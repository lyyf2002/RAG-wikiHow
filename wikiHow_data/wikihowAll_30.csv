Next, use a soft brown that matches your skin tone, and spread it along the crease of your eye. It will give your eyes some definition but not stand out too strong, letting your eyeliner shine. Then, using a black eyeliner, line the edge of your top eyelid, bringing it out into a little wingtip past the corner of your eye.








Another option is to create a smoky eye. Start with a kohl eyeliner, and use it to line your upper and lower eyelid. Then, use a sponge or brush to smudge it upward and downward onto the lid, which will create a smoky eye.
Use a light brown or taupe eye shadow on both lids, then line your waterline with a dark eyeliner., For this look, you want dramatic lashes. One option is to ramp up your own lashes. Another option is to apply fake eyelashes. Fake eyelashes can dramatically increase your volume and length, making them stand out.For dramatizing your own lashes, you may want to start by curling them or use a mascara that does the curling for you. Next, apply several coats of mascara to make them darker.To apply fake lashes, start by curling your own lashes with an eyelash curler. Use tweezers to apply the fake lashes, so you can place them right on your natural line. Also, make sure to trim them so they follow your natural line., Now's the time to apply a liquid foundation. Using a sponge, spread it out over your face. Next, add a concealer in problem areas, such as where your face is splotchy. It can help to hide red spots, too. After, set the foundation with a powder. Make sure the foundation, concealer, and powder all blend with your skin tone.

Pick a nontraditional color.,
Add a floral touch.,
Use polka dots.,
Go dark.",How to Do Valentine's Day Makeup3," Heart nails don't have to be just a cutesy heart in the middle of your nail, though they can be. It can also be layers of pink and red that just create the middle shape of the heart. If you're layering at home, be sure to let the colors dry between coats., While you may think of pinks and purples for Valentine's Day, any color can be Valentine's with a few hearts and some sparkle. Pick a pale blue with white highlights, for example. Don't be afraid to add some Xs and Os or even spell out ""love"" across your fingernails., Florals create a romantic flair, and with any number of paint-on designs these days, you have your pick. If you want to create your own, try adding little roses by swirling in red on a white background. Red roses are the perfect complement to Valentine's Day., Polka dots are just cutesy enough to work for Valentine's Day, especially since they are vintage and modern all at the same time. Just be sure to pick contrasting colors when you create polka dots. Light colors on darker colors usually work best., Another option is to go for a dark color, like purple or even black. You can tone it down a bit with some tiny pink hearts. Once those dry, consider coating the top with a sheer pink sparkle to give your nails some shine. You could also swirl in a second color."

Make sure to just use it on the roots of your hair. Turn your head upside to create a big ponytail high on your head. Also, make sure to leave a few straggles of hair out at the front to frame your face., Start with a low, loose ponytail. Separate the ponytail into two parts above the holder. Flip the ponytail down and through the separation. Tease your hair in the ponytail a little (if it's fine) to give it body. Flip the ponytail back up and over, tucking the end back into the top of the ponytail, creating a loop. Secure it with bobby pins and hairspray., Use a curling iron that creates big curls.

",How to Use Concealer," Concealers come in many forms and sizes. Each of the six types of concealers is formulated for specific skin types and coverage. It is common to use more than one kind of concealer at a time.Selecting the correct concealers for your skin type and problem areas will guarantee optimal coverage.


Stick concealers come in tubes similar to lipstick and are used to provide full to medium coverage for dark eye circles.These thick, creamy concealers are ideal for the individual with normal, dry, or sensitive skin. Stick concealers go on thick and often contain oil so the user can easily spread and blend the makeup. Therefore, avoid stick concealers if you have oily skin.Cream concealers come in a small pot, compact, or palette. This medium to full coverage concealer is ideal for the individual with normal, extremely dry, combination, or sensitive skin. Its thick texture provides wonderful coverage for individuals with extreme discoloration.If not blended and set properly, this concealer can sit very heavy on your skin.Cream-to-powder concealers come in compacts. This light to medium concealer is ideal if you have normal, semi-dry, combination, or sensitive skin. Cream-to-powder concealers are designed for use any where on the face.However, you should never use this concealer to cover a blemish or patches of dry, flaky skin. The oils and ingredients found in these products tend to make breakouts worse and emphasize dry skin.Creamy liquid concealers come in small squeezable tubes or tubes with wand applicator. This type of concealer is formulated to provide light to full, even under eye coverage. It is ideal for individuals with normal, combination, oily, or sensitive skin. It also provides excellent coverage for blemish-prone skin.Unlike stick concealers, creamy liquid concealers are less likely to crease. Their light formula allows for buildable coverage.Matte-finish liquid concealers come in small squeezable tubes or tubes with wand applicator. This type of concealer provides light to full coverage. Matte-finish liquid concealers are ideal for covering blemishes. You may also use them as the base for your eyeshadow. It does not crease or slip; it also outlasts cream and powder concealers.Color-correcting concealers are available in liquid, cream, or stick form. When flesh-toned concealers fail to provide adequate coverage, use a color correcting concealer. To mask the concealer’s hue, first apply your color-correcting concealer, followed by your foundation, and a layer of flesh-toned concealer. The five colors offer solutions for five distinct problems:

Lavender is used to conceal sallow or yellow-toned skin.
Yellow conceals deep purple tones, such as under eye circles or scars.
Green conceals redness.
Pink conceals the bluish hint that commonly accompanies lighter skin tones.
Orange or salmon conceals blue, gray, and purple blemishes.;
, Applying a concealer that is too light or too dark counteracts the product’s purpose. It will only draw attention to your problem areas. To ensure that you select the right shade, test the product in the store. Swipe or dab a small amount of concealer onto your hand. After blending in the product, examine the results. If the product is visible on your hand it is either too light or too dark. If you can not see the product, you have selected the right shade.Try to match the shade of your general coverage concealer to the shade of your foundation. This will result in a flawless, well blended look.An exception to this rule pertains to the concealer you will use under your eyes. Your under eye concealer should be 1 to 2 shades lighter than your foundation and general coverage concealer. This will highlight and lighten the dark area., When applying conceal, you will use a variety of tools, including the clean pads of your finger. Purchase a natural hair concealer brush—this is a flat, oval shaped brush.You will also need Q-tips and makeup sponges on hand., Before applying moisturizer and makeup, always thoroughly clean your face to remove dirt, oil, and makeup. Use eye makeup remover to wipe off mascara, eyeshadow, and eyeliner. Douse a cotton pad with cleansing water. Gently wipe your face with the saturated cotton pad to remove makeup., The level of coverage you require will vary from day to day. After cleansing your face, observe your skin in the mirror. Note the areas of your face you would like to conceal. Gather the tools and makeup required to conceal these problem areas.


Do you have dark circles under your eyes?
Is the area around your nose red?
Do you have a zit or a breakout?
Are there any scars or patches of discoloration visible?

, Face lotion combat dryness and the sun’s rays throughout the day. Squirt, scoop, or dab a small amount of face lotion into your hands. Warm-up the moisturizer by rubbing it between your fingers. Apply a light, even layer over your face.


If your skin is oily, use a gel based moisturizer., The area under your eyes is very delicate and prone to dryness. Eye creams provide extra protection and moisture to this area. Use the pads of your fingers to dab a small amount of eye cream under each eye. Carefully rub in the cream and allow it to dry.You can apply eye cream to your eyelid too., Concealers’ most common application is under the eyes. Instead of drawing a semicircle under the eyes, create a triangle. The triangle method, which you may apply with your fingers, a brush, a wand, or a sponge, will highlight and lift your face.Begin at the inner corner of your left eye. Draw or dab a diagonal line of concealer from the inner corner to the top center of your left cheekbone.
From the top center of your cheekbone, draw a diagonal line up to the outer corner of your left eye.
Use your tool of choice to lightly blend the concealer down and outwards.
Repeat on the right eye.Avoid pulling or rubbing on the skin under your eye., Use a cream concealer and concealer brush to mask scars and dark spots. Dip the brush into the full coverage cream concealer. Use the brush to dab the concealer directly onto the dark spot or scar. Apply one layer of highlighting concealer. Dab the area with a damp sponge to blend the makeup., Although it is not possible to cover puffy eyes, you can mask the puffiness with a concealer and highlighter. Combine a small amount of liquid concealer with a drop of highlighter. Use your fingers, a brush, or a sponge to dab the mixture onto the puffy area. Blend the makeup down and out., To conceal redness, use an oil-free cream concealer, a damp sponge, and loose powder. Use your fingers to dab the concealer onto the red areas. Blend the makeup by dabbing the area with a damp sponge that you’ve dipped in loose powder., When concealing a zit or textured blemish, use a concealer pencil. With the point of the pencil, go over and around the zit or blemish. Dab the area with a damp sponge, followed by a light coat of loose powder.


If the zit or blemish is red, use a green concealer., To conceal varicose veins, use a flesh-toned concealer pencil. After applying your foundation, trace over the varicose veins with your concealer pencil. Use your fingers to blend in the makeup. Apply a second coat of foundation to further blend the makeup. Complete process by dabbing a damp sponge dipped in loose powder over the area., You may choose to apply your foundation at various points in the process. For full coverage, apply your foundation before you put on any concealer. For less coverage, apply your concealer followed by your foundation.


Pour or squirt a quarter sized amount of liquid foundation onto the top of your non-dominant hand.
Dip a natural hair foundation brush into the foundation.
Begin applying the foundation at the center of your face and blend out, up, and down., Blending is the key to a flawless look. Dampen a makeup sponge. Run the damp sponge over your face in long sweeping motions. This will blur the lines between your foundation and your concealer, making it difficult to tell where one starts and the other begins., Setting your makeup with a loose translucent powder will combat shininess caused by oil. Dip a small natural hair powder brush into your loose translucent powder. Tap the brush on the side over the container to remove any excess powder. Gently sweep the brush between your eyebrows, down your nose, under your eyes, and around your chin.

Do detail work with a Micro Mini Beauty Blender.",How to Use a Beauty Blender," One of the biggest mistakes you can make with a Beauty Blender is using the sponge dry to apply makeup and skincare products. Before using it, make sure to dampen it under the sink so it’s thoroughly saturated. That will cause the sponge to expand, so it won’t soak up as much of your cosmetic products.You can use warm or cool water to dampen the Beauty Blender, but you may find your application more refreshing if you use cool water.
If you don’t have access to a sink when you’re using your sponge, you can wet it with bottled water or even spritz it heavily with your favorite setting spray to dampen it.;
, While you want your Beauty Blender to be damp when you use it, it shouldn’t be dripping wet. Before applying your makeup or other products, gently squeeze the sponge to remove all of the excess water.Beauty Blenders are fairly delicate, so don’t wring the sponge to get the water out. You may wind up tearing or ripping it.
When you squeeze the sponge, it helps to wrap it in a clean towel or piece of paper towel. That will help absorb the excess water.

, If you're doing a full face of makeup, you may find that your sponge starts to dry while you're applying it. To ensure that you get flawless results from the first step of your makeup routine to the last, keep a spray bottle of water, setting spray or facial mist on hand so you can lightly dampen the sponge when necessary.Beauty Blender also makes a reactivation spray to moisten the sponge if it starts to become dry while you're using it.

, To use your Beauty Blender to apply foundation, concealer, blush, highlighter, setting powder, or any face makeup, press the damp sponge into the makeup. Don’t dab it too hard, though, or you may wind up picking up too much product.For makeup products such as foundation, tinted moisturizer, BB cream, or concealer, it helps to put some on the back of your hand and dab the sponge into it there. For the best results, don’t apply the makeup directly to the Beauty Blender.
For makeup products that are in a compact, such as cream blush or highlighter, you can dab the sponge directly into the pan.
For loose powder products, such as setting powder, shake some into the lid and dab the sponge into it there.
For makeup items that you’ll be applying to large areas of the face, such as a foundation or cream blush, dab the rounded bottom of the sponge into the makeup.
For makeup that you’re concentrating in small areas, such as concealer under the eyes or highlighter along the cheekbones, dab the pointed end of the sponge into the makeup.

, When you’ve dabbed some of the makeup onto the sponge, tap the round bottom against your skin to apply the makeup. Don’t wipe the sponge across your face, but bounce it to gently stipple or press the makeup into the skin for a flawless finish.Stipple the sponge over your skin until all of the makeup is evenly blended. It may take a couple of bounces in the same area to fully blend the makeup.
You don’t have to press the sponge very hard against your skin to blend the makeup. Bounce it gently, and the sponge will do the rest of the work.

, To apply concealer or foundation under the eyes, around the nose, along the lips, or in another small areas, press the pointed edge of the Beauty Blender against the skin. You’ll want to press a little harder than you would with the rounded edge to ensure that the makeup is completely blended into the skin., Because the Beauty Blender sponge is so absorbent, it can easily grow bacteria. You want it to be clean the next time you use it, so try to get in the habit of washing it after each use to ensure that it’s always ready when you need it.Beauty Blender makes a liquid and a solid sponge designed specifically for washing your sponge.
If you’re on a budget, you can also wash your sponge with an antibacterial, fragrance-free dishwashing soap. A bar of antibacterial soap also works well for cleaning a Beauty Blender.
To wash it, moisten the sponge with warm water and work some of the soap or cleanser into it. Create a lather, and keep washing until the water from the sponge runs clear.
If there’s a stain on your sponge that doesn’t come clean from washing, soak it in a mixture of liquid soap and warm water overnight. If the makeup still doesn’t come out of the sponge, try treating it with a thin oil, such as baby oil, before washing it. The oil can help break down the makeup that’s trapped inside.
Let your Beauty Blender sit out to air dry after you wash it.

, It can be difficult to dab the Beauty Blender into certain products, such as a concealer in a tube with a wand applicator or a cream blush stick. In those cases, dot the makeup directly onto the skin in the area(s) where you want to apply it.Start by applying a small amount of the makeup, and only adding more if you need it. The sponge will blend out the product quite a bit, so a little can go a long way.

, Once the makeup is dotted onto your skin, bounce the damp sponge over the product to gently blend it into the skin. If you’re concerned about the makeup spreading too far as you blend, use the pointed end of the Beauty Blender.Because the sponge will pick up some of the product as you blend it out, be careful not to press the Beauty Blender onto other areas of the face or you may transfer the makeup.

, When you stipple makeup that’s already on the skin with the Beauty Blender, it can sometimes look a little patchy. To get a flawless, even finish, roll the side of the sponge over the area to smoothe out any streaks or patches.Rolling the side of the Beauty Blender all over your face is an ideal finishing step to your look no matter how you apply your makeup. It will ensure that your makeup is fully blended, and there are no harsh edges or streaks.
Just as when you use your Beauty Blender to apply makeup, make sure to wash your sponge after you've finished blending out your makeup so it's ready for your next use.

, While you should always dampen a Beauty Blender to apply makeup or skincare products, that’s not the case if you’re cleaning up makeup mistakes. Instead, make sure that your sponge is clean but completely dry before you start.It helps to have an extra Beauty Blender -- one that you can use wet to apply your makeup and one that you can leave dry in case you need it to clean up mistakes.

, If you’ve applied too much blush or bronzer, wipe the sponge over the areas to help tone down the color. Because the sponge is dry, it will pick up more of the makeup and give you a more natural finish., If you’ve applied too much foundation, concealer, or setting powder, you can use the dry sponge to help pick up some of the makeup. Roll the side of the Beauty Blender over areas that look cakey, and the sponge will remove the excess.You can use the same technique to smoothe out streaky foundation or lines around the edge of your face.

, The sponge is also ideal for pressing skin care products into the skin to ensure that they’re fully absorbed. For the best results, though, use the Pure Beauty Blender, which is white so it doesn’t contain any dyes that might irritate your clean skin.Make sure to wet your Pure Beauty Blender before applying your moisturizer, serum, sunscreen, or other products just as you would when applying makeup. That way, you won’t wind up wasting your skin care products because the sponge won’t absorb as much.

, It can be difficult to apply self-tanner with a smooth, streak-free using your hands or even a large mitt. The sponge makes it easy to stipple the tanner into the skin for even color all over. Use the Beauty Blender Body Blender, though, which is black and won’t be stained by the self-tanner.The black Beauty Blender is also ideal for applying dark bronzers and long-wearing foundation that might be difficult to wash out of the traditional Beauty Blender.

, While the pointed end of the sponge is small enough to get into nooks and crannies, it doesn’t always offer the precision you might need. The Micro Mini Beauty Blender is a better option because it’s ¼ the size of the original. Use it to apply concealer under the eyes, set undereye concealer with powder, or contour and highlight the face.You can also use a Micro Mini Beauty Blender to apply cream eyeshadow to your lids.

Remember to always blend your makeup well.",How to Use Color Correcting Concealers," Color-correcting concealers help to mask skin discoloration by bringing problem areas to a more neutral hue. When picking concealers, an understanding of color theory will be helpful.


Complementary colors are colors that are completely opposite each other on the color wheel. The following are the pairs of basic complementary colors you'll use for color correcting: red with green, yellow with purple, and blue with orange.
For most types of color correcting, makeup of one color will cancel out discoloration of its complement.
The exact opposite color can also sometimes overcorrect, making skin look lifeless and unnatural. In these instances, you should use a color next to the discoloration's complement.
Most color-correcting concealers come in a single shade. The exceptions are oranges and peaches. For these, pair deeper shades with darker discoloration and brighter, more pastel concealers with lighter areas.A normal skin tone concealer is usually used over color-correcting concealers.;
, Green is the color opposite red on the color wheel and is therefore the strongest color for canceling out red. Because of this, green color-correcting concealers are best for neutralizing intensely red blemishes. Most green color correctors are a pastel mint color.


Use green concealers directly on small patches of red like pimples.
Green concealers are also good for medium-sized areas of redness, such as moderate acne and irritation. For people with fair skin, a common pattern for placing green concealer is down the front of the nose, the center of the forehead, around the nostrils, and along the cheekbones.
For more diffuse areas of vivid redness that cover most of your face, like sunburn or rosacea, consider using a green-tinted makeup primer instead. A tinted primer will work the same way as a color-correcting concealer but will even out your tone for a flawless foundation application., Sometimes green concealers work too well, making the skin look dull and lifeless. By instead selecting yellow, a warm color next to green on the color wheel, you can tone down red discoloration without removing all traces completely.


Yellow concealers are a good choice for masking mild to moderate diffuse redness.Yellow concealers are also great for neutralizing and brightening dark purple and blue blemishes like fresh bruises, age spots, sun spots, and dark under eye circles on some people.
If this is your first time using a particular skin tone concealer or foundation, check to see how you look wearing them without additional color correction first. Many concealers and foundations for lighter skin tones have some degree of yellow pigment for built-in color correction., If you have darker skin, orange can be used as a catch-all color corrector for many different types of discoloration.


If you have dark skin, you can use orange to disguise anything from acne scars to hyperpigmentation around the lips.
You can also apply orange to the entire face for a radiant effect. When using orange as a whole-face product, consider using a dusting of orange powder or tinted primer instead of concealer.Orange is also the color of choice for correcting blue-toned under eye circles on medium to dark skin.
If you have darker skin that has a lot of natural variation in shade, it's best to also use two or more different oranges for color correcting. Use a deeper orange on darker areas of skin and a paler orange on the lighter spots.If you have lighter skin, you may choose to use orange concealer as a bronzer for contouring instead of color correcting. Orange is generally too bold to work as a color corrector on light skin., Concealers in this color family are a muted combination of orange, red, and yellow. Because of this, a single concealer can cancel out the blue, green, and purple often found in the dark under eye circles of people with fair to medium skin.









In general, salmon works best on pale skin, while peach works best on olive and tan skin.
You may need to experiment a little to find the exact tone that works best with your skin.
Peach can also work very well on pale skin when correcting brown patches like age spots.These shades are also good as an all-over balancing brightener for olive skin. When used in this way, either brush some onto your highlight areas or use a pink-tinted primer on your whole face., Purple is the complement of yellow, so purple concealers neutralize warm yellow tones. The vast majority of purple concealers are a pastel lavender color.









You can use lavender to cover up old bruises and age spots.
Like orange and yellow, lavender can also be used across the entire face. When using color corrector in this way, consider a tinted primer as an alternative.
If your natural, healthy skin tone is on the yellow side, don't feel the need to ""correct"" it. Skin that is merely warm-toned looks radiant on its own., While orange discoloration is uncommon, the best way to neutralize it is with its complement, which is blue. A majority of blue concealers are a pastel robin's egg color and tend to work best on fair to medium skin.









These concealers are best for balancing out warm tones that are dark and intense, such as sunspots.
These concealers are also a good choice if you've gone a little overboard with the self-tanner. By bringing these patches to a more neutral tone, they will look less obvious and more natural.
If the discoloration is across your entire face, try using a blue-tinted primer instead of a concealer., Start with clean skin and add a little moisturizer of your choice if needed. Next, apply a makeup primer evenly across your entire face. Primer will even out any imperfections on your skin to give you a smooth canvas to work with. Primer also helps makeup to adhere better to skin, making it last longer.








When using an all-over color corrector, such as green for ruddy skin or lavender for sallow skin, consider using a tinted makeup primer. If this is the only color correction you would like to do, skip the color-correcting concealer.If you're using foundation, apply it after your primer and before your color-correcting concealer.Some people apply foundation after color-correcting concealers. However, foundation has its own concealing and color-correcting properties. Starting with foundation will help to prevent overcorrection.

, If you don't have a concealer brush, any other fine makeup brush will also work. Dip or swipe your brush over the concealer to load.


Like other types of concealers, color correcting-concealers come as creams, liquids, and powders.
If you're using a powder concealer, tap your brush over the container to remove excess product.
Some liquid concealers come in tubes with their own applicators. You can use those directly on your skin instead of loading a brush.
If you're using a crayon or stick concealer, you can either swipe your brush against the concealer or apply it directly to your face.

, Be careful not to overdo it. For localized areas of discoloration, be especially careful not to apply the concealer too far outside the blemish's perimeter. While green will neutralize redness, it can make already neutral-toned skin look sickly. Brush on only a minimal amount of concealer. Too much product in general will also lead to caking and creasing., Even out the concealer by blending it out. Use small, circular buffing motions to spread the product.









If you used a brush for application, use the same one for this step. You can also use clean finger tips to blend instead.
If you're correcting a small blemish, be sure to keep the concealer focused on this spot and don't blend it out too far.
If you're using a color corrector on your entire face, blend it out completely as you would with foundation.

, Remember that color-correcting concealers are meant to neutralize just the tone of a blemish. You will need to brush on a normal concealer to actually hide the mark. Use a concealer with a sheer formula to prevent the area from looking too thick or caked on.









Be sure to blend the second concealer before moving on., Move on to the rest of your makeup. Color-correcting concealers can be used with any style of makeup, from minimalist natural looks to dramatic ones. Dust on a layer of setting powder at the very end to help your makeup last all day.








, Like regular concealers, color-correcting concealers come in a variety of different consistencies. While which you use will likely come down to personal preference, some types will work better on skin that is dry, oily, or a combination of the two.


Liquid concealers are the best choice for dry skin. Liquid concealers feel lighter on the skin but may not cover darker blemishes adequately. Despite this, liquid concealers work very well around the eyes. Primers are always liquid.
Powder concealers are best for oily skin. Liquid concealers often turn blotchy on oily skin.
People with combination skin may choose to use two or more types of concealer on different parts of the face. For example, powder at the oily T-zone with liquid for dry cheeks.
Solid or cream concealers offer the best coverage and are a good choice when correcting dark or vivid discoloration., If you have multiple skin issues you would like to address, there is no reason to just stick to one color corrector. Most people who use color correctors go with at least two at a time.


For example, if your skin is sallow but you also have purple under eye circles and a few pimples, you would use at least three different color correctors. A potential makeup scheme would be to start off with a lavender primer before applying your foundation. After that, brush peach concealer under your eyes and spot treat your pimples with a green concealer.

, A common cause of a subpar, unnatural look when using makeup is improper blending. Foundation, concealer, bronzer, blush, and eye shadow all need to be blended. In fact, many makeup artists consider blending to be the most important step when applying makeup.









One major reason to use color-correcting concealers is to avoid having to go overboard with opaque foundation and concealers. If you find that your makeup still looks caked on, use less product. Rely on thin, well-blended layers instead of thick ones.If you have difficulty blending your color corrector in completely, try putting it on under your foundation instead. This may be necessary when covering a large area with an unnatural-looking color like green."

Figure out your skin's undertone.,
Look at your wardrobe and accessories.,
Match the shade of foundation to your undertone.,
Take into consideration your hair color.",How to Pick the Right Foundation Makeup2," Undertone is not the same as skin color or tone; your skin tone can change, but your undertone does not. Undertones can be cool, warm, or neutral. In addition to pigment or color, foundations have a cool, warm, or neutral tone as well. In order for your makeup to blend seamlessly with your coloring, it needs to work with your specific undertone.If you have a rosy or pinkish complexion, or a yellow or golden tint, your undertone is warm.
Blue or purple tints, as well as olive or greenish hues, mean you have a cool undertone.
If you don't see a definite tint in one direction or the other, then you probably have a neutral undertone.
Check the veins in your wrist or ankle for clues about your undertone. Veins that look purplish bluish indicate a cool undertone. Veins with a faint green coloring suggest a warm undertone.

, You probably already make choices in clothing or jewelry that suit your undertone, so think about the colors that look best on you in order to figure out whether you have a warm, cool, or neutral undertone.


If you typically favor silver toned jewelry, your undertone is likely warm.
Gold tone jewelry works best with cool undertones, so if you gravitate towards gold, you probably have a cool undertone.
If you can wear either gold or silver toned jewelry, you have a neutral undertone.
Do you look your best in warm colors like red, yellow, or orange? Then your undertone is probably cool.
Warm undertones look best in cool colors like blue, green and purple.

, Foundations mainly come in three ranges of shades: fair, medium, and dark. For each range of shades there is also a range of undertones: cool, warm, and neutral. You want to find the right shade with the right undertone. For instance, very light blondes with pale skin that burns easily often look best with a fair shade of foundation that has a yellow or golden undertone., Your foundation should look natural and complement your look overall. If you have recently changed your hair color, or if your hair has greyed significantly, you need to recalibrate your foundation to suit your new look.


For lighter hair color, a foundation with some warmth can keep you from looking too pale or washed out.
A lighter, cooler foundation often contrasts well with darker hair.
Redheads should typically avoid foundations with too many pink or rosy tones."

Makeup counters at most department stores will let you try out different foundations, so a trip to a cosmetics counter is worth your time and effort if you want to avoid making a mistake about the best shade for your skin.


A department store will have multiple lines of cosmetics, making it easier for you to select the right foundation for your skin type and your makeup needs.
Typically the people working at makeup counters are very knowledgeable about a variety of cosmetic lines, and they can help you narrow down your best options.
Even if you don’t want to pay department store prices, you can find a good match for your skin there and then find a less expensive brand that is a close or even identical match.

, Some types of foundation need special application tools or techniques for optimal coverage and wear, or may take more time and maintenance than you would like. A makeup artist can give you advice and tips about the best foundation for your needs.Tell the makeup artist about any skin allergies or sensitivities.
Bring a few magazine ads or pictures with you to show them the kind of look you want to achieve.
Ask the makeup artist about any special brushes or applicators that you need to use with a foundation.
Ask for any tips or tricks about applying foundation.
Discuss your morning and evening routine and how much time you typically spend applying and removing makeup.
Find out what makeup remover or cleansing products work best for specific foundations types.

, If you only have time for a quick shopping trip, you can sample foundations from different cosmetic counters yourself. There are different options, and different opinions, about where you should try out foundation shades. While the most obvious choice is your cheek or jawline, if you are wearing makeup already you may need to test the foundation somewhere else on your body.


If you have avoided over-exposure to sun, your chest is a good option for selecting the best shade of foundation.The jawline is probably one of the most common areas for testing foundation colors. This is a particularly good way to make sure that your foundation matches with the skin on your neck.The skin on your arm or hands is not a good place for testing foundation colors. The skin on your face is very different in texture than that on your arm or hand, and probably very different in color as well.

, Apply a couple of colors to the jawline of your left check and a couple more to the right side of your cheek. Looking at several shades at one time will help you compare the look and feel of different products., The fluorescent lights in most department stores can alter how foundation colors look on your skin. Once you have found a color that seems to match your skin, apply a larger amount to your face. Step outside with a mirror and check your reflection in natural light to make sure it still looks right for you., Bring a friend to help you choose which foundation suits you best. You can always ask for feedback from the makeup professionals manning the counters of course, but sometimes the best advice comes from someone who knows you really well.

Have a clear idea of the look you want.,
Keep in mind your environment as well as your plans.,
Don't wear the same foundation color year round.,
Mix colors for a perfect match.,
Dilute a heavy foundation with moisturizer.,
Pick a foundation made for your age.",How to Pick the Right Foundation Makeup4," Foundation can make or break a look, so you want to choose a one that will work for your style and your needs. You can use foundation to get anything from a nearly naked skin look to a flawlessly smooth matte finish.For a luminous glow, choose a lightweight water based liquid foundation. Apply sparingly to skin. Finish the look with a pressed powder that has a little sparkle. You can also skip the powder and instead try spritzing your finished face with mineral water for an extra glow.
A dewy face looks healthy and fresh. Make sure you choose a foundation that has a moisturizer in it and is oil based rather than water based.
You can get a matte finish from several different forms of foundation: a matte liquid, a mousse, or a matte powder. You want to make sure your skin is oil free before and during applying the foundation, so start with a very clean face and try using a primer base. Use a brush or sponge to apply the makeup so that you don't get oil from your fingers on your face.

, For instance, if your plans include physical exertion or humid conditions, a foundation that is water-resistant or sweat-resistant but still breathable would be appropriate. If you're attending a formal event, a foundation that has staying power but has shine control will help you look your best in photographs.If you're heading for the gym or the tennis court, a sweat-proof foundation that isn’t too heavy and won’t clog pores, with an SPF of at least 20, is a good choice.If you are selecting a foundation for work or school, avoid going too cool in tone. The fluorescent lighting in most buildings can make you look pale, so adding a little warmth can compensate.For proms, formal events, or weddings, choose a foundation that won't fade and will keep your skin looking picture perfect. A semi-matte to matte foundation is a great option because these foundations are usually long-lasting and cut down on shine.If you are typically in and out all day, or in natural light most of the time, look for a sheer foundation that won't make you look too ""made-up.” Water based liquid foundations or a tinted moisturizer are good choices for you.

, You should change your foundation several times a year in order to match your coloring and adjust your look to the season. For example, if you tan during the summer, you should adjust your foundation to fit your new skin tone., Your skin is unique and you may not find one shade that works. Try mixing colors or tones to create the perfect shade for you., If you find a great match but don't like how it feels on your skin, you can probably make it feel lighter just by adding a few drops of moisturizer. Experiment with the ratio of moisturizer to foundation until you get a good balance of texture and coverage.

, Your skin’s texture and complexion changes as you get older, as do the skin problems you may want to address. Different formulations and types of foundation can make you look your best as well as take care of your skin as it ages.For teens and early twenties, oily skin and breakouts can be an issue. Choose a water based foundation or a light mineral powder foundation. Use clean brushes or makeup sponges, and wash your hands before applying the foundation.Your skin may begin to show signs of aging in your thirties and forties, so choose a foundation that will nourish your skin and keep it looking and feeling youthful as well. A cream foundation with an oil based moisturizer is a good choice, such as L'Oreal or Maybelline cream foundations.As skin ages, look for a foundation that not only hides the signs of aging, but can help repair and revitalize your skin too. L'Oreal makes foundations with silicone to soften the appearance of fine lines, while Estee Lauder's foundations have anti-aging properties that may help slow down or prevent new lines from forming.Foundation for older skin should be lightweight and moisturizing. Stay away from powders that can cake in skin creases and make you look older.

Understand the benefits of skin oils.,
See a dermatologist.",How to Reduce Oil from Your Face Naturally5," Your skin has a large number of glands and ducts, also known as pores, which also contain hair follicles. These get clogged every day with semi-solid or dried oils in your skin. The skin in your face secrete oily substances that is attacked by skin bacteria, causing the resulting oils on your face.


The resulting oils are made of up those secretions, natural skin fats, sweat, and environmental materials such as dust, dead skin, and bacteria. the oil that ends up on the surface of your skin is a complex mixture of sebum, fats (lipids), sweat and environmental material (dust, dead skin cells, bacteria).
The skin in your face changes based on age, hormones, gender, and other environmental factors. If you don’t clean your skin, the pores and glands get clogged.
The clogged pores cause blemishes, uneven skin tones, and other face issues., Despite the issues that skin oils can cause, there are also some benefits that result from skin oils. These oils also function to:


Reduce water loss in your skin
Protect your skin from infection from bacteria and fungiSecrete body odors that function as a pheromone, helping to attract a mate or to affect behaviorGive a viable environment for the bacteria Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes), which may play a role in the regulation of the skin’s immune system, Some face oil is natural for everyone.

Wash your face twice a day with a gentle face cleanser.,
Apply toner to tighten your pores and remove oil.,
Use blotting paper and carry medicated pads for quick and easy oil reduction.,
Use a deep cleaning facial mask as needed to remove excess oil.,
Use oil-free moisturizers and oil-free sunscreen.,
If your oily skin is causing acne, treat it with over-the-counter acne medication.",How to Prevent Oily Skin1," This will remove the excess oil that's clogging your pores. Dermatologists agree that using a basic face cleanser every morning and night is the best way to prevent oily skin.Choose a gentle face soap that cleans your face without drying out your skin. Don't use a moisturizing soap that adds oils or moisturizers to your face.
Use warm water when washing your face. Hot water may dry out or irritate your face.
Dry your face thoroughly with a soft towel after washing.
Stay away from harsh soaps or facial cleansers designed to dry out skin. The purpose of washing the face is to physically remove oil and dead skin cells from your face and pores. If you choose a soap designed to dry oily skin, choose the mildest one you can find and only use it when needed.
If a basic cleanser doesn't work, try a product that has acid like benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid. These products are usually for acne, but they help to fight oily skin too.;
, There are many kinds of toner. Use either an astringent or freshener to fight oily skin. Check the ingredients: astringents have alcohol while fresheners usually have ingredients like caffeine or green tea. Generally stay away from skin tonics and skin bracers because they are only for normal or dry skin.









Apply the toner on the ""t-zone"" of your forehead and nose. Those are the oiliest spots on your face. Apply the toner very lightly or not at all to your cheeks, where it can easily cause over drying.
Use cotton balls to apply to toner. Brush the cotton balls lightly over your face.
After the toner dries, wash it off with a face towel and use an oil-free moisturizer to prevent over drying.

, Blotting paper is great because it doesn't dry out skin and it only takes 15 to 20 seconds. Medicated pads usually have salicylic acid or glycolic acid and are easy to use on the go. Since they're acid-based they're a great treatment for acne too.









Apply blotting paper to your oiliest areas such as nose and forehead. Make sure you don't scrub it. You just have to press it on the oily area for a few seconds so it can absorb the oil.
Some blotting paper includes powder, which fights oily skin even more.
Carry medicated pads in your purse or bag. These pads are typically acid-based so they fight acne too.
Be careful not to use medicated pads as needed, but don't use more than three a day as they can over dry your skin.

, Facial masks give you a deeper cleanse than an ordinary face wash. They go deeper to remove impurities and draw out the oil in your pores. However, there is a greater risk for over drying with facial masks. Use them sparingly.


Only use a mask after using your regular face cleanser.
Your skin and hands should be damp when you apply the mask. Try doing the mask in the bathtub for maximum relaxation and minimal cleanup.
Keep the mask on for 10 to 15 minutes. Use water and a washcloth to gently remove the mask.
Your best bet for absorbing oil without over drying is a mask containing purifying ingredients like clay as well as soothing ingredients like shea butter or honey. You can also use a mask made of sandal and turmeric for removing oil and acne from your face.
Use a mask once a week or before important events like a wedding or a big date. If you use it too much you risk over drying.

, Read the ingredients carefully on any products you use. Choose only water-based, noncomedogenic cosmetics.


Some people with oily skin don't use moisturizers or sunscreen because they think it will add to their problem. If you use the right products, however, they can be enormously beneficial to your skin. Oily skin still needs to be moisturized and protected from ultraviolet radiation.
Get in the habit of checking the ingredients of every product you use on your face. Make sure none of them are oil-based.
Sunscreen gels or facial powders can protect your skin without adding oil or clogging your pores.
Avoid oil-based cosmetics, and wash all makeup off before going to bed. Makeup settles into pores and will clog them if it's not completely removed. Never apply additional makeup without first removing the old makeup.
Don't use cold creams or lotions for makeup removal if you have oily skin. These products are designed to moisturize dry skin and may leave a greasy film on the skin, contributing to clogged pores, oil buildup, and acne.

, Use products with benzoyl peroxide to kill the bacteria that builds up on the skin and causes acne. It also cuts back on dead skin cells which clog your pores.


Acne creams that contain resorcinol, sulfur or salicylic acids also help to unclog pores. These products are designed for use after acne blemishes appear on the skin and to help sores heal.
Follow all manufacturer usages instructions when using over-the-counter acne products.
Make sure you wash your face with soap in the shower too. Just don't wash your nose as that can cause more clogging.
There are many different acne products. If the first one doesn't work, try another.
If over-the-counter medications don't work, see your dermatologist for more treatment.

Mix the two juices together well. Using a cotton ball, apply the mixture to your face. Leave on for 15 minutes, then rinse off with warm water and pat dry.


This mask may sting even more than just the tomato juice, especially if you have sensitive skin, because of the added acidity in the lemon. Be careful if you have sensitive skin or reactions to citrus juice.You can also add some oatmeal for a little texture and added nutrients to your mask.Lemon juice has nutrients and vitamins that will help brighten, moisturize, exfoliate, and lighten your skin as well as help with acne., Take a medium ripe tomato and cut it in half.

If the mixture is too runny, add a little more yogurt.The probiotics and natural bacteria in the yogurt help fight the organisms that cause acne and reduce the prevalence of them on your skin., Take a tomato and cut the top third off, near the stem. Set the larger part aside but keep the smaller part nearby. Pour out two tablespoons of iodized salt onto a plate or napkin. Take the small piece of tomato and rub it around a little in your hand to get the juices moving. Dip the wet edge of the tomato into the salt mixture. Over a sink, rub the tomato around you face for a few minutes, using the salt to exfoliate your face. Leave the mixture on your face for 10 to 15 minutes. Rinse off with warm water.


Do not rub too hard. You don't want to irritate your skin.
Plum tomatoes work best for this scrub because the tomatoes are hardier and won't fall apart as easy as you rub the tomato across your face., Take a small, ripe tomato and cut it into easily crushable pieces. Place them in a bowl and, using a fork or masher, crush the tomatoes. Keep crushing until they make a pulpy mixture with a few clumps. Apply the pulpy mixture to your face. Leave it on for 10 to 15 minutes, then rinse off with warm water. Pat dry with a towel.


You can also use a mortar and pestle, if you have one, to crush tomatoes. Don't blend, unless you just pulse it a few times. You want there to still be some chunks of the tomato left."

Make sure to always shower after exercise to wash away the sweat and bacteria. If you let it build up, it can lead to more skin problems.
Physical stress on the body may also trigger higher levels of androgens causing the same chain reaction on oil production. People with a genetic predisposition to oily skin may have increased symptoms during menstruation or when suffering from allergies, colds and other conditions. Be prepared for this and counteract it with stress-reducing activities.

, There is a strong link between mental health and skin health. Stress is a frequent cause of acne and oily skin. Work on keeping a positive mindset by cutting out stress in you life, and your skin will thank you!


The connection between stress and acne has been noticed by people for many years. Research has found that the body produces higher levels of androgens and cortisol during times of high stress. In turn, this stimulates the sebaceous glands causing them to increase oil production.

Doctors recommend eight to ten glasses of water a day.
Inadequate water can cause wrinkles, dull skin, and more prominent pores. Likewise, dehydration and acne breakouts are frequently linked together.
Dehydration triggers changes in the oil glands in your skin, causing oil to build up on your skin. Staying hydrated keeps the oil on your skin at healthier levels.
Drinking lemon water is great too. It keeps you hydrated and it's rich in antioxidants and vitamin C. Lemon water is also effective for curing acne. Drink it in the morning on an empty stomach for healthy skin!

Learn what causes you stress.",How to Keep Skin Clear and Non Greasy," You can wash three times a day, but don't overdo it—unless you've just come from the gym, two times a day of thorough face-washing (morning and night) is all you truly need.Don't use hot water, since the heat will dry out essential moisture you need for your skin and can lead to unnecessary burning and cracking. Avoid very cold water. Cold water is great for refreshing the face, but run it too cold and it shrinks pores and prevents you from clearing out the dirt effectively.
Make sure to use a gentle facial soap or cleanser when you wash. While using water will clear out obvious dirt and loose particles, soap and similar products will provide a more thorough clean. Be careful, though, to choose a mild soap, and to avoid hard scrubbing—the abrasiveness will ultimately damage your skin more than it will help.
While it seems logical to scrub hard when your face feels dirty, the hard scrubbing action can remove the natural, protective film your face produces, which in turn can change the pH balance of your skin and will affect the growth of the microorganisms on your skin. Remember that your skin is an organ, so treat it carefully.;
, Depending on your needs, old fashioned water and soap might need assistance from an additional product. Whatever you put on your face, though, make sure you do your homework on it and don't overdo it—you should not be applying products to your face more frequently than you wash your face.

, This time of day will be the most important for your face care regimen. While it's okay to wash your face when you get up in the morning, you will see greater benefits (and probably feel less gross) if you wash up before you go to bed.


If you have some, put on a night mask that you wash off in the morning. If you don't put on a night mask put toner on a cotton pad and spread over face, continue with putting on moisturizer while face is still wet from toner.

, Steaming is simply a matter of holding your face for a number of minutes over a container (a pot, sink, tub, etc.) of water hot enough to produce steam. Some people like to place a towel over the back and top of their head as they steam. This will open your pores and allow your natural sweat to drain away impurities.


While it is often great for people with greasy skin, steaming alone won't solve an acne problem—which is a more complicated issue.

, But greasy skin and pimples aren't caused by having moisture on your skin—they're actually your body's response to a lack of moisture. So get ready to add another step to your facial care routine.

, You can look for products that are designed for your predominant skin type or that target the specific issue or problem area that you are dealing with. If you have oily skin, you'll want to look for lotions rather than creams (which tend to have more fatty oils in them).

, If you live in a place of extreme temperature, whether it's very hot or very cold, or if you are in the middle of a tough weather season, then look for products that will help you compensate for those additional, external factors.

, It would be even more frustrating to find a great-looking moisturizer only to have it give you a rash. Dab some on your forearm and try that every day for at least a week or two, if you can wait that long. If you have no reactions to it after a period of time, then the product is likely safe for your face.

, A moisturizer will help keep your skin supple and smooth, but it won't clear away grit in your pores on its own.

, It's recommended to drink 8 glasses daily. Drinking water helps your body flush out toxins that can cause pimples and blackheads on the surface of your skin. The only way to “feed” your skin is through your stomach (remember that the skin is an organ), so stay hydrated and your skin will, too., Our bodies are designed to move. If you stay active, you'll definitely see an improvement in your skin.

, It's important to eat healthy by eating lots of fruit and veggies. Some people have found they could manage their skin breakouts and greasy-feeling issues but making changes in their diets. Cutting back on processed foods, caffeine, processed sugars, and excessive salts has been helpful for many—experiment with avoiding certain problem foods to learn how your body & skin react to those changes.

, If you have to go out or work extensively outside, always cover your skin or wear a sunscreen.Big hats, with at least a 2-inch brim, are best for blocking the harmful rays of the sun. You want a hat that will throw some shade on your face. Explore the varieties of head coverings that exist today—you may find something stylish outside of your own regional fashions.

, There are many different kinds available, so use a heavier one if you are planning intense physical activity in the sun.


If you towel off after swimming, you're removing the protection you had applied, so you will need to reapply sunscreen.
Remember, however, that you'll need to clean the sunscreen off of your skin at night, so using one adds a step to your daily routine.

, Many skin problems, particularly acne, have been shown through scientific study to be linked to stress. Remember that your skin is an organ! So just like your heart, lungs, and other bodily organs, your skin will respond to stress and life problems. Be gentle with it and help it by developing peaceful routines and strategies you can use to relax., Your skin problems can clear away--stay optimistic and try to reduce your stress by focusing on the good things in your life, at school, during the work, and particularly during your first waking moments and before you go to sleep.

, Just as scrubbing the skin too harshly, or using too-harsh products on your skin, will cause your skin to react negatively, so will exposing yourself repeatedly to sources of stress. Think about what things are causing you stress and work to reduce those sources or limit your time with them.

Mineral oils provide temporary moisturization and they clog the skin's pores. In this way they leave them suffocating for fresh air. The skin cells are unable to get rid of the toxins and this leads to acne eruptions, allergies, irritation, rashes and photo sensitivity.
Explore the fragrance compounds used. Often, these are made up of synthetic chemicals and they cause depression, anxiety, hyperactivity, hormonal disruptions and interfere in the normal functioning of the central nervous system.
Avoid parabens. Parabens are cheap preservatives used to improve their shelf life of skincare products, but they are thought to be linked to some types of breast cancer and other health concerns.;
, Different moisturizers can help certain skins. Rinse your face gently and rinse your face thoroughly of products. If you don't rinse well, the pores will stay open, that way more dirt and oil comes through the pores. Wash your face with cool water and pat dry.

Avoid the sun.,
Exercise.,
Eat healthy.",How to Maintain Oily Skin2," The sun’s heat as well as its invisible ultra violet rays, cause more damage to our skin than any other element of nature. Most people spend the summers in skimpy swimsuits that barely cover their bodies.


Sunscreens and sunblocks help to minimize sun damage, but staying in the shade and wearing white cotton clothes helps avoid most of the sun’s rays. Wrinkles are created when the skin becomes dry and loses its elasticity.

, Sweat is a combination of dirt, impurities, and other excretions that the body needs to get rid of. By sweating, our body regulates its temperature, hormones, bacterial toxins, and emotions. Most of us who do aerobic exercises know that the longer we stay on our treadmills or jogging schedules, the happier we feel, and the fewer acne-causing toxins will be in our bodies.


Exercise stimulates endorphins or happy hormones (called the runner’s high). Meditation and Yoga are tremendously helpful to keep our emotional and physical systems running smoothly so that our body and mind are in top condition.

, What you eat affects your overall health. Nothing ages your skin more than your diet.

Apply an oil-free, mineral powder makeup base for the daytime.",How to Cure Oily Skin1," Most dermatologists agree that cleansing the skin is the best way to reduce oil.Make sure to use a gentle, pH balanced cleanser rather than regular soap. Most soaps are highly alkaline and strip the natural acid mantle from the skin leaving it vulnerable to bacteria.


Products containing benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, glycolic acid, or beta-hydroxy acid are often considered best. These are slightly acidic, however, so start off with only a small amount to make sure your skin doesn't have an adverse reaction.
When washing your face, make sure you use warm water, not hot. Hot water can further irritate the skin.;
, Place a few drops on a clean, natural cotton pad and wipe it gently over the affected area.

Before putting on any lip products, exfoliate your lips to remove any dry, flaky skin. Use a scrub designed specifically for the lips or brush them lightly with a clean, sanitized toothbrush to remove dead skin.You can make your own lip scrub by combining 2 teaspoons (10 g) of brown or white sugar with 1 teaspoon (15 ml) of an oil, such as coconut or olive.;
, When your lips are exfoliated, you want to hydrate them to lock in the moisture. That will leave them looking plump when you apply your lip color. Use a moisturizing lip balm or treatment, and allow it to sit for a couple of minutes so it sinks into your lips.You can use any type of lip balm or moisturizer that you like, but it’s a good idea to choose a formula that lists a mint, such as peppermint or spearmint, as an active ingredient. Mint helps boost blood flow, so it can help make your lips look fuller.

, Patting concealer over your lips can help ensure that your lipstick or gloss goes on true to color. You can also make your lips look fuller if you blend the concealer just a little bit beyond your lip line to blur the edge. That will help it look more natural when you line outside your lips with a liner before you apply your lipstick.Use a concealer that matches your skin tone exactly so you can blur your lip line more easily.

, Many cosmetic companies make temporary lip plumping products that use ingredients that temporarily swell the lips to make them look fuller. If you really want full lips, apply a clear lip plumper product to your lips before lining or applying lipstick.Lip plumping products often cause a stinging sensation that some people find uncomfortable. It’s a good idea to test the product on a small area of your lip before applying it all over, especially if you have sensitive skin.
You can find colored lip plumping products, such as glosses and lipsticks. If you use one of those, you can apply it just as you would a regular gloss or lipstick.

, Your lip liner is a powerful tool in creating the illusion of fuller lips. Instead of lining right at the edge of your lips, use the liner to define just beyond your natural lip line for added fullness.For the fullest looking lips, use a lip liner in a shade that’s just a bit darker than your lipstick. That will help add major definition to your lips.
Don’t fill in your lips with the liner. You want to keep the definition sharp along the outer edge.

, Because dark colors make things look smaller and light colors make items appear larger, avoid dark lipstick when you want your lips to look fuller. Instead, opt for a nude or other light colored lipstick, such as pink or peach.For extra fullness, consider blending two lipsticks that are a similar color but a shade or two apart. Apply the darker shade on the outer parts of your lips and the lighter color in the center, blending the edges with a lip brush for a seamless transition.

, To make your lips even fuller, top your lipstick with a gloss. The shiny finish of the gloss will reflect light and help your lips appear larger. Apply a clear lipgloss or a sheer shade that’s similar to your lipstick color.Using a gloss with a shimmery finish can add even more dimension to your lips to help them look fuller.

, To bring focus to your lips and make them appear larger, it helps to use concealer to outline them. Use a very small concealer brush to carefully apply your favorite concealer around the edge of your lipliner. Make sure to carefully blend the concealer into your skin so it looks natural.This technique can also help clean up any mistakes you may have made when applying your lipliner or lipstick.

, Don’t just use your highlighter to accent your cheekbones -- dab a small amount of your favorite powder or cream highlighter on the small indentation above the center of your top lip known as the cupid’s bow. That will bring light to the area and help your lips appear fuller. Blend well so the highlight looks natural.Make sure that you apply the highlighter all the way along the groove that runs from your cupid’s bow to the bottom of your nose.

, You can give the illusion of a fuller bottom lip by using contour powder. Use a small, fluffy brush to lightly dust contour powder or bronzer just beneath the edge of your lower lip. Make sure to blend well for a natural look."

Fill a cup with isopropyl alcohol.,
Dip your lipstick in the alcohol.,
Wipe off the lipstick and let it air dry.",How to Clean Lipstick1," To clean and sanitize your lipstick, you’ll need a bottle of isopropyl alcohol, which you can find at any drugstore. Pour enough into a plastic cup so you’ll be able to easily submerge the lipstick into it.Isopropyl alcohol comes in different percentages. For cleaning your lipstick, 70% is usually the best option. It’s strong enough to kill the bacteria and germs that might be present on the lipstick, but won’t evaporate as quickly as higher concentrations.;
, Take the tube of lipstick that you want to clean, and turn it all the way up the entire bullet is exposed. Submerge the lipstick in the cup of alcohol, and hold it there for 15 to 30 seconds.Be careful when you’re holding the lipstick in the alcohol so you don’t bang it against the side of the cup and damage the bullet.

, After you’ve let the lipstick soak in the alcohol, remove it from the cup. Use a tissue to wipe off the top layer of lipstick from the bullet, and leave the lipstick uncovered so it can finish air drying the rest of the way.To avoid dripping alcohol all over your table or counter, tap the lipstick container gently against the side of the cup when you pull it out to knock off any alcohol droplets before they fall.

Gently press the tissue against your lips until you’re no longer getting a lot of color off.Make sure not to rub the tissue over your lips, or you may wind up smearing the lipstick around your mouth.

, When you’ve removed the top layer lipstick with the tissue, spread a thick layer of petroleum jelly over your lips like a mask. Allow it to sit on your lips for 1 to 3 minutes, leaving it on the longest for dark, matte lipstick shades.If you don’t have any petroleum jelly on hand, you can also use coconut oil or baby oil. However, apply just a thin coat to your lips or you may wind up with lipstick-colored oil running down your chin.

, When you’ve let the petroleum jelly sit on your lips for a couple of minutes, take a cotton pad and dampen it with warm water from the sink. Wipe the pad over your lips with firm pressure to remove the remaining lipstick.Don’t use cotton balls to wipe your lips. They’re usually too fuzzy and can wind up sticking to your lips.
Be careful when you’re wiping the cotton pad over your mouth to make sure that you don’t rub it beyond your lip line -- you can wind up smearing lipstick on your face that way. It helps to “wrap” the pad around your index finger to keep it confined to the lip area.

, If you just want to clean your lips of lipstick so you can put on a new shade, you’re ready to go. If you’re removing the lipstick at the end of the night, follow up by washing your face with your favorite cleanser. That will remove any lingering lipstick or smudges around your mouth."

, Lip balm stays on your lips for long periods of time and you will not have a fresh palette to contour. In addition, don't use any lip balms with medication or beeswax in them, for those can harm your lips and even become addictive (they don't heal your lips, only relieve them, so it's a continuous cycle).

Massage a lip scrub over your lips to gently exfoliate before applying any lip products. You can also use a clean washcloth or toothbrush to gently scrub your lips.You can mix up a DIY lip balm by combining 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of organic coconut oil, 2 tablespoons (26 g) of brown sugar, and 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of organic honey.;
, Once your lips are smooth, you want to keep them that way by applying a hydrating lip balm. Smooth it over your lips, and allow it to sit for 5 to 10 minutes so it has time to sink in.Choose a waxy lip balm rather than an oily formula. Oily balms can cause your lip color to slip right off.

, After you’ve allowed the lip balm to sit for several minutes, there may still be some excess product that doesn’t sink into your lips. That residue can make it difficult for your lip color to last all day, so use a tissue to gently blot away the excess.It’s a good idea to blot your lips several times to ensure that you don’t leave any lip balm residue on the lips that might interfere with your lipliner and lipstick application.

, To create a base for your lip color to stick to, it helps to apply some concealer to your lips first. Your lipliner and lipstick will adhere to the concealer so the bold color lasts longer. Apply a thin layer of concealer to your lips with your finger or a sponge.Don’t apply too much concealer -- you don’t want to erase your lips completely.
For the best lasting power for your bold lip color, use a waterproof concealer.
You can substitute foundation for the concealer if you prefer.

, Bold lip colors have a tendency to bleed beyond your natural lip line. To keep your color in place all day, reverse line your lips by using concealer to line the outside of your lips. That creates a barrier that prevents your lipstick from feathering and bleeding beyond your lips.Reverse lining is easier if you use a pencil or stick concealer. You can also use a cream concealer or even foundation on a small concealer brush.
Make sure to blend the concealer into the skin lightly with your finger to ensure that it looks natural.

, As another way to keep your bold lip color from bleeding and make it last all day, it helps to layer a lip liner beneath your lipstick. Follow your natural lip line with the liner, and then use it to fill in your lips as well.You don’t necessarily have to match your lipliner exactly to your lipstick. Instead, use a nude liner that’s as close to your natural lip color as possible. Keep in mind, though, that using a liner in a shade that matches your lipstick usually results in a more intense color on your lips.

, For the longest wearing lip color, you should use a matte lipstick. The drier texture keeps the color from fading as easily as glossy shades do. To get the boldest color from your lipstick, though, apply it directly from the tube to your lips.If you’re worried about not getting your bold lip color on precisely enough, you can apply it with a lip brush. You can also do a combination of applying from the tube and with a brush. For example, apply the color from the tube to the center of the lips and use a brush to apply it the edge where you want more precision.
When it comes to choosing a bold lip color, there are a wide variety of options to consider. For example, a dark lipstick shade, such as a deep burgundy or wine, can look bold on fair skin. If you have darker skin, you may prefer going bold with a bright shade, such as a hot pink or cherry red. You can also go bold by choosing an unexpected lipstick color, such as black, blue, or green.

, After you’ve applied a first layer of lipstick, lightly press a tissue to your lips to blot the color. That will remove any excess product or oils to help ensure that the color lasts longer.Instead of a tissue, you may prefer to use a blotting paper that’s usually used to remove oil from the face to blot your lips. These papers are designed to lift off the oil from your skin without disturbing your makeup, so they can remove any emollient residue from your lips without removing the pigment.

, After you’ve blotted your lips, take another tissue and separate the layers so you have just a single sheet. Hold it over your lips, and use a fluffy powder brush to lightly dust your mouth with a thin layer of translucent powder.You can apply the powder directly to your lips, but that may leave you with cakey-looking lips. Applying it through the tissue helps set your lipstick without leaving a layer of powder behind.

, Once you’ve set your lipstick with the powder, apply another layer of your bold lip color. Keep the coat light, though, so you don’t have to worry about your lipstick smearing."

, Or open up a vitamin E capsule and rub the contents on your lips. Plant-based oils—like olive, coconut, sunflower, and jojoba—work, too.

, For temporary bee-stung lips, use an over-the-counter lip plumper, which contains irritants that swell lips. There are also over-the-counter topical treatments that may slightly enlarge lips over time because they contain peptides or hyaluronic acid.


To make your own plumping product, rub a small amount of cayenne pepper on your lips. It’s the main active ingredient in many commercial plumpers.

Try some darker powder subtly under your lower lip to create the illusion of a gentle shadow from a bulge., If you’re interested in a longer-lasting plumping solution, collagen or hyaluronic acid injections or a lip implant may be an option.

The glossy sheen will help to disguise the dry appearance of your lips and hydrate them at the same time.Skip the matte color when you have chapped lips; it will accentuate every flaw and flake.
Even though glossy lipsticks are hydrating, you should still apply a moisturizing lip balm to your lips before adding lipstick on top.;
, Matte formulas are very drying. Even if your lips are in good shape before you apply it, the formula tends to suck all the moisture right up. To combat this, start off with freshly scrubbed and well-moisturized lips. Use a lip scrub or extra toothbrush with soft bristles to gently exfoliate your lips. Finish up with a long lasting lip balm.To protect your lips, you may want to rub on a little Vaseline before scrubbing with the toothbrush. Be sure to rinse it off, though – otherwise, it will leave a film behind.
It’s a good idea to exfoliate and moisturize before you apply any kind of lip product, but when it comes to matte formulas, it’s essential.

, Matte lipsticks are highly pigmented and draw attention straight to your mouth. If your lips are on the thin side, you may not want to accentuate that with a matte color. Glossy formulas, on the other hand, highlight lip curves and create a more three-dimensional effect. Your lips will appear plumper and healthier with a glossy sheen., If you love your lip shape and want to highlight that feature, matte formulas are perfect for you. They are highly pigmented with zero shimmer, drawing eyes straight to your lips. Start off with a lip liner to provide a little extra dimension, since matte finishes can make lips look less plump and slightly flat., Matte formulas are notoriously difficult to apply. The intense pigmentation requires a skilled hand – one small mistake outside your lip line can be difficult to remove from your skin. Glossy formulas, in contrast, are a breeze to apply. They glide on smoothly and don’t require the precision that matte formulas demand.If you’re a lipstick pro but short on time, skip the matte and opt for a gloss.

Glosses need to be reapplied a lot more often than matte formulas, but since they are so easy to apply, you hardly even need to use a mirror. Glide a glossy lip color on when heading to class or to the office.

, Because of their intensity, matte formulas work well for evening looks. A chic dress, heels and a highly pigmented matte lip perfectly complement one another. Apply a matte formula before hitting the town with friends or a date. Matte finishes are long-wearing, so you won’t have to spend a lot of time in the bathroom touching up during the night.


Concentrate on a precise application the first time around and a matte lip can require very little effort to maintain., Glossy lipsticks work with all casual looks. If you’re heading to a low-key event or having lunch with friends, a matte formula might overwhelm your casual outfit. If you love the intense color of matte lipsticks, look for a highly pigmented gloss. The bright color looks polished, and the glossy finish keeps the hue from being overpowering.


If you aren’t wearing a lot of makeup to begin with, a gloss can take your look up a notch with very little effort., If you work long hours or have very little time to reapply your makeup during the day, a matte lip is a great solution for you. Most formulas last from 6 to 8 hours after application.Carry along a moisturizing lip balm that you can easily reapply over the lipstick, since matte formulas are very drying.

Test it on your hand.,
Match the color to the outer edge of your lips.,
Stay in the same shade range as your natural lip color.,
Try a hint of pink for fair skin.,
Go a bit darker if you have light olive skin.,
Try a golden beige for medium skin.,
Pick darker than you think for dark skin.,
Blend colors for the perfect nude.,
Exfoliate before applying the lipstick.,
Add a moisturizer.,
Consider a coverup.,
Create a sheen with gloss.",How to Choose the Right Nude Lipstick," Testing out a nude before you take it home is essential, but you don't want to apply it to your lips (too many germs!). A good place to try it out is the back of your hand, where you can see how it looks against your skin before you purchase it.You can also try it on your inner wrist, which may match the color of your face and lips more closely.;
, Often, the outer edges of your lips will be slightly darker than the rest of your lips, particularly if you have a darker skin tone. When looking at the color, make sure you match the outer edge of your lips. Otherwise, it can leave your lips looking washed out., When picking out a color, think about your natural lip color. Try to pick something that is similar. You want it to work with your lip color rather than against it, as it will be more difficult to achieve a nude effect with a lipstick that works against your natural color.That is, if you have naturally rosy lips, try to pick a nude with a hint of rose.

, If you have fair skin, you may be tempted to pick a tan nude. However, that can really wash out your face. Instead, pick a nude that has a hint of pink. It should still be very soft, but it will help keep you from looking too pale., If you're not totally fair but still light-skinned, you can go a bit darker. If you pick something too soft, your lips won't have any definition. Pick a light pink or beige with enough definition to distinguish your lips from the rest of your face., If your skin is in the medium range, try a more golden hue. Make sure that the color you choose is slightly darker than your skin tone, so you have definition. In addition, try not to pick something to heavy, texture-wise.If you want slightly more color, you can go with a peach undertone. Salmon can also be an appropriate color.

, Often, if you try to pick a ""nude"" for darker skin, you'll choose something that's too light. Make sure that the color you choose matches your skin tone or is a bit darker.For a bit of shimmer, go for a bronze or gold undertone., If you can't find what you like, you can blend colors instead. For instance, for a dark nude, try coloring in your lips with a brown pencil, then adding a brown lipstick with a hint of rose on top. Make sure to blend them together well.To create a completely nude shade, make sure you are matching the color to the outer edges of your lips.

, Nude lipsticks tend to show every nook and cranny on your lips, which is a problem if you have dry lips. Therefore, it's important to take care of dry lips before you apply a nude lipstick. For instance, you could try using a lip scrub to smooth out your lips first, giving you a more polished look., Moisturizing can also help smooth out your lips before applying a nude lipstick. After using a lip scrub, apply a moisturizing lip balm. That way, you have a nice, soft base to apply the lipstick over., If you're trying to truly wipe our your lip color, you may need to add a bit of concealer to your lips before applying the lipstick. The concealer will help block out your natural lip color, helping you achieve the nude look., Nude lipsticks can be a bit flat, so adding a bit of gloss can help them shine a bit. However, you don't need too much. Just apply a bit to the middle of your lips for a tiny bit of pop."

Talk to a salesperson at a make up store.,
Do a test run of the lipstick.,
Buy several long-lasting lipsticks to try.",How to Choose Long‐Lasting Lipstick2," If you are more of a hands on person, you may opt to going into a make up or beauty store and trying the lipsticks out for yourself. Ask a salesperson to help you find a high quality long-lasting lipstick. Discuss what shade or color you are looking for as well as how much staying power you want the lipstick to have with the salesperson.For example, you may say to the salesperson, “I’m looking for a long-lasting lipstick in coral for a wedding I am going to. Do you have any suggestions?”

, Depending on the policy of the make up store, you may be able to try the lipstick on your lips so you can determine if it is right for you.

Check the return policy at the make up store before you buy several lipsticks to ensure you can return them if they do not work out. If you cannot return the lipsticks, you may opt for buying only one or two so you do not spend too much money on products you will not use.

Moisturize your lips before you apply the lipstick.,
Use lip primer.,
Try a lip pencil.",How to Choose Long‐Lasting Lipstick3," Many long-lasting lipsticks can be drying on your lips due to the ingredients in them. To ensure your lips stay smooth and supple, moisturize them before you apply the lipstick. You may apply a lip balm on your lips about an hour before you plan to apply the lipstick. This will give the lip balm time to dry and moisturize your lips so they are prepped for the lipstick.You should always apply lipstick on bare lips. Before you apply the lip balm, you may use a non-alcoholic make up remover on your lips to get rid of any lingering color or pigment on your lips. You should also remove any food or liquids that may be on your lips before you apply the lipstick.

, Lip primer can be a good way to ensure your lipstick stays on as long as possible, even if it is a long-lasting formula. Lip primer can be worn under lipstick, lip gloss, or even a lip pencil. It can help to keep your lipstick from feathering out or from coming off.You can buy lip primer online or at your local beauty supply store.

, Using a lip pencil on your lips before you apply the lipstick can help the color to adhere to your lips better and appear more vibrant. Go for a lip pencil that is a slightly lighter shade than the lipstick you are using. Rather than line your lips with the pencil, you should color in your lips with the pencil, starting at the center of your lower lip. Then, apply the lipstick on top of the lip pencil.Using this method, your lipstick should stay on your lips for a prolonged period of time. The lip pencil will help to ensure the color stays put, especially if the lipstick is also a long-lasting formula.

Determine whether you have cool or warm skin.,
Pair warm reds with warm skin.,
Choose cool reds for cool skin.,
Match the depth of the red shade to the depth of your skin tone.,
Select a matte lipstick for a richly pigmented red.,
Pick a cream lipstick for a hydrating, comfortable red.,
Choose a sheer lipstick for a subtle, moisturizing red.,
Use a liquid lipstick for a red that lasts all day.,
Pick a gloss for a shiny, hydrating red.,
Exfoliate your lips.,
Smooth on a lip balm.,
Line and fill in your lips.,
Apply the red lip color and blot.,
Add a second layer if necessary.",How to Choose a Red Lip Color," To choose the right red lip color, you need to figure out what your skin tone is. Turn your arm over so you can look at the inside of your wrist, and examine your veins. If they’re greenish in color, you have warm skin. If they’re bluish in color, you have cool skin. If they’re a mix of green and blue, you likely have neutral skin.Another way to determine whether your skin tone leans warm or cold is to consider what type of jewelry is most flattering against your skin. If you look better in gold, you likely have warm skin. If you look better in silver, you likely have cool skin. If both look good against your skin, you likely have neutral undertones.
If you have neutral skin, you’re lucky -- virtually any red shade will look good with your skin tone, so you can have fun trying a variety of shades.;
, If you have warm undertones in your skin, you should choose a red lip color with similar warm tones. That means choosing reds that have orange, coral, copper, gold, or brown undertones in them.Warm red lip color shade names typically include words such as orange, golden, sunset, coral, or fiery.
If your teeth aren’t extremely white, you should avoid reds with orange tones in them. They have a tendency to make to bring out the yellow tones in teeth.

, If you have cool undertones in your skin, you should choose a red lip color with similiar cool undertones. That means choosing reds that have blue, pink, or plum undertones.Cool red lip color shade names typically include words such as cherry, raspberry, burgundy, wine, rose, or crimson.
A red lip color with blue undertones is an especially good option if your teeth are slightly yellow. The blue undertones help your teeth appear whiter.

, In addition to the undertones in the red lip color, it’s also important to match the depth of the shade with the depth of your skin color. If you create too much of a contrast, the red shade will look harsh. If you use a red that isn’t deep enough for your skin tone, it may not show up enough.If you have fair skin, stay away from extremely dark shades of red, which will create too much of a contrast with your complexion. A light or bright red lip color will be more flattering.
If you have medium skin, you can get away with most shades of red, ranging from light and bright to deep and rich.
If you have dark skin, avoid sheer or light reds that may not show up enough against your skin tone. Bright or deep, rich red shades are a better option.

, Matte lipstick has a fairly flat finish without any shine or shimmer. As result, it is very pigmented and tends to last longer on the lips than other lipstick formulas.Matte red lipstick doesn't provide much moisture so you should avoid it if you have dry, chapped lips.
You can apply matte lipstick directly from the bullet or use a lip brush to get more precision. A matte red lipstick also works well if you want to create a stained effect and apply the color with your finger.

, A cream lipstick is fairly pigmented and hydrating so it feels good on the lips. Because of the extra moisture, the red color won't last as long so you'll need to reapply periodically.A cream red lipstick is a good option if you have dry lips because it can help hydrate your lips.

, A sheer lipstick has very little pigment, so it's an ideal option if you're just getting used to wearing a red lip. The formula is also highly moisturizing so it can help hide dry, chapped lips.A sheer lipstick doesn't last very long on the lips at all, so you’ll need to reapply fairly often.

, If you want your red lip color to last as long as possible, it’s best to choose a liquid lipstick. They usually dry down on the lips to a matte finish, which typically stays in place for many hours.A liquid lipstick is likely going to be extremely drying. That means it will emphasize all of the lines in your lips, as well as any flaky, chapped areas. If you have dry lips, you should try another type of red lip color.

, A red lip gloss delivers color, shine, and hydration. While some glosses are highly pigmented, most are fairly sheer so they’re another good option if you’re new to red lip color. Keep in mind that lip gloss wears off the most quickly of any lip product, so you’ll need to reapply it regularly.Lip glosses are usually highly moisturizing, so a red gloss is a good option if you have dry lips.

, Because a red lip color will draw attention to your lips, it’s important to make sure that they’re smooth and flake-free. Rub a small amount of lip scrub on your lips in a circular motion to gently exfoliate them. Wipe your lips off with a damp wash cloth to remove the scrub when you’re finished.While you can purchase lip scrubs at the drugstore and beauty supply store, you can also make one from items in your kitchen. Mix 1 part olive oil with 1 part sugar, and apply it to your lips just as you would a commercial scrub.
You can also use a clean, damp toothbrush to exfoliate your lips. Just rub the brush lightly over your lips to remove any flakes.

, Once your lips are exfoliated, it’s important to lock in the moisture. Apply a hydrating lip balm to your lips, and give it at least 5 minutes to soak in before applying your other lip products.To make sure that there isn’t any excess balm on your lips that might make the red lip color slide off, blot your lips with a tissue after you’ve given the balm time to be absorbed.

, To keep the red lip color from bleeding outside your lip line, it’s important to use a lip liner. The liner also serves as a base for the lip color to stick to so it lasts longer. Trace around the edge of your lips with the liner, and then fill in the inside of your lips.For the richest red color, use a lip liner that matches the red lip color you’re using as closely as possible.
If you want to keep the look of the red lip color soft, line your lips with a nude liner that’s similar to your natural lip color.

, After you’ve lined and filled in your lips, it’s time to apply the red lip color. The best method of application will depend on the type of lip product that you’re using, but take your time so you can smooth the color on as precisely as possible. After you’ve applied the color, use a tissue to blot away any excess.If you’re using a traditional red lipstick, apply it directly from the tube for the most pigmented red color. You can also use a lip brush to apply the lipstick to edges of your lips for more precision. If you want to create a stained effect, rub your finger on the lipstick and then tap the color onto your lips.
If you’re using a red liquid lipstick, it likely comes in a tube with a doe-foot applicator. The tip is usually slightly rounded so you can easily apply the color along the edge of your lips precisely.
If you’re using a red lip gloss, it usually comes in a tube with a doe-foot or brush applicator. You can get a precise line along the edge of your lips with the applicator.

, After you’ve blotted your lips, some of the pigment may be removed. If you want the red lip color to look a more intense, apply a second layer of the product. Lightly blot your lips again, and you’re ready to go.If you’re using a liquid lipstick, make sure that the lip color is completely dry before you add a second coat.

If choosing a flavored lip gloss, aim for one that you like.,
Keep your budget in mind.,
Work out which container will fit best with your lifestyle.,
Choose a lip gloss suited to the occasion for which you'll be wearing it.,
Be aware that some lip gloss or its ingredients may not be suitable for you.",How to Choose a Lip Gloss," Lip gloss has three main functions, namely: To add luster (shine) to lips, to add moisture to lips and, in some cases, to add just a touch of color. Lip gloss can be used instead of lipstick or over lipstick.


Some lip gloss contains flavor as well. For some people, this is the reason for wearing it.;
, Pharmacies, drugstores, department stores, beauty stores, local marts, etc. all carry lip gloss lines. You can also buy lip gloss online, but it's best to know what you like first, and just buy top ups of that brand when you're sure it's the right one for you., Do you want it to just add shine? Or, would you like one with color? Perhaps flavor is your preferred reason for using the lip gloss. In some cases, you may wish to combine the reasons. By knowing what you expect the lip gloss to achieve for you, you're all set to start choosing.

, This can add a touch of color to your lips, as well as adding shine. Colored lip gloss comes in either full color or sheer; the sheer gives a ""hint"" of color, while full color will recolor the lips temporarily. Colored lip gloss is best if the color is slightly darker than the natural color of your lips, as well as accounting for your skin complexion.


If you use a lot of bright colored eyeshadow, it is recommended that you do not wear a colored lip gloss, as this can provide too much color. Pick which feature you want to dominate, and stick with that.
Decide whether you want glitter in the lip gloss. If you lick your lips often though, the glitter can get stuck in your teeth.

, This will help to ensure that you don't buy a color that isn't well matched to your complexion.

, Some of the more commonly used flavors for lip gloss include: Grape, cherry, strawberry, peppermint, and spearmint. In some cases, the suggested flavor may not be what you expected, so don't spend too much on flavored lip glosses.

, Prices will vary depending on the brand and the type of lip gloss on offer. Don't be afraid to try cheaper versions though; there isn't much to a lip gloss, so a lot of the cheaper lip glosses are just as good as the more expensive ones.

, Lip gloss comes in various forms, including a tube with a brush, a glass container with a roll on feature, a rub-on hard stick, a small pot, or a squeeze tube. It's personal preference as to which way you prefer to apply the lip gloss, although since you're new to it, it might pay to experiment with each type before deciding on which one works best for you.


The brush version may feel lighter and in need of less rubbing pressure than the roll-on version.
Finger applied gloss requires absolutely clean fingers. This might not be as useful if you're not near a bathroom during reapplication time.

, Think about where are you will be wearing it, as this can impact the type of lip gloss you need. For example:


For school: Choose clear lip gloss, especially if there are rules about not wearing makeup. This might also apply in certain workplaces, if makeup is not permitted.
For dates or events: Choose colored lip gloss (especially for evenings), or a fun lip gloss with glitter in it.
If you're going to be outdoors a lot, consider using a lip gloss that contains SPF 15 or above in it. Also choose one that is long lasting.

, Take note of the ingredients before purchasing. Some things to consider include:


There is a risk of allergies: Some ingredients may cause allergies if you're susceptible, such as beeswax, colors (dyes), flavorings or preservatives.
The ingredients are unacceptable: If you don't like certain ingredients, such as parabens (suspected carcinogens), or non-vegetarian/vegan ingredients, then you'll need to avoid lip gloss containing such ingredients.
The gloss is uncomfortable: Heavy gloss doesn't work for everyone. If you choose a heavier gloss and find it is unpleasant, try a lighter one instead. Equally, if the glitter lip gloss feels like sandpaper, choose a different one.
The gloss doesn't last: If you are using lip gloss to add color, it won't last as long as lipstick. Either reapply frequently, or change to a lipstick and only use lip gloss for added shine.

Ask for samples or a return policy.",How to Buy Lipstick," Check the shadow on the paper and reflection that it makes on your skin. If it is blue, red or purple, you have a cool skin tone. If it is beige, yellow, or dull, you have a warm skin tone.


Keywords for people with warm skin tones are: Beige, brown, golden, honey, bronze, mocha, taupe, spice, peach, coral, orange, brownish red, warm red, tawny, copper, and apricot.
For cool skin tones, keywords are: Pink, rose, fuchsia, violet, lavender, grape, cherry, wine, mauve, berry, plum, burgundy, lilac, and cranberry.;
, Sometimes lipstick stores have tester tubes that you can use.


Ask a sales representative. Sometimes stores only have swatches. You can hold these up to your skin as well.

, If you trend toward a certain color scheme, make sure you are wearing your favorite color when you test out lipstick colors. Bright colors may clash, and all-neutral colors can make you look washed out.

, Different lipsticks suit different hydration needs.If you have very dry lips, you will need to avoid many shimmery and long-wear lipsticks, as these will dry out your lips even faster.

, Cream lipsticks are intended for everyday wear. They often come in nude tones, and are used to make neutral looks look finished.


If you choose a nude shade, make sure it is a little bit darker than your skin tone., Glossy lipsticks add shine to your lips, which gives them volume. Unlike matte or cream lipsticks, glossy lipsticks hide all the lines and wrinkles on your lips with light, giving your lips a full, round feel.


Glossy lipsticks are not casual. They may also dry out your lips, so do not use them if you have naturally dry lips. , These are very popular right now, and they are often long-lasting. Be careful using matte lipsticks if you have dry lips.


Matte lipsticks accentuate every line and wrinkle on your lips, because they have no shine to gloss over details. If you use matte lipstick, make sure to hydrate your lips beforehand.

, These are very shimmery lipsticks that were popular in the 1980s and 1990s. They were often chosen a few shades lighter than the wearer’s skin tone. Some looks from the ‘90s like jelly shoes and crop tops have returned, and some celebrities are now wearing frosted lipstick.


Frosted lipstick is not for casual wear.

, A high quality lipstick should be somewhere between rigid and oily. It should be stiff but not crumbly, slick but not greasy.


If the feeling of a lipstick makes you uncomfortable don’t buy it. It might be a high quality product, but you will not use something that is not enjoyable to apply.

, Packaging isn’t just about creating the world of the makeup brand. It also plays a key role in how long you will be able to keep your lipstick after buying it. If the cap is very easy to move, it is likely that the bullet of your lipstick will get broken, or leak into your bag.


If the packaging is light and cheap with a metallic finish, it will likely begin to flake after a week of bouncing around in your bag. This can be an indication that the brand is not worth buying.

, If you're still not sure you like the color and texture, big makeup and department stores will have samples for you to take home. If at a drugstore, ask about their return policy. Most will let you return it if you don't like it.


Never be afraid to ask. If you don’t ask, you may miss an opportunity.

Some experts recommend against exfoliating your lips, as this can cause small tears in the skin of your lips, making them dry and chapped in the long term.
Having healthy, well moisturized lips is better than exfoliating your lips, but if your lips are flakey, exfoliating is a quick way to make them smooth.;
, Before applying anything else to your lips, apply a light moisturizing balm. Make sure the balm isn’t too waxy — you want it to sink into your lips, not sit on top of them.


If your lips are dry, chapped, or cracked, it will be difficult to apply a smooth line to them, particularly if you intend to fill them in completely with liner.

, Some experts recommend waiting 20 minutes to apply anything else to your lips after putting on a moisturizer.


If you don’t have that kind of time, wait at least a couple of minutes, and then dab your lips with tissue to remove any excess moisturizer.
You want your lips to dry but well moisturized before you apply anything else to them.

, A primer isn’t 100% necessary, but some makeup artists do recommend it, as it can help smooth your lips and hold both the liner and lipstick on your lips longer.


If you intend to wear lipstick, you can apply a lip liner to your entire lips, and this will also help hold the lipstick in place.
Concealer or foundation can be used in place of primer. These are good options if you’re planning to change the shape of your lips.

, Choose your lip liner color based on what you intend to do with it. If you’re planning to wear red lipstick, go for a red liner; if you’re planning to keep your lips looking natural, go for a nude or soft pink liner.

, Always sharpen your liner before using it. A sharp liner will give you a good, precise line. When your liner is dull, it’s closer to the wood of the pencil, and if any pieces are sticking up from the wood they might scratch your lips.


Some people suggest that sharpening your liner before each use removes bacteria from it.
A trick to make sharpening easier is to place your lip pencil in the freezer 20 minutes before sharpening it. This is supposed to help prevent the tip from breaking off, and should produce a cleaner, sharper point., Before using your lip liner, warm up the tip by drawing on the back of your hand.This way it will go on to your lips more smoothly.


Another way to warm up your lip liner is to rub the tip between your thumb and index finger.

, Parting your lips slightly will help you stick to their natural shape as you line them., Many artists recommend sticking to your natural lip line, as overdrawn lips can look unnatural.A common thing to do is to start at the center-top and center-bottom of your lips and then work outward.


Another common lining method is to start at the center, drawing an “x” at your cupid’s bow, and then outline the corners and bottom of your mouth before lining the rest of your lips.Unless you're filling your lips in with lipstick, this isn’t a good option.
As you trace your natural lip line, be extra careful to ensure that you’ve applied liner to any creases or cracks in your lips; this will help prevent your lipstick from bleeding.

,


If the liner tugs at your lips at all, it’s too hard. Try warming the tip up by rolling it between your thumb and index finger, or drawing on the back of your hand; you can also see if sharpening it helps., What you do after lining your lips depends on whether you plan to keep your lips looking natural, or to wear lipstick.


If want a natural look, you’ll blend the liner into your lips and follow it up with gloss.
If you want to wear lipstick, you’ll fill in your lips with liner before applying the lipstick.

, If you’re not wearing lipstick and simply want to use liner to define your lips, use a nude liner and then a brush to gently buff the line out into the center of your lips. You would then finish the look off with a clear gloss.Even if you’re not wearing lipstick, a little bit of lip liner lightly applied to your natural lip line can do wonders for helping to define your lips.
If you’re going for a natural lip, your lips should now be done!

, Using swift, short strokes, fill in your entire lips with liner. This will give you a good base that will help your lipstick stay put longer. It will also help keep the lip color even, meaning the lipstick won't change color where it overlaps with the liner.


Some people fill their lips in with liner and just wear the liner itself. If you do this, consider using a gloss or similarly colored lip balm over top of the liner to help it look smooth and even.

, Starting at the center of your lips and working outwards, apply your lipstick to your lips. For a lighter and/or more precise application, use a lip brush to apply your lipstick.


Even if you want your lipstick to go on thick, you can use a brush — it’ll just take a couple of layers to get the same thickness as using the lipstick.

, Once your lips are lined and filled, the last think you'll want to do is clean up and even out your line.


You can clean up the line with a bit of moisturizer or makeup remover on the edge of a cotton swab or kleenex.
If you need to refine the line, simply draw over the necessary areas with your lip liner, then use your lip brush to blend where needed., This is particularly helpful if you’re wearing a dramatic color that has left small stains around the edges of your lips; it also helps prevent your lip color from bleeding out to the skin around your lips.


Use a small brush or a foundation brush to paint a small amount of concealer or foundation around your lips, as needed.
You can also set the foundation/concealer with a small amount of powder.

, It’s really common to apply one layer of lipstick, blot it and then apply another layer. To blot your lips, open them, stick some tissue or blotting paper between them, and then close them gently in an “mmm” position.


If you’re going to use tissue paper, make sure it’s a thick, good-quality tissue that won’t leave any bits of fluff on your lips.

, Makeup artists often set lipstick by laying a thin layer of tissue over the lips and then dabbing a translucent powder over the tissue so that a small amount of powder gets on to the lips and helps hold the lipstick in place., Choose a nude liner and nude lipstick for a natural look, or a more dramatic liner and matching lipstick if you’re feeling more adventurous.


Note that darker colors and mattes can make lips look smaller., This will help blur your natural lip line. It will also help your liner and lipstick stay put.

, To make your lips look slightly larger, line just outside your natural lip line. To keep it looking natural, only go a very small step beyond your natural lip line., If you want your lips to look significantly larger, you’re better off using a two-toned method, with a liner that’s slightly darker than your lipstick.


In 2014 Kylie Jenner sported newly plumped lips with a ‘90s-inspired lining style of having a darker liner and a lighter lipstick. Experts say it’s important to use a darker liner and then lipstick that’s only slightly lighter (e.g., a burgundy liner and a cranberry lipstick) for this look., Regardless of what size you go, make sure that you return to your natural lip line as you near the corners of your mouth. If you don’t, you’ll end up with clown lips., As you do this, be sure to leave space between the lipstick and the lip liner, as you’ll be pulling the lipstick up into the liner and blending the two in the next step.Go thick with this application, as you’ll need to be able to drag it up and blend it into your lip line.

, Use a lip brush to pull the lipstick up to your lip liner, and blend the two., Do this gently back and forth until you’ve smoothed out any remaining hard lines. You want your lips to look smoothly graded, with just slightly darker edges leading into a lighter, plump center.

, If you’d like you can dab a tiny amount of gloss or shimmery powder in the center of your bottom lip, which will help make it look a bit more plump.

, Choose a nude liner and nude lipstick for a natural look, or a more dramatic liner and matching lipstick if you’re feeling more adventurous.


Note that darker colors and mattes can help make lips look smaller., This will help blur your natural lip line. It will also help your liner and lipstick stay put.

, Using short and swift strokes, line just inside of your natural lip line. Use a nude lip liner for nude-looking lips, or a darker shade for a more dramatic effect. Darker colors can help make lips look smaller.

, Once you’re done lining and filling in your lips, remove any stray lines with a kleenex or cotton swab, then use a concealer brush and some foundation to clean up around the lip liner and further hide your natural lip line.

, Good-quality lip liners are available at drug stores and makeup shops: you just need to know what to look for. Always try before you buy. A good liner should easily draw a smooth, richly colored line on your hand.


Avoid liners that go on translucent, chalky, and/or crumbly.
If it’s at all difficult to draw a line on the back of your hand with a liner, avoid it.

, Some makeup aficionados have a matching lip liner for every color of lipstick they own. If you only buy one color of lip liner, however, make it a nude or natural one.


A solid beginner’s set of lip liners would include one nude, one red, and one pink., Unless you’re using a liner stick that twists up (these usually come in plastic casings), you’ll be using something similar to a pencil crayon. You’ll need a pencil sharpener to keep your liner in good shape.


There isn’t a lot of advice available as to how to purchase a good-quality sharpener; it’s best to ask friends or do an online search for highly reviewed sharpeners within your price range.
Sharpeners can cost anywhere from $2 to over $40, but it’s certainly possible to get a good-quality one for under $10.

, Especially when you’re new to lining your lips, you may need to clean up the lines. It’s a lot easier to do if you have a cotton swab or tissue paper handy.


For particularly stubborn marks, put a little bit of moisturizer or makeup remover on some tissue paper or the tip of a cotton swap, and gently rub at the mark until it disappears.
It can help to dab a tiny amount of moisturizer on the mark then use the dry side of the cotton swab to rub the mark away.

, Moisturizing your lips before applying a liner can help prevent them from drying out, which can make your liner look dry and crumbly when it sinks into the cracks that form in your lips when they’re dry.


A good lip balm will sink into your lips and make them feel moisturized. Avoid anything too goopy, which will make it difficult to apply anything else to your lips.

, Some makeup artists suggest applying a lip primer to your lips before doing anything else, as this can help lengthen the life of your liner and lipstick once they’re on your lips.


If you don’t have a primer, you can also use concealer or foundation to prime your lips.

Let the Lip Tar dry.,
Apply powder to make the Lip Tar last.,
Use a small amount of product for touch ups.,
Remove the Lip Tar with an oil-based cleanser.",How to Apply Lip Tar," Before you apply the Lip Tar, moisturize your lips so they are smooth and soft. Doing this will help the Lip Tar stay on your lips for a long period of time. You can moisturize your lips by applying clear lip balm. You can also apply a natural moisturizer like coconut oil to your lips.If your lips are very dry and you have dead skin on your lips, you may want to exfoliate them before you apply a moisturizer. This will make applying the Lip Tar much easier. You can exfoliate your lips by gently rubbing them with a damp clean washcloth. Or you can use a sugar scrub to exfoliate your lips.;
, To help prime your lips for the Lip Tar, apply a dab of your favorite concealer on your top and bottom lip. Blend the concealer in to create a neutral primer for your lips. Another option is to use lip liner on your lips as a primer. Apply lip liner in a similar shade to the Lip Tar shade you are going to use or use a nude colored lip liner.You can also use foundation on your lips as a primer if you do not have concealer or a lip liner pencil.

, For a more professional approach, invest in a lip primer. Apply the lip primer to your lips before you put on the Lip Tar. Put the lip primer on using a small lip brush or a clean finger, starting in the center of your lips and moving outward.You can find lip primer online or in cosmetic stores.
The company that produces Lip Tar, Obsessive Compulsive Cosmetics, also sells a lip primer made specifically for application before using Lip Tar.

, The lip brush should have a very small head and short bristles. Lip Tar is a thick product so it may stain the lip brush. Use a dark colored lip brush and use it for Lip Tar only so the product does not mix with your other makeup.In a pinch, you can use a clean finger to apply Lip Tar. However, using a lip brush will result in a more accurate and smooth application.

, Squeeze a small dot on the brush. One dot of the product should be enough to cover your top and bottom lip. Do not use too much product right off the bat as this can lead to feathering and bleeding of the color on your lips., Put the Lip Tar on your bottom lip, starting at the center of your lip. Blend the product outward to your lip line. Gentle brush the product on, making sure you get the product along your lip line., Once you are done with your bottom lip, apply the remainder of the product on the brush to your top lip. Start at the center of your top lip and move outward to your lip line.

, Press your lips together and let the Lip Tar set on your lips. This will take up to 30 minutes. Do any touch ups to your lips with the lip brush as needed and let them dry.The Lip Tar should stay on your lips for several hours at a time, with minimal touch ups.

, If you find the Lip Tar is not staying on your lips or you want the product to last longer, use powder to help it set. Using a clean finger or brush, apply a light dusting of setting powder over the Lip Tar. Then, use a Q-tip dipped in lotion to remove any powder around your lips or mouth.Try not to get the setting powder all over your face when you apply it. You just want to apply it to your lips to help set the Lip Tar.

, Lip Tar is designed to last for a long time on your lips, even when you eat or drink. If you notice the lip color is starting to rub off or fade, apply a very small amount with a brush on your lips for touch ups. Start with a dab of the product and apply it in small amounts. You do not need a lot of Lip Tar for touch ups and a little will go a long way.Try not to put too much product on your lips during touch ups. This can cause the product to feather or bleed.

, At the end of the day, remove the Lip Tar using an oil-based cleanser. The oil in the cleanser will help to remove the lip color, as it is made with hemp oil. You can use an oil-based makeup remover or a natural oil-based cleanser like coconut oil. Gently apply the oil-based cleanser to your lips with clean fingers.Do not rub or scrub your lips hard with the cleanser. The product should come off easily once you apply the oil-based cleanser.

Wear clear lip gloss over gold-flecked rosy brown lipstick.,
Layer a shimmery gold lip gloss over a rosy-hued lipstick.,
Apply rose gold lip gloss over rose brown lipstick.",How to Add Rose Gold to Your Lips1," Choose a pinkish brown lipstick shade that has golden flecks in the formula.You may have to look closely to see the golden flecks, but often the shade name is a good indicator – look for terms like “sunset” and “ginger.” Then layer a basic clear lip gloss on top. This will provide high shine without venturing too far into the metallic side of things.








This is the easiest and most subtle approach. If you’re new to rose gold makeup and want to test the waters, this is a good place to start.;
, Gold lip gloss does, in fact, exist! It’s also surprisingly versatile. The most important thing to look for in a gold lip gloss is a lack of opacity. When you apply the gloss, it should appear to be mostly clear, with gold mica particles visible throughout the formula. The underlying rosy lipstick shade will shine through and the gloss simply provides a golden sheen.








If you want to take it up a notch, look for a more opaque formula. Your rosy lipstick will still be visible beneath it, but there will be a definite metallic edge added that isn’t completely sheer.
It’s not easy to find, but gold lipstick is out there, too. You can layer it with a rose lipstick to get a dramatic effect. Since gold lipstick will be opaque, you’ll need to experiment with layering to get the effect you want.

, When you’re ready to foray into something more metallic, invest in a rose gold lip gloss. This will provide a subtle rose gold sheen to any lipstick you pair it with.The result is luminous but not overly metallic. You can control the overall impact of the look through the shade of lipstick you wear underneath.









For example, a dark rose lipstick under the gloss will appear more substantial, whereas a lighter pink hue will look more shimmery.
You can also control how metallic the look is by limiting (or adding) additional layers of the rose gold lip gloss on top.

Mix rose gold eye shadow with petroleum jelly.,
Add a little gold eye shadow on top of nude or pink lip gloss.,
Line your lips with a gold eyeliner pencil.",How to Add Rose Gold to Your Lips2," If you can’t find or create the rose gold lipstick or lip gloss shade you want with lip products, eye makeup may be the answer. Rose gold eye makeup palettes are very popular right now, and the range of available shades is wide. Mix a bit of the loose eye shadow powder with petroleum jelly, then paint the mixture on with a lipstick brush.








You can create a dramatic shade or something more shimmery and light by adding more or less petroleum jelly.
The petroleum jelly will provide high shine to this metallic look.

, Apply your favorite pink or nude colored lip gloss, then dip a small makeup brush into a warm shimmery eyeshadow and paint it on top. The slickness of the gloss will help you evenly spread the eyeshadow powder on your lips. This look emphasizes gold tones rather than pink tones, although you can control how gilded you get with it.








For a more subtle result, choose a shimmery warm nude eyeshadow. Look for color names like “champagne” and “warm glow.”
For more of an impact, layer glittery gold eyeshadow over a pink gloss.

, There are tons of metallic makeup products on the market right now – you can experiment with almost all of them on your lips, even if they aren’t created for that purpose. Try lining your lips with a gold metallic eye liner pencil, then adding a rosy lip gloss over it. Run your finger along your lip line to blend the gold pencil down into the pink gloss.









You can use a thick line for a dramatic look, or use a light touch for more subtle rose gold effect.Avoid using liquid eyeliners and stick to pencils only. The liquid liners won’t blend as easily and many of the waterproof formulas are hard to remove.

Find the right rose gold shade for your skin tone.,
Try out the rose gold look by applying highlighter to your Cupid’s bow.,
Be discerning when using metallic lip products.",How to Add Rose Gold to Your Lips3," Shades of rose gold tend to look flattering on most skin tones, since they contain both warm and cool tones. However, some rose gold shades will be warmer and more golden, whereas others will be cooler, with emphasis on the frosty pink side of things. For best results, find the shade on the rose gold spectrum that best compliments your skin tone.


If you have cooler undertones, opt for shades of rose gold that feature more pink than gold.
If you have warmer skin tones, choose shades that have more gold in them than pink. Peach and warm shimmery hues also fall into this category.

, If you want to start out slow or get an idea of what rose gold lip color may look on you, add a few drops of rose gold or gold liquid highlighter to your index finger and then gently massage it into your Cupid’s bow (essentially, the center of your upper lip).Highlighters provide a luminous sheen wherever you apply them.









Typically, highlighters are applied to the cheekbones, but they are safe to apply anywhere.
These products are subtle, flattering and provide a glow that looks healthy rather than metallic.

, Keep in mind that extremely metallic lip colors can draw attention to cracks and imperfections. To prevent dryness and cracking from showing through, always apply a lip balm before working with metallic lip products. Avoid metallic formulas when you have chapped lips.









If you plan to be outside on a particularly cold winter day, you may want to forgo metallic or rose gold lips altogether. The dryness in the air could end up creating cracks in the appearance of your lips, which the metallic sheen would highlight."

Pick a true red for fair skin.,
Try a coral-red for beige skin.,
Go for brick red for medium skin.,
Pick a red with pink undertones for olive skin.,
Go for a purple-red for chocolate skin.,
Try a cherry red for coffee skin.",How to Wear Red Lipstick1," With doll-like porcelain skin, a true candy-apple red will add lovely color and contrast. Look for shades that have blue undertones (rather than yellow) to bring out a warmth in your skin tone.;
, Your skin is perfectly accentuated with reds that have a golden undertone and are coral-like. Rather than going super orange, find a red with very subtle pumpkin-y undertones. That will keep your lips looking sophisticated rather than costume-y.

, If your skin is slightly tanned, a bold brick red will create a classic look. Don’t worry about going too deep; select a shade that is slightly darker and richer than cherry red.

, Rich, copper skin is accented beautifully with a brighter berry red shade. The brightness of fuschia and raspberry based reds compliments the natural warmth of your skin. Avoid looking too old or young by staying away from neon-bright berry reds.

, Deep chocolate skin paired with a purple-based red creates an incredibly chic look. Find a red in the same color as an ultra-ripe pomegranate or an under-ripe plum, preferably with a bit of gold iridescence or glitter.

, Skin the color of black coffee looks great with a bright red for the same reason that fair skin does: it creates a beautiful contrast. Find a glossy red with blue undertones.

Lipstick is usually has a more opaque colour, and a thicker consistency than lip gloss.
Lip gloss is usually transparent, or with a subtle hint of color. They can be used as an additional layer over the lipstick for an additional shine.
Lip balms are usually transparent, and are designed to protect the lips from sun and wind, and often to soothe chapped lips and cold sores.
Lip stains are like a pen. They can sometimes have a strong colour, but they help change the color of your lips without looking like you are wearing lip color.
Some categories may overlap. You can find lipsticks with SPF protection, lip gloss that is very thick, etc.;
, Sometimes samples are available to comparison shop. You put these on your hand or a testing strip provided by the store, never directly on your own lips.

, Find the perfect shade by experimenting with different colours.


Start with a subtle color, something a few shades darker than your lip color.
Avoid bright fire-engine-red at first; a beginner's mistake is going straight for the loudest red you can find to announce, ""I'm wearing lipstick!"" Even if you do look great in that color, any mistake, imperfection, or slightest smudge will stand out.

If you have a sister who is experienced with lipstick color, find out her favorite shades. Sisters tend to look good in similar colors, because of their similar skin tones. (But don't share her makeup!)

, Today's lipsticks are better formulated than those of the past, making it unneeded. For a beginner, it is usually an unnecessary step. If you do, it should be neutral or match the colour of your lipstick.

, Stretch the lips and start at the center, putting on the lipstick to the corners. Blot the lipstick with a tissue. Make sure the lipstick has not smudged over the line of your lips.

, Stretch your lips and draw the stain in a line in the center of each lip, upper and lower. Rub your lips together and blot.

, Either apply it all over your lips, or just apply it in the centre of each lip and rub your lips together to apply an even, thin coat. Another option is to apply it in the centre of your lower lip, as this makes your lips look fuller.

Throw away old lip balm.,
Don’t use lip balm if you don’t need it.",How to Apply Lip Balm," Depending on the type of lip balm you selected, you will retrieve the balm in different ways. The most common type of lip balm is the tube.


For tubed lip balm, use the dial located on the bottom of the tube to raise the lip balm above the brim of the tube. You need only raise the balm by a half centimeter or so.
Gel-based lip balms are squeezed through a tiny hole in a lipstick-shaped applicator tip. An amount slightly smaller than pea-sized should provide enough coverage.
Liquid lip balms often come with what is known as a doe foot applicator. These are attached to the cap of the balm and store the balm on a spongy applicator tip.;
, A thin, even coating to the lips and area just outside of the mouth is best for keeping those areas moisturized. Don’t worry about overdoing it – the most you have to worry about is a slightly glossy appearance around your mouth.


Gel-based lip balm cannot be returned to the tube, so start with a smaller amount and add more as necessary to avoid wasting the product.
If you wear lipstick, apply the balm to your lips first and allow it to sit for a few minutes before applying lipstick. This lets the moisturizing agents work their magic on your lips first., You want to “hide” your lips in your mouth. This helps spread the product over areas near the mouth that also become dry or cracked.


If your lip balm has a tint or coloring, be careful when applying and spreading the balm. Being too imprecise can cause a streaky, smeared mess on your face!

, Use soap and water, or an anti-bacterial gel if you’re out and about. It’s a good idea to wash up properly before you touch your lips (or any other sensitive part of your body).Touching your fingers to your lips (in this case, to apply lip balm) increases the chance of spreading germs and infections to your mouth.
The proper way to wash your hands involves scrubbing the palms, back of hands, each thumb, between the fingers, and under the fingernails for 15 seconds total., Use your index finger, applying to the center of the bottom lip first, working your way toward the corners. Use a small amount and apply evenly to the lips, adding more balm as necessary. Balms meant for the fingers are waxy or gel-like in consistency.


Small balm applicators are available for purchase. These can be carried and dipped into the balm to apply this style of balm without using your fingers. They can be easily cleaned, and will generally stay cleaner than your fingers. Quite helpful if you can't wash your hands!
Don't use your fingers to apply lip balm when you are sick - you don't want to risk contaminating the balm. Instead, purchase a separate balm, and only use that one while you are sick. Using an contaminated lip balm, even when using an applicator, risks spreading germs., Lip balm can also be applied to other dry areas on the face. Use your fingers to apply a small amount of balm to your nose, cheeks, and other areas that could use moisture. Common areas that dry out include just under the nose and the cheeks. This is particularly prevalent during times of cold weather, wind, or if you are prone to rubbing your nose., Ingredients used for artificial colors and fragrances can cause lip irritation and actually contribute to dryness. Avoid these ingredients to keep from damaging your lips further, which can lead to unnecessary reliance on the balm.


Menthol, camphor, and phenol cool the lips, but contribute to dryness.
Artificial colors and fragrances often cause lip irritation.
Certain ingredients help moisturize, but can irritate lips, depending on your individual reaction. These include salicylic acid, aloe butter, and vitamin E. , Ingredients such as beeswax and ceramides help retain water for your lips. Other ingredients to look for include dimethicone, which helps prevent drying and improves longevity of the product, and sunscreen.Choose a lip balm that features an SPF rating. This helps protect your lips from getting sunburned, dried out, and cracked. Find a balm with SPF 15 or higher for best results., Old lip balm can dry out, losing its moisturizing properties. It can also harbor bacteria and mold if stored in a dark, damp area, so check the expiration date before use.Some lip balm comes in packs featuring multiple containers. Consider buying in bulk if you are concerned about ""wasting"" old lip balm.

, Lip balm can be habit forming. Overuse can actually lead to further drying out your lips. Only use lip balm when necessary, such as the cold winter months, or dry season. Ask yourself the following questions to determine whether you might be addicted:


Do you use it very often?
Do you spend a lot of money on lip balm?
Does a lack of lip balm distract you from other activities?
Do others comment on your use of lip balm?"

Exfoliate your lips.,
Apply a bit of lip balm.,
Brush your teeth before applying the lipstick.",How to Apply Dark Lipstick1," If your lips are chapped or flaky, your lipstick may appear uneven and bumpy. To avoid this, exfoliate your lips first to make sure they are nice and smooth before applying any lipstick.You can pick up a lip exfoliant at a beauty supply store, or you can use a DIY method. The smoother your lips are, the smoother the lipstick will go on.






;
, After your lips are exfoliated, you can enhance their silkiness even more by putting on a light coat of lip balm. This will help keep your lips moisturized and help the dark color to glide on smoothly and evenly. Apply your lip balm, and wait a couple minutes while it soaks into your lips.







, This isn't directly related to applying your lipstick, but it's a crucial step. You will not be able to brush your teeth after applying your lipstick without messing up your careful work. Skipping the brushing isn't an option either, because you will be calling attention to your mouth with your bold lipstick, and so bad breath is not an option. Scrub your pearly whites before you get started."

Not only will this prevent drying, it will leave your lips looking smoother before you apply your lip paint.Wash your hands before exfoliating your lips.;
, A translucent setting powder will make paint stick to lips easier. Before applying any lip paint, dab on a light layer of setting powder over your lips. In addition to making application easier, a setting powder can brighten the colors of your lipstick.If you prefer, you can use primer instead of setting powder., As it's easy to smear lip paint, a lip liner will help your lipstick stay on your lips. Take a liner that's roughly the same shade as your lipstick. Carefully outline your top and bottom lip in the lip liner., Your cupid's bow is the center of your lips.

Dry and peeling skin will be removed, leaving your lips smooth and soft – the perfect canvas for applying lipstick.









If you don’t own a lip scrub product, whip one up at home. Mix a small amount of sugar with equal parts olive oil and honey, then gently massage your lips with the mixture for about 60 seconds.The lips are very delicate, so use a light touch when applying a scrub.;
, Dab a small amount of concealer around your lip line. Use a makeup brush or your finger to gently blend the concealer into your skin. Work the makeup slightly above your lip line, and then blend it right below the lip line, so that the majority of your natural lip color is obscured.








For those with dry lips, it may help to apply lip balm or a tiny dab of coconut oil to your lips for moisture before you add concealer, which can be drying.
If you don’t have concealer on hand, a nude lipstick is a great substitute. This will be a little more moisturizing, as well.

, Popular hues are deep berry or bright red, but you can use any highly pigmented lipstick color you like. Use the fleshy part of your index finger or a lip brush to dab the lipstick right in the center of your bottom lip. Make sure you apply it so that it reaches the very inside edge of your lips.








Do not apply the lipstick close to your lip line or bring it out to the corners of your mouth.
To get an intensely blurry result, use a lipstick with a matte finish. However, any finish you like will work for this look.

, This will transfer some of the bright color to the center of your top lip. Do not rub your lips together or smack them. Press them together once or twice with a small amount of pressure. Then use your finger or a lip brush to pat a small amount of lipstick in the center of your bottom lip again, to play up the contrast and add depth.








For a more intense result, tap a loose pigment in a similar or slightly amped up color right in the center of the bottom lip., Working with a lip brush or cotton swab will give you the most precision and control, but your finger also works well. Pat the lipstick gently, blending it out toward your lip line on the bottom lip. Do the same for your upper lip. Try to blend so that the hue appears as a gradient, with the brightest color right in the center, and growing increasingly fainter as it gets closer to the lip line.








Keep blending until the lipstick appears to fade into your skin., Dip a clean cotton swab into translucent face powder, then tap it against the edge of your compact or sink so that the excess falls off. Dab the end of the cotton swap around the outermost edges of your lips, following your lip line. Flip the swab over to the clean end and gently blur the powder into your mouth.









Imagine that you’re trying to “erase” the appearance of your lip line. Blend it gently, taking care to preserve the gradient effect you created with the lipstick., A matte finish will have a more blurred effect, but adding gloss will intensify the bright color in the center and create more dimension. Dab the lip gloss on lightly, taking care not to smudge or change the work you’ve done with your lipstick. Use your finger to pat the gloss all over your lips.







, This is very similar to the blurred look, but less pigmented. It creates more of a washed out effect and the illusion of thinner lips. Apply a matte lipstick in a bright color all over your lips, as you normally would. Pat a small amount of translucent powder on top and then blot your lips on a tissue to mute the color. Pat concealer around the other edges of your mouth to remove the definition of your lip line.








Do not apply lip gloss or balm on top of the lipstick, since this will ruin the faded effect.This look is meant to de-emphasize the fullness and color of the lips.

, This is a very subtle look and the technique involves working backwards, applying pigment and then removing most of it. Apply your favorite lipstick to your lips, as usual. Use only a thin layer, or use your finger or lip brush to control the amount of lipstick you use. Hold a tissue over your lips and use your fingers to press down several times, which will blot away pigment.









Lift the tissue to check your progress. If necessary, keep blotting until your lips have achieved a barely there “stained” appearance., Apply a lip balm that has a subtle hint of color, such as a berry hue, all over your lips. Then apply a highly pigmented lipstick in a dark wine or berry color to the center of both lips. Dab the lipstick, but do not rub or blend it in. Avoid bringing the color out to the corners of your mouth.









If the result looks too dramatic for you, blend out the lipstick slightly. However, the effect is intended to be obvious and unnatural."

Consider a matte red.,
Try a glossy red.,
Look into a stain.,
Try a red tinted moisturizer.",How to Wear Red Lipstick2," The most classic look available is a matte red lip. Matte lipsticks are the longest lasting and won’t feather over time, making them ideal for a long day at work or a night out at a concert.

, For a more modern red look, try a glossy red lipstick. Unlike the sparkly red glosses of our pre-teen days, glossy reds are now made to add a sophisticated touch to your lips. Wear a glossy red lipstick as a stand-alone color, or layer it over a matte shade for extra long wear., Lip stains are an up-and-coming in the world of makeup; they are a liquid lipstick/gloss hybrid that stains your lips with a matte finish for over 12 hours. On the downside, they can be difficult to remove. Consider a lip stain as an ultra-long wear alternative to a traditional lipstick.

, If you’re not quite ready to take the plunge into a full-on lipstick, test the waters by using a red tinted moisturizer. These hued balms have enough color to add the traditional rouge to your lips, but are easy to remove and slightly translucent. They tend to have a slightly glossy finish.

Smooth out your lips.,
Outline your lips with a highlighter.,
Add lip liner.,
Apply the lipstick.,
Remove any excess lipstick.",How to Wear Red Lipstick3," One unfortunate consequence of wearing red lipstick (especially matte lipstick) is that dry, peeling, and flaky lips are exaggerated. Use a sugar scrub to remove any dead skin from your lips, and follow up with your favorite moisturizer. Your lips will look significantly improved in red lipstick if they are smoothed and softened first.

, To make your lips really pop, use a light concealer or highlighter and a small brush to apply around the outside of your lips. Gently blend the outer edge of the line for a more natural look. This will draw attention to your lips and create a greater contrast between the red of your lips and the natural tone of your skin.

, Unlike lip liner of old, a nude or red shade will work to fill the grooves of your lips with a waxy coating, providing a totally smooth blank canvas for the lipstick. Draw on the outline of your lips, and then fill in the entirety of your lips with the liner. If you make a mistake, don't swipe it off with your finger––use makeup remover on a Q-tip (cotton bud) for best results.


Slightly line outside your lips if you want your lips to look bigger.
Consider using a reverse liner; it's clear and it allows you to outline your lips to prevent lipstick from running and bleeding.
If you don't have a lip liner, pat concealer across your lips.

, Apply a smooth, even coat of lipstick to the complete surface of your lips. You can apply it directly out of the tube, or use a lip brush for a more precise application. Make sure to pucker slightly so expose the soft center of your lips, an area often forgotten about.

, You’ve likely seen women with lipstick on their teeth; definitely not an attractive look. Prevent this very thing by placing a tissue between your lips and pressing them together gently. Alternatively, place your index finger in your mouth and move it around gently. It'll lift excess red lipstick likely to smear on your teeth."

Keep the rest of your makeup subtle.,
Check your lipstick often.,
Reapply when necessary.,
Finished.

",How to Wear Red Lipstick4," Red lipstick is a statement piece, almost an accessory. As such a bold statement, it is important to keep the rest of your makeup toned down. Heavy eye makeup with red lipstick will leave you looking childish or costume-like. Rather, keep a neutral eye with soft skin for the most classic look.

, Unless you’re using a top-of-the-line lipstick, it is likely that your lipstick will fade or feather over time. Avoid wearing bad lipstick for extended periods of time by checking it often. Wipe off any that has bled outside your lips, and even out your lips by wiping off areas that are particularly heavy.

, Following the aforementioned tip, it is necessary to reapply red lipstick every few hours. When you noticed that it has faded significantly, swipe on a second (or third) coat. Keeping your lipstick fresh will keep your look sophisticated and classy rather than sloppy.

Use a lip brush to apply the lipstick.,
Apply your dark lipstick following your natural shape.,
Lightly powder your lips.,
Apply a second coat of lipstick.",How to Apply Dark Lipstick2," When it comes to dark lipstick, precise application is key. Instead of rolling it on straight out of the tube, it’s better to use a small lip brush to paint it on. You can purchase these at any cosmetic or beauty supply store.

, Using your lip brush, carefully paint your lips within your natural lip line. To make your lips look most natural, apply the product into the center of your lips. Then, brush it outwards so that it becomes lighter as it reaches the outer corners of your lips.







, After you’ve applied one coat of your lipstick, use a tissue to gently blot your lips. Then, using your fingertips, lightly pat translucent or nude powder into your lips. This will help set your first coat of lipstick, as well as give your second coat something to stick to.







, A second coat will help ensure your lipstick stays on all day or night. Use your lip brush to apply it exactly as you did the first coat. Double check your work, and make sure it looks perfectly even.If you desire, you can also outline your lips in a matching color lip liner. This can enhance and define the border around your lips.
Another option is to apply concealer with a small concealer brush around your mouth to perfect the border between your lips and skin.

Select a lipstick that balances your skin’s undertones.,
Choose between a glossy or matte finish.,
Test your lipstick shade before purchasing it.",How to Apply Dark Lipstick3," This is a great rule of thumb to narrow down which dark lipsticks will work best on you. If you are cooler toned, you will want to balance that with a warmer colored lipstick. If you are warmer toned, choose a cooler toned lipstick.If you aren’t sure of your skin’s undertones, learn how to figure it out here.
If you’re shopping at a cosmetics store, don’t be afraid to ask for help selecting a shade.

, Typically, matte shades work best for daytime looks, and glossy shades are reserved for the evening. With a bold, dark color, the added gloss may be a bit too dramatic for the light of day – however, these rules can always be broken.Choose the finish you prefer.

, This isn’t always possible, but take advantage if it is. If you’re shopping at a cosmetics store, they will have a tester tube of lipstick. Use a cotton swab to apply the lipstick, and examine yourself in a mirror. The proper shade should brighten up your complexion. Take your time, and find the shade that flatters your face most.Brush your cotton swab on any area of tester lipstick that doesn’t look touched to avoid germs.

Place a few drops of almond oil onto your palm.,
Rub your palms together to warm the oil up.,
Gently pat your hands against your face and neck.,
Wipe off any excess oil, if necessary.",How to Use Almond Oil for Aging/Dry Skin1," If you have not yet done so, wash your face using your usual facial cleanser, then pat it dry with a soft, clean towel. You should never apply oil (or any type of moisturizer) to a dirty face. If you apply oil to a dirty face, you'll trap the dirt; this could lead to blackheads and breakouts., A little bit goes a long way, so you only need 2 to 4 drops. You can always apply more oil later, if necessary., This will help make it easier to absorb into your skin. It will also reduce the chances of you applying too much., Avoid rubbing the oil in.If you only want to use the oil to spot-treat a dry patch, pick the oil up from your palm with your ring finger, then gently pat your finger against your skin. This is especially important if you are treating the delicate skin under your eyes.

, If you have very dry skin, you could leave some of the excess oil on your skin. If your face feels too greasy, however, use a cotton pad to gently wipe off any residual oil."

Note that wrinkles are primarily caused by ageing and the makeup of the skin.,
Learn about the effects of the ageing process.,
Note the other role of ultraviolet light in causing wrinkles.",How to Understand the Cause of Wrinkles,"


There are three layers to the skin, and these are - epidermis, the dermis and then the subcutaneous tissue.
All of the three layers are made up of slightly different things and contain a different sort of tissue. They also do different things.

The epidermis, for example, is a barrier to the outside world.
The dermis is a connective type of tissue. It contains different types of this connective tissue that all do different things, by way of strength, durability and also the look and texture.
The subcutaneous tissue is the bottom layer of the skin that contains fat cells. It is these layers that insulate the body and makes the skin appear plump and healthy.

;
, During the ageing process, the epidermis and the cells within it become thinner. Thinner cells mean thinner skin and the barrier against outside elements is less effective. The skin appears dryer and the skin is unable to repair itself as easily as it did in younger age. The dermis contains cells like collagen. Less of this is produced in the ageing process and the skin starts to lose its elasticity. Because of this and the effects on the first layer, the epidermis, the skin loses its healthiness and it will start to wrinkle and also sag.


With the third layer, the subcutaneous tissue, the fat cells shrink as they get older and the cells cannot fill out the skin as much as it can when it is in its younger years. When the skin becomes damaged, and wrinkles and sagging begins to happen, the cells cannot fill it out, and it is this reason why wrinkles happen with age.

, There are many other reasons why this wrinkle process begins prematurely.


It has been proven that up to ninety percent of the symptoms that accompany premature ageing,for example, wrinkles, is due to prolonged exposure to ultraviolet light. This comes from sunlight and can also come from tanning beds. Basically, the exposure to the sun causes the wrinkles to begin at an accelerated speed. The light that the sun gives out kills the cells within the epidermis and the layers further down and causes the same system of events as ageing does.

Talk to your doctor.",How to Take Care of Dry Skin," Your body naturally produces oils that keep your skin protected and prevent drying out. However, you do lots of things throughout the day that remove these natural oils. The biggest threat to your skin's natural protectant is your bathing routine. Soaps which remove to much oil from your skin and water which is too hot both put your skin at risk. Lower the temperature of your showers as low as you can stand and use only soaps which contain moisturizers or are marked for ""sensitive skin"".


You should also be sure not to bathe too often or for too long. Both can also wash away too much of your natural oil. Shower for no more than 10-15 minutes and no more than once a day. If you can, bathe only every other day.;
, You have probably seen the advice to exfoliate dry skin. This removes the dead skin, preventing infection and allowing moisturizing products to absorb properly. This is good advice but you should follow it carefully. You don't want to exfoliate too often, first of all. Once or twice a week can be plenty, especially for sensitive areas like the face. You also shouldn't use harsh exfoliants, like a loofah or pumice stone. Instead, baking soda paste or a clean washcloth will get the job done without causing damage.


It is also important to make sure the washcloth you use is clean. One of the reasons why things like loofahs cause problems is because items like that easily harbor germs and bacteria. Using a clean washcloth can help keep that problem from happening.

, When you dry your skin, be careful. Vigorous rubbing with a towel can not only irritate your skin, it can also remove too much moisture and oil. This can cause dryness or make an existing problem worse. Instead, air dry when you can and otherwise lightly pat your skin dry with a soft, clean towel or cloth.

, After you bathe or get your skin wet, you should always apply a layer of moisturizer to help lock in moisture and return the natural oils that you may have removed. This basic layer does not need to be thick, necessarily. Just a basic layer of protection can make a difference.


Lanolin cream is one of the best products for protecting your skin and maintaining moisture. This is a natural product which is produced by animals to protect their own skin. The most common US brand is called Bag Balm and can be found in most drug stores.
For your face, however, lanolin can be a bit much and should be used only occasionally and in very severe cases. Otherwise, you should use a lighter product which is oil free and designed not to block pores or cause other skin problems.

, If you can, try to apply a thicker layer of product at night, and then cover the area in clothing to protect the product. This will give your skin more to absorb and more time to absorb it. Be aware, however, than most of these skin moisturizing products stain, so be sure to cover the skin with clothing that you don't worry about, like an old pair of sweats or pajamas.

, If you want to have real results that last, it's important to form a routine. You'll need to moisturize and care for your skin regularly and for a long time before you can see real results. Be consistent, persistent, and above all: patient. You will see results but you need to be sure to moisturize every day for a really long time.

, When the air gets cold, it precipitates moisture out of the air. The air then sucks whatever moisture it can get out of your skin, causing dryness. This is why you are probably most affected in the winter. Protect your skin from the temperatures by covering up in warm clothing and by covering your skin in cremes to lock in the moisture you have.


For example, wear gloves to protect your hands and socks to protect your feet. Scarves and cowls can be worn across the face to protect your skin there.

, The sun also causes problems with dry skin, by irritating your skin and causing damage. You also risk skin cancer by getting too much sun exposure. Be sure to wear protective clothing as much as you can when you go out on a sunny day and for what skin is not covered by clothing, use sunscreen.


SPF 1000 sunscreen is just not needed. The regular sunscreen, 15 or 30, should be plenty. You will want to be sure, though, to get a broad spectrum sunscreen (UVA/UVB).

, Some soaps, especially those with high levels of synthetic surfactants are really harsh on your skin and can cause damage and dryness. You'll want to find a mild soap, that suits your skin, in order to prevent dryness, Hard water, or water which contains a large concentration of calcium, is common throughout the world. This excess calcium ( which not technically harmful) can irritate and dry out your skin, however, by leaving some calcium behind on your skin. You should have your home tested for hard water to see if this is causing your skin problems.


If you do have hard water, it's possible to treat the water so that it comes out of the pipes calcium-free. Your local hardware store should be able to help with this.

, Just like dry winter air is bad for you, any kind of dry air can also cause dry skin. You can combat this by using a humidifier in your home or office. A basic place to start would be running one in your room at night, since this will also help you sleep.

, Dehydration can cause problems with dry skin very easily so you'll want to be sure that you're drinking plenty of water. However, how much is the right amount depends on each individual. The recommended eight glasses is a starting point, but you might need more or you might need less.


A good rule of thumb is that if your urine is coming out pale or clear, you're getting enough water. If it's sunshiny yellow or darker, you need to drink more water.

, You skin, just like so many other parts of your body, need some nutrients more than others in order to look its best. You'll want to be sure to get these nutrients in your diet or take supplements to make sure that your body has enough. The best nutrients for skin include vitamin A, vitamin E, and omega-3 fatty acids.


You can find these nutrients in high concentrations in salmon, anchovies, sardines, olive oil, almonds, kale, and carrots.

, It is well established by science that dry skin can often be caused by excess weight and obesity.Conditions that are related to obesity, such as diabetes, can also cause skin dryness. If you find that other methods are not helping you to maintain healthy skin, you might want to consider if your weight and general health are the root cause of your problem.

, Other underlying health problems can also cause dry skin. You'll want to talk with your doctor and get evaluated to see if any of these problems are affecting you. If they are, then you'll know why your own efforts haven't been very successful and you'll have new options available to you to help keep your skin healthy.


Eczema and psoriasis, for example, are common conditions which both cause problems with dry skin.
If you find you have dry skin on your face and around your hairline, it's important to realize that it might actually be dandruff and caused by a skin fungus. This requires different treatment than just moisturizing.

, As with most medical problems, if you have questions or concerns it's a good idea to talk to your doctor. Dry skin is a problem that should not be ignored. Severely dry skin causes small and large cracks in the skin, which puts you at serious risk of infection. Dry skin can also, as stated above, be associated with more severe health problems like diabetes. For these reasons, it's a good idea not to ignore the problem if you find that the measures discussed above are not helping.

Prevent further skin damage.",How to Tone Sagging Skin1," A good moisturizer won’t solve the problem of sagging skin, but it will mask the effect. Moisturizing will make your skin look fuller and improve the skin’s appearance, at least for a while.Apply a moisturizer to your face and body often, ideally at least once per day. Do this after a shower when your skin is saturated with water, to lock in more moisture.
Avoid creams that are too heavy, as they tend to clog pores. Choose a cream that’s formulated to your skin type, i.e. oily or sensitive skin. Try also to pick a “non-comedogenic” kind, which means that it won’t clog pores.;
, Topical retinoids like Retin-A, Renova, Avage, and Tazorac are derived from vitamin A and, when applied to the skin, partially repair damaged collagen. You can use these over-the-counter substances to reduce your fine lines and other wrinkles and even help the skin renew itself faster. Usually, you apply them overnight.Look at your neighborhood pharmacy for such creams. Usually they cost under $20.
Apply topical retinoids at night and rinse off in the morning. Then put on a good sunscreen and protective clothing, as they can make your skin burn more easily.
Also be aware that, in high doses, retinoids can make your skin scaly, itchy, or excessively dry.

, The idea behind exfoliation is to remove the outer layer of dead skin, which leaves your skin brighter. If done right, exfoliation over the long-term can stimulate collagen production and make your skin more youthful looking. It can also make other topical treatments more effective.Try to exfoliate with a scrub or a motorized scrub brush. Again, you should be able to find these at most pharmacies for a reasonable cost. You might also try an at-home, 2% salicylic acid wash.
Be careful not to be too aggressive. Over-zealous exfoliation can damage the skin and leave the redness or discoloration. Avoid exfoliation if you have rosacea or inflammatory acne, for example.
Talk with a board-certified dermatologist to see what the best kind of exfoliant is for your skin, as well as how often you should exfoliate.

, There are tons of non-prescription aging creams on the market, and some of them can modestly improve your skin quality. How well they work depends a lot on active ingredients, however – creams with retinol, alpha hydroxy acid, antioxidants, and peptides will work better.Most non-prescription creams have less active ingredients than prescription creams. The results may therefore be temporary. Look carefully at ingredients. Also read reviews or ask your dermatologist to suggest an effective brand.
Pick a product that suits your skin type as well as one that is hypoallergenic and non-comedogenic.
Have realistic expectations. Don’t think that a cream will make you look ten years younger overnight. No cream can have the same effect as a surgical facelift.

, Be proactive when it comes to your skin. Save yourself further damage and sagging by protecting it from the sun and avoiding other behavior that promotes aging. This won’t solve the problem or tighten the skin, but it will avoid making the situation worse.Stop sunbathing and using tanning beds. Avoid any over-exposure to the sun, which can damage your skin and cause wrinkles and sagging.
Use sunscreen whenever you go outside with at least SPF 30. Apply it at least 15 minutes before you go outdoors. Also wear protective clothes, a hat, and seek shade when possible.
Drink less alcohol and more water. Alcohol dehydrates the skin and, over time, can damage it, making you appear more aged.
Stop smoking, as well. Smoking speeds up the aging process and can make your skin look dull and sallow.

",How to Do Pin‐up or Rockabilly Makeup," Wash your face using lukewarm water and some face wash, then rinse with cool water. Gently pat your face dry using a soft, clean towel.









Consider applying some toner and moisturizer. The toner will help restore the natural pH of your skin and tighten the pores while the moisturizer will hydrate your skin. Soak a cotton ball with toner and wipe it across your face, avoiding the eyes and lips. Next, apply a thin layer of moisturizer onto your face, making sure to massage it into the skin and avoid the area around the eyes. Wait a few seconds for the moisturizer to sink into your skin and dry.;
, This will help full in any pores and make your skin appear smooth and soft. It will also help the foundation last longer. Simply dot the primer onto your face and blend it in; a little bit goes a long way.








, You can use liquid or powder, but make sure that it matches your skin tone exactly. Be sure to blend it in, especially around the sides of your face and jawline; you do not want any harsh lines, or it will look like you are wearing a mask.








, Pin-up and rockabilly models were known for their flawless complexions, so if you have any blemishes, you'll want to cover those up with some concealer. Simply pat the concealer into the blemish, and lightly blend the edges into your foundation using a small brush or cosmetic sponge. If you are using a color-correcting concealer, put that on first, then put on a regular concealer that closely-matches your foundation. Here are some tips on choosing the right color-correcting concealer:








If you need to cover any red areas, such as pimples, use a green concealer.
If you have fair skin and want to hide those under eye bags, then dab on some peach or pink concealer.
If you have olive or tan skin and need to conceal those under eye shadows, then reach for the yellow concealer instead.

, On the other hand, you can also turn a blemish into a beauty mark; many famous pin-up models had such beauty marks. Just put a dab of black or dark brown liquid liner over the blemish. Try to make it as even as possible, but do not make the mark too big.








, Sweep the brush across your powder and gently puff on it to get rid of any excess powder. Lightly dust the powder across your face, focusing on your nose, forehead, and cheekbones. This will set your makeup and prevent any shine.








, Pin-up and rockabilly models were known for their strong, arched eyebrows. If you haven't had your brows tamed in a while, now is the time to get them waxed and tweezed. You can do this either at home or professionally.








, You can use an eyebrow pencil, some eyeshadow, or an eyebrow shading kit. Be sure to follow the arch of your eyebrow and to go lighter and thinner the further away you get from your nose. This will help make your eyebrows appear stronger and draw attention to your eyes, a key point of the pin-up or rockabilly look. Do not make your eyebrows too dark, however; instead, consider following these suggestions on how to find the right shade:








If you have lighter hair or eyebrows, go one shade darker.
If you have dark hair or eyebrows, go one shade lighter. Never use black.
If you skin has a cool undertone, use an ashy color.
If your skin has a warm undertone, use a warmer color.

, Use a small, fluffy brush and blend the eyeshadow into the crease, going towards the brow bone.








, Lower your eyes, and run the brush along the eye socket. Use an angled blending brush to blend the crease in.









For more defined eyes, add some even darker brown eyeshadow to the outer crease/corner of your eye. Be sure to blend well.

, You can use any light color, such as while, ivory, or champagne. highlight. Use a soft brush, and dust it on lightly; you are only contouring, so do not use too much eyeshadow.








, This is not necessary, but it can help your eyes appear more open, especially if you have naturally straight lashes. Open the eyelash curler and position it at the base of your eyelashes. Squeeze the curler shut and hold it for three seconds. Let go and more the curler up to the middle of your lashes. Squeeze the curler again for another three seconds and let go. Lastly, curl the very tip of your lashes, again holding the curler shut for three seconds.









Do not hold the curler for more than three seconds, or you will bend your lashes instead., You can use a felt-tip liner, or an eyeliner brush and gel liner. When you reach the outer corner of your eye, flick upwards, creating a wingtip. Do not extend the ""wing"" too far and do not let it connect with the lower lid; you want it to blend in with your outermost eyelashes when you open your eyes.








, Use the volumizing mascara first, then once it dries, apply the lengthening mascara to the tips of your lashes. This will give you a nice, full look. To apply the mascara, dip the brush into the tube, then pull it out, dragging it along the rim of the tube; this is to get rid of any excess mascara. Hold the brush at the base of your lashes, and flick upward, blinking as you do so.









If you are going to wear some false lashes, then apply only a single coat of regular mascara.

, The eyes were a big part of pin-up and rockabilly makeup, so if you really want to make your eyes stand out, you can draw attention to them with some false eyelashes. Keep in mind, however, that applying false eyelashes may be tricky at first and require lots of practice. Do not be discouraged, however; the end result is worth it.








, Simply peel the lashes off the plastic case and pull off any excess glue. Be very gentle while handling them; the lashes are delicate and can be easily crushed.








, Hold the lash against your natural lash line. If they are too long and extend beyond your natural lash line, you will need to trim them. You can do this by snipping the excess off from the outer edge of the lash using a pair of sharp, clean scissors.







, If not, then put a drop of glue onto the packaging, and lightly run the lash strip across it. Do not apply the glue to the other lash yet.








, While you are waiting, hold the lash between your hands and bend it into a C- shape. This will ""train"" the lash and make it easier to put onto your lid.








, Once the glue starts to turn clear, you can put the lash on. Hold it above your eye and slowly start to bring it down onto your lid. If you have very curly lashes, you will need to bring it behind them in a sort of curving motion. Position it right against your natural lash line.








, If you bent the false lash enough, it should rest comfortably against the curve of your eyelid. If you didn't bend it enough, you will need to hold the lash in place while the glue finishes drying. Make sure that your hands are clean, then press down on the corners of the lashes. It helps if you are looking down while doing this.








, Once the glue on the first lash has dried, repeat the whole process for the other lash.








, Do this only after the glue has dried. Apply a light coat the underside of your lashes. This will help seal them even more to the false ones.








, This will smooth your lips, helping them appear fuller. Wait about five to ten minutes before applying the lip liner. If there is any excess chap stick or lip balm on your lips, gently blot it off with a tissue.








, You want a true red color. If you really want to be authentic, then use a glossy red lipstick; matte lipstick did not exist during the rockabilly era. Stay away from shimmery or glittery lipsticks.








, Trace your lips using lip liner, then fill your lips in using the liner. This gives the lipstick a sort of canvas to grip on to and help it last longer.It also acts as a sort of stain, so that if your lipstick fades during the day, it won't be as noticeable.








, Using a brush to apply your lipstick (as opposed to directly putting it on) will give you that nice, crisp line so often found on pin-ups and rockabilly models.








, Fold a tissue in half, then place it between your lips. This removes any excess lipstick. You can then reapply your lipstick and blot it a second time for an even more intense color.








, This will help the lipstick last longer. Simply pull a tissue apart so that you have two, thin sheets. Place one of the sheets against your lips, and dust it with some loose powder using a big, fluffy brush.







, The pin-up and Rockabilly makeup look focused mainly on the eyes and lips, so blush should be used sparingly and carefully. Choose a soft pink or peach color on the apples of your cheeks, and use just enough to give you a healthy glow.








, While not necessary to complete the pin-up or rockabilly look, this can help your makeup last even longer.

Harness the power of antioxidants.,
Consume foods that are rich in vitamin C and vitamin E. Vitamins C and E are rich in skin-enhancing antioxidants, and some experts believe that vitamin C is the most important vitamin for combatting wrinkles.Vitamin C supports collagen production, which keeps the skin plump and full of moisture, and vitamin E helps protect against radiation from the sun.,
Eat foods that are high in vitamin A and beta-carotene.,
Munch on foods that contain quercetin.",How to Remove Facial Wrinkles with Fruit1," Antioxidants are compounds that protect the body from damage done by harmful molecules called free radicals. An antioxidant-rich diet can help counteract the damaging effects that free radicals have on your skin, which helps reduce the appearance of wrinkles. Antioxidants and other important skin nutrients are found in a variety of sources, but the best source is fruit!, Some fruits that are rich in vitamins C and E include:


Tomatoes are packed with vitamin C, which helps make skin look firmer and plumper. They also contain lycopene, which helps neutralize skin-damaging free radicals from the sun and improves vascular function. One study noted that regularly eating tomatoes for six weeks resulted in extra circulation, a noticeable glow, and increased protection against sunburn (which causes wrinkles!) by 33%.Avocados are packed with both vitamins E and C, and they also contain B-complex vitamins and essential fatty acids that nourish the skin and keep it soft and wrinkle free. They are also high in glutathione, which flushes toxins from the body and is shown to help with acne and wrinkles.Citrus fruits, such as oranges, grapefruits, clementines, and tangerines, are very high in vitamin C. For example, a medium-sized orange provides about 117% of the recommended daily intake of vitamin C!, Vitamin A and beta-carotene, an antioxidant that converts into vitamin A within the body, are important nutrients for maintaining, protecting, and repairing the skin.The antioxidants found in vitamin A- and beta-carotene-rich foods help to fortify the skin against getting wrinkles in the first place, as well as the formation of new wrinkles. Some fruits that are rich in vitamin A and beta-carotene include:


Cantaloupes are high in vitamin A and vitamin C, and they contain the most beta-carotene than any other fruit. Regularly eating a quarter of a medium-sized cantaloupe provides enough of these nutrients to promote skin cell turnover and increase skin elasticity.Stone fruits, especially apricots, are very high in beta-carotene antioxidants and other compounds that help fight wrinkles., Quercetin is a type of flavonoid, which are natural compounds found in plants that contain antioxidant properties.These antioxidants, like the antioxidants found in vitamins, help fight free radicals and their damaging effects on the skin. Some fruits that are rich sources of quercetin include:


Apples are one of the best sources of the quercetin. Apples also contain a great deal of vitamin C and are extremely hydrating, which are both great for the skin. Just be sure to eat the apple skins, since that’s where the quercetin is the most concentrated!Red grapes are also very high in quercetin, and like the apple, the antioxidant is most concentrated in the skin of this fruit. The antioxidants in red grapes will also help reduce inflammation of the skin and improve overall skin tone.Berries, especially blueberries and raspberries, include a great deal of the wrinkle-fighting quercetin. Considered “free-radical scavengers,” many berries include high concentrations of quercetin, vitamins, and anthocyanins, which neutralize the enzymes that destroy connective tissue (i.e., that cause wrinkles!)."

",How to Do Marilyn Monroe Makeup," Unless you have very oily skin, you will need to apply a good moisturizer to your skin. Marilyn's skin almost always has a ""glowing"" dewy appearance, which requires a good moisturizer!Ideally, you will apply it twice each day, once in the morning and once at night. It is best to apply moisturizer right after bathing, when the skin is clean and the pores are open.Give your moisturizer 10-15 minutes to soak into the skin before applying makeup!;
, You don’t want the foundation to be too matte (because Marilyn preferred a more moist, dewy look), so look for foundations with a medium coverage.Apply this all over your face lightly and evenly.


Make sure you choose a shade of foundation that matches your skin as closely as possible. If you have never done this before, it is best to go to a department store with a trusted friend or family member. There, an employee can help you determine the correct shade for your skin.
Medium coverage foundation refers to foundation that is thick enough to cover blemishes on the skin, but will still feel light and natural.Remember, Marilyn had a flawless yet natural appearance to her skin.

, If you have any blemishes, pimples, or dark spots that you cannot cover with foundation alone, then apply a concealer as needed.


Be sure to use a concealer that is well matched to your skin so you don’t end up with patches.

, If you really want to mimic the makeup tricks of Monroe, try swiping a tiny amount of vaseline along your cheekbone. This will create shine, and is believed to be one of trick she almost always used.It is also believed that Marilyn also used vaseline as a primer all over her face.If you wish to try this, be very cautious and use a tiny amount to start with, especially if you have oily skin to begin with. Vaseline is very, very thick and oily. It might look great if you can apply it thin enough, but using too much will make you look very greasy.

, Marilyn’s face was heart-shaped, and her artist used contouring to exaggerate this. If you feel comfortable with the process, then you can use the contouring technique to make your forehead appear wider, your cheekbones high, and your chin and jaw more narrow.Unless you are very skilled at doing this, it may be best to skip it! Contouring is not easy to do, and requires a lot of practice! Remember that it is perfectly OK to look like yourself, but with Marilyn inspired makeup.

, Marilyn tended towards bright coral tones for her blush.If you have light skin, you can use a similar color. If you have darker skin, you will need a darker blush. The end goal is to have cheeks that look rosy and healthy.


Apply the blush on the apples of your cheek and sweep it towards your hairline, but make sure it is blended so that you don’t appear clownish!

, To do this, swipe a very thin layer of translucent powder over your face, paying particular attention to your t-zone.


The t-zone is the area in the middle of your face which includes the skin just above your eyebrows, your nose, and underneath your nose and lips., To make Marilyn's nose appear shorter, her makeup artist would tap a small amount of blush on the tip of her nose.If you already have a short nose, this is not necessary. However, if your nose is a bit longer than you would like, a bit of blush will help.


Don't overdo it! You don't want to have a bright red nose.

, If you have pale skin like Monroe’s, you can use a white shimmery powder. Sweep the powder all over your eyelid.Pay particular attention to the inner part of the lid next to the tear duct, and avoid going to far out (e.g. towards the hair line), instead stay focused on the eyelid.
If you have darker skins, choose darker tones (not white), but make sure they are shimmery to stick with Marilyn’s look.
It is reported that Marilyn also liked to swipe a bit of vaseline or coconut oil on her eyelids before applying shadow.You can try this, too; however, make sure you apply the vaseline or oil in a very, very thin layer. Otherwise, it might not blend well with the eye shadow.

, Monroe’s makeup artist used several shades for her eyeliner. You can begin by using a brown eyeliner pencil to line the inner half of your eyelid. Do this only on the outer part of the lashes., Use the black eye liner on the outer half of the eyelid. Again, you will want to apply a thin line to the outer part of the lashes.You can finish the black liner by gently flicking the liner out at the end of your eyelid. You don’t want a cat-eye look, but instead, a small upward flick of the pencil., For this step, choose a white liner and lightly run it along the water line to make your eyes appear bright like Monroe’s.The waterline refers to the small line of skin that is between your eyelashes and your actual eye. When using a liner here, be very careful, or you may poke yourself in the eye!

, One of the many secrets of her makeup artist was to draw a tiny triangle using a white or very pale colored liner at the outer edge of her lids to make the eyes appear bigger. You can copy this by very gently drawing two very small lines outwards from the outer corner. One will go up, and the other will go down., Using a good eyelash curler, gently curl your upper lashes on each eye.


Make sure you have applied your eyeliner and eye shadow before doing this.
Gently place your top lashes in between the ""mouth"" of the curler.
Press the curler to the base of your eyelashes and gently squeeze for about 5 seconds.
Be gentle! There’s no need to squeeze the tool to tightly!

, To make her forehead appear more narrow, Monroe’s artist would shape her brows so that they had a “peak”.You can mimic this look by brushing your eyebrows up, and then brushing the outer half of the brow down.


If you truly want the look, you can also use tweezers to pluck any extra hairs that may make your eyebrow arch less defined, but be careful! It can sometimes be hard to re-shape your eyebrows once you’ve committed to a dramatic look.
Use a bit of hair spray, hair gel, or vaseline to keep the hairs in place.
You can also use an eyebrow pencil to help draw in the peaks, but use the pencil modestly, and be sure to blend it with a brow brush!

, Marilyn’s artist would cut the false eyelashes in half before applying them, and then only apply them to the outer corners of her eyes to create a more natural look.These days you can purchase individual lash packs that give you a way to apply only a few lashes here and there.


You can also always purchase normal false lashes and cut them in half, just the way her artist did.

, Once you have applied your eyelashes (or chosen not to) apply a few light coats of black mascara to your lashes.


Remember Monroe’s look was mostly natural for her eyes, and more dramatic for her lips! That means you don’t want the eyelashes to be too dramatic.

, You can do this with an exfoliant you might use on your face, or you can use a wash cloth dampened with warm water. Rub your lips using a gentle circular motion.

, If your goal is to have bright red lips like Monroe’s, you can use an espresso color as the liner.

, Choose a color that is lighter than the outer liner, but still darker than the goal color. For example, a brick red color can work. Use the pencil to completely fill in the lips.

, Now you will blend the color using a brighter red lip pencil, which will be the top color.Here, you will fill in the lips again, blending with the inner liner. Using a pencil will help the color stay in place better.


Be careful not to touch the outer liner with the bright red! If you smear it, it will ruin the depth that was created with the darkest liner., To brighten up your lips, use your fingers or a brush to dab on a small amount of creme highlighter.Simply dab this into the center part of your bottom lip.


Alternatively, if you don’t own a creme highlighter, you can also use a small dab of vaseline.

, Using either a light red or clear lip balm, gently dab a small amount all over your lips to add moisture.,"
"
Get laser treatment.,
Try other light sources.,
Consider radio frequency treatment.,
Go with Botox.,
Try derm- or microdermabrasion.,
Get a chemical peel.",How to Tone Sagging Skin2," There are a variety of skin “resurfacing” procedures that will remove wrinkles and tone your skin. In these, light or radio frequency sources destroy the outer layer of skin (the epidermis) and heat the underlying layer (the dermis), stimulating new collagen growth. The skin then heals and comes back younger-looking and tighter than before.Laser treatment is often “ablative,” which means that it causes wounds. The laser will either remove skin precisely, layer by layer, or destroy the top layers altogether.
Ablative laser treatment may take several months of healing and carry the risk of scars. However, it can also reduce the likelihood of changes in skin pigmentation.

, There are also “non-ablative” skin treatments that use light, but not normal lasers. These include intense pulsed light (IPL), infrared lasers, and phototherapy. Non-ablative procedures take less time to heal and have fewer risks. However, they also offer subtler results.IPL can target pigment on your skin to remove blemishes or discoloration, for example.
Infrared and other non-ablative lasers can also resurface the skin, promoting new and healthier skin to grow.
Keep in mind that you may need to repeat non-ablative procedures more often than ablative ones.

, Still another option is radio frequency skin tightening. This procedure uses electromagnetic wave frequencies to heat your skin, stimulating new tissue and collagen growth and reducing the appearance of wrinkles. Ideally, it will tone your skin.Some treatments use a mix of radio frequency and light source energies, like Syneron. This is a non-invasive therapy that can improve fine lines but also blemishes, redness, and the appearance of small veins.

, Botox is made from a form of the botulinum toxin and is an injectable, FDA approved filler for wrinkles and facial lines. It can also treat crows feet, forehead creases, wrinkling of the chest, and sagging bands of skin on the neck for a smoother, younger look.Consult with a dermatologist or cosmetic surgeon about whether you are a candidate for Botox injections. It is usually safe for men and women aged 18 to 70 years old.
Botox works fast. You should notice results within 5 to 7 days after the injection, which will last several months. Botox is also minimally invasive.
Be aware of side effects, though. Some patients report headaches, temporary numbness at the injection site, and nausea. Also, you may have less range of expression because Botox works by stopping muscles from contracting.

, Both of these treatments involve “planing” and removing top layers of skin with a rotating brush, letting the underlying layer grow up in its place and resulting in smoother, tighter skin. Like ablative and non-ablative laser treatments, abrasions can be more or less aggressive.Talk to your dermatologist about dermabrasion. This procedure is more aggressive and will yield better results. However, you should expect to have redness and maybe scabbing that can last for several weeks. Pinkness can linger for a few months.
Microdermabrasion only targets the very top layer of skin. You won’t see as much irritation, but you’ll also have to repeat the procedure several times to see results – as many as 16 times. The benefits are more modest and temporary.

, During a chemical peel, a doctor will apply a mild acid to your skin to remove the top layers. This burning should remove scars and blemishes but also wrinkles, and will rejuvenate the skin. The peel stimulates new skin cells to grow, tightening the skin and making it look fresher.You can get chemical peels on certain areas of your face, forehead, hands, and chest. You may also need a series of peels.
Expect to need about 5 to 7 days to heal from the peel. You may notice redness and irritation, as if your skin is sunburned.

Get your tummy tucked.,
Consider a facelift.,
Do a body lift.",How to Tone Sagging Skin3," Many people are self-conscious about sagging skin on the abdomen, which can be pronounced after pregnancies or weight loss. A tummy tuck is a surgical procedure that can tighten this skin. The cosmetic surgeon will remove excess fat and skin to create a smoother, tauter profile.Talk to a doctor about whether you qualify. Usually, patients should be in good health, non-smokers, and have realistic expectations. Also, be sure to discuss the surgery itself and possible complications.
Know that a tummy tuck is a major operation. It takes about 3 to 5 hours and you will be put under general anesthesia.
Expect a long and potentially painful recovery, as well. Swelling and inflammation is common and you may need several weeks or even months to see the final results.
Other risks include bleeding, infection, scarring or skin loss, asymmetry, or nerve damage.

, Like a tummy tuck, a facelift will tighten the skin on your face and neck and reduce sagging and other signs of visible aging. However, like a tummy tuck again, it is also a major surgical procedure with benefits and risks. Talk to your doctor about these and seriously consider them.Candidates for face lifts usually have sagging in the mid-face, drooping eyelids, deep creases between the nose and lower mouth, or loose fatty deposits in the jowls or under the chin and jaw.
Again, talk to your doctor to see if your qualify and are healthy enough for the procedure.
Be aware, too, that a facelift is an operation. The surgeon will make an incision along your hairline near the ear, tighten the skin, and remove excess skin and fat. It takes several hours.
You should also expect a lengthy recovery. Results can be long-lasting, but it may take weeks or even months for swelling to subside and incision scars to lighten.

, Body lifts are usually for people who have lost significant amounts of weight in a fairly short time, often from bariatric surgery or exercise and dieting. They treat sagging skin and tissue in the abdomen, thighs, waist, and buttocks. Surgeons can do this full lower body lift in a single procedure.Make sure that you are able to undergo the operation. Your doctor will advise you on the requirements. For example, your weight must be stable for at least a year. Women considering having children may want to postpone the operation, too.
Patients should also be non-smokers, healthy, and have realistic expectations.
You can expect the surgery to remove folds of excess tissue and tighten up skin in your lower body. The surgeon may also recommend liposuction to get rid of excess fat.
During this major operation, you’ll be under general anesthetic for several hours and have to stay in a hospital for a number of days.
Know that recovery time varies widely. It may take months for pain and swelling to subside, and your usually activities will be limited for four to six weeks or more.

, You can also use soap-free cleansers as well. Consider mild cleansers that contain jojoba or avocado oil. Both of these ingredients are very moisturizing.

, Once you step out of your bath or shower, pat yourself dry for no more than 20 seconds. Apply a thick moisturizer onto your skin to help seal in the moisture.You can use a store bought moisturizer, or a natural one, such as shea butter or coconut oil.


When using moisturizers on your face, make sure that they are labeled for facial use.
Consider products that contain vitamins A and E.
Consider products that contain ceramides. These will help replenish the outer layer of your skin and lock in moisture.

, When choosing scrubs or peels, look for something that is labeled as gentle, moisturizing, or for dry skin. Avoid products that contain harsh, abrasive particles. When using the scrub or exfoliater, massage your skin gently and don't apply too much pressure.


Most scrubs are oil-based and do not require a moisturizer afterwards.
Don't use scrubs and exfoliators everyday. Limit yourself to twice a week, at the most., This especially applies to toners, peels, and astringents. Alcohol can be very drying on skin. You may also want to consider avoiding products that contain mineral oil, colorings, preservatives, and perfumes. All of these can be irritating to sensitive skin and lead to dryness.

, Use a sunscreen that has at least SPF 30, and wear long sleeves. Hats should have at least a 2 inch (5.08 centimeters) wide brim, so that they cover your neck and face.Sun gives your skin beneficial vitamin D, but too much sun can cause your skin to become dry.

It can be found not only in oranges, but also in berries and many tropical fruits. It is also abundant in dark, leafy green vegetables.A lack of magnesium often results in dry skin. If nothing seems to help, your body might just need more magnesium. You can find it in dark, leafy green vegetables, nuts, and fish. It is also found in grains and beans.
Other foods reputed to help dry skin include: avocados, cucumbers, olive oil, oysters, and sweet potatoes."

Conceal blemishes and apply foundation.,
#* Conceal your under-eye circles too to brighten your eyes and face.,
Apply peach or nude-colored eye shadow.,
Do your bushy brows.,
Add some blush.,
Lastly, decorate your lips.",How to Do Joseon Makeup (Korean Traditional Makeup)," Korean women have blemish-free faces (most of them) with a porcelain finish. This requires a lot of maintenance and even cosmetic alterations to achieve clear skin.


Before creating the look, conceal any blemishes, pimples, or marks in your skin using a concealer.
Use a yellow concealer for more stubborn spots. For redness or acne, dab a green concealer first, then top off with the skin-toned concealer.
When you apply it, use a concealing brush. If you're going to use your fingers, do not rub on the concealer; make light and gentle taps instead until the concealer sets evenly.;
,

After your concealing session, dampen a makeup sponge, rub on the foundation powder, and dab on skin. Moistening the applicator helps the foundation powder give you a no-cakey look which lasts for hours.
If you want to exactly copy the traditional way of applying foundation, you can simply use a light powder, but that won't work much in controlling sebum or giving you porcelain texture. You will know when everything is done when your pores are hardly/slightly visible now, and when your blemishes have faded for about 60%-80%. Too much application can give you an unnatural appearance which is a big no-no in traditional makeup routines.

,


Prepare a black/dark brown eyeliner. Whether it be gel, pencil, or cream liner, as long as it is edible, then it is good.
Choose a non-smudging liner to prevent a huge mess around the eyes.
First, dampen the sponge applicator before applying a neutral-colored shadow along the crease of your eye.
Do not put beyond the crease or you will be ruining your intended no-makeup look.
Afterwards, tightline your upper lids. Make the line as close as possible to the eyelashes.
If you want to intensify your eyes, you can make the winged-style eye lining, where the line exceeds the corner of the eye to lengthen and narrow the eye shape.
Draw a thin white line below your lower lids (use a neutral/white/peach eye shadow or simply a white eyeliner to do this). This brightens your eyes so your upper lids are emphasized.
After finishing applying eyeliner, use a clear mascara on the lower and upper lashes, then curl them.

, Bushy brows are a trend in Korea! Even in the Joseon era, if you notice photographs of real Joseon people or Joseon queens/princesses (well, not all. If you look at Queen Min's photo, her eyebrows are thin), they have bushy eyebrows which give them a youthful, innocent look.


Grab an eyebrow powder applicator (You can use a little brush if there is none), dip into a dark brown eye shadow, and sweep lightly over the inward end of the brows. Do not move across the whole brow. The objective here is to fill in the gaps between the hairs to saturate the natural thickness and curve of your brows.
If you have thin brows that make it impossible to create a bushy look, just define the curves and make the color a little darker. Overshadowing the brows robs you of a natural appearance; it makes you look like a constipated queen.

, Joseon women also blushed their cheeks. They used dried persimmons to color them. A tinge of orange or light brown blush does the trick, but to use darker shades ruin the picture. The blush should only be around the center of the cheeks, not the whole cheekbones.


Do not brush across the side of your face.
Do a circular motion around the center of your cheeks while you blush.

, Before putting any lip color, use a clear lip balm to soften and moisturize your lips.


If you wish to sport a sterner look, use a brown/nude matte lipstick.
Never go for glossy shades!
Use a tinted lip balm to complete it. Tinted ones look best in keeping a neutral and youthful glow.

, If you choose, you can add some color to your lips. A pale pink, or, if you would like, a dark red. If you do not want to add any color, your white makeup should cover your lips. (Only the parts where you would apply lip balm or lipstick.)

Use foundation that matches your skin tone, or is just one shade lighter.
Feel free to apply foundation makeup a little thicker than you would normally, as the doll look features a porcelain or plastic face that is unlike natural skin.
Add concealer to any blemishes, red patches, or dark circles under the eyes so that your face color is completely even.;
, Set your foundation with a translucent powder or a shade that matches your skin tone and foundation.









Use a wide powder brush or sponge to press powder onto the face lightly.Try a powder that has some shimmer to it for a slightly shiny plastic or porcelain look.

, Use a pink or peach hued blush at the base of your cheeks using a blush brush or your fingers.









Keep the blush purposely heavy, or in a distinct circle shape, for a more dramatic doll look.
Add a highlighter to the top outer edge of your cheekbones to make them more rounded and full-looking., Apply a neutral eyeshadow in a shade that is darker than your skin tone to the outer corner of the eye, forming a V shape that extends into the crease of the top lid and along the bottom lid under the lashes.









Don’t go past about the middle of the eye on top and bottom with your darker eyeshadow.
Leave a small gap between your lower lashline and where you apply your darker shadow to make your eyes appear larger., Use a lighter shade than the shadow for the outer corners for use on the top lid.









Blend the two shadow colors together with a small, soft blending brush.
Add an even lighter white or cream shade to the inner corner of the eye and just below the eyebrow to open the eyes up.

, Line the top lid of your eye with a brown or black eyeliner pencil or liquid liner.









Keep the eyeliner thinner or nonexistent toward the center of your eye, and not as wide at the outer corner as well if you want your eyes to appear rounder as doll eyes often are.Don’t line your bottom lashes, or only apply a thin line from the middle to the outer corner.
Use a white eyeliner pencil on your water line (the wet inner section between your lower lashes and your eyeball) in the inner and outer corners to achieve an effect of a larger eye., Apply mascara liberally to your upper and lower lashes. Press on false eyelashes as close to your natural lash line as possible if you want more dramatic and full lashes.









Find false lashes for the lower lid to add length and volume to them as well. You may need to use false lashes that you can apply individually or in small sections.
Make sure whatever false lashes you use have extra length and volume at the outer edges to continue to accentuate the roundness and size of your eyes.

, Use eyeliner or a dark eyeshadow with a very thin brush to apply your own long and exaggerated lashes to the top and








Use the natural curve and direction of your own eyelashes to guide you to draw longer lines away from the lashline. Again, try to make more or longer lines toward the outside of the eye to accentuate the size.
Use this method in addition to false lashes, or if you can’t use false lashes, for extra length and an intentionally artificial and exaggerated look that mimics doll eyelashes.

, Use an eyebrow pencil or eyeshadow in a color similar to your natural brows to gently fill in and define the shape.









Use small, light strokes to create more natural “hairs” to fill in the brow.If you want to, you can also draw distinct edges on your brows to create the perfect curve or arch shape of a doll’s brows.

, Use cosmetic contact lenses to make the pupils and irises of your eyes appear larger and/or more colorful.


Try blue contacts for a popular doll eye color that will also help your eyes appear even larger due to the light color.
You should not use cosmetic contact lenses if you are already wearing prescription contact lenses, or if they irritate your eyes.

, Use a pink, peach, or red lip liner to line your lips, creating a more exaggerated heart shape by defining two rounded curves on the top lip.









For an even more exaggerated heart shape, try covering the outer corners of your lips with the same foundation or powder shade that you used for the rest of your face, effectively making the corners “disappear.”
Feel free to draw outside your natural lip line to alter the shape slightly or simply make them a bit larger.

, Fill in both lips with lipstick or a lip pencil in the same color as the liner you used.









Add a little highlight to the middle of the bottom lip using a light color eyeshadow or highlighter pencil to create the illusion of shine., Create the shiny finish of doll lips by going over the color with a high-shine lip gloss.









Use a transparent gloss, or one in a similar color as your lipstick.
Make sure to reapply your highlighter if you used some on the bottom lip, or avoid obscuring it by sticking to a transparent gloss and not smudging the color too much.

Pat dark brown foundation on your lips.",How to Do Black Swan Makeup," The best way to do this is with white face paint, however very light pressed powder will work as well. Nina’s face is ghostly white in the film, so whitening the face is extremely important. To apply the face paint, use a sponge or a large foundation brush. Make sure to cover your entire face, taking care to make it even around your hairline. Don’t forget to do your eyelids, your ears, and your neck.As you bring the white face paint down your neck, begin applying it more lightly so that it gradually fades into your natural skin color. This will look much less harsh than an abrupt border between the white paint and your skin.;
, You should use the lightest foundation you can find. Use a large fluffy brush so that you don’t brush off patches of the face paint. The foundation will set the face paint and even out any streaks or splotches. When you’ve finished with the foundation, grab a white eye shadow and do the same thing. The white shadow will make the white color extremely intense, opaque, and matte.Using a powder over the face paint will help to ensure your eye makeup will not rub off easily. It creates a nice base for the rest of your makeup.

, A taupe-colored bronzer works best. This will enhance your cheek bones. Nina’s face in the film is very gaunt, which makes her makeup all the more striking. By brushing your cheekbones with a bronzer they will pop, especially against your stark white face. Blend the bronzer from the apples of your cheeks diagonally to your temples., Use a waterproof black eyeliner pencil or a liquid eyeliner for this step. It’s tremendously helpful to look at a picture of Nina’s Black Swan makeup as you do this. The outline of the wing should have a sharp point at the inner bridge of your nose, then curve upwards along the natural top border of your eyebrow. The bottom border will curve from the inner nose point along the bottom of the eye, like thick bottom eyeliner. The wings should fan out from the outer corners of your eyes, with a jagged border.It’s ok if your outline isn’t perfect. The idea of the eye makeup is to look like wings of a Black Swan, so a little bit of smudging will just give the wings a more feathered look.

, You can fill it in first with your black eyeliner, then brush black eye shadow on top. The eyeliner will make the black opaque, while the black eye shadow will set it. The easiest way to do this is to paint black liquid eyeliner within the outline, and then use a small eye shadow brush to go over it with the shadow., Don’t worry about being too precise on this step, because these lines should be wavy and uneven. To make the white lines stand out even more from the black wings, dip an eye shadow brush into your white face paint and paint this over the white eyeliner. Do this as many times as you need to give the wings the intense feathered look that Nina’s had.


You can also apply the white eyeliner on your bottom waterline. This will help to make your eyes appear brighter against the intense black.If you choose, you can accentuate the lines with some sparkly silver eye shadow to make the look even more dramatic.

, Use your finger to apply it lightly, dabbing it on top of the design you've created. Nina’s eye makeup had hints of green in it, so lightly patting green eye shadow is the final touch. It doesn’t need to be dark— simply apply enough so that hints of green will sparkle when you move your head or stand in the right light!, Nina didn’t have dramatic lashes, but this step can make your eyes pop even more. Applying a few coats of mascara will open your eye up fully and make it appear bigger within the mass of black eye shadow around it. Add a layer of mascara, let it dry, and then apply another coat. Focus the mascara on the outer lashes to really open the eye., Use a dark burgundy color. Using a lip liner will help your lipstick last longer, so it’s particularly important for this look. Nina had perfectly bold lips, so you don’t want your lipstick wearing off quickly. Make sure your lip liner is sharp, and begin lining in the center of your top lip, then the center of your bottom lip. Carefully bring the lip liner to a point on either side of your mouth., For this look, the best shade is a dark burgundy or wine color with hints of brown. Fill in the lined lips completely and blot.Don’t forget to bring the lipstick with you wherever you go, because you will probably need to reapply your lipstick throughout the evening if you are eating or drinking.

, This will ensure the lips stay dark. This step is optional, but it will definitely make the lip color more durable. Take a makeup applicator sponge and press it lightly into the dark powder. Firmly press it onto your lips. The dark lipstick will still show through, but the pressed powder will help it stay put."

Spritz your face with a setting spray.",How to Minimize Pores With Foundation," When your pores are clogged with dirt, they are going to appear larger. Before applying any makeup, use a gentle cleanser to remove any dirt or oil from your skin.For best results, choose an oil-free cleanser.
When you’re rinsing your face after washing, use cool or cold water. It will help keep your pores from producing excess oil so they don’t appear as large.;
, Dead skin cells can clog your pores and make them appear larger. After washing your face, massage a facial scrub over your skin in circular motions to gently exfoliate and smooth your skin to ready it for foundation.To keep your pores clear, exfoliate two to three times a week.
You can make your own natural exfoliating scrub by mixing three parts baking soda with one part water.Don’t use your baking soda scrub more than once a week.

, Salicylic acid is an important ingredient when you want to make your pores appear smaller. It helps slough off dead skin cells from inside the pore lining so pores appear smaller. Smooth a salicylic acid-based serum or moisturizer over your face to keep your pores clear and moisturize your skin at the same time.A serum is best for extremely oily skin. A lightweight moisturizer is best for combination or normal skin.
Be sure to choose an oil-free, non-comedogenic serum or moisturizer to prevent clogged pores.

, Even if you’ve washed, exfoliated, and moisturized your face, your pores may still look large. Applying a silicone-based foundation primer can fill in your pores, so they aren’t as noticeable and you have a smooth canvas to apply your foundation over.Apply your primer with clean fingers so you can be sure to really work it into your pores.
Opt for an oil-free, mattifying primer to keep your pores looking small all day.
Check the label on your primer to make sure it is designed to minimize pores.

, Any makeup that has a dewy or luminous finish calls attention to the texture of your skin, including large pores. Make your pores appear smaller by using a matte foundation that won’t reflect light and highlight your pores.Matte foundation also keeps the skin from looking shiny throughout the day, so your pores will stay minimized.
Opt for a matte foundation that’s oil-free and non-comedogenic so your pores stay as clear as possible.

, Brushing or smoothing foundation over enlarged pores usually causes the makeup to catch in them and emphasize their size. Instead, press and buff the foundation into your skin in circular motions. Pressing fills in the pores, while buffing helps cover them for a minimized appearance.A full, dense foundation brush is ideal for pressing and buffing your makeup in. However, you can also use an egg-shaped sponge to apply your foundation in a similar manner. Wet the sponge and wring it out before using it, though, so it doesn’t absorb too much of your makeup.

, Once you’ve applied the foundation, you want to set it so your pores stay minimized all day. Use a powder puff to press and roll a translucent setting powder over your face. It will fill in any pores that your primer and foundation haven’t covered and keep your face from getting shiny.Loose powder typically works best for pressing and rolling into the skin. Pressed powder can look cakey.

, Even if you apply a setting powder, there may still be some shine or excess makeup on your face that emphasizes your pores. Minimize their appearance by pressing blotting papers over your face. They’ll soak up excess oil and emollients from the surface of your skin without disrupting your makeup.


If you don’t have blotting papers, take a tissue and pull it apart so you have a single layer. Gently press it over your face to blot.

, When you’re happy with how your foundation looks, it’s a good idea to apply a setting spray. Not only will it lock your makeup in place all day, it will remove any powderiness or cakiness that might occur if you use too much foundation and powder.To use the spray, hold the bottle out at arm’s length, and spritz it several times over your entire face.
Different setting sprays are made for different skin types (oily, dry, or combination). Make sure you pick a setting spray that is right for your skin.

",How to Contour Cheekbones with MAC Sculpt and Shape Powder," Apply whatever face base you want to use- try to keep it natural, as the contouring can look quite made up if done in a certain way. If you want to use blush, apply it only to the apples of your cheeks.;
, Put the highlighter on areas of your face that you want to bring forwards and bronzer on the areas of your face that you do not want to bring attention to. I will tell you how to contour- not bronze - your face with the powder, but you may want to alter some steps depending on your face shape.

, Which brush you use depends on the look you're going for- a smaller, more tightly packed brush will apply the pigment more heavily while a larger, fluffier brush will apply the products lightly and not be as precise, giving a more natural look.


You may want to use a smaller brush for highlighter and a larger one for bronzer, simply because of the respective areas each product is used on- or different sized brushes to contour different areas of your face.

, Swirl your brush in the bronzer section of the Sculpt and Shape palette. Swipe the bronzer down both sides of your nose bridge, knock off any excess product, and use circular buffing motions to blend. Don't blend the product away, but blend enough so that it does not look too unnatural.


Then, sweeping a clean brush through the highlighter, swipe the light shade straight down the bridge of your nose in a fluid movement.
Knock off any excess product and lightly blend- you don't want the highlighter too out of place. And done! You have used the bronzer to create the illusion of shadows on the sides of your nose, and brought forward the center- giving yourself the appearance of a thinner nose bridge.

, Start with the bronzer. Making a fish or kissing face, observe where the natural hollows below your cheekbones are.


Using your brush, apply bronzer to the hollows and slightly above for more definition. Blend with a clean brush- blend more for a more natural look and only blend lightly for a more defined look.
Then, using a bronzer-free brush, sweep the highlighter along the tops of your cheekbones. You can also highlight around the apples of your cheeks so that the light will hit when you smile. Blend- but not too much.
If highlighter gets too misplaced, it loses it's effect. And there you have the appearance of higher, more prominent cheekbones.

, Sweep the bronzer along your jawline to give it a softer, more rounded look. Blend down your neck so it doesn't look like your foundation is too dark or like you're wearing excessive makeup.

, Using a large brush, buff bronzer onto your temples and up onto the sides of your forehead. Blend lightly down the sides of your face. Put highlighter on the center of your forehead and on the center of your chin. Bring lips forwards by using a small brush to outline them with the highlighter. And your finished!

Don't touch your face during the day.",How to Make Your Concealer Last," Clean your face before you put on makeup in the morning, and wash your face at night to remove your makeup before bed. Long lasting makeup starts with clean skin. Use a cleanser that is appropriate for your skin type (dry, oily, combination, etc.) to remove all of the oils and impurities that can cause your face to look dull or break out., Adding toner to your skincare regiment is a great way to even out your skin tone and eliminate any blemishes or breakouts. Apply toner with a cotton ball after cleansing your face. Gently wipe the toner cotton ball all over your face, avoiding your eyes.Some toners are better for oily skin, and some are better for dry skin. Make sure to get a toner that works best for your skin type.

, Using a moisturizer is a must when it comes to skincare and makeup. Apply a good moisturizer to your face after you've washed and toned your face. Squirt a nickel sized amount of moisturizer onto your finger tips, and gently rub it on your face.You should moisturize in the morning before you out on makeup and at night before bed.
Pick the right moisturizer for you. Some moisturizers are best for dry skin, and others are best for oily skin.
Many moisturizers contain SPF for skin protection against the sun. Try to use a moisturizer with an SPF during the day, as this is another way to protect your skin.

, Primer is a base foundation for the rest of your makeup. When applied, it will help your makeup to appear smoother and last longer. To apply primer, you can use your fingertips or a brush. Use a dime sized amount, and rub it into your skin.


Primer can also be used as a lighter form of foundation. If you like a natural look, use primer as your foundation, and use concealer to fix up any problem areas., There are tons of makeup brands, and each brand has tons of different concealers. If you're looking for long-lasting concealer, look for that wording on the packaging. If you need help, look online for long-lasting concealers or ask a professional in a beauty store.

, Stick concealers come in swivel-up tubes – similar to lipstick. Stick concealers are best used to provide coverage for dark circles under your eyes. They are usually extremely thick concealers, so you'll only need a little bit. Although they are usually inexpensive and easy to apply, stick concealers are typically too thick and heavy to cover up breakouts., This type of concealer usually comes in a squeeze tube, or a tube with a wand applicator. Liquid concealers sometimes have the tendency to settle in the creases under the eyes, especially if you have oily skin. This type of concealer is not a good choice for those with oily skin.

, Cream concealers usually come in small jars or squeeze tubes and provide medium to full coverage for dark under-eye circles and breakouts. Cream concealers have a good consistency to cover acne, making them the ideal concealer choice for those who tend to break out.

, These concealers usually come in compact cases. They are applies like a cream, but dry with a matte-powder finish. This type of concealer is good for those with oily skin, but not for those with acne or dry skin., To cover dark circles under your eyes or dark spots on your face, choose a concealer that is 1 shade lighter than your natural skin tone. If you want to cover acne, you should use a concealer that matches your natural skin tone. If you are covering your dark under-eye circles and breakouts, you should consider using two different types of concealer., When applying concealer, you can use your fingers or a small brush to blend it in – whichever you'd prefer. Put small dabs of concealer onto the area you'd like to cover, and blend in the dabs with your fingers or with your brush. Use small circular motions to blend in the concealer.









To apply concealer to your under-eye area, lightly dab concealer along the bags of your eyes and proceed to blend it in. Using your ring finger to blend in this area tends to work very well. If you're covering dark bags, you should get a concealer that is a shade lighter than your skin tone.To cover blemishes with concealer, lightly dab concealer on top and around of each blemish. Then, take your finger or a concealer blush, and blend in the concealer. Use a concealer that is the same color as your natural skin tone to cover acne.

If you're covering bright red acne, consider getting a concealer that has a yellow tint to it. This will help balance out the red.



, Some people apply foundation before concealer, but it's actually more effective the other way around. After you've applied concealer to all of your problem areas, use your finger tips or foundation brush to apply your foundation. Use circular motions to blend everything in so that it looks nice and smooth.








Choose the right foundation for you. Some foundations work better with dry skin, some work better with oily skin. Some foundations have a matte finish, while others have a dewy finish. When choosing a foundation, do some research or ask a professional to help you find the foundation that is right for you.

, Once you've applied your concealer and foundation, set your face makeup with some powder. This will help keep your makeup in place all day long and prevent your face from looking too shiny. Apply the powder with a large powder brush, and use circular motions for blending.









Whether you use setting powder, a tinted powder, or a foundation powder is up to you. If you want more coverage, use a foundation powder. If you want less coverage, use a setting powder., Touching your face throughout the day is never a good idea. When you touch your face, you're transferring the oil and dirt from your hands onto your face. This can cause your makeup to smudge and cause your face to break out.

Gather the ingredients.,
Melt shea butter in a small pan.,
Add your other ingredients.,
Put your lotion into a bowl or small container.,
Add zinc oxide to your moisturizer.,
Mix clay in your foundation.,
Add mica powder and cocoa powder.",How to Make Liquid Foundation1," If you want to truly create your liquid foundation from scratch, you’ll need about five ingredients to create your base and four to create your custom color. For your base lotion, you’ll need shea butter, emulsifying wax, argan oil, aloe, and witch hazel. For coverage and color, you'll need zinc oxide, cosmetic clay, mica powder, and cocoa powder.


You can find shea butter, argan oil, aloe, and witch hazel – an astringent – at your local pharmacy or beauty supply store. You may need to search a bit harder for the emulsifying wax, but can certainly order it from Amazon if you can’t find it locally.
You can find zinc oxide at your local pharmacy. You'll find cosmetic clays at natural beauty supply stores – a quick Google search will bring up several options. The easiest place to find mica powder is online. Cocoa powder can be found in any grocery store.;
, If you have one, a double boiler also works great for this step. Add one teaspoon (4.93 mL) of shea butter into the pan, and set your stovetop to low heat. This shouldn't take long at all, so don't step away.Continue stirring the shea butter as it begins to melt.

, Once the shea butter has melted, you'll need to throw in two teaspoons (9.86 mL) of argan oil and half a teaspoon (2.46 mL) of wax. Continuously stir your mixture as it warms and melts together. Once those have melted, add one tablespoon (14.79 mL) of the aloe and one teaspoon (4.93 mL) of the witch hazel.


Mix until everything is thoroughly blended, and remove from heat.

, You'll be adding the color ingredients next, so make sure there is plenty of room for mixing in this container. You may want to create your foundation in whatever container you’ll use for storage, like a small makeup container or cup. Just make sure that whatever container you use has a lid.

, Zinc oxide will add sun protection to your liquid foundation, which will help keep your skin healthy and wrinkle-free.Because the zinc is a pretty thick substance, it will ensure your liquid foundation provides the coverage you desire, concealing any blemishes. It will make your skin appear smooth and soft.


You may need to experiment a bit to find out how much zinc oxide you like in your recipe. Typically, it requires anywhere from one teaspoon (4.93 mL) to four teaspoons (19.72 mL)., While the word ""clay"" probably brings to mind images of modeling clay you used back in art class, there is actually powder cosmetic clay to use for recipes like these. However, this is an optional ingredient, and you don’t need much – about half a teaspoon (2.46 mL) will do the trick.These clays contain minerals that are healthy for your skin and absorb excess oil so they’re a great addition to your liquid foundation.Bentonite clay is the most popular clay to use, so as a beginner, you can start with that!

, These powders will provide the color and bronzing to your liquid foundation. This is where you can really customize your foundation to match your skin tone, so do this step slowly and carefully. Sprinkle in a bit of mica powder, then a bit of cocoa powder, stir, and test the color. Tweak as needed, and continue mixing until you’ve created a shade that matches your skin tone.Choose mica powder in gold and bronze to match your skin tone and create a beautiful glow.

",How to Create a Tinkerbell Inspired Makeup Look2,",,,, To make sure the shadow is the right shape, make sure it is going straight outwards (horizontally) from the middle of the eye, then coming down and slightly inwards towards the outer corner of the eye.

,,, The line should get thicker at the outer edge, and there should be a wing, or a flick, which makes the look more pixie-like.

,, Make sure the black or brown eyeliner is dry first, otherwise you will smudge it.

, it should stay on the top lid.

, If you wish, add fake eyelashes. The best way to apply these would be to cut a fake eyelash strip in half, or use individual eyelashes.

Purchase a moisturizer.,
Squirt your lotion into a container.,
Use a store-bought mineral powder.,
Stir until satisfied with the consistency.",How to Make Liquid Foundation2," If you aren’t interested, or don’t have the time, to make your own lotion, you can simply buy some.If you have a great facial lotion that you use religiously, stick with that one. It’s great to use one that you know won’t make you break out or cause any unfortunate side effects. If you don’t have a trusted moisturizer, head to your local pharmacy or beauty supply store to pick one up. A lotion with shea butter is great for your skin, and works well to make liquid foundation.If you aren’t sure which lotion to choose, make sure you buy the smallest available bottle. That way, you won’t waste money (or lotion) if you discover you don’t like it.

, It's simple to put it into whatever container you'll be storing your foundation in, so put it in anything with a tight lid. Make sure there is adequate room for mixing as well. Decide how much liquid foundation you want to make, and add that much lotion to the container. Just remember that if you add a lot of lotion, you'll need a lot of powder foundation as well.

, Feel free to use whatever powder you like. If you have a powder that matches your skin but simply prefer a liquid foundation, go ahead and combine it with the moisturizer to quickly turn it into a liquid.Picking the perfect powder for your skin tone can be tricky. If you've never purchased powder before, it might be smart to head to a cosmetic store or a beauty counter in a department store and ask a professional for help finding your shade.
If there is no one to ask for help, make sure you test the powder before buying it. The right shade should blend naturally on your jawline. Make sure that you check the color on yourself in natural light, because the bright lights of stores can be deceiving., Add one teaspoon (4.93 mL) and stir, another another, stir, and so on. Continue doing this until you've reached a color and consistency that you like for your liquid foundation. When the color and consistency look good to you, test it on your forehead to ensure you like the product you’ve created. The great thing about making your own product is that you can always tweak the ratios, make new batches, and find the recipe that works best for you.

Know the lead limits for color additives.,
Be wary of traditional eyeliners.,
Use progressive hair dyes cautiously, and only as intended.,
Weigh your options with lipstick.,
Don’t expect to find lead listed among the ingredients.,
Consult existing lists and databases.,
Contact the manufacturer.,
Test the product yourself.,
Recognize the dangers of lead.,
Don’t overreact to the situation.,
Look at both sides of the debate.,
Take practical steps to reduce lead exposure from cosmetics.",How to Know if Your Cosmetics Contain Lead," In the U.S., the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has limited authority to regulate cosmetics, but it can legally regulate color additives in cosmetics (as well as foods and drugs). Color additives require prior approval from the FDA before the products can legally be manufactured or sold in the U.S.Although there are some variations, the typical limit for lead in a color additive is 20 parts per million, which is well within recognized safe parameters under normal use. A listing of FDA-permitted color additives is available at http://www.fda.gov/Cosmetics/Labeling/IngredientNames/ucm109084.htm.;
, Eyeliners known by names including kohl, kajal, and surma have long been popular in many parts of the world, and occasionally appear for sale in the U.S. However, these eyeliners contain high amounts of lead and are not approved for sale or use in the U.S.The danger of these products is real — they have been linked to cases of lead poisoning in children.
These eyeliners are on an FDA “import alert,” meaning they can be seized by FDA field personnel to prevent sale or distribution., Most hair dye products, and especially progressive hair dyes that darken hair color over time, use color additives that are subject to FDA approval. They typically contain lead acetate, and are permitted by the FDA to have much higher concentrations of lead than is typically allowed for color additives.The FDA contends that, when used as intended, the elevated lead content in these products is not a health concern because the product does not enter the body. However, the products must contain this special label on the packaging:

""Caution: Contains lead acetate. For external use only. Keep this product out of children's reach. Do not use on cut or abraded scalp. If skin irritation develops, discontinue use. Do not use to color mustaches, eyelashes, eyebrows, or hair on parts of the body other than the scalp. Do not get in eyes. Follow instructions carefully and wash hands thoroughly after use.""



, Lipstick is the most common cause for concern about lead in cosmetics, as emails, news stories, and press releases about lead in lipstick seem to make the rounds in waves every several years.The FDA has done substantial testing and is not concerned with the findings. However, it did find lead in virtually every lipstick tested.
The other sections of this article contain more information on lead content in lipstick. Practically speaking, however, the darker (especially red) your lipstick is, the more likely it is to have greater amounts of lead in the pigments., Your lipstick can contain lead without noting it on the package ingredients because lead is not considered an ingredient. That is, manufacturers don’t purposely add lead as part of the manufacturing process. Instead, lead is considered a “contaminant” that is present in trace amounts in the base materials and pigments that constitute the product.In the U.S., the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) actually has quite limited authority in regards to identifying and banning substances such as lead from cosmetics. And, in any case, the FDA has studied the matter and determined that the amount of lead in cosmetics is not a health concern., When the FDA addressed the topic of lead in cosmetics in 2010, it authorized detailed testing of 400 different products. The bad news, if you are worried about any amount of lead in your cosmetics (even if the FDA isn’t), is that each and every product showed traces of the element. The good news is that the entire results list for those 400 products is available online.You can also look for lists and searchable databases maintained primarily by organizations that are working to eliminate lead and other potential toxins from consumer products.Remember that cosmetics formulations change regularly and without warning, so the list of eleven (out of 33 products) that passed muster during testing by the Campaign for Safe Cosmetics in 2007 is probably no longer accurate. Seek out up-to-date information whenever possible., Even if your cosmetics manufacturer is not required to list trace amounts of lead in its products, it may have conducted testing (or be aware of testing results) that determined any lead content. They don’t have to disclose this information to you, either, but it can’t hurt to ask.Increasing numbers of cosmetics companies are proud to advertise that their products are “lead-free,” but again there is no clear definition of that term. Does any trace amount of lead count? How much testing must be done? Who did the testing? You can feel more confident about choosing products that are advertised as lead-free, but you can’t be completely certain due to the lack of established, common standards.

, If you really want to be certain whether your favorite lipstick or face cream contains lead, the most accurate results will come from sending the product to a laboratory that can do detailed testing. There are actually laboratories that advertise for this service, so some people must be utilizing it.You can also purchase at-home testing kits from various sources, although the accuracy cannot be guaranteed.There is also a simple at-home method that may or may not be useful (depending upon who you ask). It involves smearing your chosen product onto a clean surface, then thoroughly rubbing a piece of gold, copper, pewter, or silver on it. Supposedly, the presence of lead will cause the product to discolor with darker streaks or smears. Again, the effectiveness of this method has not been confirmed.

, Lead is an element that has served useful purposes from plumbing to paint and beyond for centuries, but the dangers of excessive lead levels in the body have become apparent in recent decades. Lead is a neurotoxin that can cause behavioral, developmental, and learning difficulties. It is therefore particularly dangerous for children and their developing brains.See the handout created by an agency of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (available at http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/ToxProfiles/tp13-c1-b.pdf) for detailed information about lead, how it enters the body, how it impacts the body, and how to limit exposure.

, Yes, 400 out of 400 cosmetics tested by the FDA in 2010 contained lead (and a separate major study also got a 100% result). And yes, lead is a toxic substance. That said, among the most likely sources for dangerous levels of lead exposure, your cosmetics are pretty low on the list. Continuing to use cosmetics is unlikely to significantly alter the amount of lead in your body, and pitching all your cosmetics will not protect you from possible lead exposure from more likely sources.You are more likely to be exposed to higher levels of lead by way of water carried through old pipes, houses built before 1978 with flaking paint, and airborne dust near industrial sites, to name some examples.Often with good intentions, some individuals and groups have resorted to scare tactics in order to advocate for the removal of all traces of lead from cosmetics. You may have gotten emails before that say cosmetics companies intentionally use lead because it lowers their costs, and that lead causes cancer.
In reality, most lead in cosmetics occurs as a natural contaminant, and the possible links between lead exposure and certain cancers are still unclear., On one hand, then, you have organizations like the FDA that state that the small amounts of lead found in cosmetics are of no real health concern. On the other hand, you have advocacy groups and some researchers who focus on the fact that lead is a toxic substance, and say that it should be avoided in any amount whenever possible.


Advocates against lead in cosmetics believe that the FDA does not adequately factor in the cumulative impact of reapplying a product like lipstick several times per day, every day. This cumulative buildup, they contend, can push lead intake above the daily “safe” threshold, especially for children.There is, unfortunately, no clear consensus about the impact of lead in cosmetics.

, The amount of lead in your lipstick is probably not an issue that should cause you sleepless nights. That said, if you can find cosmetics products that work for you and don’t contain lead, then perhaps it is your best option to choose them. Consider also:Limiting the use of cosmetics by children, especially when it comes to reapplying lipstick or other lip products.
Reapplying lipstick or lip products yourself only as necessary, and ideally not more than a handful of times per day.
Choosing lighter shades of lipstick and makeup, which tend to have less lead in them.
Seeking out lead-free products and/or testing your cosmetics for lead, as discussed elsewhere in this article.

Understand your undertone.,
Determine your undertone.,
Know the best foundation for your skin type.,
Use your skin to narrow down your choices.,
Choose a makeup store, pharmacy, or department store.,
Test a few shades.,
Choose your foundation.,
Lighten foundation that’s too dark.,
Darken foundation that’s too light.,
Change the color of your foundation.",How to Find the Best Foundation Color Shade for You," Before trying to choose a foundation, it’s best to determine a few things about your skin, such as your undertone. While the surface of your skin can change color because of many things, such as exposure to the elements or acne, your undertone will always stay the same.Therefore, determining your undertone will help you choose the right foundation color. In general, people fall into one of three undertones:Cool, which means your skin is more blue, red, or pink.
Warm, which means your skin is more golden, yellow, or peach.
Neutral, which means your skin will have a combination of cool and warm colors.;
, There are a few tests you can use to determine if your undertone is warm, cool, or neutral. The tests involve assessing your hair and eye color, what colors you look best in, how you react to the sun, and the color of your veins.


Naturally black, brown, or blonde hair combined with green, grey, or blue eyes is an indication of a cool undertone. Hazel, brown, or amber eyes combined with naturally black, auburn, or strawberry blonde hair indicates a warm undertone.Silver jewelry will look best on you if your undertone is cool; gold jewelry will look best on you if your undertone is warm; someone with a neutral undertone will look equally good in both silver and gold.People who are cool will tend to turn pink or burn easily in the sun, while people who are warm will bronze or tan in the sun.
Blue veins on the inner wrist indicate cool; green veins indicate warm; bluish-green indicates neutral., While knowing if you have dry or oily skin won’t help you pick a foundation shade, it will help you choose the right type of foundation. Skin can be oily, dry, or combination, and you can have normal or sensitive skin.


Choose a matte finish or oil-free liquid or powder foundation if you have oily skin.
Choose a moisturizing or hydrating cream or stick foundation if you have dry skin.
Choose a hypoallergenic and scent-free foundation if you have sensitive skin.
Choose a powder foundation if you have combination skin.Choose a foundation that offers full or medium coverage if you have an uneven complexion and want to cover most of your skin. Otherwise, look for a foundation that offers partial or sheer coverage if you have a fairly even complexion and want a more natural look.
It’s always a good idea to buy foundation that has an SPF, because this will provide a small measure of protection against damaging UVA and UVB rays.

, You already know what to look for in a foundation based on your skin type, and now it’s time to use the knowledge you’ve gained about your undertone to select some possible shade choices. Before heading to the pharmacy or makeup store, consider what foundation bases and shades will look best based on your undertone.


For cool undertones: choose a foundation with a rose, red, or blue base, and consider shades like cocoa, rose, sable, and porcelain.
For warm undertones: choose a foundation with a gold or yellow base, and consider shades like caramel, golden, tan, chestnut, and beige.
For neutral undertones: consider shades like buff, nude, ivory, or praline., When buying your foundation, look for a store that offers support from beauty experts who can help you choose the right shade and foundation. If that’s not available, look for a shop that has in-store testers so that you can determine the right shade for yourself before you buy. As a last resort, choose a store that has a return policy on cosmetics in case you buy the wrong one.

, Use the information about the best shades for your undertone and select some foundations to try out. Going by eye, choose a few shades that look closest to your skin tone. Then, test them by dabbing some swatches of foundation on your jawline. The skin at your jawline will be truer to your natural undertone and give you an idea of how the foundation will look against your neck.


If the store doesn’t offer testers, hold the bottles of foundation up to your neck and jawline.
Whether you are using testers or just holding bottles up to your skin, find a door or window to see what the foundation shades will look like in natural light.This will also give the foundation some time to dry so that you know what it will look like all the time.

, The best foundation is the one that disappears into your skin. Foundation isn’t supposed to be seen: it’s supposed to provide an even canvas on which to work. Use the swatches on your jawline to determine which foundation blends in best with your skin. This is the foundation shade that will best cover blemishes and redness while still looking natural.Consider purchasing a few shades at once so that you can try them out at home and compare them, especially if your shop doesn’t have testers available., Whether you bought the wrong one and can’t return it or you’re still finishing an older bottle, you can customize the color of your foundation to create a better match for your skin. One way to make foundation lighter is by applying it with a wet sponge instead of your fingers. You can also make foundation lighter by mixing it with:Moisturizer
Primer
A lighter foundation
Concealer or finishing powder

, Just as you can lighten foundation that’s too dark, so too can you make a foundation darker if it’s too light for your skin. To make foundation darker, try: Adding blush or concealer
Mixing it with bronzer
Combining it with a darker foundation or tinted moisturizer

, Foundation that isn’t right for your undertone can be customized as well. To make your foundation match a yellow undertone, add turmeric. Add a pinkish-brown blush to match a more pink or blue undertone. To make a foundation more brown, add cocoa powder.

Start off with a clean face.,
Apply foundation.,
If you have any more imperfections visible, cover them up with a high-quality concealer that is slightly lighter than your skin and blend well.This will give your face the perfection that you want.Blend with your ring finger or your cosmetic wedge.

,
Select a vibrant shade of cream blush.,
Bring forward the eyes.,
Heat your eyelash curler with a hairdryer for about thirty seconds, and then curl your lashes.,
Choose a long-lasting, moisturizing lipstick in a shade that will contrast your skin and is in the same family as your blush.,
Apply lipgloss for a nice shine.,
Use clear mascara or brow wax to keep your brows in place.,
The finishing touch is to powder your face again.,
Wear it with confidence.",How to Apply Versatile Makeup," Cleanse and moisturize with products suitable to your skin type. Allow your moisturizer to sink in for a few minutes before proceeding to apply your makeup so it won't smear.Then,apply primer so the makeup will stay in place!;
, A flawless look isn't possible without perfect skin. Select a quality liquid, mineral and powder foundation that matches your skin tone as closely as possible. Apply it to your face with a dampened cosmetic wedge or brush, beginning from the center of your face and blending outwards. Be sure to blend down over the jawline and up to the hairline.

,, For fair skin tones, choose a bright pink or fuchsia color. Medium skin tones look best with peachy or coral hues. If you have dark skin, deep wine or berry-toned blushes should do the trick. Apply the cream blush to the apples of both cheeks, and softly blend upward along the cheekbones towards the temples. If you feel the color is making a harsh line, softly blend the color down towards your earlobes. You should look fresh and dewy at this point.

, Since your cheeks are bright, your eyes don't require heavy makeup. Begin by selecting a color of eyeliner. The best choices for this look are in the gold and bronze family, but you could also use black or navy. Either will work fine. Sharpen your eye pencil, and softly smudge the liner in between the lower lashes; do not apply it your waterline.Why?Because makeup there is hard to clean,and there is no such cleaner up yet,so the makeup will get caught and will cause irritations and so on. Once you're finished with this, smudge the liner into the upper lashes as well. Bring this line from the outer corner all the way to the inner corner.

, The heated curler acts like a hair styler - it will help your lashes keep their shape for longer. Then apply deep black mascara to your lashes in two to three coats. You can use an eyelash primer if you want, but it's not completely necessary.

, Fair skin can use bright pinks and bold fuchsias. Medium skin looks fabulous with peach or coral shades, especially those which have golden undertones. Dark skin tones call for deep wine and berry colored lipsticks. For precision, apply the lip color using a lip brush. Begin in the middle of your lips, and slowly move outward. Be sure not to venture out of your natural lip line.

, Because your lipstick is bright, use a clear gloss, or one that matches the lipstick color for extra vibrance. Blot your lips after application with a tissue - this will make your lip color last longer.

, If they need extra definition, softly apply eyeshadow in the same tone as your brow hairs to your eyebrows using a brow brush.

, This time, avoid the eye area completely. Be sure not to get any powder on your freshly painted lips. For touch-ups throughout the day, keep a compact with a mirror and a powder puff in your purse or school bag and apply when you feel it's necessary.

, This look will not look good on you if you don't wear it with confidence. Confidence will make you that much more vibrant, and people will be sure to notice you.

Recognize the difference between skin undertone and skin shade.,
Examine the veins on the underside of your wrist.Look closely at the veins – what color are they?,
Reference your jewelry collection.,
Wrap a white towel around your face to examine your skin.,
Exfoliate and moisturize your skin.,
Wear white and be sure to test the makeup in good lighting.,
Match the undertone of your skin first.,
Match the color of your face, neck and décolletage.The neck tends to be the lightest, and the face and décolletage are usually slightly darker because they are exposed to more sunlight and elements.,
Try 3 different shades to compare.Foundation shades usually fall somewhere on a loose spectrum of fair, moderately fair, medium, medium deep, deep and very deep.,
Go 1-2 shades lighter than your skin tone to neutralize dark areas.,
Match your foundation exactly for concealing other areas of the face.Areas of redness and most other skin issues are best covered with a concealer that exactly matches your foundation/skin tone.If you have trouble matching them exactly, go for a neutral beige with faint yellow shades.,
Adjust your chosen shade to match the seasons.,
Go 1-2 shades lighter than your skin tone for highlighting.To highlight, you'll need to apply a concealer 1-2 shades lighter than your skin tone to the areas of your face that naturally catch the light – the top of the cheekbones, directly beneath the arch of the brow, down the center of the nose and the Cupid’s bow.Highlighting with concealer can help you sculpt your face and give it added dimension.

,
Go 1-2 shades darker than your skin tone for contouring.To contour, you'll need to apply a concealer 1-2 shades darker than your skin tone to the natural hollows of the face – right below the cheekbone, along the jawline and at the temple near the hairline.Highlighting and contouring are currently enjoying a surge of popularity, so you'll probably see contouring kits and other special products made for this on the market.However, all you really need to get this look are the right concealer shades.

,
Address specific discolorations with color correcting concealer.These concealers come in shades that are not flesh tones.",How to Find the Perfect Concealer or Foundation Shade," Your undertone is the true color of your skin, just beneath the surface. Sun exposure, rosacea and acne can change the surface color of your skin, but the undertone never changesThere are 3 possible undertones – warm, cool and neutral.
Foundations and concealers are usually divided into one of those 3 categories.
These undertones are true for all nationalities. Those with darker skin sometimes have undertones that look somewhat ashen or gray. This is an olive skin tone, which falls under the neutral umbrella.;
, Blue is universal, so you need to determine whether your blue veins lean more towards purple or green in appearance. Be sure to do this in natural lighting, since artificial lighting can change the way colors appear.Blue-purple veins indicate a cool undertone.
Blue-green veins indicate a warm undertone.
If you can't tell either way, this usually indicates a neutral undertone – both cool and warm undertones in equal parts., What do you have more of – gold jewelry or silver jewelry? If you often find yourself preferring gold jewelry because it looks more flattering on you, you probably have a warm undertone. If you lean more towards silver jewelry because it seems to compliment you better, you probably have a cool undertone.


If you aren’t sure, check your skin in the mirror against both gold and silver jewelry.
If one doesn’t seem to flatter you more than the other, you probably have a neutral undertone., Look closely – do you see a particular tint? The white of the towel will make the undertone easier to detect. This is only effective if your mirror gets natural light, since fluorescent bulbs can distort the skin’s true undertone and create a deceptive greenish tint.


A blueish tint indicates a cool undertone.
A yellowish tint indicate a warm undertone.
A greenish tint indicates a neutral undertone., Dirt, sweat and dead skin cells on your face can distort the way a foundation shade appears on your skin. By exfoliating and moisturizing first, you are priming your skin to accept and accurately reflect the true shade of the foundation.


You should always do this before testing foundations., Wearing other colors can distort how you perceive your skin tone, so be sure to wear white when you’re testing shades.Always use good lighting and try to use more than one light source to confirm a shade looks consistent.


Natural light definitely needs to be one of your light sources, since it shows the shades most accurately.

, Most brands will identify the complementary undertone right on the product label, so check that first. If you are considering a brand that doesn’t provide the undertone information for you, there are certain keywords you can look for that will give you some clues.Words like beige, golden, tan, caramel, and chestnut usually correspond to warm undertones.
Terms like porcelain, rose, sable, and cocoa usually indicate cool undertones.
Descriptions like ivory, buff, nude, and praline usually indicate neutral undertones.

, Even though all 3 won't match each other exactly, there will be a predominant shade that covers the most area. Choose the foundation shade that looks closest to that predominant shade.


Test the foundation on both your face and your neck to ensure you’ll end up with even color.
Check your jawline after applying foundation. Make sure the skin above it (your face) also matches the skin below it (your neck)., Even if you feel certain you know your shade, test out 3 different ones for comparison. Choose the ones that most closely match your skin color.


Use enough of each one to get a good read on it – a tiny dab is not enough. Use a streak about 2 inches (5 cm) long for testing.
The right foundation shade will disappear into your skin and look natural., The goal of concealer is to even out skin tone by targeting small areas, so inspect your face closely. A common problem area for a lot of people is under the eye, due to the prevalence of dark circles. Going 2 shades lighter to conceal dark areas should be the absolute maximum.


1 shade lighter is generally preferable to prevent the reverse raccoon eye look.Concealers with yellow tones will help to diminish the look of under eye circles., These tend to look good when applied anywhere on the face.


Always test and apply concealer in natural light to get an accurate read of the shade.Avoid flesh-toned concealers that have prominent pink, rose, peach, white, yellow, or copper shades in them.

, Most people tend to have a slightly darker skin tone in the summer, so you’ll likely need 2 shades of concealer – one to match your summer tone and one to match your slightly paler winter tone. In the fall and spring you can mix those to concealers together to get the perfect in-between shade.,,, Their use is based on basic color theory – colors opposite one another on the color wheel will cancel each other out. For instance, green is directly across from red on the color wheel, so you can use a green concealer to neutralize redness.The color correction palette works like this:


Lavender neutralizes sallow/yellowness skin;
Yellow offsets deep purple tones caused by dark circles and/or scarring;
Green counteracts the redness caused by ruddiness, pimples and rosacea;
Pink cancels out the blue cast on lighter skin tones;
Orange/salmon counteracts blue, dark purple and/or grayish tones found in deeper skin tones."

, Use a soft, eyeshadow blush to apply the shade all over your eyelid. Next, use a blending brush to blend it up into the crease.If you can't find a ""latte"" shade, any other light, dusty brown shade will do.

, Sweep the brush back and forth across the crease, going from the inner corner of your eye to the outer. You can also extend the shade down to your lash line and outer lid corner to create < or > shape.

, Use a soft, fluffy eyeshadow brush to apply the shade, and a blender brush to blend it in. This is your transition shade, so it doesn't have to be heavy-handed., Choose a color that's a shade or two darker than your transition shade, and apply it using a crease brush. Blend the shade down onto your lid using a blending brush.








, You want to end up with something that looks like a < or > (depending on which eye you are working on). This will help give your eyes that smoky look, as well as give your eyeshadow more depth.

, Blend it out towards the inner and outer corners of your eye. You can also choose a light, metallic orange. This is the eye-catching part of your eyeshadow, so try to find something that screams ""pumpkin spice"" at you.








, You do not have to blend this shade out at much. You are using it to help brighten and open up your eyes. You could even use a metallic ivory color instead; this will help give your eyeshadow that creamy look lattes have.








, Many pumpkin spice lattes come with a swirl of whipped cream and a sprinkle of pumpkin spice. This will mimic that sprinkle of delicious pumpkin spice.

, Use a thin, angled brush to sweep it outward towards the outer corner of your eye. If your eyeshadow palette is limited, you can use the same terracotta color you used for your transition shades.








, You want to drag this line out at the corner, sort of like a cat eye or wingtip. If you were to angle a brush between the end of your eyebrow and the corner of your lip, the white eyeliner should touch the brush. This will create that frothy latte look.

, Apply some white eyeliner to your lower lash line (not the waterline). Next, extend it outwards, until it is just a little bit short than the upper white line. Don't let these two lines touch; you want some space between them., If you'd like to really make your eyes stand out, apply some false eyelashes.

Find flatback rhinestones.,
Pick your size and color.,
Play with the location.,
Get an adhesive remover.",How to Make a Fake Lip Stud1," Rhinestones with a flatback are not a necessity but will stick much nicer than rounded-back rhinestones, simply because the skin under your lip is flat.This allows the rhinestones to be flush with your skin.


Don’t limit yourself to the beauty store. Check your local craft store for an endless supply of rhinestones.;
, When choosing a rhinestone, it may be best to purchase a variety pack. This allows you to test several sizes on your face before committing to one.For example, a 5 mm rhinestone may seem like a wise choice but may actually be too large for your face.


Try a 2.5 mm or 3 mm rhinestone. This compares in size to some real lip studs without looking gaudy or overdone.

, Use a semi permanent marker to play with location of your fake lip stud. Experiment to see if you would prefer the middle, a side, both sides, your top lip or your bottom lip.If you want both sides of your lip to have a fake stud, place a strip of tape below where you want to mark your face. This ensures even marking.

, When your lip stud eventually falls off, your skin may be left feeling tacky and gross if you’ve used spirit gum as an adhesive.In order to prevent this, pick up a spirit gum remover.The remover will wash away any remaining tackiness or dryness from the glue.

;
, Your lipsticks will create the freckles you will surround and cover with glitter later on. You want to use liquid lipsticks, as they will stay on better throughout the day.








Choose two shades you like. It's best to start off with a very dark and very light shade. You can start by dabbing on dark and light freckles and, later, mix the shades together and add smaller freckles to help the shades blend together better.
You should also choose shades that match well with your chosen glitter.

, Dot wherever you want your freckles to appear. Use a thin tipped brush to gently dab a smattering of freckles on your face, varying between your light and dark shades.








Many people like dabbing their freckles where they would naturally appear, such as near the chin, under the eyes, and on the upper cheeks.
Do not worry if your freckles are not perfectly round. Slightly oblong freckles are normal and you will be covering your face with glitter. This will obscure the precise shape of your freckles slightly.

, Not all of your freckles should be the same size and shape. This can look a little too uniform for what is supposed to be a fun, carefree look. Try dabbing freckles in different shapes and sizes. You can also have clusters of freckles in some areas and spread them out more in others.







, You want your light and dark shades to blend together naturally. Mix together your light and dark lipstick in a shade that's the middle ground between the two of them.








Use a slightly smaller brush to apply this shade.
Dab on your lighter freckles in between your light and dark freckles, creating a color gradient that's slightly less jarring.

, From here, get your glitter ready. You can buy makeup glitter at a local department or beauty store. Take the cap off the glitter and pour a small amount of glitter into the cap. Set the bottle aside as you work.Make sure you set the bottle aside in a clear space. If glitter smears, it can be very difficult to clean up.

, Use the tip of your index finger to gently dab on your glitter. Try to dab glitter over your existing freckles, making them sparkle slightly. You can also dab glitter in between the freckles, creating an attractive, shimmery look on your face.








There is no precise to apply glitter. Apply as much glitter as you want and in a manner that looks attractive to you.
Remember to use a shade of glitter that matches well with your lipstick.

, Glitter spreads easily, so small bits of glitter will smear in unwanted spaces during the process. Use a makeup brush to gently brush off any unwanted glitter. If you added too much glitter, or added glitter to an area you now want clear, you can brush this glitter off as well.







, Glitter freckles are a dramatic look, so it's okay if your glitter feels a little overpowering. Do not shy away from using bright shades. Dull glitter can create a dark look, and people may even struggle to see your freckles in the wrong light. Opt for lighter shades., Glitter lashes are supposed to be spontaneous and carefree. Therefore, avoid going overboard on symmetry with glitter freckles. It's okay if one side of your face has a little more glitter than the other. In fact, this can actually improve upon the glitter freckle look., There are no strict rules when it comes to glitter freckles. Everyone has their own preferences and tastes, so be open to experimentation here. Have fun experimenting with different colors and styles as you create a fun glitter freckle look that works for you.

Now blend it into the foundation. This concealer is, again, pretty pricey. (around 30 pounds or 40 dollars).

, She uses the Rimmel Stay Matte Powder. Apply this all over your face to set the foundation. This is only around 4 (pounds) or 5 (Dollars) So this is pretty cheap and it works amazing!

, She uses the NARS Laguna Bronzer. Apply this into the hollows of your cheeks and onto your cheek bones. Then, blend upward to your temples and down to your jawline. This is about 26 pounds or 36 dollars. If your willing to pay that then great! It's an amazing bronzer, but if you're on a budget, try the E.L.F Mineral Glow Bronzer. It's only 7 Pounds or 8 Dollars and it gives the same warm glow as the Nars Laguna!

, Eleanor uses the Top Shop Blush in Afternoon Tea. Apply this lightly onto the apples of your cheeks to get a soft flush onto your cheeks like El's! This blush is about 11 Pounds or 12 Dollars, so kind of expensive for blush. Try 'Rimmel London's Tickle Me Pink' Blush. It's only around 6 pound, 7 dollars and it is almost the exact same color as TopShop!

, It seems Eleanor isn't very big on lipstick or lip gloss because she applies Vaseline to her lips to keep them hydrated. Then she applies about two dabs of her concealer (don't do this if you have a dark color of concealer) and then blends it into the Vaseline. This creates a very pretty pink nude color! Vaseline is very cheep and you just re-use the same concealer! However, if you want a lip color, apply a coat of light colored lip gloss.

, Eleanor uses Maybelline The Falsie's for mascara. Use only one to two coats as Eleanor's eyelashes do not stand out very much. The falsies are very inexpensive and very high quality. (Around 5 pounds 6 dollars)

Peel the back of the rhinestone off using tweezers.,
Apply and hold to your face.",How to Make a Fake Lip Stud2," You want to start with a clean palette.Do not apply moisturizer or any cream to the area where you will be applying your lip stud. Simply wash your face and towel dry.

, You may want a second pair of tweezers for this. Holding the rhinestone down with one pair, you can use the second pair to lift the protective backing of the rhinestone off., Pick the rhinestone up and gently apply it to the area you want your fake lip stud. The longer you firmly hold the rhinestone in place, the longer your fake lip stud will last.

Apply a small glob of spirit gum to the rhinestone and your face.,

Hold the rhinestone firmly.",How to Make a Fake Lip Stud3," Spirit gum will only work efficiently when applied to both your face and the rhinestone backing.Spirit gum may be available at drug stores during the Halloween shopping season (Late-September & October). For any other parts of the year, check out your local costume shop or an online website.

, Allowing the gum to become tacky will give it a proper hold onto the back of the lip stud. Try counting to sixty and testing the gum with your fingernail. It should feel tacky to the touch.When in doubt, it’s better for the spirit gum to be too dry, rather than too wet.Do not use a blow dryer or another heat form to help the gum tack up faster.

, If your rhinestone is tiny, try using the tweezers to move it. When applying the rhinestone, cautiously stick it to your skin in one fluid motion.After it has stuck, do not move it.

, Press the rhinestone against your face gently. Maintain for approximately ten seconds. Once the ten seconds has past, your fake lip stud should be ready to go.

Apply a drop of glue to the rhinestone.Open your adhesive and test it by squeezing a single drop onto a piece of tissue.,
Let the glue dry for at least 45 seconds.,
Apply the rhinestone to your face and hold.",How to Make a Fake Lip Stud4," If the drop is much larger than needed, use a toothpick to pick up the adhesive and apply it to the back of the rhinestone. If the test drop is sufficient, apply a second drop directly to the back of the rhinestone.


When applying to the rhinestone, lift the rhinestone up and face the bottom down before applying the glue to the bottom. This will prevent accidents such as spilling too much glue on your rhinestone and ruining it.Eyelash glue is a great adhesive if you don’t sweat much. It is available at most drugstores and is quite inexpensive.

, Letting the glue dry longer is better than not long enough. Packaging of eyelash glue commonly says to wait 20 seconds, but this is not enough.Waiting longer allows the glue to bond better to your face., When applying to your face, roll your lip back over your teeth to provide an even canvas. If the flesh on your face is pulled taut, you will have better control when it comes to applying the rhinestone.

",How to Get a Sun Kissed Appearance Using Makeup," Although being in the sun can result in peeling skin, that does not equate to sun kissed, more like sun burnt. Thus, the first thing you need to do is to prepare your skin well so that it looks glowing, natural and dewy.;
, Check that the label reads non-comedogenic (won't clog pores) and hypoallergenic (won't cause a reaction). For best results, you can use an Olay scrubbing brush or a Clarisonic brush. The Clarisonic brush is more expensive and both of them have the relatively the same performance.

, To get dewy skin use moisturiser daily, twice a day.

, For bright eyes put in eye drops to make you appear bright and awake.

, For a bright happy aura, you also need a bright and big smile. Of course, take care of your teeth and whiten periodically when needed. Practice a genuine smile in the mirror; for the most genuine smile, try laughing.

, For smooth flawless skin, use acne strips on problem areas. Application/ directions are on package.

, A luminous foundation will reflect light onto any blemishes and make them appear larger.

, On your nose, forehead, and chin, swipe on a tinted moisturiser. Spread it out evenly across your face.

, Apply a gel bronzer on your cheek bones and blend it in with two fingers in a downward motion.

, Apply a peach or coral colored light blush. Base the color you choose based off of your undertones- warm, cool or neutral. Use a color that has an orange or red-pink base. No matter what, do not go overboard with your blush. If you are naturally flushed, don't use blush. The less makeup, the better.

, Apply a few coats of black or brown mascara and tightline your waterline with black on top and a lighter color on your bottom waterline is optional. Whatever works for you.

, Keep your brows well groomed. Next, apply a primer to your lids and a light base color. On top of that, add a eyeshadow based on your eye color. No colors too bold. Different colors work differently but for reference copper goes with green eyes, bronze/rose gold for blue eyes, and gold for brown eyes.

, Or for a touch of color put on a peach or light coral gloss. Try to find a sheer pale pink that matches your skins natural lip color. Do not make it evident that you are wearing any lip color- just a bit of color or shine to enhance your natural lip color. If you are to choose a tinted color, than be sure that it is definitely not lighter than your natural lip color and not anything much darker resulting in a flamboyant or faux lip color. Although that new Oxblood lipstick just came out, that is a statement color on it's own that controls your look. This look will appear overdone if you are wearing a bold color and a different color theme on the rest of your face. This look is naturally beautiful to enhance your features and appear fresh and sun kissed.

Clean with a cleanser containing either glycolic acid or sulfur.,
Use Visine or ice.,
Use a tinted moisturizer.",How to Cover Up Blemishes1," Inflammation of a blemish is usually caused by picking. If this is the case, make sure you clean the blemish before placing makeup on or around it. These two chemical cleansers will help heal your blemish in just a few days and won’t be noticeable beneath makeup., Before you apply any makeup, you should reduce the swelling as much as you can. Use Visine or ice to reduce the swelling and flatten the blemish. This will help make up go on smoother and hide the blemish more effectively.








A drop of Visine directly on the blemish is all you need.
Hold ice on the blemish for 3-5 minutes to reduce swelling.

, Before applying any makeup, apply a tinted moisturizer. This will help even out your skin tone. Use this instead of a full-coverage foundation because the moisturizer will be much lighter and less likely to cause more blemishes.

Draw two lines down the sides of your nose.,
Highlight the bridge of your nose.,
Blend away any harsh lines.",How to Contour Your Nose1," Do this on top of your foundation. Use an angled eyeshadow brush to draw the contour lines. They should begin at the brow bone and go all the way to the end of your nose. Make sure to keep the lines light at first - it's easier to build product than to take it away.









If you're worried about placement, use two q-tips to figure out where the lines should go. Hold one q-tip in each hand and align them on either side of the cartilage of your nose, parallel to the middle of your nose. This is where the contour lines will go.
There are several different products you can use to contour your nose. A brown blush or eyeshadow, a matte bronzer or a sculpting powder will all do nicely. Just make sure that the color is only 1-2 shades darker than your natural skin tone. Cream products can also be used to contour, but powder is easier to work with, especially for beginners.;
, Choose a highlighter 1-2 shades lighter than your natural skin tone and use it to highlight the bridge of your nose. Lightly apply the highlighter in a thin line from the top your nose down to the ball of your nose.









Be careful not to make the line of highlighter too wide. Highlighter emphasizes the area it's placed on, so applying too much will make your nose appear wider rather than thinner.
If the bottom or tip of your nose is wide, only apply the highlighter halfway down your nose.
To highlight your nose, you can use a specific highlighter product, an off-white or nude eyeshadow, or a foundation or concealer a shade or two lighter than the foundation you're wearing.

, If you notice any harsh lines, blend them away until you're just left with subtle shadows. You don’t want the product to look too obvious.









Use a fluffy blender brush or a make-up sponge to blend both the contour and highlighter lines.
Be careful not to blend the lines together - you want them to look subtle, yet distinct.

Bring your concealer with you.",How to Cover Up Blemishes2," If you have a red blemish on your face, you want to use proper makeup to tone down the redness. A yellow color corrector is the most efficient at diminishing redness.








Use a makeup sponge to apply your concealer because using your finger transfers oils.

, After you’ve used your corrector on the blemish, you want to find a foundation that is the exact shade of your skin tone. You want it to look as natural as possible.









The idea that a dark concealer will hide your blemish better is just a myth., Use a dusting powder to offset any remaining oil. The powder should match your skin tone and you should stick to one layer of powder. Putting on extra layers of powder will cause you to look cakey.







, When you have blemishes that you’ve covered before you left the house, you should bring concealer with you when you leave. Especially if you have oily skin, you will need it for touch ups. Concealer is prone to fading on oily skin. To keep the blemishes hidden all day long, spot touch up with your concealer."
"
Highlight around the blemish.,
Use a masking cosmetic.,
Use a finishing spray.",How to Cover Up Blemishes3," This may sound counteractive, but if the blemish is large enough that it casts a shadow, you should counteract it by creating an optical illusion. Do this by using a highlighting concealer under the blemish. Your next layers of makeup will continue to reduce the visibility of the blemish while allowing the light to bounce off of the highlighter. This illusion will take away from the severity of depth in your blemish.








, A masking cosmetic is makeup that is thicker than concealer. It has added pigment as well. If you’re trying to hide scars or other prominent blemishes, use a masking cosmetic as your concealer.







, When covering more prominent blemishes, a finishing spray is great. It will help keep your blemish concealed. Your finishing spray should go on directly after you finish covering your blemish. Apply your eye makeup and lip color after your spray.If you have smaller blemishes, a finishing spray is not necessary, but you may choose to use one.

Make sure to use a matte bronzer or eyeshadow to do this, you don't want the tip of your nose to shimmer!
Blend the powder well using a soft blender brush or sponge.

, Apply highlighter to the bridge of the nose, stopping about halfway down. Applying highlighter only halfway down will give the illusion of a shorter nose.








, Make your nose appear shorter and thinner at the same time by applying shading down the sides of the nose, as well as on the tip. However, to avoid adding length, you should only begin the contour lines parallel to your tear ducts, rather than at the brow bone.

Begin contouring at the brow bone.,
Make the line of highlighter longer.",How to Contour Your Nose3," To make your nose look longer, you should begin shading the contour lines at the curve of the brow bone, then work all the way down to the tip. Using an angled brush, follow the curve of the brow bone to the top of your nose, then continue in a straight line all the way to the end. Repeat on the other side.









The line at the brow bone should begin just underneath your eyebrow.
Always work from the top to the bottom, as you want the line to be darkest at the brow bone.

, To make your nose appear longer, you should apply highlighter all the way down the bridge of your nose, right to the tip. But most importantly, you should extend the highlighter up between your brows, until it's parallel with the highest point (usually the arch) of your eyebrows.

Rule out problematic products.,
Observe where and when your skin is oily.,
Do a tissue test.,
Determine a course of action.,
Read the label.,
Examine the ingredients.,
Think about texture.,
Consider the other products you use.,
Look for SPF.,
Shop around.,
Test new products on your arm first.,
Vary your routine with the seasons.,
Think about your age.",How to Choose Moisturizer for Oily Skin," Don’t assume you have naturally oily skin just because it appears shinier than you would like. You might just be using the wrong product.It’s possible that the moisturizer you are using is too heavy. When you use a product that is too rich for your skin, your pores can’t absorb it. As a result, the product sits on your skin, potentially clogging your pores.
Conversely, you might actually be using a product that is too harsh and drying. Your skin compensates for these products by producing more oil.
Stick to gentle cleansers and light, oil-free moisturizers for a few weeks to see how your skin reacts.;
, All people have natural oils in their skin, but this does not mean that everyone should use products developed for oily skin. Once you have ruled out products as the culprit, consider the following when determining where you stand:If your skin is oily throughout the day and you have large pores all over your face, you probably have oily skin.
If oily skin and large pores exist only in your T-zone (the forehead, nose, and chin), you probably have combination skin.
If you only see oily skin in your T-zone when the weather is warm, you probably have normal skin.
If your skin is oily but your pores are small, it’s a good sign that your products, and not your skin type, might be to blame.

, Wash your face with a gentle cleanser, and don’t put anything on top of it. In an hour or two, blot with a tissue. If you see greasy splotches, your skin is probably oily. If not, you probably have combination skin., If you determine that your skin is not really oily, look for a moisturizer for normal skin. On the other hand, if you have truly oily skin, look to Part 2 for help choosing the right product.

, Moisturizers designed for oily skin will often include key words like water-based, non-comedogenic (won’t clog pores), non-acnegenic (won’t cause acne) and/or oil-free.Oil-free products are more complicated than you think, however, as they may contain other ingredients that can clog your pores (like waxes) or irritate your skin (like alcohol)., People with oily skin should be on the lookout for the ingredients that can both help and harm their skin.


Water-based products should have a word than ends in “-icone” (like silicone) as one of the first few ingredients.Dimethicone is often used as a replacement for petrolatum, which is oil-derived. Dimethicone is both moisturizing and mattifying, which means that it can help control grease and shine.Look for exfoliating ingredients. Oily skin can often be dull and thick, so choose products with ingredients that will aid in cell turnover. These include lactic, glycolic, and salicylic acid.Avoid products that include paraffin, cocoa butter, or oils., Moisturizers come in many different forms. From lightest to heaviest, these include gels, lotions, and creams. Keep in mind their different properties when choosing.People with oily skin should avoid creams and heavy lotions.
Instead, choose gels or light lotions.

, Oily skin can also be acne-prone, which means that you might be using harsh and drying anti-acne products. Don’t irritate your skin further by layering anti-acne moisturizer on top of these products. Instead, look for moisturizer for sensitive skin.


If you’re not using other anti-acne products, moisturizers that also fight breakouts might be a good bet for you.

, Experts recommend that you look for a moisturizer that also protects your skin from the sun. Many people with oily skin worry that sunscreen will exacerbate greasiness and shine, so again look for products that claim not to clog pores or cause acne.You might also want to consider using sunscreen as moisturizer. Sunscreen hydrates your skin, so you might want to skip a second layer, especially if your skin is oily. (If you wear both, put on sunscreen first.), You want a moisturizer that leaves your skin hydrated but not greasy, fresh but not tight. It might take you a little while before you find a product that matches your particular skin. Since you might have to try a few different products before you find the right one, don’t think that you have to buy the most expensive brand. Cheaper options can often work just as well., To avoid breakouts and rashes, test moisturizer on your arm before using it on your face. This is especially important for people whose skin is also sensitive. Unless you have an immediate reaction, try to wait two weeks before deciding if the product is right for you., Your skin will not behave the same all year long, so consider using a different moisturizer in summer and winter.As long as your skin is not acne-prone, even those with oily skin may want to consider using an ointment in winter.
Similarly, those with normal and combination skin may want to switch to a lighter lotion or gel during the summer months, when their skin may be oily.

, Oily skin does not exist in a vacuum. A fifteen-year-old who is dealing with oily skin and acne will need different products from a forty-year-old who might want to fight aging, as well."

",How to Contour and Highlight Your Face (Makeup)," You will need foundation under your contouring  and highlighting, whether you are doing a liquid contouring and highlighting, or a powder contouring and highlighting, you will need a base. It depends on the type of contouring and highlighting you are doing, If you are doing a liquid one, your base might be foundation. If you are a powder one, your base might be powder.;
, Then you can do the contouring and highlighting.








, After you have done your foundation and you've concealed your imperfections, you can go ahead and use a darker foundation, or a dark, matte, cream blush.

, Find the hollows of your cheek bones. Draw a straight line, from your ears to the middle of your cheek. Do this on both sides. With a clean foundation brush, a Beauty Blender, or a small stippling brush, blend back and forth, and then blend slightly upwards a bit.








, Find the arch or your eyebrows. Draw a straight line up to your hairline. Do it on both sides. Then draw a horizontal line from the left line to the right line that you drew before. Make sure to leave at least 1/4 in between your hairline and the horizontal line. Blend everything outwards.








, Find your jaw line. Draw a line all along your bottom jaw line, very close to your neck. Blend downwards towards your neck.








, Connect everything drawing a three along the sides of your face.








, To make your nose look smaller, draw a straight line on both sides of your nose. Connect both lines at the tip of your nose, drawing a ""U"" shape. Now, look for the crease of your eyes. Draw a curved line, kind of like you were doing a cream eyeshadow look. Connect the crease line with the lines on the sides of your nose. Blend outwards.








,,









Highlight under your eyes. For this there are two ways you can do this. First one:

Start at the inner corner of your eyes and go down to your nose, then go up to the edge of your eye. Draw dots in between that triangle. Blend with a blending brush, a beauty blender, foundation brush, or concealer brush. (Follow blue lines)
The next option is going all the way to your temples. So basically, you will just follow the same step above, but instead of going to the edge of your eye, you will go all the way to your temples.



, Start at your nose:









Draw a straight line at the middle of your nose. When you get to the tip, draw a tiny horizontal line.
Now go to your forehead. Draw a straight line right above your nose, which means right in the middle of your forehead. Then draw two lines on either side of that other vertical line. These two lines will follow the shape of your eyebrows.
Now the rest of your face, starting with your chin and cupids bow. For your cupids bow, just follow the lines of your cupids bow. For your chin, you can draw horizontal lines or vertical lines. (This is the easiest part.)
Now with the your cheeks. You can do this two ways too:

First one: Draw dots right on your cheek bones and blend.


Second one: Just draw dots on the high points of your cheek bones, and go in a ""C"" shape when you get to the eyebrows, or just stop there.

, You can use a blending brush, going in small swirls to give it a soft airbrush effect. You can use a Beauty Blender, concealer brush, or foundation brush. Whatever you choose, make sure it is well blend because the concealer is two to three shades lighter than your foundation shade, so you don't want white stripes all over your face.








, Apply a matte bronzer or a neutral powder, making sure to stipple it on first, so the colors wouldn't blend messily.








, Grab a lighter powder than your regular setting powder, and lightly stipple it onto the concealer. Setting this will help your concealer not to crease.








, Once you are all done, it should look like the picture on the right.


If you are still not sure what it should like before you blend everything together.

Prior to cleansing your face, you should pre-cleanse your skin. Rinse your face with warm water to remove dirt and oils from the surface of your skin. Apply a gentle cleanser to your clean, damp face. Rinse away the product and pat your face dry with a clean towel.Resist the urge to wash your oily skin multiple times a day. This will strip your face of its natural moisture and send your oil production into hyperdrive. Instead, try to wash your face once in the morning and once in the evening before bed. As your oil levels even out, skip the A.M. wash.;
, Toners are formulated to remove excess dirt, makeup, and oils from your skin. Saturate a cotton ball with your oil free toner. Wipe the cotton ball across your face—avoid your eyes. Allow the product to air dry.









To avoid dehydrating your skin, use an alcohol-free toner once per day.
Rosewater and witch hazel are excellent natural toners., Your pores are over producing oil to compensate for dehydrated skin. Although it seems counterintuitive, oily skin needs additional moisture. It does not, however, need any additional oil. When you select a moisturizer, look for a lightweight product that is oil-free, mattifying, and shine-reducing. Apply a thin layer of light moisturizer to your face.








Mattifying moisturizers actually help to absorb excess oil from your skin.Select a SPF moisturizer for extra protection., Primer provides a smooth, shine free base for your makeup. These products prevent your makeup from “melting” off your face. When selecting a primer, opt for a mattifying, oil free product in a powder or liquid-to-powder form. Apply a thin, even layer of primer to your face—don’t forget your eyelids.









You can purchase and apply a separate primer for your eyelids., Oily skin is prone to breakouts and blemishes. Applying light layers of liquid matte concealer will help to minimize these imperfections without causing new breakouts. Use the wand or a concealer brush to cover your dark circles, red marks, and imperfections.









For additional coverage, apply a layer of liquid concealer, followed by a layer of powder foundation and another layer of liquid concealer. Seal in the makeup with a final coat of powder foundation. The more layers you apply, the more likely you are to see shiny spots throughout the day. This application method may require several touch ups.
Avoid cream concealers—they will clog your pores., Long-lasting powder foundations create an even complexion while combatting excess oil. Before you purchase foundation, read the label carefully—make sure the product is oil-free, mattifying, and noncomedogenic (will not clog your pores). Apply a thin, even layer of powder with a large powder brush. Move the brush in a circular and dabbing motion.


If you need additional coverage, apply a second layer of powder with a clean, damp sponge. Move the sponge in a circular and dabbing motion.If you do not like powder foundation, select a mousse foundation or a water-based liquid foundation., Translucent matte powder provides another barrier against oily skin. Pour a small amount of powder into the makeup container’s lid. Swirl a kabuki brush or a powder brush inside the lid until all the powder disappears. To apply a thin coat of matte finishing powder over your foundation, move the brush in big circles from the inside of your face to the outside of your face.









You can apply the powder to your eyelids too., Mattifying blush will produce a radiant glow while fighting off excess oil. You may apply the powder matte blush with a traditional blush brush or a powder blush. Circle the brush from the apples of your cheeks to your upper ear.








Avoid shimmery blushes because they will make you look shiny.
Powder matte blush will stay on your cheeks longer than a cream matte blush., Like water, natural oils can cause your makeup to melt away. Opting to wear waterproof, water resistant, and/or long wear products will help you avoid creased and smudged eye makeup. Pair a cream eyeshadow with a waterproof eyeliner and mascara.









Instead of preparing your lids with concealer, prep them with an eyelid primer., At some point in the day, your natural oils will inevitably seep through your matte makeup. Blotting paper will remove the spots of oil from your face without wiping away your makeup. Gently press a sheet of blotting paper onto the oily spot—do not rub it across your entire face. Once the oil is absorbed, carefully peel the paper off of your skin.









You can purchase blotting paper that will absorb oil AND leave powder on the oily spot., After you have removed the oil, cover the area with powder. The powder will help to absorb any remaining oil and help you maintain an even complexion. Use a puff, sponge, or beauty blender to press the powder into the oily spot.









Always carry powder with you., Once or twice a week, consider treating yourself to an oil-absorbing face mask. Find a mask that contains kaolin or bentonite clay. Apply a thin layer of the mask to your face. Allow it to harden for 10 to 15 minutes. Rinse off the mask with warm water.

Choose a cleanser.,
Wash your face twice daily with warm water.,
Pat your face dry with a clean towel.,
Moisturize your skin.",How to Clean Oily Skin1," Use a gentle face wash designed for oily skin. Liquid face washes containing alphahydroxy acids (AHAs), such as citric acid, lactic acid, or glycolic acid, exfoliate your skin and remove dead skin cells. Cleansers with emollients (petrolatum, lanolin, mineral oil, and ceramides) or humectants (glycerin) hold moisture in your skin. If you have acne, use medicated cleansers that contain salicylic acid, sodium sulfacetamide, or benzoyl peroxide. These ingredients fight acne while cleaning your skin.Salicylic acid clears blocked pores and reduces swelling and redness.
Benzoyl peroxide is an exfoliator and kills bacteria.
Sodium sulfacetamide fights the growth of bacteria.;
, First, clean your hands. Wet your face with lukewarm water. Apply cleanser with your fingertips.Gently cleanse your skin--do not scrub it harshly.When you wake up and before you go to bed are ideal times to wash. Also be sure to wash after exercising or sweating profusely. You can wash over the sink or while showering. The shower acts as a giant steamer, opening your pores and liquefying sebum--your skin's oil.Do not scrub your face too hard.Also, do not use water that is too hot. Sebum is meant to lubricate your skin and protect it.Use an exfoliator once or twice a week to remove dead skin cells and keep your pores open.On the other hand, using a washcloth or buff puff can increase oiliness.If you wear make-up, cleansing is better than using makeup remover wipes. If you must use a wipe, avoid products with alcohol and fragrances. Choose products designed for sensitive skin. If you have acne, buy wipes containing salicylic acid or do not use wipes at all.Regardless, be sure to wash your face afterwards. Wipes are not a substitute for washing. Coconut oil is an effective, moisturizing, natural product for makeup removal., If possible, change your face towels every day. Oil, dirt, and bacteria get trapped on your towels. It is essential that you do not transfer these things back to yourself. Use a smaller sized hand towel or washcloth to reduce laundry.

, After you wash and dry your face, it is important to apply an oil-free moisturizer. Even oily skin needs to be moisturized. Vary the amount you use based on how oily your skin feels.Minimize the amount of moisturizer you use on your oiliest areas.

Use a face mask.,
Apply natural oils.,
Utilize a toner.",How to Clean Oily Skin2," Once weekly, apply a drying mud or clay mask to your face. Mud or clay masks absorb excess oil from your skin and tone and tighten your pores.While green clays absorb more oil, white clays are better for sensitive skin.Egg-white masks also can firm your skin and soak up excess oil.Lemon juice and mango are common ingredients for face masks.


You can purchase masks in health stores or make your own. For one type of homemade mask, use facial clay (like bentonite) and witch hazel. Do not use pottery clay. Add one tablespoon witch hazel to one teaspoon facial clay; stir until they are blended. Additionally, add two drops cypress oil and two drops lemon oil for fragrance and to help control overactive oil glands. Relax and wear the mask for ten minutes or until the clay is dry. Rinse it off., Although it might seem counterintuitive to apply oil to your face, some natural products like argan, coconut, or jojoba oil can reduce oiliness. By applying oil, you can trick your skin into thinking it already has produced enough oil. Using oil then stabilizes your body's oil production.A mixture of lavender and neroli essential oils (derived from orange blossoms) can act as a skin cleanser and toner. Tea tree oil is also effective at reducing oily skin., Non-alcohol toners help tighten your pores. Although toners are not essential to a skincare regimen, they help many people. You can purchase toners in drugstores or make your own. Use toners after you wash your face. Soak a cotton pad in the toner and dab it on your face. Use it twice daily for two to three weeks. After week three, apply it once daily. Be sure to use the toner only on the oily parts of your face (e.g. forehead, nose, and chin).You can make your own toners at home. Toners restore the skin's natural pH balance, which hard water can disrupt. Witch hazel, thyme, lavender, sandalwood, cucumber, and basil are all effective toner ingredients."

Choose a base color that complements your skin tone.,
Use a variety of shades.,
Use one color.",How to Do Monochromatic Makeup1," Colors that work great for the monochromatic look are red, pink, bronze, brown, nude and orange. However, if you are feeling extra adventurous, you can also choose purple, grey, blue and even green as your base color.For example, if you have a warm skin tone, pick burnt rust or peach as your base color.
If you have a cool skin tone, then choose burgundy, purple or magenta as your base color.
If you have a neutral skin tone, then you are in luck because you can choose from a variety of colors like bronze, peachy pink, and blue, to name a few.;
, Once you have decided on a base color, use varying shades of the base color for your makeup application. If pink is your base color, for example, then use a medium shade of pink on your lids, a lighter shade on your cheeks, and a deep shade of pink on your lips.If purple is your base color, then choose from lavender, mauve, and violet.
If brown is your base color, then experiment with dark brown, gold, and bronze.

, You can also opt for the traditional monochromatic look by using the same color and shade for your eyes, cheeks and lids. It is perfectly fine to apply watermelon pink, for example, to your eyes, cheeks and lips when you are trying to achieve the monochromatic look.You could also apply lavender to your eyes, cheeks and lips.
Alternatively, try applying magenta to your eyes, cheeks and lips to achieve the monochromatic look.

Eat well and stay hydrated.,
Protect your skin.",How to Cleanse Pores1," The heat of the water relaxes your skin and opens your pores, which helps gets rid of of excess oil, which may cause blackheads and acne.The water doesn't need to be so hot that it is uncomfortable, just warm enough for cleansing.;
, This doesn't mean to just get some soap and rub it all over your face. Choose an oil-free, water-based skin care product for best results.Some kinds of cleansers may be specifically marketed for facial care; it is up to you to judge whether or not these help you with your complexion.


Over-the-counter acne creams may be desirable, as they contain ingredients such as benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid, which help dry skin oils.But keep in mind that medicated cleansers, as well as facial scrubs, products containing astringents, and body wash, may irritate your face rather than cleanse it. Use what feels right for your body.

, Cleansers, if drying on your skin, may themselves be irritating. You may wish to wash it off with colder water, which can make your skin feel tighter. If you wear makeup, always remove it before going to bed.

, Facial lotions will moisturize your skin, keeping it from producing too much oil. There are many kinds of different skin types, so there are many kinds of different lotions. Choose one that fits your skin type and lifestyle; for example, if you are acne-prone, you may want to try an oil-free gel rather than a heavy lotion. Other lotions contain plant-based oils that may be necessary for skin that tends to be dry., Keeping your bed linens clean is key to maintaining clean pores. If dirt, oil, and bacteria build up on your sheets, then they can transfer to your skin and clog your pores. Additionally, silk pillowcases can help prevent wrinkling, which can minimize the look of your pores., Keep your pores clearer with a diet that features fruits, vegetables, dairy, and lean meats. These foods will provide you with nutrients that can help the overall look of your skin. Choose foods that are low-glycemic and minimally processed to promote healthier skin.To stay hydrated, drink 8-10 glasses of water., Clean pores don't just happen in the shower; they must also be maintained. Choose a daily sunscreen that will protect your skin, and make sure you keep your skin clean (for instance, after exercising) without overwashing."

Wash your face twice a day.,
Use oil-free cosmetics.,
Use moisturizers selectively.,
Don’t over-wash your face.,
Be mindful of what touches your face.",How to Care for Oily Skin1," Having a good cleaning and skincare routine is the most important thing you can do to care for oily skin. Gently clean your face twice a day, morning and night, with warm water and soap, or a soapless facial cleanser.Use a gentle cleanser at first, as a harsher cleanser can actually increase oil production.


If a normal cleanser does not reduce the oiliness of your skin, consider a cleanser that includes benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, glycolic acid, or beta hydroxy acid.
Start with a cleanser with benzoyl peroxide. This chemical is used specifically to treat mild to moderate acne.A chemical cleanser like this might lead to side-effects, such as drying, redness and scaling. These effects often recede after the first month of using the cleanser.You may have to try a number of different products to see which one works best for you.Use your hands to clean your face and do not use a washcloth or loofah. Pat your face dry afterwards — do not rub or irritate the skin.;
, If you have oily skin, it is important that you choose cosmetics that will not exacerbate it. Check the labels carefully and always opt for “oil-free” or “water-based” cosmetics.There is some uncertainty about the direct effect of cosmetics on oil production, but heavy makeup may block your pores.If you can go without, try holding off on products like foundation. Keep your makeup minimal (like using mascara and lipstick only) to avoid clogging pores.

, Often people with oily skin will steer clear of moisturizers, thinking that their skin doesn’t need any extra lubrication, but this is not true. Those with oily skin still need to moisturize. Certainly oily moisturizers should be avoided, along with anything that might further clog up your skin. Oil-free moisturizers, however, can help you achieve a balance in your skin.


Vary the amount you apply according to the parts of your face that are oilier or drier.Choose the product carefully, and look for a non-oily non-comedogenic moisturizer.Look for products specifically tailored to those with oily skin. Some cosmetic lines, like Clinique, have different lines for different types of skin, including oily skin.
Avoid any moisturizers that contain lanolin, petrolatum or isopropyl myristate.Look at online reviews for some pointers, and consider a gel moisturizer that has a different texture to lotions., If you have oily skin, you may be tempted to keep washing it throughout the day to tackle the oil build-up. Avoid this temptation, and try to wash your face only in the morning and evening. Washing more often can dry out your skin and cause irritation.


You may try washing your skin once during the day if it is exceptionally oily.You can wash your face more than twice a day if you have been sweating.

, Although the oiliness of your skin is largely genetic and the oil is produced below the surface of the skin, it’s a good idea to be mindful of what touches your skin. If you have greasy hair and it is falling over your face, some of this greasiness will be transferred to your skin.


If you have grubby hands and keep touching your face, you will be spreading the oil around.
Keep your hair and hands clean and off your face."

Talk to your doctor about products that dry the skin.",How to Control Your Oily Skin," Oil on the skin is produced by the sebaceous glands. These are more numerous in the areas of the face, neck, chest, and back, which is why these areas are where you most commonly experience oily skin., These include:


Genetics — If your mother and father have or had oily skin at some point in their lives, it is more likely that you will too.
Age — Oily skin is more common for teenagers and young adults (people in their twenties) than it is for older adults.Hormones — Oily skin can be provoked for some women around the time of their period, during pregnancy, while taking birth control pills, or for older women around the time of menopause; hormones play less of a role for men as they do not have the same fluctuating patterns as they do for women., Some of these are modifiable, which in turn can improve the condition of your skin. Exacerbating factors for oily skin include:


Stress — The oiliness of your skin may increase during stressful times in your life.
Diet — Greasy and fatty foods, as well as dairy products, can increase oily skin. After using makeup — Makeup such as foundation can contribute to clogging pores and make your skin even more oily.
The weather — This can be a trigger for some people.
Vigorous scrubbing and washing — This irritates the skin and can actually worsen oiliness.

, Vigorous scrubbing can actually exacerbate oiliness, so it is important to be gentle; however, washing is important as it unclogs pores and diminishes overall oiliness.Choose a gentle soap product or mild cleansing agent, and lightly dab your face dry with a towel afterwards (again being aware to not be too vigorous with the skin on your face)., Some foods that have been shown to help with oily skin include eggs, lemon juice, yogurt, tomatoes, apple cider vinegar, apples, cucumbers, and honey. Foods to avoid include greasy and fatty foods, as well as an excess of dairy products, which can exacerbate skin troubles.

, These ingredients are particularly helpful for people with oily skin.Check the label at your local pharmacy to look for these ingredients.

, These labels indicate that the product does not block your pores and is much better for oily skin.Also choose water-based cosmetics as opposed to oil-based cosmetics, and powders are better for your skin than creams whenever possible.

, Carry a small pack of cosmetic blotting paper with you to soak up oil on your skin when you are on the go. Don't scrub your face with the blotting paper — press it to your chin, forehead, nose, or whichever area of your face is oily. Hold it to your skin for about 10 to 15 seconds.Blotting papers are an excellent choice because they won't dry out your skin.

, If you put on your makeup right after you wash it,your makeup is more likely to clog your opened pores, which can cause irritation and increase oil production..

, Gently cleansing your skin with a mild cleanser (not regular soap, as this is too harsh on the skin) after makeup removal will help to maintain healthy skin and to prevent excess oil production., This may seem counterintuitive for people with oily skin, but all skin types need proper hydration.Choose a light, oil-free moisturizer; this actually maintains the health of your skin, and therefore decreases oil production by increasing the overall health of your skin. Apply once a day.


Select an oil-free sunscreen for the summertime that may also serve as a moisturizing cream.

, There are products available at the pharmacy or via your physician that can help in cases of severely oily skin to dry the skin; however, always consult your doctor prior to using these. As previously mentioned, the number one priority is to maintain the health of your skin and to avoid irritation, so skin-drying products (or ""shine reducing products"" designed for people with oily skin) are a last resort.

Dry out the cyst with apple cider vinegar.",How to Bring a Cyst to a Head1," Before you put any essential oils or herbal remedies on the cyst, you should warm up the cyst and encourage it to come closer to the surface. You can do this by applying a warm wet cloth to the cyst for 10-15 minutes. The compress should be warm but not boiling hot, just warmer than the temperature of your skin.


Repeat this process every couple of hours. It will help to bring blood and infection-fighting white blood cells to the source, in addition to keeping the skin soft so that it can drain.
The compress will also keep the area around the cyst clean and better prepare the cyst for the herbal remedies.;
, You can apply essential oils such as tea tree oil, turmeric oil, garlic oil, or frankincense oil directly onto the cyst with a cotton ball or a Q-tip. These oils all have anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties. They will help to reduce any swelling around the cyst and lower the risk of infection.You should only use one essential oil or herbal product at a time, especially if you've never used them before. That way, if your skin gets irritated or you develop an allergy, you will know exactly which oil has caused the problem.
If you have sensitive skin, you can mix the essential oil with castor oil, using three parts essential oil to seven parts castor oil.
Apply the essential oil to the cyst four times a day and cover the cyst with a bandage after you have applied the oil.

, Aloe vera has anti-inflammatory properties and can help to speed up healing. You can put the aloe vera directly on the cyst and then let it dry.You can find aloe vera at your local health food store or in the beauty section of your local grocery store.

This will prepare your face for the application of eye shadow, blush and lipstick., Use your finger or an eye shadow brush to apply a single wash of color to your eyelid. Also apply a line of shadow along your lower lash line.Because dark mascaras can overpower a monochromatic look, use a lighter mascara, like a brown or dark brown, on your lashes.

, Dip your brush in the blush. Before you apply the blush, tap the brush to get rid of any excess powder. Then sweep the blush over the apples of your cheeks, or along your cheekbones.For an intense flush, sweep the blush up to your temples.

After the water begins to boil, remove it from heat. Place the pot in an area, such as a table or counter, where you can comfortably lean over it. Consider placing folded towels under your pot in order to insulate your table from heat.


You may want to pour the water into another container or bowl so that you do not accidentally touch a hot pot. Be careful that you do not put your equipment in areas that may be damaged by heat.
You may also avoid putting your water into plastic bowls or containers. Plastic may release chemicals into the water upon heating.Prefer clean metal containers.

, Clean and basic ingredients, often herbal, can enhance your cleanse, making it more spa-like. You can add a few drops of essential oils, such as rosemary, lavender, or thyme, to the water. This will release a fragrance, which acts as an aromatic. Allow the oil to steep for ten minutes.


You can also wrap whole herbs in a cheesecloth and add them to the water, allowing them to steep for ten minutes.
Some herbs, such as dried lavender, act as a stress-reliever. Others, such as anise seeds or rosemary, can aid overly oily skin.Feel free to experiment with which herbs work best for your skin and mental state.

, Use a gentle cleanser to wash your skin, as well as an exfoliator such as baking soda. This will remove any residual dirt, grime, and dead skin cells from your face, preparing it for the steam.

Add the exfoliator to your cleanser, or try a cleansing product that already contains an exfoliator.

You can put a towel over your head to trap the steam, which will further clean your face.You can steam your face for however long is comfortable. Ten minutes is plenty; those with sensitive skin may want to limit their steam to five minutes.
If your water stops releasing steam, boil fresh water and herbs; don't reuse what you have.

, The best time to use a pore strip is after steaming your face because your pores are open. This will allow for maximum extraction. Apply the strip and wait the recommended time before slowly pulling the strip from your skin., Follow the considerations laid out above: choose a gentle cleanser either with or without medication, and avoid harsh products. You may want to choose an extra-gentle cleanser for this kind of cleanse, as the hot steam will have loosened up much of the oil and dirt in your face.

Use retinol.,
Use an exfoliating brush.,
Use products from your kitchen.,
Consider noncomedogenic skin care products.,
Try a facial or chemical peel.",How to Cleanse Pores3," Though cleaning your skin feels nice, washing your face more than twice a day can make it too dry, which can irritate your face or cause it to overproduce natural oils. This can contribute to acne.Additionally, using too heavy of a touch when washing your face can damage your skin.Use a gentle, non-invasive touch to massage your skin while cleansing.


You may require a more specific regimen for your skin type or history with acne. Ask your dermatologist or doctor about how often you should be cleansing your face.

, Your face encounters enough pollution, dirt, and chemicals from the air; it doesn't need contact with other pollutants. Everyday sweat, oil, and bacteria from your hands or clothing can get on your face, where it can block pores. Avoid touching your face in order to keep it clean., Even though it may be tempting, squeezing at blemishes can cause scarring.Pimples are inflammations that do go away on their own over time. Popping them may force bacteria deeper into the inflamed pore, which may result in longer-lasting pimples or scars.If a blemish remains longer than a week, and if it is a real problem, a dermatologist can safely lance it for you, which will avoid further inflammation or scars.

, Cleaning your skin removes normal dirt and dust from the environment, but your pores can also be clogged by what you put on your skin deliberately. Remove makeup before you retire for the night, as well as heavy sunscreens. Makeup removers are special cleansers that are formulated to remove heavy or stubborn makeup.


A gentle and effective cleansing at night can remove the need for a morning cleanse--your face will have been on a clean pillow all night, so there will be no need to wash it again.

, You can find over-the-counter products that contain retinol, or you can ask for a prescription strength product from your doctor. Retinol will help speed up cell turnover and prevent clogged pores.

Popular retinol-containing creams include Retin A and Differen gel.

, If washing with a cleanser that contains benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid is not working for you, try an exfoliating cleansing brush. You can find different kinds of face brushes to use for cleansing, including some that spin. These brushes will clear away dead skin cells to allow your products to better penetrate the skin and clear out your pores., Many products that you already have in your kitchen can help you clean your pores. Baking soda, coconut oil, lemons, avocado, and honey are all great examples.You can even make your own facial products by combining ingredients. For example, you could combine coconut oil, baking soda, and honey for a decadent exfoliating face mask., Noncomedogenic products are those that avoid ingredients that may make acne worse. They are generally labeled as such on the front or back of packaging. Such products are generally oil-free, or do not contain ingredients that contribute to oil build-up.


Your skin type may require products formulated for dry skin, oily skin, sensitive skin, or inflamed skin. Your dermatologist is the best person to ask for advice on medicated or non-medicated products for your skin type.

, While they can be pricey, facials are one of the best ways to deep clean your skin and may be able to provide you with the results you're looking for. If you feel like your situation is extreme, a chemical peel will help remove dead skin cells and stimulate new ones to grow, which reduces the appearance of pores.Talk to your esthetician, the skincare expert who will do your facial or chemical peel, about what you need to do before and after your appointment because you will likely need to stay out of the sun and avoid using makeup or other products for a period of time afterwards.

Try face masks.,
Use blotting pads.,
Consider using a mild astringent.,
Talk to a medical professional.",How to Care for Oily Skin2," Face masks and clays can be effective in drawing out the oil from the skin, but there is also a danger that overuse will result in excess dryness and irritation. Be wary of this when you use masks, and try to concentrate them on the areas of your skin that are the oiliest. Don’t use masks or clays too frequently. Instead only use them ahead of a special occasion, such as a party or big presentation at work.You can look for masks especially designed for oily skin.
Be prepared to try out a few to see which one works best for you.

, If your skin gets oily throughout the day it can be upsetting, and constantly washing your face is likely to only make it worse. You can, however, use simple blotting pads to remove excess oil from the surface of your skin. This is a good way to remove the oily shine during the day, which you can do subtly and quickly no matter where you are or what you’re doing.There are a number of over-the-counter blotting pad products you can buy that will help remove shine during the day.
You can also just use a tissue or some toilet paper.
Be sure to be gentle with your skin, and don’t scrub at it.

, Astringent toners are quite commonly included in skincare regimens, but you should be wary of using one that is drying or harsh on your skin. Drying the skin with a strong toner is not the way to tackle oily skin, and will only make the situation worse. If you do want to use a toner, make sure you stick to a light alcohol-free and oil-free one.


Only apply it to the oiliest areas of your skin.
If you find that you are getting dry patches of skin, stop using the astringent.
Remember that most people’s skin is a combination of dry and oily, so you should adapt your approach for the different areas of your skin., Make an appointment to talk to your doctor or dermatologist if you are sticking to a good skincare routine, but you find that the oiliness does not diminish. They will be able to advise you on what further steps you can take, and may even prescribe you some medication.


The choice of therapy should be individualized, depending on the severity and type of skin problems, as well as tolerance and other factors. Your doctor can help specifically tailor your skincare routine to your skin type.
Remember that oil production is perfectly natural and normal.
If the situation is upsetting you, ask for some professional help."

Recognise what causes oily skin.,
Reduce your stress levels.,
Have a healthy diet.,
Protect your skin from the sun.",How to Care for Oily Skin3," Oily skin is caused by excess skin oil (or sebum), which begins to occur for both males and females during puberty. The amount of oil produced varies from person to person, but for some people there will be an excess of oil, giving the skin a shiny and oily look.


After puberty the oil production generally subsides, but problems with oily skin can continue into adulthood.
Oily skin is often exacerbated by hot and humid weather conditions.
Oily skin can be uncomfortable and upsetting, and those with oily skin tend to suffer more from acne., If you have oily skin and acne, heightened stress levels may exacerbate the problem.Adopt a healthy lifestyle and try to find ways to relax. To calm down at a particular moment try doing some deep breathing, or even some gentle yoga or meditation.


Going out for a walk can help you to clear your head while getting some exercise.
Make exercise a regular part of your daily routine to help you blow off some steam.

, It is a myth that greasy foods lead directly to greasy skin and acne, but it’s important to have a healthy diet to promote good overall health and well-being. Some foods, including those rich in carbohydrates, such as bread, may trigger acne. The oiliness of your skin does not depend on what you eat, but if you work in a kitchen, oil can stick to your skin and block your pores., Thick sunscreens can be difficult for people with oily skin, as the heavy liquid will add new oiliness to your skin and block your pores. It is, however, absolutely vital to protect your skin from the sun. When you are buying sunscreen look for “oil-free” options, and products designed especially for those with oily skin.


Sunscreen gels are generally less likely to block your pores than lotions or creams.
Choose a sunscreen that has broad spectrum coverage with an SPF of at least 30. Make sure that the sunscreen is water-resistant. Apply at least 15 minutes before you go in the sun and wear it daily.

Mixing these three ingredients will help moisturize your lips and remove dry, dead skin cells.To make a basic lip scrub at home, mix together roughly one tablespoon of sugar and a half a teaspoon each of honey and olive oil. You can modify this basic recipe to your taste (using more or less honey or oil) or to make a larger batch at once.
If you decide to make a larger batch of lip scrub, be sure to store it in an airtight container with a lid so your scrub doesn't dry out.
If you prefer, you can add different scents like mint or vanilla to your lip scrub to get the exact scent/taste that you like.
Add your lip scrub to your evening routine right after you brush your teeth. Making lip exfoliation part of your daily routine will keep your lips healthy and hydrated. Experts recommend using a scrub at least once per week and more often if you have very dry lips., Apply lip balm or lip moisturizer to restore moisture to the lips. Reapply as needed, especially if you wear matte finish lip colors regularly because these can be very drying., Matte long wear lip colors are often extremely drying and difficult to remove. If you love the look of these lipsticks, try alternating them with lipsticks advertised as “hydrating.” It’s easier to remove lipstick from hydrated lips than dry, flaky ones.


If you choose matte long wear lip colors, be sure to thoroughly hydrate your lips before applying the lip color. Look for a natural lip balm with aloe and vitamin E in it. These components in natural lip balms protect and hydrate your lips without creating a sheen on your lips that can interfere with applying matte lipsticks.

, If you have an especially stubborn lip color that won’t come off easily, then you might need to give your lips a rest between removal attempts. Don’t scrub your lips so much that they feel raw.

, Lip exfoliating scrubs are available in drug stores, department stores, beauty stores, and online. If you want to get a premade scrub, then you should be able to find one with no problem. If you’d rather make your own, then you can use ingredients that you may already have in your kitchen.To make your own exfoliating sugar scrub, add a tablespoon of sugar to a teaspoon of olive oil or coconut oil (at room temperature). Combine the sugar and oil until it they form a paste. You can keep the scrub in a small jar or other container in your refrigerator for up to a week.
If you prefer to make the scrub fresh when you need it, then just take a pinch of sugar and few drops of oil and mix them together whenever you want to exfoliate your lips.

, You only need a small amount of sugar scrub to exfoliate your lips, about a ¼ teaspoon or less. Use your index finger to apply the sugar scrub to your upper and lower lips and move it around in circular motions.Rub the sugar scrub all over your lips. Make sure that you scrub all of the surfaces of your lips and the areas around your lips.
Do not use sugar scrubs more than twice per week or you may irritate your lips., When you are finished, take a clean washcloth and moisten it with warm water.

, Keeping your lips moist is another good way to keep them soft and kissable. Try wearing lip balm at night to moisturize your lips while you sleep. Apply the lip balm right before bed so that your lips will benefit from the treatment in the morning.If you do not have any lip balm, then you can just use a bit of olive or coconut oil (at room temperature) on your lips instead.

, Moisturizing your lips during the day is also important. You can use an intense moisturizing balm if your lips are extra dry, but a regular tube of lip balm will also work.Keep your lip balm handy and reapply it often.

, Before you apply any liner or lipstick to your lips, you should apply a deep moisturizing lip balm or at least a heavy layer of regular lip balm. This will help to create a moist, smooth canvas for your lipstick.Apply the lip balm to your lips about 15 to 30 minutes before you want to apply your lipstick.

, Look for a lipstick that is moisturizing rather than long lasting. Long lasting lipsticks may dry out or irritate your lips more than other types of lipstick.


If you are planning on some serious kissing, then you may want to go with a nude or pale pink shade rather than a bright red or coral. Otherwise your kissing partner may end up with lipstick all over.
A lip stain may also be a good choice because stains do not come off your lips as easily., Clean teeth and fresh breath may make your mouth seem more attractive, so make sure that you include dental hygiene in your kissable lip routine.Take a few minutes to brush, floss, and use mouth wash.


If you can't brush your teeth, then chew on a piece of gum or have a mint.

, Another way to draw attention to your lips is to touch them with your fingers or with something edible. This can be a seductive, playful or subtle way to get someone to kiss you.


For example, you can run the tip of a finger over your lips, as if you are thinking about something. Or, hold an ice cube or a piece of fruit, such as a grape or a strawberry, against your lips for a few seconds before you put it into your mouth.
To send a stronger signal, try making eye contact with the person you want to kiss as you touch your lips.

, Another way that you can bring attention to your lips is to hold them in a way that your potential kissing partner might find sexy. For example, you can try pursing your lips, parting your lips slightly, licking your lips, or gently biting one of your lips. Try out a few different things to draw attention to your lips.

, Physical closeness can also make your lips appear more kissable. It will also be easier for your potential kissing partner to kiss you if you are within arm's reach. Try standing somewhat close to the person you want to kiss.


To make it even more clear that you want to be kissed, try looking at your partner's lips instead of making eye contact. This should help him or her to understand that you want to be kissed."

Examine your skin in natural lighting to determine your complexion: fair, light, medium, tan, deep.,
Look at the color of the veins on the inside of your wrist.,
Notice how your skin reacts to the sun: do you tan or burn easily?Skin that tans easily has more melanin indicates a warm skin tone.,
Try on gold and silver jewelry.,
Find a color that is one to two shades deeper than your natural lip color.,

,
Try on lipstick with little or no other makeup on your face.,
Ask for help at the makeup counter.,
Don’t match a lip color too closely with your clothing.,
Have fun and experiment, but consider these guidelines if you're not sure:


Nude lips look great with just about anything.,
Go for dramatic lips or eyes; not both.",How to Choose the Right Lipstick for You," Concentrate on the skin around your jaw line.Fair skin: your skin is very pale or translucent and you burn very easily. You may have freckles and some redness.Light skin: your skin is pale. When you are in the sun, you burn and then may possibly tan.Medium: you tan easily and generally don't burn or have sensitive skin.Tan: your skin is tan or olive. You rarely burn and look tanned even in the winter.Deep: your skin is dark and you never get sunburned. Your hair is possibly black or dark brown.;
, This is a quick way to figure out if you have a warm, neutral, or cool skin tone.Blue or purple veins indicate you have a cool skin tone.
Green veins mean you have a warm skin tone.
If you have difficulty deciding if your veins are blue or green, you likely have a neutral skin tone and can choose colors from both the cool and warm spectrum. People with olive skin usually have neutral undertones.

, Most women of African-American and Indian descent fall into this category.
If you burn before you tan (and maybe can't tan at all), then your skin has less melanin and you have a blue skin tone. If you have deep ebony skin, you may actually fall into this category.

, Which looks better?Gold jewelry looks best with warm skin tones.
Silver jewelry looks best on cool skin tones.
Both look good on a more neutral skin tone.
This can be a good ""tie breaker"" if you don't clearly meet the criteria listed already.

, To test how close the shade is to your natural color, apply the lipstick only to your lower lip. Compare that shade to the your upper lip. If the shades are drastically different, you need to keep looking., Dark shades will actually make your lips look smaller, while lighter shades can add plumpness.Lipstick with a matte finish can also cause lips to look thinner, while glosses and shimmery shades can make them look fuller.,


Remember that your undertone and complexion will help guide you, but they aren't the be-all-end-all of choosing a lipstick color. It is important to try on different shades and, ultimately, choose what you feel looks best.

,


If you have fair or light skin, try light pink, coral, peach, nudes, or beige.If you have cool undertones, try a soft mocha and nude. Warm undertones, try pale pinks or a nude with a little peach.If you have medium skin, try rose, mauve, or berry shades.Cool undertones: try shades of pink or cranberry. Warm undertones: experiment with copper or bronze.If you have tan skin, try to avoid browns and purples and go for colors with an orange undertone. Most other colors will look great. Try coral, or deep pink.If you have a deep complexion, try browns or purples like walnut, caramel, plum, or wine.Cool undertones should look for ruby and wine-colored reds. Warm undertones: try copper or bronze., Unless you're feeling like making a statement with bold lips (which is totally fine!), apply strong shades to your lower lip only. Press your lips together, then use your finger to even out the color., Again, use your skin tone and complexion as a guide--if you find a color you love that breaks the ""rules""--go for it!


Fair or light skin should look for dusty, pinkish red or coral. Cool undertones: raspberry. Warm tones: try reds with a blue undertone or coral.Tan or medium skin should look for bright red cherry red, or true red with no undertone (if you have a neutral undertone). Warm undertones: orangey-red or tangerine. Cool undertones: wine.Deep skin with warm undertones should try blue-based red. Cool: Metallic ruby red or deep wine., This is a classic look that any woman can pull off, regardless of age, skin, hair, eye, or lip color. Own it!

, Clean the tester with a little alcohol (the store should provide this in a spray bottle) and use a test brush or a cotton swab to apply the color to your lips.If you don't want to apply the tester lipstick to your mouth, test it on the pads of your fingertips. Your fingertips are closer to your lip color than your wrist or the side of your hand., Otherwise, you will be mixing multiple colors together. Ask a sales rep for makeup remover or lotion.

,, Look for a shade that, worn with no other make up, brightens your face and makes other makeup unnecessary.

, Sometimes it's hard to objectively judge what looks best on ourselves. A professional at the makeup counter can match you with the right color.

, For example, if you are wearing a fire-engine red dress, wearing the same exact color on your lips will look overwhelming.

, It's a great casual look and can help play up dramatic eyes.
Red can add drama to a fairly plain outfit. Try not to overwhelm by wearing red with very bright clothing or clothes with crazy patterns.
Pink is versatile because there are so many shades. Pinks that are just a few shades brighter than your natural lip color work for a subtle, everyday look.
Berries can make a dark ensemble seem sombre and can weigh down an airy, summery look. Try matching berries with mixed neutrals.

,


Stick to just mascara on the eyes, or just a bit of dark brown eyeliner in between your lashes.

Contact lens case
Empty lipstick or chap stick tubes
Empty lip balm container
Empty eye shadow or blush containers
Pill boxes;
, If you have not already done so, clean your container well using soap and warm water. Wipe your container down using a cotton ball soaked with rubbing alcohol; use a cotton swab to get into small spaces, such as corners.








, Your lipstick will start to harden quickly and you will need to pour it into its container before it sets. Make sure that your containers are within reach and open, so that they will be ready.

, You can do this by placing the crayon under warm, running water for a few minutes, then peeling the wrapper off.You can also use a craft knife to score a shallow line down the length of the crayon and peel the paper off.









Dispose of crayon parts that were not covered by paper, as these parts may be tainted with germs, bacteria or other crayon colors.

, Hold the crayon between your fingers and snap it into smaller pieces. If you are having difficulties breaking the crayons, you can cut them using a sharp knife. Breaking the crayon into smaller pieces will not only make it easier to melt, but it will also make it easier to mix colors together.








, Fill a pot with 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) with water. Place a metal or heat-safe glass bowl on top of the pot. The bottom of the bowl should not be touching the surface of the water.

, You will be using the hot steam to melt the crayon, butter, and oils.

, Using a lower temperature will prevent them from melting too fast.








, You can use all one color, or you can combine different colors to create your own unique shade. Stir the crayon pieces occasionally with a fork or spoon.








, You can use any type of food-grade oil, but some oils (such as coconut oil) might give the lipstick a more pleasant taste and smell than others.









For a sheer lipstick, use ½ teaspoon of oil; for a more intense color, use only ¼ teaspoon., At this point, you can also add in additional ingredients, such as extracts or essences, or even some cosmetic-grade glitter.








, Use oven mitts or a dish towel to lift the bowl so that you do not burn yourself.








, Use a spoon to help guide it into the container so that the melted wax does not get everywhere.








, You can let it cool in the kitchen (or whatever room you were making it in), or you can leave it in the freezer or refrigerator.

, You can use a match or lighter. Make sure that you are working close to a sink, or have water close by, in case the candle tips over.

, Keep the spoon about one inch (2.54 centimeters) above the flame., It will take about 30 seconds before the crayons start to melt.Be sure to stir them occasionally using a toothpick.








, You can use any type of food-grade oil, but some types, such as coconut oil, will give the lipstick a nicer smell and taste.









For sheer lipstick, use ½ teaspoon of your chosen oil.
For a more intense color, use ¼ teaspoon of your chosen oil.

, At this point, you can add in other ingredients, such as an extract for flavor or cosmetic glitter for shimmer. If the spoon becomes too hot to hold, consider using an oven mitt or wrapping the handle with a towel.








, Once the ingredients have melted and there are no more lumps, pull the spoon away from the flame and carefully pour the melted lipstick into the container. Be sure to blow out the candle.








, You can leave the lipstick to cool in the room you were working in, or you can stick the container into the fridge or freezer.

, Avoid using craft glitter; even the finest grain craft glitter will be too chunky to use for lipstick. Try using some cosmetic-grade glitter instead; you can purchase it in a beauty shop or online.


You can also use metallic crayons to create a pearlescent lipstick.

, When making your lipstick, use castor oil instead of the food-grade oil.

, You can mix however many colors you want, so long as you end up with what amounts to one crayon. Here are some color combinations you can try:To deepen a pink color, add some deep burgundy.
If the pink is too bright, add some peach-colored crayon.
Create a shimmery red-violet by mixing 1 part Gold and 2 parts Red Violet. You can add more shimmer with some gold cosmetic glitter.
Use one part each of Melon and Magenta to create a bright pink.
Create a bright red using 1 part each of Red Orange and Wild Strawberry.
For a creamy, neutral color, use 1 part each of Bittersweet and Peach.
For a silvery purple, use 1 part each of Silver and Violet.

, You will only need one or two drops of your chosen extract, essence or oil. Keep in mind that certain flavors and scents will be stronger than others, so you will need to use a little bit more/less. Keep in mind that the flavor and scent will become stronger after the lipstick hardens.Here is a list of extracts and essences that work well in homemade lipstick:


Coconut
Grapefruit or tangerine
Peppermint
Vanilla

Use a lip-plumping product.,
Try brushing with a little cinnamon.,
Rub on some peppermint oil.,
Rub a hot pepper on your lips.",How to Get Pouty Lips1," In the cosmetic section of the drugstore you'll find shelves of products designed to have a lip-plumping effect. These glosses and chapsticks usually contain ingredients like cinnamon oil or capsaicin, the substance that makes hot peppers hot. These ingredients slightly irritate the skin, causing it to plump up temporarily.


Lip-plumpers are usually quite glossy, which creates an even poutier appearance.
Caffeine is also commonly found in lip plumpers, so check the ingredients if you're sensitive to it.;
, Cinnamon is a mild irritant that can safely plump up your lips a little. Try sprinkling a little cinnamon powder on your old toothbrush (the one you are not using) then using it to brush your lips. Gently scrub your lips until they become full and flushed.









Try making your own cinnamon plumping gloss by mixing a little cinnamon into a teaspoon of coconut oil. Place it in an old chapstick jar and use it whenever your lips need a boost.
Feeling a little tingly is normal, but if your lips feel painfully irritated after using cinnamon, discontinue use and try another method.

, Mint, similarly to cinnamon, has a mildly irritating effect that can cause the lips to swell a little. A great natural way to plump your lips is by rubbing on a few drops of peppermint oil.


Make your own plumping gloss by mixing 5 drops of peppermint oil with a teaspoon of coconut oil. Store it in an old chapstick jar.
If your lips feel irritated by the peppermint, use another method.

, This method isn't for the faint of heart, but it works! Take a small piece of jalapeno or another moderately spicy pepper and rub it over your lips. In a moment or two, your lips will start to swell, much like they do when you eat hot salsa or hot sauce.


Don't try this with habaneros or other very hot peppers, since the experience might get uncomfortable.
You could also dab a little dried pepper powder, such as cayenne, into your lips for a plumping effect.

Start by exfoliating.,
Use lip pencil to broaden your lip outline.,
Contour your lips with deeper colors.,
Wear shiny lipstick.,
Highlight your cupid's bow.",How to Get Pouty Lips2," Exfoliating your lips increases circulation, helping blood rush to your lips to make them look fuller. Use a toothbrush to scrub away dry, flaky skin, leaving the fresh skin underneath.


You can moisturize your lips at the same time by using coconut oil. Put a little on your toothbrush and scrub away. Your lips will look shiny and fresh when you're finished.
Or try using a baking soda paste to help exfoliate deeper. Mix a teaspoon of baking soda with enough water to make a paste, then apply it to your toothbrush and scrub.

, Choose a lip pencil that's the same color as your lips, a few shades darker than your facial skin tone. Carefully outline your lips just a centimeter or so above and below your natural lip line. Fill in the gap using the lip pencil. This will create the illusion that your lips are larger than they really are.









Don't be tempted to make them look too big, or it will be obvious that you're using makeup to create fuller lips.
To make your lips pop, use a colorful lipstick or gloss over the pencil, covering both your lips and the area you drew in.

, You can create a pouty effect by using a darker color on the underside of your bottom lip, and a slightly lighter color elsewhere. Choose a deep red and dab it on the outer part of your bottom lip. Sweep it across the underside of your top lip as well. Use a slightly lighter red to fill in the rest of your lips, both the bottom and the top. Use your fingers to blend the colors where they meet.









To create a more defined line, use dark lipliner on the bottom edge of your bottom lip, and a lighter liner on your top lip.
For a stand-out finish, apply a coat of clear gloss.

, If you don't have time for lining or contouring, wearing glossy lipstick is a quick way to make your lips look more pouty. Choose a shiny pink, red or even clear gloss that will make your lips stand out from the rest of your face. The contrast in texture will make your lips look fuller than normal.








, This is the ridged area between the bottom of your nose and the top of your upper lip. Highlighting it draws attention to your lips and makes them look fuller and more pouty. Rub highlighter into your cupid's bow, or simply use clear lip gloss there to make it stand out.

Look into lip fillers.,
Look into permanent makeup.",How to Get Pouty Lips3," If temporary methods aren't cutting it for you, you might want to research lip fillers. Due to the popularity of the pouty look, there are dozens of options available. The most famous lip fillers are Botox, but there are other options that use different chemicals to keep the lips full.


During treatments, filler is injected into the lips, causing them to plump. The effect usually lasts for several months.
Be sure to conduct plenty of research and choose a technician who is well reviewed and very experienced.

, If you're tired of lining your lips all the time, maybe permanent makeup is the right choice for you. It involves essentially tattooing the area around your lips to make them appear fuller or more colorful.


If you've given it a lot of thought and permanently pouty lips are what you want, do plenty of research to find a technician who will help you achieve the right look.
It's very difficult to remove permanent makeup, so don't go this route unless you're absolutely sure it's what you want.

",How to Apply Lip Stain," A lip scrub will help buff away dead skin cells and make your lips appear smoother and plumper. It will make applying the lip stain a lot easier. If you don't have a lip scrub at home, or don't have time to run out and buy one, you can make your own by combining 1 part honey, 1 part sugar (white or brown), and 1 part oil (almond, coconut, jojoba, or olive) in a small dish., Apply the scrub to your lips using your fingers. Gently massage your lips using soft, circular motions. A few seconds is all you need. If you have very chapped lips, however, you might need to exfoliate them for up to two minutes.







, Soak the corner of a clean, soft towel with warm water. Squeeze out the excess moisture from the towel, then gently wipe the excess lip scrub off your lips.








, Use a clean toothbrush. This is great for circulation and can help make your lips appear more plump and full.









Consider getting a separate toothbrush for lip buffing purposes.

, Take a soft towel, and gently pat your lips dry with it. You are now ready to start applying your lip stain.








, Depending on how your lip stain is packaged, you may also need a lip brush. Lip stain can come in a bottle with an applicator, in a small jar, and in a small tube. If the lip stain comes in a small jar, you will need a lipstick brush.


If you plan on doing some layering and contouring later on, choose a lighter shade.

, Simply start from one corner of your lip, and drag the applicator or brush to the other. Follow the curve of your bottom lip. Once you have your lip outline, fill the center part in with more lip stain.








, Pull your lips inward, so that you can't see them, and then pop them. This will help transfer some of the excess lip stain from the bottom lip to the upper lip.








, Start applying the lip stain at the top of your lip. Drag the applicator or brush downward towards the corner. Be sure to fill in the center part of your lip as well.








, Take a tissue or paper towel, and fold it in half. Place it between your lips. Close your lips and pull them inward. Open your lips and discard the paper towel. This helps get rid of any excess lip stain. It also helps make your lip stain look more natural.







, You will be applying brighter shade to the outline of your lips, to make them ""pop."" You will be applying the darker shade to the inner part of your lips to add depth. Combined, this will make your lips appear fuller and plumper.

, Keep the lip stain inside your lip line, not outside. The innermost part of your lips should still have the lighter lip stain color.









For a sharper, crisper look, use a lipstick brush to apply the lip stain—even if it comes with an applicator.

, Once you have outlined your lips using the brighter shade, go over your lips with a lipstick brush. Focus on the transition line, right where the two shades meet. This will create a smoother transition, and make your lip stain look more natural.








, Gently dab the lip stain on using a soft, tapping motion. Focus the color on the inner part of your mouth, and work your way to the center of your lips.








, This will help make your lips appear plumper. Choose a light pink, shimmery shade, and tap it onto the middle of your bottom lip. This will help give your lips that finally touch of luscious fullness.

,
Get enough sleep.,
Reduce stress.",How to Remove Deep Facial Wrinkles," Studies have named the sun as the No. 1 cause of wrinkles. Wear a broad-spectrum (UVA and UVB) sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30. There is no need to go above SPF 50.You need to wear sunscreen even when it’s not sunny. If you’re tanned, this doesn't mean that you’re protected from the sun. Wear sunscreen no matter what!Wearing sunscreen will not only prevent wrinkles; it will also reduce your risk of getting skin cancer.Reapply your sunscreen often — at least every 2 hours.;
, Doctors recommend washing your face twice a day — no more than that. Over-washing your face can strip your skin of its natural oils and moisture so that wrinkles appear deeper; it may even cause new wrinkles to form.Even if your skin is oily, don't wash your face more than twice a day, as it can irritate your skin and, if you have acne, it can cause further breakouts.
People with mature skin (ages 40 and up) can likely get away with washing their faces with a cleanser each night, and only rinsing with cool water in the morning., Applying a toner to your skin after you’ve washed your face can help balance your skin’s pH and keep it looking healthier. Just be sure to avoid toners containing alcohol, as this can dry out your skin.

, Many moisturizers contain ingredients aimed at fighting and preventing wrinkles. Apply a moisturizer to your face twice a day: once after your morning face-wash and once after your evening face-wash.


There is little evidence to suggest that day and night creams are particularly different; however, some ingredients in moisturizers are made ineffective by the sun. For example, retinol, a highly effective wrinkle-fighter, is rendered inactive by sunlight., The skin around your eyes is different from the rest of your facial skin: it is thinner and more delicate, quicker to wrinkle and droop. For this reason, it’s worthwhile to use an eye cream in addition to your facial moisturizer.


Look for an eye cream that contains collagen, vitamin C, peptides, and/or retinol., Some health professionals claim that retinoids are the best proven way of reducing wrinkles and other signs of aging. At first, medications containing retinoids can cause redness and peeling, but once the peeling stops, your wrinkles should be improved. You can get a retinoid cream as a prescription from your doctor.


Many drugstore skincare brands offer creams containing retinol, a less irritating form of the prescription acid, retinoid. These do not require a prescription. They vary in quality, so it’s important to know what to look for.
Retinol degrades with exposure to light and air, so choose a product whose packaging blocks out both. Seek brands that offer retinol treatments in single-dose capsules, opaque glass bottles with air-tight pumps, or aluminum containers., Idebenone is a powerful antioxidant. A recent study showed that in 6 weeks of topical use, idebenone was able to reduce lines and wrinkles by 29%., Alpha-hydroxy acids will not irritate your skin as much as retinoids, but they also won’t give you the same results. These skincare products will only subtly reduce your wrinkles., Skincare products containing vitamins A, C, and E plus beta carotene can mildly improve wrinkles., There are a variety of skin peels available both through medical professionals and over the counter.Note that the deeper the peel, the more likely it is to irritate your skin. Peels can even cause scarring and changes in skin color.,


Peels with ingredients like salicylic acid and trichloroacetic acid go deeper than glycolic acid peels; as a result, they are better at removing fine lines.

, Lasers can stimulate collagen production, making the skin look plumper. If your wrinkles are particularly deep and you’ve found that nothing else works, ask your doctor to see if this might be an option.

, If you have tried everything and are still struggling to reduce or remove your wrinkles, speak to a doctor or a dermatologist. A medical professional may be able to help you select a wrinkle-removing option that’s right for you — for example, a medication, a medical procedure, or a prescription cream.

, Dozens of studies have named the sun the No. 1 cause of wrinkles. One study even found that sun exposure was more important than heredity in determining wrinkles.Best stick to the shade!


If you must go out in the sun, ensure that you’re covered up: wear sunglasses, a hat, and at least SPF 30 sunscreen.
Particularly avoid going out in the sun between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m., when its rays are at their strongest., If you do smoke, here’s another reason to quit: many studies have confirmed that cigarette smoke ages skin; it does this primarily by releasing an enzyme that breaks down collagen and elastin, which are important to keeping your skin looking young., Excess alcohol consumption can damage blood vessels in the skin. It can also harm the liver, which can cause wrinkles., When you’re dehydrated, your wrinkles can appear deeper. Staying well-hydrated will keep your skin looking healthy. If you’re unsure of how much water you should be drinking, divide your body weight (in pounds) in half: that’s how many ounces of water you should drink each day.


A 150-pound woman should drink 75 ounces of water each day.
If you exercise or live in a hot climate (i.e. if you sweat a lot), you’ll need to increase your water intake.
A reliable way to tell if you're getting enough water is by paying attention to your urine: if it’s bright yellow or has a strong smell, you’re likely not getting enough water.

, Some doctors have linked inflammation to poor skin quality (including wrinkles) as well as diseases such as cancer and heart disease.Eat a diet rich in fruits and vegetables, raw nuts, whole grains, and lean proteins.Avoid foods that contain a lot of sugar — particularly processed foods.

, Antioxidants such as vitamin E, C, A, and B are essential for healthy skin. To ensure that you get enough of these vitamins, eat 5 to 7 servings of fresh fruits and vegetables each day.Some recommendations in case you’re unsure of where to start: tomatoes, citrus, green leafy vegetables, and carrots.In addition to eating foods rich in vitamin C, using vitamin C as a topical agent can help reduce the appearance of wrinkles. The most potent form of topical vitamin C is L-ascorbic acid; search for this ingredient in face creams.

,, When we don’t get enough sleep, our bodies produce excess cortisol, which breaks down skin cells. When you get enough sleep, your body will produce more human growth hormone (HGH), which will help your skin look thicker and more elastic.The average adult needs between 7 and 9 hours of sleep each night. Teenagers need between 8.5 and 9.5 hours of sleep each night.When you do sleep, sleep on your back if possible. Sleeping on your back can help prevent wrinkles on your cheeks and chin if you’re a side sleeper, and on your forehead if you sleep on your stomach., Cortisol, which breaks down skin cells and promotes wrinkle formation, is the primary stress hormone.Beyond that, physical expressions of stress can also lead to deep facial wrinkles: frown lines around your lips and forehead, wrinkles between your eyebrows. Try these techniques for reducing stress:


Meditate for a few minutes each day. Sit up straight on a chair or in a cross-legged position on the floor. Close your eyes and focus your attention on reciting a positive mantra — for example “I feel at peace” or “Breathe in love, breathe out fear”. Place one hand gently on your stomach to remind yourself to breathe deeply into it.Practise deep breathing. Sit straight with your eyes closed and your hand on your abdomen. Slowly inhale through your nose, imagining that you are inflating a balloon deep down in your stomach. Slowly exhale through your mouth, paying attention to how your body feels as the breath moves out of you.Do something nice for yourself. Light some candles and poor yourself a nice hot bath with some stress-reducing lavender oil. Go for a slow, mindful walk and take in the scenery around you. Watch 10 minutes of cute animal videos. Whatever makes you feel good, do it!

Go for goth.",How to Apply Lipstick," This will help remove any dead skin cells and give you a smooth canvas to work on. It will also help your lips feel softer. You can exfoliate your lips by gently brushing them with a toothbrush for a few seconds, or rubbing them with a damp towel. You can also make a lip scrub using one part oil and one part sugar.









Good oils to use in lip scrubs include jojoba oil, oil, olive oil, or coconut oil. Even honey works for those who don't want to use an oil.;
, Open the lip balm and run the stick across your bottom and upper lip; if it comes in a little jar, use your finger to apply it instead. This will not only help soften your lips and make them smooth, but it will also help the lip liner and lipstick go on more evenly.Leave the lip balm on for a few minutes; you can do the rest of your makeup while you wait.








Try to choose a waxy, non-oily lip balm. This will be less likely to leave behind oily residue., Before you apply any lipstick or lip liner, check and see if there is any lip balm on your lips. If there is still some residue, wipe it off using a tissue or cotton bud. Any lip balm that's leftover will make your lips too slippery and prevent the lip liner and lipstick from sticking.







, This will help bring out the natural color of the lipstick, but it is not necessary.Use the same color that you use on the rest of your face, and apply it with a makeup sponge. Be sure to smile while doing this; it will help you fill in all the little cracks.







, Lip liner is very important. It gives the lipstick something to grip on to and makes it last longer. It also helps the lipstick go on more evenly and prevents it from bleeding.If you are going to wear a bold color lipstick, choose a lip liner that is a bit darker than the lipstick color. This will help deepen the color of the lipstick and make it more opaque.If you primed your lips with foundation, or if you want a more neutral look, match the color of the lip liner to your lips.

, How you apply the lip liner can change the way your lips look. You can make your lips appear bigger, smaller, rounder, or wider. Start by outlining your lips, then fill them. Here are some tips and guidelines:








To make your lips appear smaller, apply the lip liner to just inside the lip line. Apply some concealer around your lips to hide your natural lip line.
To make your lips appear bigger, apply the lip liner to just outside your lip line; it should still be touching your natural lip line.
To make your lips appear wider, apply the lip liner along your natural lip line, but then extend it just past the corners of your lips. To make them appear narrower, do the same thing, but apply the lip liner to just inside the corners. Conceal your natural lip line with some concealer.
To make either the upper or bottom lip appear fuller, apply the lip liner to just outside the lip line. Stay within the lip line for the rest of your lips.
For a softer, more natural look, tap the lip liner on the corners of your lips with your finger. This will help soften any sharp edges., You'll be a lot happier with the results of your lipstick application if you understand which lipstick shades and compositions complement your skin tone and texture. Keep these factors in mind when you're picking out lipstick:


If you're dark-skinned, choose a bold color that provides a pretty contrast. If you're pale-skinned a lighter pink or neutral color may stand out enough for you. For a medium complexion, go for mauve, cinnamon or plum.
If your lips are on the dry side, you may not want to use matte lipsticks since matte lipsticks can dry lips out. Look for lipsticks that contain emollients and conditioners or use a lip primer to create a barrier between the lipstick and the skin of your lips.
If you have thin lips and want to make them appear larger, avoid using very dark colors; they tend to make lips appear smaller.

, Start from the center of your lips and brush the lipstick outward, filling in all the gaps.You can apply the lipstick directly from the tube, or you can use a lipstick brush for more precision.







, The first one acted as a sort of base; this second coat will give you a lasting, more intense color.







, Stick your finger into your mouth, close your lips around it, and then pull your finger out. This will help prevent any lipstick from getting onto your teeth.







, Gently pull a tissue apart so that you end up with two, thin sheets. Press one of the sheets against your lips and lightly dust it with some translucent setting powder. Pull the tissue away and apply a second coat of lipstick.







, Blend it outward into your foundation. It will not only give your lips a nice, crisp outline, but it will also prevent the lipstick from smearing.







, This will help accentuate the natural shape of your lip. Simply outline your cupid's bow using a white or ivory pencil. Do not draw over the lipstick; draw above it.








, It will also help your lips appear plumper. You do not need to apply the lip gloss all over your lips; you can just dab a small amount to the center of your bottom lip.








, Apply your usual lipstick to your lips, but use a slightly lighter shade down the center of your upper and bottom lip. Be sure to blend well. You can also use a creamy highlighter pencil instead.







, Choose a matte, powder blush that is the same color as your lipstick. After you have applied your lipstick and lip liner, sweep your finger across the blush and press it against your lips. Keep applying the blush this way until it is completely covering your lips, and your lipstick is matte.








Do not use shimmery blush.
This will not work for all lipstick colors; it is only dependant on what colors of blush are available.
If you cannot find blush in the right color, you can try using matte eye shadow in a matching color instead.

, Choose a lip liner color that is darker than your lipstick color. Outline your lips using this lip liner, then fill your lips in with your lipstick. For an even more exaggerated ombre effect, apply an even lighter shade of lipstick to the innermost part of your lips. Blend everything together by applying a clear gloss.









For a reverse ombre, use a lip liner that is lighter than your lipstick, and outline your lips with it. Fill your lips in with your lipstick; for a more exaggerated look, apply an even darker shade of lipstick to the innermost part of your lips.

, This chic, feminine look was popular in the flapper era. It's perfect for a theme party or nights when you want to try something new. Outline the middle of your lips, but stop short of the corners. Fill in the outline with a bright red lipstick. Finish the look with a 1930s finger wave hairstyle.








, Choose a dark lip shade like black, dark red, or maroon. Find a lip liner that matches the lipstick color and outline your lips with it. Fill your lips in using the lip liner, then apply the lipstick. Wear this style with a goth outfit and hairdo.

Be aware of the costs.,
Only use Retin-A products at night.,
Use Retin-A sparingly.,
Always use in combination with moisturizer.,
Deal with any sensitivity or irritation.,
Give it a chance to start working.,

Do not wax Retin-A treated skin.,
Do not expose your skin to sun damage.,
Do not use Retin-A if you're pregnant.",How to Reduce Wrinkles With Retin A," Retin-A is a vitamin A derivative which has been prescribed by dermatologists to combat aging for over 20 years. It started out as a treatment for acne, but patients using Retin-A for this purpose soon discovered that their skin became firmer, smoother and younger-looking as a result of the treatment. Dermatologists then began researching the benefits of Retin-A as an anti-aging treatment.Retin-A works by increasing cell turnover within the skin, stimulating collagen production, and exfoliating the top layers of skin to reveal, fresher younger-looking skin underneath.
In addition to decreasing the appearance of wrinkles, it can prevent new ones from forming, fade discoloration and sun damage, reduce the risks of developing skin cancer and improve the skin's texture and elasticity.
Currently, Retin-A is the only topical treatment for wrinkles that is FDA approved. It is extremely effective, and doctors and patients alike swear by the results.;
, Retin-A is the brand name version of the generic drug known as tretinoin. It is available only with a doctor's prescription, so you will need to make an appointment with a dermatologist if you are interested in trying this treatment.


The dermatologist will assess your skin and determine whether Retin-A is a good option for you. If used correctly, it can work effectively on most skin types. However, due to it's drying, irritating qualities, it may not be suitable for people who suffer from skin conditions such as eczema or rosacea.
Retin-A is applied topically and comes in both cream and gel forms. It also comes in a variety of strengths: the 0.025% cream is for general skin improvement, the 0.05% cream is designed for reducing wrinkles and fine lines, while the 0.1% used widely for the treatment of acne and blackheads.
Your doctor will usually start you off with a weaker strength cream until your skin adjusts to the treatment. Then you can progress on to a stronger cream, if necessary.
Retinol is another vitamin-A derivative which is found in many over-the-counter products and big brand beauty creams. It produces similar results to Retin-A treatments, but due to its weaker formula it is not as effective (but will cause less irritation.), Retin-A is such an effective treatment, that you will notice a visible improvement in the appearance of wrinkles no matter what age you are when you begin using it.


Starting Retin-A treatments in your forties, fifties and above can have the effect of turning back the clock by plumping out the skin, fading age spots and reducing the appearance of wrinkles. It is never too late to start!
However, women in their twenties and thirties can also benefit from using Retin-A, as it boosts collagen production beneath the skin, making it thicker and firmer. As a result, starting Retin-A treatment early in life can prevent deep wrinkles from forming in the first place., One downside to Retin-A treatments is that the creams themselves can be quite pricey.The cost of Retin-A can vary from $80 to $150 for a month supply.


The cost will depend on the strength of the cream, which ranges from 0.025 to 0.1 percent, and whether you want to go for the brand name Retin-A (amongst others) or for the generic form of the drug, tretinoin.
The advantage of going for the brand name version is that these companies have added an emollient moisturizer to the creams, making them less irritating than their generic counterparts. In addition, Retin-A and other brand name versions have more advanced delivery systems, meaning that the active ingredients get absorbed by the skin more efficiently.
The use of Retin-A for acne treatment is usually covered under insurance plans. However, many insurance companies will not cover the cost of Retin-A treatment if it is prescribed for cosmetic reasons, such as anti-aging treatment.
Despite the high cost, it is important to remember than many commercially available skin care products from high-end brands will cost at least as much, if not more, than the Retin-A creams, and, according to dermatologists, Retin-A cream is more effective at reversing the signs of aging than any commercially available cream on the market., Retin-A products should only be applied at night, as the vitamin-A compounds they contain are photosensitive and will make your skin much more sensitive to sunlight. Applying the product at night also gives it a chance to absorb into the skin fully.When you begin Retin-A treatment, your doctor will probably recommend that you only apply it every two to three nights.
This will give your skin a chance to adjust to the cream and help to avoid irritation. Once your skin has adjusted, you can build up to using it every night.
Apply the Retin-A to dry skin, about 20 minutes after thoroughly cleansing your face.

, Retin-A is a very strong treatment, so it imperative that you use it correctly and only apply it in very small amounts.


At most, a pea-sized amount of cream should be used on the face, and a little more if applying to the neck. A good technique is to dab the cream on the areas most affected by wrinkles, age spots, etc., then wipe any remaining cream over the rest of the face.
Many people become scared of using Retin-A because they start applying the cream too heavily and experience negative side effects such as dryness, irritation, stinging and acne outbreaks. However, these effects can be greatly reduced if the cream is applied in moderation., Due to the drying effects of Retin-A treatments, it is imperative that you always wear a hydrating moisturizer, day and night.


At night, wait 20 minutes for the Retin-A to be fully absorbed into the skin, then apply your moisturizer. In the morning, wash your face thoroughly before applying a second moisturizer containing a high SPF.
Sometimes, it can be hard to spread the recommended pea-sized amount of Retin-A to all of the areas of the face where it's needed. A good solution to this problem is to mix the Retin-A with your nightly moisturizer before applying it to the face.
This way, the Retin-A will be dispersed evenly all over the face. Due to the diluting effects of the moisturizer it should also be less irritating.
If your skin starts to feel really dry and your regular moisturizer doesn't seem to be enough, try rubbing some extra virgin olive oil into your skin before bed. The oil contains fatty acids which are extremely moisturizing for your skin, in addition to being very gentle., Most people will experience some dryness and irritation after beginning Retin-A treatments, and a small number will experience acne breakouts. Don't worry, as these reactions are completely normal. As long as you are using the treatment correctly, any irritation should subside within a few weeks.


Things that will lessen irritation include making sure that you gradually build up to using the cream every night, using only the recommended pea-sized amount, and moisturizing frequently.
You should also be sure to use a very mild, non-irritating cleanser when washing your face. Choose something very natural, with no added colors or fragrance. Also try to use a gentle face scrub once a week to slough off any dead skin.
If your skin becomes very irritated and sensitive, cut back on the Retin-A applications or stop using it altogether until your skin has recovered slightly. Then, you can slowly build back up to using it again. It will take some skin types longer to adjust the the Retin-A than others., The length of time it takes for Retin-A treatments to produce noticeable results will vary from person to person.


Some people will see improvement in as little as one week, whereas for others it might take as long as eight weeks.
Don't give up however - Retin-A has produced proven positive results and is possibly the most effective anti-wrinkle cream available.Beyond Retin-A, the only more effective thing you can do to combat wrinkles is to get Botox or Dysport treatments, injectable fillers, or to consider surgical options., Glycolic acid and benzoyl peroxide are two other ingredients commonly found in skincare products. However, these can also be quite drying on the skin, so it is best to avoid using them in combination with a harsh treatment like Retin-A.

, Retin-A works by exfoliating away the top layers of skin. As a result of this, skin can become thinned out and fragile. Therefore is not a good idea to undergo any facial waxing while you are using Retin-A cream.

, Retin-A treatment makes your skin hyper-sensitive to sunlight, which is why you only apply it at night. However, you should also take precautions during daylight hours by wearing an SPF every day. It doesn't matter if it's sunny, rainy, cloudy or even snowy - your skin needs to be protected., Retin-A creams should not be used if you are pregnant, suspect you might be pregnant, trying to get pregnant or breastfeeding, as there have been reports of fetal deformities following use of tretinoin treatments."

Eczema most commonly occurs on the hands, feet, ankles, wrists, neck, upper chest, eyelids and the insides of elbows and knees. These symptoms can be worsened by stress, sweat, heat, generally dry skin and irritants in the air. Most severe problems with eczema stem from infections received during intense scratching.


Antihistamines and anti-itch creams can help reduce the itching associated with eczema, reducing the scratching that can occur.
Keeping your skin well moisturized and taking baths that help reduce itching, such as oatmeal baths, can help reduce the scaly skin associated with eczema and reduce itching. A humidifier can also help keep your skin moisturized.
If home treatments aren’t helping, see your doctor. Your doctor may prescribe creams to help reduce itching.;
, The skin condition psoriasis is primarily identified by red patches of skin covered in silvery scales. Other symptoms of psoriasis include dry, cracked skin, itching or burning, thickened or pitted fingernails, and swollen and stiff joints. Psoriasis should be treated by a doctor, who will prescribe topical ointments such as corticosteroids and retinoids in mild cases, with more severe cases requiring oral medication and light therapy.


The best approach to keeping psoriasis in check on your own is to avoid particular triggers that might set off an inflammation. These include stress, cold weather, smoking, or heavy alcohol consumption. Keep a log of suspected triggers to help avoid activities that you think are causing outbreaks.
Home treatment options for psoriasis include staying well moisturized and avoiding prolonged, hot baths. However, these treatments only assist in reducing symptoms, and will not eliminate the skin condition., Many topical fungal infections, such as ringworm and athlete’s foot, cause red, itchy scaly areas on the skin. In the case of infections such as ringworm, the scaly patch eventually expands into a circular pattern or “ring.” These fungal infections are commonly acquired from direct contact with an infected surface, such as a floor mat or another person.


If you’re certain of the nature of the infection, a simple over the counter antifungal cream can help clear up the affected area. Clotrimazole and terbinafine are two common antifungal creams that can be found at most pharmacies., This “fish scale” skin disorder is indicated by dry, scaly skin that presents with distinct polygonal-shaped scales. The skin may also become thickened or flaky. Ichthyosis is an inherited condition, so the only treatment is easing the symptoms. Your doctor may prescribe creams and ointments containing salicylic acid, urea, or retinoids. Bathing in warm salt water will ease scaling associated with the condition., Scabies typically present as a series of small red bumps with irregular “track marks” indicating their travel across the skin. Your own reaction to the presence of scabies may include inflammation and scaly skin, particularly if you are finding yourself scratching at the affected area frequently. A doctor will need to prescribe a topical cream to get rid of the infestation.


Over the counter medications are useful for reducing the amount of itching you experience while you wait for your prescription., Moisturizers can prevent your skin from getting dry, which can exacerbate existing skin conditions and lead to scaly skin. They are designed to hold water in the skin and provide a temporary barrier. Moisturizers are not all the same but most contain humectants and emollients, which are additives that help reduce the loss of moisture in the product.


Look for moisturizers that contain the active ingredients petrolatum, mineral oil, lanolin, and dimethicone. These ingredients help seal in moisture.
Other ingredients to look for include glycerin, propylene glycol, proteins, and urea. These help attract water to the outer layers of the skin.
Apply liberally and often. Use moisturizer every day after washing, bathing or showering. Moisturizer works best when applied to damp skin., Sunburned skin will become scaly and flaky as the skin heals, and prolonged exposure causes the skin to take on a leathery appearance. If you go outside each day, apply sunscreen to your body, and remember to reapply as necessary. Use enough lotion to coat any skin that will not be covered by clothing.


Use sunscreen with a minimum of SPF 30 year round in order to prevent damage from the sun.

, Frequent use of tanning beds damages the skin and can lead to skin cancers such as melanoma and basal cell carcinoma. Over time, tanning beds will also cause wrinkles, age spots, and change the texture of your skin.


Indoor tanning is not safer than outdoor tanning. Both are considered dangerous for the skin., Sport wide brimmed hats, long sleeves and pants to protect your skin from sun, wind and cold. Wind and cold weather can reduce the natural moisture in the skin, leading to dry, itchy patches. It is also possible to become sunburned in winter, particular when there is snow on the ground.


Use gloves, knit hats, scarves and good boots during the winter months and in snow. The extreme cold can damage skin, and snow reflects the sun’s UV rays., Keep your skin hydrated from the inside out. The outer layer of skin needs plenty of water, and if lacks sufficient hydration, will feel dry and rough, which can lead to itching and scratching. Though there is a lack of research showing a direct link between skin health and water consumption, staying hydrated is always a good idea.


Drink roughly 8 eight-ounce glasses of water a day to stay hydrated. This can come from drinking water, or water from fruits and vegetables., Add fish into your diet and limit your fat intake. Food items such as coconut oil, avocados and salmon contain nutrients and fats that help reduce inflammation, including that which occurs on the skin. Such inflammation can lead to further skin issues, or agitate existing skin conditions.


Foods high in antioxidants have a protective effect on the skin. Yellow and orange fruits and vegetables, green leafy vegetables, tomatoes, blueberries, nuts, lentils, and fatty fishes are all high in antioxidants.
Reduce the number of foods you eat that are high in processed or refined carbohydrates and unhealthy fats. Such foods promote aging of the skin., Vitamins A, Bs, C, E and K are particularly helpful for healthy skin. These vitamins can help prevent damage from the sun, fight against free radicals, repair and build new skin cells.


Ask your doctor before taking any multivitamin. Your doctor is best equipped to tell you what vitamins you should be getting, and how much more you need.
Don't take too many vitamins, particularly if you get plenty of vitamins in your diet already. This can lead to an overdose of vitamins, which can be harmful or fatal., Hot water will dry out your skin quickly. Instead, opt for a lukewarm or cool shower to keep your skin from becoming too dry. If you do take a warmer shower, don’t spend too long washing. Keep the shower as short as possible.


Pat dry with towel after showering, rather than scrubbing. Scrubbing too hard can contribute to dry skin., Showering too often can dry out your skin and rob it of natural oils. Try cutting back on how often you shower or bathe in order to see if your skin starts feeling a little less dry.


Ask your dermatologist whether showering could be contributing to your dry skin, and what changes you can make to help alleviate the symptoms., Many kinds of soap, particularly bar soap, strip the skin of its natural oils, rendering it dry and flaky. Use a soap or body wash with moisturizing properties to help lock in moisture during and after your shower.


Look for body washes with sodium lauroyl isethionate, and hydrolyzed milk protein, petrolatum, or shea butter for moisturizing properties.
Stay away from body washes containing alcohol or fragrances. These can contribute to dry skin.Avoid over scrubbing when applying your body wash. This can damage the skin, especially when using some kinds of wash cloths or body scrubs.

Avoid getting moisturizer in your eyes, nose, or mouth.
Apply makeup over your moisturizer, if you wear makeup.

, Tretinoin (Retin-A) is a potent retinoid that has been proven to promote the production of collagen in the skin. It is the only topical cream that is approved by the FDA as a medication for the treatment of fine lines and wrinkles. Tretinoin cannot be legally purchased in the US without a doctor's prescription.Retin-A is also prescribed to treat acne in teens and adults, and is FDA-approved for this purpose.
Retin-A should be applied to clean skin once per day.
Retin-A should be applied in the evening, to minimize risk of sun exposure.
When using Retin-A, always use a 40 SPF or higher sunscreen, and avoid incidental (unprotected) exposure to the sun as much as possible. UV rays are very damaging to skin that is being treated with tretinoin.
Retin-A can cause extreme skin redness, irritation, dryness, and flaking, especially during the first few weeks of treatment.

, Retinoids are a form of vitamin A that are reportedly effective in minimizing the look of fine lines, wrinkles, and dark spots. Retinol and other related retinoids are a form of vitamin A that is related to, but less potent than, Retin-A (tretinoin).


Retinoids found in non-prescription creams include: isotretinoin, retinol, adapalene, and retinaldehyde.Products containing a combination of retinol and glycolic acid have been shown to be effective in reversing some of the aging effects of sun damage.
Retinol products are less likely to cause the side effects that often accompany Retin-A usage, such as redness, irritation, dry and flaking skin.

, Using a lot of different skin care products can actually backfire, and amplify the appearance of aging skin. Multiple skin products can react with each other in unpredictable ways, and can irritate the skin. Find a few products that work well for you, and stick to those.Choose one mild facial cleanser. For example, one all-natural foaming cleanser you could try is Origins' A Perfect World, which contains white tea to remove toxins from your skin.
Choose one daytime moisturizer with sunblock. For example, Aveeno Positively Radiant Daily Moisturizer has skin protection of SPF 30, along with light-reflecting minerals that are designed to make your skin tone look more even.
Choose one overnight moisturizer and/or eye serum.

, To thoroughly cleanse your skin at night and remove the last traces of your makeup, buy a battery powered skin brush like the Olay Pro X or the Clarisonic. These little machines have soft bristles on a rotating or vibrating head, which scrub the impurities out of your pores.Wet your face with warm water and apply a cleansing cream.
Run the face brush over your skin for two minutes, then rinse your face with warm water and blot dry with a clean cloth.

, Aviator style sunglasses with metal frames are not the best choice to wear in the sun – they tend to reflect sunlight, increasing the likelihood of sun damage on your cheeks and nose.
Choose sunglasses with plastic frames, instead.
Mirrored lenses block more of the sun's damaging UV rays than ordinary tinted lenses.

However, other conditions, such as seborrheic dermatitis and malassezia also fall under this heading, and they require different treatment than dry skin.Ask your doctor which dandruff shampoo would be best for you. Keep in mind that you may need to try several before finding one that works.When using a dandruff shampoo, lather and rinse twice. Leave it in for five minutes on the second round. That will give the medicine time to soak in., While it's unlikely you have psoriasis, this condition can cause you to have a dry, itchy scalp. With psoriasis, you'll likely notice red areas covered in whitish scales. They are most common on places like your scalp, legs, face, palms, and back, just to name a few, but they can show up anywhere.Psoriasis is usually treated with topical creams, light therapy, and/or pills.

, This condition can lead to inflammation in the joints, but it also leaves dry, red patches on the body. Sometimes, these patches only present on the scalp. Visit a dermatologist to be evaluated for this condition.Management of this condition at home is basically the same as treating dry skin; however, your doctor will also likely prescribe you some topical medications and possibly some oral medications.

Apply a powder.",How to Apply Pancake Makeup," Pancake makeup needs to be activated with water, and should be applied with a dense sponge.The great thing about pancake makeup is that you can control the amount of coverage you get by adding more or less water (less water means less diluted makeup and heavier coverage).


For regular coverage, soak your sponge with water and then squeeze out the excess so the sponge is damp.
For lighter coverage, soak the sponge and then give it a gentle squeeze so it’s not dripping wet.
While using more water allows you to thin out the coverage, using too water much can lead to an uneven finish and streaks.
Because pancake makeup can provide such heavy coverage, you can actually use a shade that’s two or three shades lighter than your skin tone.;
, Use gentle pressure as your rub to cover one side of the sponge with makeup. For lighter coverage, don’t use any added pressure: the weight from the water will press the sponge into the makeup enough to pick up the right amount.








, With the amount of pancake you have on the sponge, begin applying the makeup to your face. Cover as much of your face as possible before going back for more. When you run out, rub the sponge into the makeup again and continue covering your face.









Apply the pancake to your face, cheeks, nose, forehead, and even eyelids. If you're using thick coverage in a shade that’s noticeably different from your natural skin tone, also cover your entire throat and neck as far back as your ears.For lighter coverage, use light and quick strokes to apply a thin layer of pancake.

, When you have covered your face, squeeze the excess water from the sponge and turn it to the clean side to begin blending. Use gentle pressure to blend the makeup into your skin. Don’t forget the areas between your eyes and the corners of your nose, mouth, and eyes.









When blending, focus on making the coverage even and removing streaks.

, Once you’ve finished blending, give the makeup a few moments to dry. If you're going for lighter coverage, blot your face with a cloth or tissue while it’s still moist to absorb excess makeup and water.







, Use a brush, puff, or clean sponge to apply a thin layer of setting, finishing, or foundation powder over top of the pancake. Remove excess powder and smooth out the finish by buffing the face with a sponge or puff.








Make sure the pancake is completely dry before applying powder.

, Contouring is a way of applying darker and lighter makeup to different areas of your face in order to highlight and de-emphasize certain features.For instance, you can use:


Darker makeup under your cheekbones to make your face look longer and thinner.
Lighter makeup on top of your cheekbones to make them stand out.
Darker makeup on your jawbone to make your face look narrower
Both types of makeup to make your nose look narrower.
Make your eyes stand out more.

, The process of applying contoured pancake makeup is the same as with regular foundation, only you use multiple colors to highlight and shade different features. You will need your regular pancake makeup (that matches your skin tone), a pancake for highlighting, and a pancake for darker contours.


The regular pancake you use should match your natural skin tone, or should be the tone you want your skin to be once the makeup is applied.
For the contour, choose a shade that’s a couple shades darker than your regular pancake.For the highlighter, opt for a pancake that’s a couple shades lighter than your regular pancake. If you want the pancake to also cover red or dark spots, choose a greenish shade., Wash your face with a gentle cleanser to remove oil, sweat, and dirt. Pat your face dry and apply an oil-free moisturizer or toner. Let the moisturizer absorb for about five minutes.








Pancake makeup won’t adhere to your skin properly if there's water, oil, dirt, or sweat on your face, which is why you have to start with clean and oil-free skin.

, If you want to make your face look narrower and your cheekbones more prominent, you can contour your cheekbones to do this. Remember that when you're contouring with pancake makeup, you will have to work a little faster than you would with regular makeup, because you will have to blend everything once you’ve applied all the makeup. Using a thin makeup sponge that’s damp with water, apply:








A thin line of highlighter pancake above the cheekbone, from the middle of your cheek to the spot where your eyebrow ends.
A finger-width line of darker pancake below the cheekbone, from the ear toward the corner of the mouth. Don’t extend the line beyond where your pupil is.
Be sure to use a separate sponge for each color.

, This can give you more definition around your jaw, and help hide extra fat under your chin. With the darker pancake and the sponge, apply pancake to your jawline and the area just under it. On both sides of your face:








Start at your ear and follow the jawline all the way to your chin. To make your chin look narrower, taper the makeup as you approach the chin so that you don’t follow the curve of your chin.
To hide extra fat underneath the chin, follow the jaw under your chin with the pancake as well.

, Apply a line of highlighter pancake down the center of your nose, from between your eyebrows right down to the tip.









With the darker pancake, draw a line down either side of the center of your nose, from the inner end of each eyebrow all the way down to the tip of your nose. At the tip of your nose, taper the makeup slightly inward., With the darker pancake, apply a thin line of makeup across your forehead, just below your hair line. Make the line a little thicker in the area above the natural curve of your eyebrows.







, You can make other features stand out by applying a small amount of highlighter. This includes dabbing a circle of highlighter to the center of your chin, drawing a small V shape in between your eyebrows, and putting a dab of highlighter at the Cupid’s bow (the top center of your upper lip).








To make your eyes pop, apply a semicircle of highlighter under each eye.

, Dampen a regular (not thin) makeup sponge and use this to apply your regular pancake to the remaining areas of your face where you didn’t put highlighter or contour. When you're finished, turn the sponge over and immediately begin blending the makeup so there are no harsh lines, uneven spots, or abrupt changes in color.







, Once you’ve blended the three colors together, allow the pancake to dry and then apply a finishing, setting, or foundation powder over top. Use the brush or sponge to blend the powder in as well.

, Then moisturize your face––the moisturizing cream helps the makeup to stay on longer.

, Use either a powder or liquid one. Powder doesn't really work well with dry skin, whereas liquid foundation sometimes does. If you apply liquid foundation with a sponge, it gives you a smoother and more even finish. After you have applied the foundation, apply a little setting powder.

,


To do this you have to lightly pull down the lower eyelid. Then, with your spare hand, grab the eyeliner and draw along the waterline. This will create the appearance of larger eyes. Repeat for the second eye.

, This is optional but nice.

, However, a normal one works too. Cover it with a shimmery light blue eyeshadow and apply it from the inner part of your lid to the middle of your lid. Now blend.

You could also apply some liquid liner to the upper lid and maybe create a flick at the outer corner of the lid to give it some oomph.

, When the first layer has dried, apply a second one and use an eyelash curler (optional).

,


To do this, get a shimmery nude/white shadow and, using a clean finger, apply it under the outer part of your brow. Blend while doing this.

, Using a blusher brush, apply a pinkish to dark blush.


If you have light skin, don't use a dark colored blush.
If you have dark skin, use a blush that is a tad bit lighter then your skin color. This is because if you use a bright peachy color, it may not look very natural. However, sometimes it does, so experiment.

, Let it soak in a bit, then get a damp flannel and gently rub over your lips. Apply some more Vaseline and leave it. Use a nude coloured lip gloss to slather onto your lips, creating a shiny and plump effect.

, I recommend starting with a liquid foundation that is only two shades lighter than your natural skin tone. Apply your foundation evenly using a brush or sponge. Next, cover any blemishes or dark circles with a concealer that is a little lighter than your foundation. Then apply a light powder foundation on any areas where your face becomes shiny - you want to look as matte as possible.

, Create hollows. Now, take a light grey, brown or mauve powder (blusher or a matte eye shadow works great) and apply it in a sweeping motion in the hollows of your cheeks. To locate the hollows, make a ""fishy face"". Where you suck in is where you apply the color. Blend, blend, blend! This should make your face appear leaner and more undead. Apply the same color along the sides of your nose and around your nostrils to make your features more defined.

, Blend! It should look natural, just adding to your mystical glow.

, If you want a more traditional look, go for a bright red. I have found that browns, grays and purples also look very vampiric and beautiful. Apply it with your finger instead of out of the tube. You want it to appear as more of a lip stain than a glossy lipstick. If you have done a really dramatic eye, you may want to simply apply a bit of concealer over your lips.

;
, When applying foundation for photographs, you want to use a matte foundation. Matte makeup does not reflect light, making it a better choice for photography.To start, use your fingertips to dab some foundation on your cheeks, your chin, the bridge of your nose, and your forehead.








Use a makeup brush to blend the makeup into your face. Use large, circular motions as you move the brush throughout your face.
Go over your face with the makeup brush a few times to make sure the foundation looks blended and smooth. Make sure to blend the foundation into your neck as well, so there is not a sharp contrast between your face and neck. Never stop blending foundation at your jawline., If you're doing an outdoor shoot, you do not need as much foundation. Natural light can make makeup appear more obvious and you may look overdone with too much foundation. Only apply foundation to areas where your skin is uneven and discolored if you'll be shooting outdoors.







, Once your basic foundation is laid down, you'll need to apply some concealer. This can help eliminate the appearance of dark circles under your eyes, and can also highlight certain areas to create a slimming affect on your face.








Use the brush that came with your concealer. Dab some concealer under your eyes. Draw a line of concealer running down the bridge of your nose. Then, add some to your chin and forehead. It may also be a good idea to add some concealer just above you lip.
Use a makeup sponge to slowly dab the concealer into your face. Go slowly and keep dabbing until the concealer is blended into the rest of your makeup.

, For photos, brightening powder can help make your face light up a bit more. It can also help set your makeup and keep it from fading during a photo shoot. Using a large and fluffy makeup brush, dab a small amount of brightening powder on the areas where you applied concealer.







, Even if you don't usually contour, doing so for a photo shoot can help your face look slimmer and more defined.Use a dark stick foundation to trace your face and blend the makeup from there.








Run the foundation from your temples to your hairline. Find your cheekbone by placing your finger on your face and finding the hollow part. Place a line of foundation here. You should also place two lines of foundation running along either side of the bridge of your nose. Trace your jawline with foundation, and then add a dab to your chin. Use a sponge to dab the makeup into your face.
Apply a lighter, powder-based foundation below your eyes, on your chin, and on the center of your forehead. Then, use a fluff brush to blend the light and dark makeup together. Move the brush in the direction of your cheekbones and jaw line, circling the outline of your face with the brush.

, You do not need a lot of bronzer for photos, but it's a good idea to add a light layer. This can outline your face a bit and help highlight your features. Take a small amount of bronzer and use a fluff brush to outline your face. Draw a circle around your face with the brush, applying bronzer along your jawline and forehead.







, Makeup usually photographs about two shades lighter than it actually is. Therefore, it's a good idea to choose a slightly brighter shade of blush to make your cheeks look red and healthy.Pick a bright pink shade of blush and use a fluff brush to apply to your cheeks.








Start dabbing on blush on the apples of your checks. As you dab, move the brush backwards and up slightly.
After dabbing, use circular motions to blend your blush in a smooth, circular line.

, Eyebrows may look lighter in photographs, so it's a good idea to fill in your eyebrows prior to a photo shoot. You'll need a brow brush in a color that matches your natural hair color.








Take the brow brush and start at the bottom of the brow. Work upward, making short and direct strokes with the brush.
Fill in gaps in hair to make your eyebrows look fuller and more pronounced. Keep going until you reach the end of your eyebrow.

, You want your eyes to look bright and defined in photos. Adding highlighter to your eyelids can help prevent them from looking sunken in. Choose a shade of highlighting eye shadow that matches your natural skin tone. Use a large eyeshadow brush to apply it to both your eyelids. Use sideways, back and forth motions to cover the entirety of your lid, as well as your brow bone.







, As with foundation, something sparkly or shimmery won't look great on camera. Stick to solid shades. Matte eye shadow works best here., You want your eyes to look defined. To create this effect, you'll want to apply a shade of eye shadow slightly darker than your skin to outline your eye. You will use a corner eye shadow brush to apply this shade to your crease and the corner of your eye.








Use a corner brush to outline the outer corner of your eye. Then, run the corner brush along your crease.Take a fluff brush and sweep it across your full eyelid in small circular motions. This will blend your corner and crease makeup with the rest of your eye., In order to make your eyes look outlined and defined, take a darker shade of eye shadow. Apply some of this shade to your corner brush. Draw a small line just underneath your lower lash line with this shade. Then, take the same shade you used in the crease. Apply this underneath the makeup you just placed on the lower lash line until it blends out into your face.This will prevent the line from looking unnaturally harsh.







, Once you've finished the main part of your eyes, you'll want to highlight your inner corners. This can prevent your eyes from looking sunken into your face. You'll want to use the same highlighter you applied to your cheeks earlier as it will match the rest of your face.








Use your fingers to dab some highlighter into the inner corners of your eyes.
Take a makeup brush and make swiping motions around the corners of your eyes. This should blend your makeup out.

, Eye liner is important in photographs. It outlines your eyes so they look crisp and noticeable. You can use a skinny brush, such as a corner brush, to draw a line just above your lash line. Keep the brush very close to your lashes as you draw a thin line all across your lash line.








Black eye liner is often recommended over brown shades. Black tends to show up better on camera.

, Once you're finished with your eyeliner, add mascara. To start, take an eye lash curler. Clamp it down on your eyelashes to give them a slight arch. This will make them show up better in photos. Then, take a tube of mascara and apply it to your eyelashes.








Use slow, somewhat wiggly strokes to elongate your lashes and separate them.
If any of your lashes clump, you can turn the brush on its side. Try to separate the lashes with the tip of your mascara brush.

, When it comes to lipstick, brighter tends to show up better in pictures. However, it's best to pick a shade you like. You want to feel bold and comfortable in photos and a lipstick shade you love can help bolster feelings of confidence.








As with other types of makeup, matte lipsticks work best here.
Place the end of the lipstick on your lips. Slowly trace the shape of your lips with the lipstick.

, You do not want to neglect lip gloss when putting on makeup for photos. Lip gloss can help your lips look full and plump in pictures. As with the lipstick, trace the shape of your lips with a complimentary gloss.







, If you're taking a lot of pictures, your makeup may fade throughout the shoot. It's a good idea to finish off your makeup by adding a nice setting spray. Hold the spray about a foot away from your face, close your eyes, and mist your face in spray. This will keep your makeup intact.

, Moisturizing can help your skin stay hydrated throughout the day. Healthier skin will retain makeup easier. Go for an oil-free moisturizer and apply it to your face in the morning before adding your makeup.Check any products you're buying to make sure they're catered to your specific skin type. If you have oily skin, for example, opt for a moisturizer aimed to help with that.
As you want to protect your skin from the sun in the summer, look for a moisturizer with built in SPF for optimal protection.

, Not only does primer make makeup go on easier, it can help you stay cool. The less you sweat, the less damage is done to your makeup. Look for a primer that hydrates the face and helps cool down skin.You can find these primers online, at a salon, and in some department stores.You can also try adding a splash of a naturally-cooling essential oil, like peppermint, to keep your face cool. Just make sure to dilute any essential oil you use with a carrier oil, like olive oil, before applying it to your face.

, Liquid foundations hold up much better under the heat than powder varieties. In addition to opting for a liquid foundation, look for a sheer and light brand. This will minimize sweat and keep your makeup intact longer.Consider a matte finish, as matte tends to reduce shine.
Look for liquid foundations labeled as ""long lasting,"" as these may stay on easier during the summer months.

, Only apply a light layer of foundation to keep your face cool. Instead of applying foundation across your face, focus on covering things like blemishes and discoloration., If you use concealer, only use a small amount. Focus on areas that aren't covered adequately with foundation, such as discolored spots or blemishes only.For best results, use a tinted concealer.

, You can purchase waterproof mascara, eyeliner, and eye shadow at most salons and department stores. These items are vital if you want to keep your eye makeup from running during warm days., Before applying eye shadow, opt for a smooth primer over your lids instead of eye cream. This helps minimize creasing. It also provides something for eyeshadow to stick to. In the heat, it can be difficult to get eyeshadow to adhere naturally to your eyelids., In general, the less eyeshadow you use the better during the summer. Go for a light layer of a cream-based shadows. Creamy eye shadows tend to stay on better than powder varieties.If you're comfortable, you can ditch the eyeshadow altogether and skip straight to the eyeliner.

, Before applying your lipstick, go for the liner. Lip liner helps your lipstick look neater, which can help your makeup look intact in the event of sweat or smudges.It's a good idea to add a lip balm before applying a liner, as this will help lip products better adhere to your lips.

, Big, bold colors don't always look great in the summer months as they can look heavy. Opt for soft nude shades that mimic your natural lip color. You can also try invisible lip liner or lipstick, which makes your lips look smoother without altering the color.Make sure your choice of lipstick matches your lip liner.
Go for matte formulas over creamy glosses/formulas, as mattes look less shiny. Finding lipstick labeled as ""long lasting"" can also help it stay on despite the sweat.

, Bronzer shows up more dramatically in the sunlight, so don't go overboard with contour lines. Keep your bronzer light and natural by applying a light layer to the places where the sun naturally hits your face. Dust some bronzer on places like your forehead, cheekbones, chin, and nose., Too much highlighter can cause caking and creasing. Only apply a light layer of highlighter to areas where it's needed, like to cover circles under your eyes.For best results, use a tinted concealer.

Use makeup remover to clean off any eye makeup left from a previous application.
Dip a cotton pad in cold water and brush it over your eyelids. Doing so should help dry the skin without the use of harsh chemicals while also tightening the pores. Allow the water to dry naturally., If you have notably dark circles beneath your eyes and you wish to create a cleaner look, apply concealer to the area before applying the kajal.









Choose a concealer close to your natural skin tone and lightly dab it onto the dark patches beneath your eyes. Blend it into the skin, working carefully to avoid getting it into the eyes themselves.

, Kajal comes in a variety of forms. Thin pencil sticks are the easiest to use, but you can also find powders, liquids, and gels. Regardless of what you choose, invest in long-lasting waterproof formulas since they'll be less likely to smudge.


For subtle or controlled looks, a kajal pencil typically works best. Sharpen the tip of the pencil periodically to keep the lines thin.
If you want to create a thicker look, you may wish to consider traditional kajal powders that need to be applied with your fingers. Liquid and gels can also create a heavier look, and the applicator wands they come with are typically easier to control.

Get creative.",How to Apply Hippie Makeup," Watch movies and browse online galleries and photos to get an idea of the style you would like to achieve. You might want to have Leigh Taylor-Young's look from I Love You, Alice B. Toklas! or maybe you'd like to go au naturale like Janis Joplin?

, According to your skin color and type, obtain some basics: foundation, concealer, powder, bronzer, eye primer, mascara, liquid eyeliner, false eyelashes, lipstick or gloss. Hippie makeup is very simple unless you are adding in flashy eye shadow or things like sequins or feathers. In that case, you want to choose a nice, bright eyeshadow and possibly visit your local craft or costume shop for the proper accessories and adhesives.

, You want to start with a clean canvas. Gently scrub your face with face soap and warm water. Dry your face by patting it down with a soft towel. Moisturize your face with a moisturizer for your skin type.

, Hippie girls have bright, clean skin that is free of blemishes and dark circles. Apply a thin layer of concealer over anything on your face that you feel is a blemish, i.e. blotches, circles under the eyes, etc.

, You can use a brush or your hand, although using a brush is the better option because it does not spread oil onto your face as using your hand would. Apply a dab of foundation to each major area of your face: forehead, each cheek, nose, and chin. Then, using your tool of choice, spread the foundation together and continue to do so until it has been worked in flawlessly. There should not be streaks or uneven blotches.

, Take your powder, which should be nude and should match your skin tone, and dust a small amount lightly across your face with a fluffy brush. This is so that the foundation can set, preventing it from sliding down your face later.

, You want to use bronzer sparingly because it is darker than your natural skin color. Take a pressed powder bronzer and a fluffy brush and apply small, sweeping amounts of bronzer to your forehead, cheek bones, the bridge of your nose, and your chin. Make sure to blend when using bronzer. This gives your face a healthy, sun-kissed look.

, If you are going for a very natural look, you do not need to use eye primer or shadow. However, if your are going to use these items, then start by applying a small amount of eye primer to your eye lids. Then, using an eyeshadow brush, apply your bright eye shadow all over your lid. Do not go above the crease on your lid otherwise the look will become gaudy. You can also apply a white eyeshadow or eyeliner to the inner corners of each eye to make your eyes look wider and more awake. Use eyeliner and mascara too, if you wish, but keep it to a minimum! You want to highlight your features, not paint them over completely.

, Leave your lips nude or use a nude or soft pink color if you intend to use makeup. After applying, take a paper napkin or towel and press your lips to it a couple times so that the lipstick leaves a 'lip stain'. This provides for a more healthy, natural look.

, If you are going to a party or it's Halloween (or maybe you just feel like it!), you can use sequins, feathers, glitter, and much more to make your look groovy and hip! Using costume adhesive, apply your choice of accessories to the corners of each eye. You can also sprinkle a nude shimmer or glitter to your cheeks for a glow.

It’s important that you use a good foundation to act as a base for your makeup. Select a foundation that is two shades lighter than your skin tone to give yourself a pale look that does not look cakey or so pale it looks like you wearing a white mask.








If you have a darker skin tone, look for a foundation that is two shades lighter than your natural skin tone and also buy white makeup press powder to apply over the foundation. This will give you an ethereal, grayish skin tone without appearing like you are wearing a white mask that is very different than your natural skin tone.
You should also invest in makeup primer, which often contains SPF. Primer helps to prep your skin for foundation and help your makeup last longer. Wearing primer that contains sunscreen will also help to give you a more pale look, as the sunscreen will prevent your skin from tanning.;
, Though the goth look may be dark, this doesn’t mean you can’t have some fun with your eye makeup. Look for eyeshadow in dark shades like black, purple, blue, and red.








Many goths will play their eye shadow color off their lip color and vice versa. Consider how your eye shadow selections might work with the lipsticks you buy to create a total goth look.

, If you are nervous about applying eyeliner or new to using eyeliner, you may want to try an eyeliner pencil first. The pencil is easy to apply and any mistakes can be adjusted with a Q-tip dipped in water or the edge of your finger.








Look for eyeliner pencils in black that are labeled long lasting and non smudging, as you do not want the eyeliner to end up getting all over your face. This would be more of a racoon look, rather than a goth look.

, If you are confident with pencil eyeliner and want to try something new or if you have used liquid eyeliner before, look for liquid eyeliner in black. Liquid eyeliner usually creates a more defined line around your eyes and will stay on throughout the day.








Consider getting waterproof eyeliner if you tend to sweat or your eyes tend to water. This will ensure the eyeliner stays on your eye lids and does not run down your cheeks or get on other areas of your face.

, Black mascara is a must for the goth look, as it will darken your eye area and make you look more vampy. Go for black mascara that will lengthen your lashes and give your eyes an extra shot of dark color.








If you are into playing around with color as part of your goth look, you may go for colored mascaras in darker tones like blue or red. You can apply these tones on your bare lashes or layer them on top of black mascara for a fun, unique goth look.

, The goth look would not be complete without dark lips. While pure and simple black lipstick can look great, you can also play around with darker shades like maroon, dark red, or dark purple.








You may decide to invest in several different dark shades of lipstick so you can alternate the shades depending on your mood. The lipstick colors can also be used to compliment your current goth look for a specific day.

, To get the slick goth look, it is important that you exfoliate your skin with a foaming cleanser and a toner. The foundation will look much better on skin that is smooth and clean.








You should also apply a facial moisturizer to give your skin a supple, hydrated look. This will prevent dry patches from forming on your skin throughout the day as you wear your goth makeup.

, To ensure your skin stays young and damage free, always apply sunscreen to your face. Look for sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30. Alternatively, you can look for a primer that contains SPF so both products are in one package. Sunscreen will also protect your skin from tanning, giving you a more pale goth like look.









Apply primer all over your face in one thin layer using clean fingers. You can also put primer on your neck to protect it from the sun if it contains SPF.

, Once you have clean, smooth surface to work on, take a makeup sponge and apply the foundation to your face. You can find makeup sponges at your local beauty supply store or in the makeup aisle of a department store. You can also use your fingers to apply the foundation, but it can be difficult to apply the foundation evenly with your fingers.








Apply one thin layer of foundation over your skin, making sure you get foundation on areas that tend to get red, such as around your nose, between your eyebrows, and on your chin.
Only apply one layer of foundation, as too much foundation on your face can lead to caking. It can also make it look like you are wearing a white mask, as opposed to lightening your skin tone.

, To keep the foundation in place all day long, use a light face powder. Apply the face powder using a powder pad. Make sure you apply the powder to your entire face so your foundation does not risk getting runny or streaky throughout the day.







, If you are using an eyeliner pencil, you can simply line your eyes with the liner on the top and the bottom of the lash line. Try to create a distinct dark line around your lash line to create a goth look.








If you are using liquid eyeliner, you can create more intricate eyeliner styles. For example, you may want to create small “wings” that extend from your upper eyelids for a winged eyeliner look. To do this, start with the eyeliner on the inside of your eyelid and as you move outward, gently let the eyeliner extend a one inch past the corner of your eye. This will give you a more vampy goth look.
If you have trouble drawing the “wing” with liquid eyeliner, you can use the eyeliner pencil first to draw the wing and then go over it with liquid eyeliner.

, To give your eyes more punch, you can choose a darker shade of eyeshadow and apply it using a makeup brush. Eyeshadow is a great way to make your goth look feel more unique to you.









For example, you may decide to apply a purple eye shadow on your lower lids and then use black eyeshadow on your upper lids and around your eye crease. This will create a dark look for your eyes., Finish your eye look by applying black mascara to your eyelashes. You can curl your lashes before you put on the mascara to help your eyelashes better frame your eyes. Put on one coat of mascara and let it dry. Then, apply another coat is you want your eyelashes to appear darker.









If you have very light eyelashes or very few eyelashes, you may want to apply false eyelashes to give your lashes more definition.

, Complete your look with a dark lipstick in black or purple. You can use a small makeup brush to apply the lipstick or apply it directly from the tube.








Use a Q-tip to remove any imperfections on your eye makeup or your lipstick. Run the Q-tip under your lips to ensure the lipstick looks perfect.

, Goth makeup looks best when it is clean and smooth, so use face mist to keep your makeup in place and to keep it looking fresh. You can find face mist at your local drugstore or in the beauty aisle. The mist is great for keeping your skin hydrated, especially if you live in a hot climate.

Gently pull down the eyelid.,
Draw from the inner corner to the outer edge.,
Close the eye.,
Draw a line that thickens toward the outer edge.,
Smudge as desired.",How to Apply Kajal2," Using the ring finger of your non-dominant hand, gently pull down the skin beneath your lower eyelid. Continue until you can see the waterline.








The waterline is essentially the lower rim of the eye, or the point at which water gathers when tears form. It rests just above the lower lash line.
If you have difficulty exposing the waterline, tilt your head slightly upward as you pull down on your eyelid.;
, Using your dominant hand, drag the tip of the kajal pencil from the inside corner of the waterline to the far outer corner.









Note that the thickness of the pencil tip will determine the thickness of the line. Sharpened pencils will create thin lines, but blunt pencils will create thin lines.
Try to draw the line using one motion to keep it even. Run the pencil over the waterline once for a traditional look, or retrace the area once or twice to create a bolder, more dramatic appearance.
Do not press hard since doing so could cause the kajal to flake and get into your eyes.
Traditional application requires you to put the kajal directly on the waterline, but if you have sensitive eyes, you may wish to apply it directly beneath the waterline, instead.

, Close the eye you're working on so that you can see the upper lash line. You can close the eye completely or close it just enough to reveal that lash line.


If necessary, tilt your head forward to help expose the upper lash line.

, Start at the inner corner of your upper lash line and drag the kajal pencil all the way to the outer edge of the same line. As you approach the outer edge, turn the pencil to thicken the line.









The very tip of the pencil should touch the lash line at the inner corner.
Gradually flatten the tip end of the pencil as you sweep it across your lash line. By the time you reach the end of the lash line, the pencil tip should nearly be completely on its side.
Try to work in one smooth motion across the lash line to create an even increase.

, You can leave the kajal as it is, but if you'd prefer a softer look over a sharper look, carefully smudge both lines by running the tip of an eye smudger brush over them.









Run the smudger brush over each line from the inner corner to the outer edge. Brushing over each line one time should soften the look sufficiently.
Once both lines have been softened as desired, the process is complete.

Tilt your head forward.,
Apply kajal to the upper lash line.,
Extend the line upward.,
Thicken the line with short strokes.,
Tilt your head back.,
Apply a fine line along the lower lash line.,
Curve the line downward.",How to Apply Kajal3," Stand in front of a mirror and tilt your head slightly forward, making it easier to see the upper lash line.


You'll also need to partially close the eye you plan to work on. Otherwise, the upper lash line will remain hidden behind the lashes themselves.

, Gently press the tip of the kajal pencil to the inner corner of the upper lash line. Draw a line directly over that lash line, moving outward toward the outer corner.









Keep the tip of the pencil even, and draw the line using a single motion. Both aspects of your drawing technique will make it easier to draw an even line.
Pause once you reach the outer corner of the lash line, but do not lift the kajal pencil off your eyelid unless doing so is absolutely necessary.

, Once you reach the outer corner of the upper lash line, draw 1








This line should extend just beyond the natural curve of your eyelid. You can connect it to the main line at either a sharp or curved angle; both techniques are acceptable, but they will create slightly different looks.

, Go back over the entire line of kajal, thickening it by brushing the tip of the pencil over the line in short strokes.









Instead of working with the point of the pencil tip, tilt the pencil slightly so that you're working with the side of the point.
From the inner corner to the mid-eye, thicken the kajal without changing the angle or slant of the line.
From the mid-eye to the tip of the outer wing, gradually thicken the line so that it naturally expands toward the wing and meets the wing tip at a point.

, After you finish with the upper lash line, slightly angle your head back to expose the lower lash line.


Closing your eye won't make much difference for the lower lash line. Moreover, since you're applying the kajal to the lash line instead of the waterline, you do not need to pull down the lower lid.

, Draw a thin line of kajal across the lower lash line, moving from the inner corner toward the outer corner.









Draw the line using a single motion and keep the pencil at an even angle. Pause once you reach the end of the lash line, but do not lift the pencil.
Keep this line finer than the line along your upper lashes. You may even wish to start just beyond the inner corner of the lower lash line to create an even lighter appearance here.

, Draw a gently curve off the outer edge of the lower lash line. This curve should be shorter and more subtle than the wing coming off the upper lash line.









The idea is to accent the upper wing, rather than mirroring or competing with it. Drawing a heavy line or a large, angled wing on the lower lash line could weigh down the eye too much and.
Do not thicken this lower wing line. This look is finished once you finish drawing the lower line.

"
Narrow the eye.,
Apply a thick line to the upper lid.,
Blend the line upward.,
Apply more the upper lash line.",How to Apply Kajal4," Close your eye and relax the muscles in your eyelid. You need to expose as much of the eyelid as possible since this style will be blended over the entire lid.


If necessary, you can keep your eye open in a small slit to help you see better and improve your accuracy.
It may help to tilt your head forward since doing so exposes more of the closed eyelid and may allow you to see it more clearly.

, Swipe a thick line of kajal directly over the upper lash line of the eye, moving from the inner corner to the outer corner.









Try to keep the line evenly thick, but don't worry about making it perfectly even or smooth. Most imperfections created during this step will be hidden later.
Create a line of kajal 1/8 to 1/4 inch (3 to 6 mm) thick. You may need to pass over the upper lash line multiple times to make the line adequately thick.

, Take a fluffy eye shadow brush and smudge the kajal upward, working it through the crease and toward the brow bone.








Work in vertical strokes that are perpendicular to the lash line. You'll need to work across the initial line of kajal in short increments, continuing until the entire line has been blended upward.
Note that the kajal should naturally lighten as you brush it upward, creating the desired gradient effect.

, To further accent the gradient, draw another thin line of kajal over the upper lash line, working from the inner corner to the outer edge.









You do not need to blend this line or thicken it. The purpose is merely to darken the starting edge of the gradient.
Once you finish drawing in this final line of kajal, the look is complete.

Wear dramatic eye shadow.,
Try cat eye liner.,
Wear false eyelashes.",How to Apply Evening Makeup1," You may want to wear sparkling or glittery eye shadow at night because it will create a nice look when the lights dance off it. A smoky eye with gray or charcoal shadow is also a good choice for evening makeup..

Try jewel tones like purple or dark green.Try wearing metallic eyeliner or eye shadow. Put a neutral shadow on your lids first, dusting it up to your brows. Then apply the metallic liner or shadow on top of it. Gold pencil liner is one choice that looks great at night.;
, Put the pencil liner at the roots of your lashes and then extend it out a bit at the outer corners. You could do the same look with liquid liner.


You could try the same look with gray or jade eyeliner. Add some black mascara and some eye shadow, and you’re set. Prep your eyes by applying eye primer before shadow so it doesn’t smudge.:
You could also use a black eyeliner pencil and draw dashes on your top lash line very close to the lashes. Then, take a small eyeliner brush, and use it to smudge the liner., You could always add individual lash clusters in the corners of your eyes if you want a more subtle look.


Try using individual eyelashes so it looks more natural. Curl your own eyelashes first, and then apply the single lashes one-by-one.You will want to apply a drop of eyelash glue on the back of your hand. Then, take some tweezers, and use them to dip the lash base into the glue. Then, apply a lash to the roots along your lash line. Finally, apply black mascara. You may not need liner with the boldness of false eyelashes.

, Liquid foundation tends to be easiest to apply and blend and is well suited to nearly all skin types. However, it is not portable for touch-ups and can be messy. crème compact foundation is easy to apply, but may not blend as well as liquid. It is portable for easy touch-ups throughout the day.

Go for bold lips.,
Wear foundation and blusher.,
Pick your eyes or your mouth.,
Try contouring.",How to Apply Evening Makeup2," Lips at night can, and probably should be, more dramatic than in the daytime. A good choice for night: Bold, dark red lips.First, apply lip balm. Then, use a lip pencil in a red or berry color. You will want to use the side of the pencil, not the tip, so you create a more smudged look.
Use a lip brush to apply bold red lipstick to your lips. Even though it’s night, you might want to go a little lighter on the eye makeup if you choose the darker lip route.

, You will likely want to even out your face by applying primer, foundation and powder.


Finish it off by applying rose blush or bronzer on the apples of your cheeks. You can choose a darker blush or bronze at night than you can wear in harsh daylight. A facial primer will help your makeup stay intact, even through a night of dancing.
It’s also a good idea to start fresh, and use makeup remover or wipes to remove all daytime makeup from your face before you start applying your evening look.

, Although evening makeup can be more dramatic, you don’t want to end up looking like a clown. It’s all about balance.


A good rule of thumb is to pick either the eyes or the mouth to dramatize. Dark smoky eyes? Choose a neutral lip. Dark red lips? Choose a lighter palette for the eyes.
You don’t want your eyes and lips to be competing for attention when people look at you. Choosing one or the other to highlight is a more sophisticated choice, usually.

, Many Hollywood celebrities swear by contouring as their secret for a flawless face. Contouring creates a flawless complexion, and it allows you to alter the shape of your face, such as narrowing your nose or making your face look thinner or your cheekbones starker.


You can purchase kits especially for contouring. Generally, contouring involves using a cream or pencil product that is two shades darker than your own skin to shade and redefine areas of your face. You can find different contouring maps online.You apply the contouring makeup in a pattern to create the face shape you want, and then blend it into your skin. This is known as shading. Apply the darker shade beneath your cheekbones, along your jawline and hairline. After blending it in, set it with powder.
Then, you take a lighter makeup stick for highlighting purposes. Generally, apply it under the eyes, down your nose bridge, on your chin and using upward strokes on your forehead. Blend it in with a brush. You don't want lines to show.

Get a manicure.,
Fill in your brows.,
Get some shimmer.,
Consider the venue.",How to Apply Evening Makeup3," If you’ve got a full face of makeup at night, you’ll want to make sure that your nails are just as sophisticated.


Go for dark nail polish. Think blood red or even a dark blue or shimmery gray. You could choose nail polish with a little sparkle for the night.Try gel nails at a nail salon. They provide a harder, more lacquered and ultimately more polished look, but they don’t look as fake as obviously false nails.

, Brows that aren’t shaped can ruin the sophistication of a look. Get your brows waxed or threaded by a professional, and they will upgrade your entire look!


You can also fill in your brows with a brow pencil or with brow powder that you apply to your brows with a small brush.
It’s worth getting your brows done by a professional because they can really alter the entire look of your face. Fill in eye brows with a shade 2 times darker than your natural hair color to look most natural.

, You can create a little sparkle on your cleavage or even on your face with a little shimmer spray.


You could also use hairspray that comes with shimmering sparkles. The goal is to make this look subtle, so the flecks catch the light, say, on the dance floor.
Shimmer sprays sometimes contain gold dust. The flecks are often part of perfumed sprays, so they have the advantage of giving you a signature scent too.

, Just because it’s night doesn’t mean you shouldn’t consider the context. If you’re going to a work event, for example, you might want to forgo the sparkle and shimmer.


If you’re going on a romantic date, you might want to play up a dewy look. However, if you’re going out dancing or to a formal event, rock it.In general, though, because you won’t be seen in natural daylight, which is harsher, night makeup can be a little bolder and more dramatic.

",How to Apply Invisible but Flattering Makeup," Something that will not cake on your skin and leave it looking moist and almost dewy. Once you have found the brand, also buy the matching concealer in the same colour (or one shade lighter if you have dark circles). For this look, I recommend one of the many 'Recover' or 'Sleep effect' foundations now available.;
, Rub the foundation on to the palest piece of skin showing, like your inner elbow and back of your hand. Rub it in lightly and if it disappears, you've got your match.

, First wash your face and apply a rich moisturizer, not a light one, as you want to create a dewy radiance about you. Un-perfumed is best, as it will not sting your eyes when you sweat.

, Brush the hairs upwards with a toothbrush and hold in place with a dab of Vaseline or something similar.

, This shouldn't be too much foundation. Now, with your fingertips, blend it all together in a circular motion until you get even coverage.

, If any blemishes or dark circles show, now is the time to use that concealer. Apply it thinly to the offending areas and leave for 2 minutes to soak in, before using your fingertips to pat it into the skin. If some is still showing, don't worry at this stage.

, Use both patting and circular motions to apply the talc and finish off the blending.

, Pinks are more natural than reds. Form a large smile so that the apples of your cheeks swell, and in a circular motion once again, apply the blusher.

,, Apply a thick bold dusting of eye-shadow onto your upper lids. Where the skin just below the upper lid creases, apply the same amount of shadow again. Blend it all together with your fingers.

, Sweep it across with a cotton bud right into the corners to create a subtle but eye opening line.

, As for the lower lashes, the best thing to do is to wipe the wand til it is almost dry, and dab the remaining mascara gently onto each bottom lash using the wand tip. This looks less obvious.

A clean and oil-free face is best to ensure the makeup application goes smoothly. Next, apply moisturizer because large amounts of makeup can dry out your skin. Lastly, apply a makeup primer to smooth out your features and help the makeup apply more smoothly and come off more easily.Washing is a must to make sure the face is oil-free when you start the makeup. Moisturizer and primer will help you accomplish the look better but are not absolutely necessary.;
, Don’t use anything grease-based like clown paint from the halloween store. Instead, using water-based theatrical makeup, like the one sold by Ben Nye, is often recommended.White Kabuki makeup is also a good option. It is probably easiest to order either of these online, if you have that option available. Use a sponge or brush to apply the makeup to your whole face, avoiding the area around your eyes.


Apply the makeup from the top of your forehead just below the hairline to the sides of your face at the edge of your ear and around your jawline just under the chin. Don’t go all the way under your chin or down onto your neck.
You may need to apply multiple coats so your face is covered completely. You don’t want the makeup to be too caked or become lumpy, but you want your face to appear fully white with no skin showing through.
Don’t apply makeup to your lips.

, Using standard setting powder, lightly cover the whole face. Using a brush or a powder puff are both fine. When using a puff, be sure to dab rather than wipe to keep from smearing the white base you’ve just applied.Setting with powder is not absolutely necessary, but it will ensure a longer lasting look.
At this point, you can also lightly brush hot pink eye shadow or blush on the contours of your cheeks, chin, and forehead.

, You can use an eyeliner pencil, liquid eyeliner, a nude pencil, or even cream eye shadow. The idea is to outline the whole area of the eye that you want to emphasize.The circle should encompass the entire eye socket, from the top of the eyebrows to the lower edge of the eye socket.For people with thick or tricky eyebrows, a light swipe of an Elmer’s glue stick can help straighten them and even them out. It’s safe and washes off easily with water.Don’t worry about making a perfect circle, because you can blend it with makeup in the later steps.

, Don’t be afraid to apply 2 or 3 coats of mascara because you are going for a darker look than you normally would. Using one coat of brown mascara and then one coat of black can give your lashes a fuller look.Mascara and other features don’t need to be perfect given the overall look. It’s also not a big deal if you get mascara on your eyelids since you will be covering this whole area anyway.


If you want to curl your lashes, this is the time to do it.
You can also buy mascara that is specifically meant to create more volume, such as Maybelline’s The Falsies Push Up Angel Mascara or Urban Decay Perversion Mascara.

, Go around the waterline of your eye as you usually would when applying eyeliner, but also cover about halfway up your upper eyelid. Also make sure you get the inside and outside corners well since you won’t be able to get them with paint or eye shadow. Liquid eyeliner works best but pencil is an option.

, Using either an all over eyeshadow brush or a blender brush, blend eyeshadow up from the eyeliner filling in the circle from eyelashes to eyebrow. Then extend shading around the bottom of the eye socket, filling the rest of the circle. One you finish, you should have a fully filled circle around your eye. The circle does not have to be perfect.You have a decision to make here: do you want to stick with a basic black and white look or add some color? You have freedom to style your eyes in a way that most fits the look you want. You can stick with all black or use a vibrant color like blue or pink.

, Place the dots so that they overlap just slightly using the eyeliner from before. If you want a very simple look, you can stick with black filled circle and black dots. If you you used blue or pink, black dots are also good, but if you used black to fill in the circles, you could use bright red paint to make the dots stand out.


Rather than simple dots, you can also draw more elaborate flower petals with bright colors., Start by applying basic lipstick. Bright red or pale pink are the best options, but feel free to pick what you like best. Then, use black lip liner (or eyeliner) to draw a horizontal line across the middle of your lips.You can make the line extend just past the edges of your mouth or you can extend it all the way to your jaw line.
Don’t make it super wavy, but it doesn’t have to be straight as a ruler either.

, This completes the stitching of the mouth.


The size of the stitch lines is up to you, but don’t exceed an inch long.
How close you place them is also up to you, but don’t get them so close that they blend together.

, Use black paint or liquid eyeliner to emphasize the nose. Start on the bridge of your nose and paint at least to the tip forming a triangle with rounded points. You can also paint the whole nose covering the nostrils if you want to.

, Draw two lines, like the points of a triangle, on your forehead with the point towards your nose. Draw a third line down the middle of the first two. Connect all three lines with wavy horizontal lines filling in the web. Depending on what type of shirt you are wearing, you can also add spiderwebs to your shoulders or chest., Using black eyeliner, you can add a small cross to your forehead and one on each cheek. Using red lipstick, draw a small heart on your chin. These touches symbolize the love and spiritual aspects of Day of the Dead.

, You can use flowers to customize the look in a number of ways. Keep it simple with a small flower on the cheek or whole bouquet starting at the temple and continuing down the cheek to your jaw. You can also draw petals around the black makeup on your eyes.

If you find that some of your skin is oily and other parts always need more moisturizer, you likely have combination skin.;
, Undertone is your skin's natural inclination toward pink or yellow. Some skin may be a blend of both (neutral), but more often than not you are one or the other. Honey is a yellow undertone.The easiest way to determine your undertone is to look at the veins on your wrist. If they look green or olive, your undertones are yellow. If they look blue, your undertones are pink.If you still can’t tell your undertone, hold up a white piece of paper to your face. Determine if you seem more yellow, or more pink, compared to the paper.This is your undertone.

Perform a jewelry test.Place a gold bracelet on one arm and a silver one on the other.",How to Choose a Foundation for Dark Skin Tones1," Exposure to the elements, acne, scarring and other skin conditions can cause your overtone, or surface shade, to change and vary. Your skin’s undertone, however, never changes. Discovering your undertone is the key to finding your perfect foundation shade.Avoid using your skin’s overtone to select a foundation shade.
Don’t attempt to change your undertone with makeup. This will end up looking very unnatural.;
, There are three major undertones – warm, cool and neutral. If your skin color ranges between tan and light brown, you probably have a warm undertone. If your skin color ranges between medium and deep, you probably have a neutral undertone. A cool undertone is slightly more unusual to find in darker skin, but it shouldn't be discounted completely.


For instance, someone with deep ebony skin may have cool undertones.Most foundation manufacturers divide their products into the undertone categories of warm, cool and neutral.

, The best place to look is on the undersides of your wrists. Be sure to inspect them under natural lighting. Look closely – do the veins there appear blue-green or blue-purple?Blue-green veins suggest a warm undertone.
Blue-purple veins suggest a cool undertone.
If you can’t tell, or if you see both, you probably have a neutral undertone., Which one looks better on you? Don’t judge based on which metal you like better – which one looks more flattering next to your skin? If silver makes you look lifeless and gold makes you look bright and glowing, you probably have a warm undertone. If gold makes you look washed out and silver makes you look radiant, you probably have a cool undertone.


If neither looks better than the other, you probably have a neutral undertone.

Try a lighter foundation shade.,
Avoid foundations that contain SPF.,
Test the foundation before you use it.",How to Avoid Orange Foundation1," If you notice your foundation turns an unpleasant shade of orange whenever you use it, you may want to try going one to two shades lighter than your normal shade. Sometimes, using a lighter shade can make your foundation appear less dark and make any oxidation less noticeable on your skin. The lighter shade will help to counteract the appearance of an orange tinge on your skin, even if oxidation does occur.You may try using a foundation that is one shade lighter than your normal shade in the same brand or switch to a brand that has a wider variety of shades. Make sure you test the foundation properly on your face to ensure the shade is not too light and will still blend well into your skin.;
, Foundation with SPF is made of ingredients like zinc and titanium. These ingredients can then interact with the color products in the foundation, leading to a change in the shade color.You may opt for a foundation that does not contain SPF so you can avoid a reaction on your face that can lead to an orange tinge. Instead, you may invest in a setting powder that contains SPF so your skin is still protected from the sun but it is not at risk of turning orange.

, You should always test makeup on your skin before you commit to using it full time. You may try wearing a small patch of the foundation on the side of your face for a few hours to make sure it does not react with your skin and create an orange tinge. Or you may apply a full face of foundation and test it out at home for a few hours to ensure the shade does not change color.You should test out all of your makeup products, from foundation to primer to eyeshadow, before you commit to using them on a day to day basis.

Examine your body instead of your face.Overtone – or surface shade – will determine how light or dark your foundation should be.,
Visit a department store beauty counter for foundation samples.Properly identifying your skin’s surface shade will be a trial and error process.,
Test each shade.",How to Choose a Foundation for Dark Skin Tones2," People with darker skin tones tend to have lighter skin on their faces than on the rest of their bodies. When determining your skin’s surface shade, don’t inspect the color of your face alone. Your hands are also unreliable for shade matching. Instead, look at your body as a whole, especially the area from your chest to your jaw.


The goal when choosing a foundation shade is to unify the color of your face with the rest of your body.
Make sure you are using natural lighting when examining your skin color.

, The best approach is to visit a local department store and pick up as many foundation samples and testers as you can. Be sure to grab a variety of different shades.


Once you get them all home, stand in front of a mirror under natural lighting to test them out.
Make sure your skin is clean, moisturized and has no other makeup on it before you begin testing.

, Apply the makeup by drawing a line from your cheek down to your jawline. Do not blend it in. Wait about ten minutes and then examine the swatches. The ones that disappear smoothly into your skin are your best shade choices.Once you’ve narrowed it down, test those shades on your chest, as well, to make sure they disappear seamlessly there, too.


If you have oily skin, try a foundation that’s one shade lighter than what you were expecting. This is because oily skin creates the illusion of darker skin color.If you’re having a hard time finding the right shade, consider mixing two shades together to create a customized tone."

Liquid foundations with heavier textures allow for buildable coverage, so you can even out your skin tone where you need to., Avoid foundations with glow-inducing formulas, which may end up looking greasy. Instead, opt for foundations with semi-matte finishes. A semi-matte finish can help to balance out your natural glow so there won’t be too much shine.


Check the product label to find out what kind of finish it provides.
A completely matte formula on darker complexions can end up looking cakey. A semi-matte finish is the best choice.

, This is a problem that those with darker complexions are probably very familiar with. Limited shade options have long been an issue in cosmetic lines because dark complexions are very nuanced in color and tone.However, some of the higher end foundation brands are beginning to vastly expand the range of shades they offer for darker complexions.
If you are having trouble finding your perfect shade in the drugstore, check the higher end brands at department stores and specialty boutiques.

, However, because irregular pigmentation and dark under-eye circles are typical problems for those with darker complexions, matching the two products isn’t ideal.


When choosing a concealer, opt for something one or two shades lighter than your foundation for best results.

Use a mattifying primer.,
Make sure your face is dry before you apply foundation.,
Dab on the foundation.,
Go for a setting powder that matches your foundation.",How to Avoid Orange Foundation2," If you have oily skin, you may be more susceptible to ending up with orange looking foundation. This is because the oils in your skin can interact with the foundation and change the shade. You can counteract excess oil on your skin by using a mattifying primer on your face before you apply foundation.








Use a clean makeup brush to apply the mattifying primer on clean, exfoliated skin. This will ensure your foundation goes on smooth and is less likely to change shades.

, It is also important that you let each product you use dry well on your face before layering or adding more product to it. Having excess moisture on your face can cause your skin to react with your foundation and lead to a change in the foundation shade.Once you apply a makeup primer or a face moisturizer, let the product dry. Use your fingers to lightly touch your face to make sure the product has dried before you apply any foundation.
You can also use blotting paper or a clean tissue to lightly dab away any excess moisture on your face, particularly on your T-zone area. This would be your forehead, your nose, and your chin.

, Always apply your foundation properly and evenly so it appears fresh and clean on your face. Dabbing the foundation on with clean fingertips or using a clean makeup brush to stipple on the foundation will ensure it dries properly. It can also help to reduce the likelihood of the foundation appearing cakey, thick, or orange.








Try to apply one even layer of the foundation by dabbing or stippling it onto your skin. Blend the foundation in with clean fingers or a clean makeup sponge. Never sweep, rub, or smear on the foundation.

, You can try using a setting powder to help keep your foundation looking fresh and to avoid an orange tinge later on. Look for a setting powder that is the same brand as your foundation, as this will ensure the two products will react well with each other. Using a setting powder made by a different brand can lead to a negative reaction on your skin and oxidization, which can lead to an orange look.








Check that your foundation is dry before you apply setting powder. Use a clean makeup brush to apply the setting powder and make sure the setting powder sits on your skin in one, even layer.

Use blotting papers on any oily areas.,
Moisturize your skin.,
Switch foundations if it continues to turn orange.",How to Avoid Orange Foundation3," You can maintain your foundation throughout the day or night by keeping blotting papers with you. Check your foundation periodically and use the blotting papers to remove any oily areas on your skin. Removing excess oil can help to prevent oxidization and keep your foundation shade from changing color.Always dab at any oily areas with the blotting papers or a clean tissue. Avoid rubbing or scrubbing any oily areas, as this will only ruin your foundation and can lead to breakouts or irritation on your skin.

, You should make sure your skin is hydrated so it does not become dry or flaky. Use a water-based moisturizer to keep your skin hydrated, especially if you have oily skin. Try to get into the habit of applying moisturizer in the morning and at night so your skin stays hydrated.Skin that is dehydrated can end up producing too much oil, leading to oily skin. Oily skin can then cause a reaction with foundation that can lead to a change in the shade.

, If you notice that your foundation continues to appear orange despite adjusting your foundation shade or type, you may need to switch to a different brand. Try several different brands to find the one that is right for you.


Finding the right foundation for your skin can be tricky, so do not be afraid to ask a salesperson for help. You may also want to ask for samples of different foundations and test them all out to find the right brand and shade for your skin type.

Press the highlighter over a blush on the cheeks.",How to Apply Purple Highlighter," Your skin should be as even as possible when you apply the highlighter, so you should start with a foundation. It’s best to use a matte or satin finish formula because the highlighter will add enough glow to your skin. Use a brush or sponge to apply the foundation for the best coverage.For oily skin, choose an oil-free foundation formula to help prevent shine. A powder foundation is often a good option.For dry skin, choose a moisturizing foundation to help prevent dry, flaky patches. A cream foundation is often a good option.
A liquid foundation works well for most skin types. If you have oily skin, choose a matte finish formula. If you have a dry skin, choose a satin finish foundation.
If your skin is mostly clear, you can use a tinted moisturizer or BB cream in place of foundation for lighter coverage.;
, Applying a brightening concealer in a triangle shape beneath your eyes and along your cheekbones creates a base for the purple highlighter. Choose a concealer that’s one or two shades lighter than your skin tone, and draw a triangle from the inner corner of the eye to beside your nostril in the center of the cheek to the top of the cheekbone beside the outer corner of the eye. Be sure to blend the concealer in well for a seamless look.You can use a fluffy concealer brush or a clean finger to blend in the concealer. A brush works best with liquid concealers, while a finger usually works best with a thicker cream formula.
If you have discolorations on your face that you wish to conceal before applying the highlighter, don’t use the brightening concealer -- it will draw attention to the spots. Instead, use a concealer that matches your skin tone exactly for blemishes and other discolorations.

, To ensure that your foundation and concealer stays in place all day and the highlighter applies smoothly, it’s important to set your face makeup with a setting powder. Use a fluffy powder brush to lightly dust the powder over your entire face.If you want extra coverage from your setting powder, use a pressed powder.
If you prefer a lighter look with your powder, opt for a loose, translucent setting powder.
If you have very dry skin, you may want to skip setting powder because it can accentuate dry patches.
Make sure to set the concealer under your eyes too. Use a small, fluffy brush to dust lightweight, translucent powder over the area.

, The most common spot to apply purple highlighter is the tops of the cheekbones. Use a small, tapered highlighter brush to sweep the highlighter above the cheekbones and back toward the hairline to add a pretty glow and help shape the face.Make sure to tap any excess highlighter powder off the brush before applying it to your skin. Excess powder may fall on other areas of the face where you don’t want the highlighter.
While you can wear purple highlighter no matter what your skintone, it can sometimes look ashy on darker skin. To combat the ashiness, apply a layer of a gold or peach highlighter over the tops of your cheekbones first and then dust the purple highlighter over it.

, You can add brightness to the center of your face by applying the purple highlighter to the bridge of your nose. A highlighter brush may be too thick for your nose, so use a small, fluffy eyeshadow brush to lightly apply the highlighter down the center of your nose.For the most flattering look, it helps to contour your nose on either side of the highlight. Use a small, tapered shadow brush to apply a contour powder in a line on both sides of the highlight and blend well. Contour powders should always be cool-toned with gray undertones to mimic the look of shadows, but it’s especially important to choose a cool contour powder when you’re using purple highlighter.

, You can draw attention to your lips by applying a little of the purple highlighter to your cupid’s bow, or the small indentation just above the center of your top lip. Use a small tapered eyeshadow brush to lightly dust the area with the highlighter.When you’re using a purple highlighter on the cupid’s bow, it’s important to choose your lip color carefully. Cool shades, such as blue-toned pinks, lilacs, and plums, are good options., Before you use the purple highlighter to accent your eyes, you should apply your usual eye makeup. Put on your eyeshadow, liner, and mascara as you normally would, even if it means not wearing any eye makeup.Choose cool-toned eye makeup to pair with a purple highlighter. Other purple shades are a particularly pretty option. A soft smoky eye with gray shadows can be a lovely combination too.
If you don’t like a lot of eye makeup, you can even substitute the purple highlighter for shadow completely and sweep it across the lids. Finish with mascara, and you’ll have a pretty but subtle eye look.

, Because the purple highlighter will draw attention to your eyes, it’s important to ensure that your brows look neat and polished. If you have full eyebrows, comb them with a brow comb and use a clear gel to keep them in place. If you have sparse eyebrows, fill them in with a powder or pencil and then use the gel to comb them into place.For the softest, most natural look, use a brow powder to fill in your brows with a small, angled brow brush.
A brow pencil is a better option if you want a more dramatic, precise look for your brows.

, If you want your eyes to look a little larger, applying some of the purple highlighter on the bone beneath your brow can make a big difference. Use a wide, flat shader brush to lightly sweep the powder beneath your brows.Make sure to blend well so you don’t have a stark line of highlighter beneath your brow.
If you prefer a more subtle highlighter look, just apply the highlighter beneath the arch of your brow.

, If you didn’t get much sleep, fake a wide-awake look by adding the purple highlighter to the inner corner of your eye. Use a small pencil brush to lightly dab the inner corner near the tear duct for a look that instantly brightens your eyes.If you don’t have a small pencil brush, you can tap your pinky finger into the purple highlighter and gently press it into the inner corner.

, If you want your eyes to look brighter and more awake, it also helps to add a little of the purple highlighter to the center of your lid. Use a small, flat shader brush to lightly pat the highlighter on just the center of your eyelid over your shadow to catch the light.Make sure to keep the highlighter just on the center of your eyelid. Don’t extend it into the crease.

, While your purple highlighter is likely marketed for use on the face, you can also use it add glow to your body. Dust it over your collar bones and the center of your shoulders when you’re wearing outfits that expose them. Sweep it down the center of your shins when you’re wearing shorts, dresses, or skirts to help make your legs look longer.When you’re applying the purple highlighter to your body, it’s best to use a large, tapered brush. That will allow you to work more quickly, but still keep the highlighter right where you want it.

Tap your finger into the purple highlighter and then lightly dab it on the center of your bottom lip for a fuller look.Make sure that you’re wearing a cool-toned lipstick, such as a blue-based pink, lilac, or plum shade.

, If you want major glow for your face, you don’t have to keep your purple highlighter contained to your cheekbones. Instead, apply it to the apple of your cheek over a blush on your cheeks with a tapered highlighter brush and blend well for a more intense glow.You should coordinate the blush with the purple highlighter so stick to cool shades, such as blue-based pinks, plums, and lilacs.

Set your foundation with powder and apply the rest of your makeup.",How to Apply Stick Foundation," Your complexion is the shade of your skin and can change from sun exposure or skin conditions. You always want to try a foundation on to make sure it matches your complexion. Standing in natural light, swipe potential foundations across your cheek or near your jawline. The right foundation will disappear, blending perfectly with your skin.If you can't find a foundation that matches, try choosing the shades that are closest (one slightly darker, one slightly lighter), and mixing them to make a perfect match.You can also buy the lighter foundation and add a bronzing powder later to warm it up.;
, Just as important as matching your complexion, your foundation needs to work with the undertones of your skin. Generally categorized as warm, neutral, or cool, your skin undertone always remains the same (unlike your complexion, which can change with exposure to the sun). Buying a foundation for the wrong undertone will make your foundation look off, even if it perfectly matches your complexion.Find your undertone by looking at the veins on your inner wrist. If they are green, your undertones are warm (yellow). If they are purple or blue, your undertones are cool (blue or pink). If you can't tell if the veins are purple or green, your undertone is neutral (a mix of yellow, gold, pink, or blue).Look for foundations that are specifically made for your undertone and labeled for a warm, cool, or neutral skin tone.
If the foundation brand doesn't mention undertone, try to find one that matches your undertone. Look for yellow or gold for warm; pink, red or blue for cool; neutrals can experiment with foundations with undertones from both ends of the cool/warm spectrum., Your type of skin can influence which foundation is right for you. Stick foundations may be made for all skin types (check the labeling), but for the most part they're best for oily or combination skin. If you don't know whether your skin is dry, oily, normal, or combination, wash your face with a gentle cleanser and notice how your skin feels after 15-20 minutes.If your face feels moist or oily, your skin is oily.If your skin feels tight, tingly, or dry, you have dry skin.If your skin feels soft and clean, you have normal skin.If your skin feels oily in your T-zone (your forehead and nose), then you have combination skin., Before applying makeup it is especially important to wash your face with a gentle cleanser formulated for your skin type. Removing dirt and oil from your face will help keep your pores clear and lessen the likelihood of blackheads.


Make sure your hands are washed and cleaned as well, as you will be touching your face quite a lot and you don't want to transfer dirt or bacteria.

, The moisturizer will keep the foundation from drying out your skin. A little moisturizer can also make it easier for you to spread the foundation over your skin since the stick is solid and more difficult to smooth evenly over your face than liquid foundations.Avoid moisturizers that are too rich. A day cream or heavy moisturizer that makes your skin oily can cause your foundation to oxidize and turn darker or even orange., Primer is an optional step, but most beauty experts think it's worth it. The primer gives the foundation something to cling to so it will stay put all day. Plus, it smooths your skin so your foundation won't settle into wrinkles or dry spots.Choose a foundation that is right for your skin type (oily, normal, dry).
Use primer if you live in a humid climate or plan to visit one. The primer will keep your makeup from smudging and ""melting"" off your face.Some foundation sticks come with primer already added.

, You don't want the foundation stick to come out as far as a lipstick would. The farther out you twist the foundation, the easier it will be for it to snap off or break during application.


If you are worried about bacteria on the end of the foundation stick, wipe the top with a cotton pad dipped in alcohol or a makeup cleansing wipe.

, Swipe it once across your forehead, on the bridge of your nose, under both eyes, your chin, and cheeks. You may want to add a little near your jawline as well so you can blend the foundation down to your neck.The foundation is not meant to be a mask--it is supposed to even out your complexion. Applying the foundation to these specific spots will give you enough product to cover your face and still look natural.
Dotting the foundation, as opposed to swiping, will put less product on your face and give you a lighter layer. If you're not sure how much foundation you need, try dotting it on first. It's easier to add more later than to take it off.
If you don't want to put the foundation directly on your face, you can use your fingertips to apply it to your skin. The heat from your fingers will warm up the foundation and may make it even easier to apply.
Try not to apply foundation with a makeup sponge, as this absorbs a lot of foundation and is a waste of product., You don't want to rub the foundation into your skin as you blend, rather, you want to sweep and pat the makeup. The center of your face usually has the most discoloration, so make sure you have ample coverage there.Always blend the foundation outward, toward the edges of your face.


Blend, blend, then blend some more. This step is key to getting a natural-looking application of foundation. Check your hairline and neck to make sure you don't have an obvious line where your makeup ends.
Use your ring fingers to blend the foundation--it is the weakest finger and will ensure you don't pull on your skin too much.
You can use a makeup sponge or brush to help blend your makeup if you would prefer not to use your fingers.
If you have any blemishes or dark circles under your eyes and want a little more coverage, simply dab a little more foundation in these areas and blend gently.

, Some foundation sticks are mattes, which should stay in place on their own.Otherwise, a dusting of translucent powder will set the foundation and absorb excess oil, which can cause your foundation to oxidize and turn dark or orange."

A beauty blender is a good tool to use if you want to have flawless base as it will make sure your foundation does not have a caked-on appearance. Use less and build up your coverage if needed. Do not apply lots, as it may look caked-on.
A powder foundation or mineral makeup will give a much lighter coverage while still appearing flawless.;
, Even if you have dry skin, this is a crucial step, as you do not want your makeup to move throughout the day.

If you are dry skinned, then use powder lightly or in some places.
If you're oily skinned, then it is recommended to use all over your face.
Do not powder too much as it may turn cake-like.
Do not buff or rub as this may disturb and move the makeup. Lightly bounce on the skin and once applied all over, then buff into the skin.

, Rub a dime-sized amount of facial moisturizer into your face and neck to hydrate your skin.Moisturizing your skin will keep your powder foundation from looking dry. Allow the moisturizer to sit on your skin for 60 seconds for it to absorb fully., Squeeze a pea-sized amount of primer onto a fingertip and smooth over your face, working from the center outward.Work the primer into any areas of enlarged pores or creases for an even base. Primer makes pores appear smaller and fills in fine lines for more flawless makeup application. It will also make your foundation last longer.Putting on too much primer can leave your skin slick, as many are silicone-based and don’t absorb the same way lotion does. With that in mind, it’s best to put on just a little at first and use more as needed.

, Move the makeup brush back and forth over the pressed powder in short strokes to coat the bristles. Tap the edge of the brush against the sink to shake off any excess powder. This will ensure you don’t have too much product on the brush., Use gentle pressure to roll the brush over your skin, working from the center outward, to apply the foundation. Do this all over your skin for a smooth natural look.If you are wearing a low-cut top, you can apply makeup over your neck and décolleté as well for a smooth finish.

, Using the same rolling motion, apply additional powder over any areas you’d like to cover more. Do a couple rolls at a time, and then pause to check the area in the mirror. Stop when the coverage is to your liking. This will ensure the areas you want camouflaged are hidden without putting excess makeup on the entire face., Wet a beauty sponge with lukewarm water and dab it into your pressed powder. Use the makeup dampened sponge to apply your powder, gently dabbing the sponge against your skin as you work from the center outward. This will provide heavier makeup coverage if you have widespread blemishes or lots of discoloration you want to hide.This technique should be used before applying any pressed powder foundation with the foundation brush, if desired. Doing so after could cause your makeup to look cakey.

, Most pressed powders come with a built-in puff that can ensure smooth application even when you don’t have your brushes.

Add more foundation to problem areas.",How to Apply Powder Makeup1," Like other types of foundation, you want to match the skin tone of your face as closely as possible. If you're having trouble picking the right shade, try asking a beautician at a department store or beauty supply shop for assistance.


Powder foundations generally work best with oily skin. However, there are now hydrating powder foundations on the market for people with drier skin.;
, Paint a thin layer of primer across your face using your fingertips. You should only use about a pea-sized dollop. Primer will give you a smooth canvas to work on and will help powder makeup adhere for longer.

, Avoid applying too much foundation at once, as this can create a ""caked on"" appearance. How you load your brush will depend on whether you're using loose or pressed powder foundation.


If you are using pressed powder from a compact, gently press the tip of the brush into the powder and gently move it back and forth.
For loose powder, start by tapping a small amount of your powder out onto the lid of its bottle. Dab your brush into the powder and tap it to remove any excess., Use a rounded kabuki or foundation brush for best results.Make sure the layer is evenly applied across your face. Use long, light strokes to apply., Look for any blemishes or areas of redness that are not totally concealed by the light layer of foundation. Apply more foundation to these spots until they disappear. For these areas, load the powder onto the side of your brush. Roll the loaded brush directly onto these spots, pressing down slightly into your skin."

Pick the right color.,
Load your makeup brush.,
Smile while looking in the mirror.,
Dab on the blush and blend backwards.",How to Apply Powder Makeup2," If you feel that your skin is looking a little dull, some blush will brighten your complexion. Like other types of makeup, it's important to find a color that complements your skin tone. Try to find one that creates the same color your cheeks make when your face flushes. Some general guidelines are:


If your skin is very dark, you can use vibrant reds, apricots, and berries as your blush. These colors look bold when in a compact, but they will blend in well when brushed onto your skinMany different colors work well with medium skin. Apricot, taupe, bronze, and coral are examples of the most popular blushes for medium skin.
Fair, pale skin looks best when paired with classic pink blush., Start with a clean makeup brush, preferably a blush brush. Blush most often comes in the form of a pressed powder compact. However, loose pigment used as blush has been gaining in popularity. Keep in mind that you want only the slightest hint of color; avoid overloading your brush.


For pressed powder, run your brush lightly across the compact once or twice. Flick your wrist with the brush over the pressed powder to remove any excess if necessary.
For loose pigment, start by placing the lid of its container flat on the table with the inside facing up. Shake a tiny bit of powder onto the inside of the lid. Dip your brush into it and tap against the edge of the container to remove excess., Many people struggle with blush placement, and applying blush to a relaxed face can be a gamble. Smiling will make the apples of your cheeks prominent and easy to brush blush onto without overdoing it., Dot the tiniest bit of blush onto the apples of your cheeks. Make buffing motions with your brush to blend your blush's edges. Try to work it back slightly towards your temples, following your cheekbones."

Start with a primer.,
Pick your eyeshadows.,
Use an eyeshadow brush.,
Load your brush with the lighter color.,
Apply the lighter shade all over your lid.,
Load and apply the darker color.,
Blend your colors together.",How to Apply Powder Makeup3," Pick an eye primer or eyeshadow base to help your eyeshadow better stick to your skin. Special eye primers work best, but a general makeup primer will also be fine.Use your fingertips or a fine brush to add a thin, even layer on all skin you plan on adding eyeshadow to. This will generally be your entire eyelid and the area slightly below your eyebrows.

, In general, you will want at least two shades: a lighter base shade and a darker lid shade. These can be similar or completely different colors. As with other types of powder makeup, eyeshadow can come in compacts as pressed powder or in small jars as a loose powder. Loose eyeshadows tend to be more vibrant but difficult to work with. These often contain pigment without binders and are therefore also called simply ""pigments.""

, Picking a fine pencil brush will be easier to work with. However, wider brushes can be used when shading a large area, such as your entire lid. Shadow brushes with a rounded tip are generally best when working with loose pigment.You may also choose to use a sponge applicator instead, but blending with these takes a lot more time., Be careful not to overload your brush. Too much powder can cause eyeshadow fallout on your cheeks. Remember that you can always easily add more eyeshadow, but removing it without ruining the rest of your makeup is much more difficult.


If you're working with pressed powder, simply run your brush back and forth over your eyeshadow once or twice.
If your lighter shade is a loose pigment, tap a small amount into the lid of its jar. Dip your brush into the smaller amount of pigment. Tap your brush on the side of the container to remove excess powder., Generally, you will want to use this lighter shade as a base. To do so, start with the bottom of your lid and sweep up. Stop somewhere below your eyebrow., Load your brush with darker eyeshadow the same way as you did with the lighter color. In general, you will apply the darker shade across your entire eyelid, stopping at the crease. Do this with a single sweep of your brush, starting from the outer corner of your eye towards the inner corner., Using your brush, sweep the border between the two colors back and forth a few times. Try to make the blended area as close to your eyelid's crease as possible. Avoid pressing down too hard by using light strokes. Repeat until the two colors have blended together seamlessly at their border."

Apply foundation first.,
Choose the right powder.,
Load the powder onto a brush.,
Dust your face with powder.,
Blend the powder into your face.",How to Apply Powder Makeup4," Setting powder should be added after foundation and concealer but before lip and eye makeup. Setting powder is most important when using liquid or cream foundations, as it will reduce shine and help to keep your makeup from sliding off your face. It can also be used to extend the wear time of powder foundation., Pick a powder that is either translucent or close to your natural skin tone. Make sure the product is advertised as a finishing or setting powder and not powder foundation.


Powder that matches your skin tone will give extra coverage when concealing blemishes. However, it has the tendency to look thicker than translucent powders.
Translucent powder can match all skin tones and looks less caked on compared to tinted powder. Just be sure to blend translucent powder extra well, as flash photography can make it stand out.Like most types of powder makeup, setting powder can be either a loose or pressed powder.

, Take a large, fluffy makeup brush and dip it into the powder or brush it across the compact. Tap or flick the brush lightly over the container once or twice. This will remove any excess powder from the bristles.

, Apply with light movements, focusing on the center of your face. Take care to go over your T-zone, the outer corners of your nose, your chin, and your cheeks. Avoid the outer edges of your face., Use a kabuki brush or some other type of densely-bristled makeup brush. ""Buff"" the powder using small circular motions all across your face.

Before you move on to the next step, allow your skin to rest for 2 to 3 minutes.


If you don’t have sensitive skin, consider using a gentle exfoliator.;
, Mineral makeup will not adhere, or bond, to dry skin. Applying moisturizer to your face will help your makeup stick to your face and last throughout the day. Wash and dry your hands. Use your clean fingers to apply moisturizer to your face a neck. Let the product settle into your skin for ten minutes.


If you have oily skin, consider applying a mineral-based makeup primer in addition to your moisturizer., Concealer provides additional coverage for dark spots, red patches, and blemishes. To apply this product, use a concealer brush. Move the brush over the area you wish to cover in the feathery strokes. Apply several light layers of concealer to the area.


Apply a green mineral concealer to red patches of skin.
Apply a yellow mineral concealer to mask dark circles.
Apply a concealer matches your skin tone to blemishes.
This product should be applied before you put on mineral foundation., Mineral foundation is traditionally applied with a kabuki brush. This large makeup brush is designed to buff on the mineral makeup in large, circular motions and its short bristles provide fuller coverage. The brush also holds a lot of powder.


Pour, or tap, a small amount of mineral powder into the lid of the jar. You will need less powder than you expect—a little goes a long way.
Swirl your kabuki brush inside of the lid until it takes up all of the mineral powder.
Tap the brush on the side of the lid to remove any excess powder., Mineral foundation is applied to the face in a light, circular motion. This method of application ensures even, full coverage. Begin by framing your face with the mineral makeup. Gradually fill in the remaining areas—don’t forget to apply the mineral foundation to your ears, eyelids, neck, and underneath your chin., Mineral foundation should be gradually built up in thin layers. This will create a natural look.


Reload your kabuki brush with more mineral powder.
Apply the product to your face and neck with large circular brushstrokes.
Repeat if needed., After you’ve applied the mineral foundation, you can add a flush of color to your cheeks with a mineral blush. If you prefer a sun-kissed look, apply a mineral bronzer to your face.


Tap a very small amount of blush or bronzer into the lid—use much less powder than you think you may need.
Swirl your powder brush inside the cap until all of the blush or bronzer is gone.
Tap the brush on the side of the lid.
Apply a small amount of blush to the apples of your cheeks and brush back towards your hairline.
Apply a small amount of bronzer to your forehead, cheeks, nose, and chin., Tap, or pour, a tiny amount of mineral eyeshadow into the jar’s lid. Swirl your eyeshadow brush around the lid until it contains all of the mineral powder. Tap off the brush on the side of the lid. Apply the eyeshadow from the outer corner of your eye to the inner corner with quick, downward strokes.


To complete the look, add mineral mascara to your lashes. , Mineral veil is a finishing powder. This product will give you a nice, healthy glow while helping to keep your makeup in place. To apply this product:

Clean your face using soap and water and then pat dry your face with a clean, dry towel. If you normally use facial moisturizer, use it prior to applying makeup.;
, Make sure you select the right brush for applying powder foundation. The type of brush you choose depends on how you want to apply your makeup.Most people use a rounded kabuki brush, which you can purchase at most department stores, to apply powder foundation. However, if you're applying powder foundation on top of a liquid or cream foundation, you may want to use a rounded foundation brush. The coverage with these kinds of brushes is usually more sheer.
You should also keep in mind how thick of a brush you want, regardless of whether you're using a foundation brush or a kabuki brush. If you want fuller coverage, use a thicker brush. For light coverage and touch ups, use a lighter brush., Use swirling motions to lightly coat your brush in your powder foundation. Hold the brush horizontally as you work, working the foundation into the bristles of the brush., Use circular motions to apply the foundation to your cheeks, forehead, under your eyes, and any areas where you notice discoloration on your face. If you have any pimples or acne, cover these areas with a light dusting of powder foundation.Go slowly when applying foundation. Applying foundation in a rush can cause it to smear.
Powder foundation may spread or clump lightly when applied. This is usually okay. You can remove clumps when you finish applying.

, This can also be used to smooth and blend the foundation so that it looks natural. Foundation should not change the color of your face too much; it should just make your complexion look smoother.If your makeup looks caked on, try blending it a little more into your skin.
If you still see the powder after you've blended it well, you may need to choose a different color that is closer to your skin tone.

, If you need heavier foundation, it's a good idea to use a sponge over a brush. Sponges generally make foundation look darker and can cover more blemishes and dislocations. You can buy makeup sponges at most department stores. Some powder foundations come with a makeup sponge., It's a good idea to start light with powder foundation. Take the sponge and dip it in your powder foundation to apply a generous amount. Gently dab the sponge on your face, applying a thin layer of foundation for full coverage.If you're applying powder foundation over another layer of foundation, like liquid foundation, be particularly gentle. You do not want to risk smudging your base coat of foundation.Use a finishing brush to get rid of excess powder and blend in clumps.

, Wet the sponge and dip it in your foundation. Any areas where you want more coverage, like under the eyes, can be covered with a wet sponge. Dip the sponge in a bowl of water, then wring out the excess water. Next, dab the wet sponge into your foundation.Apply it to your face using a circular motion, focusing on problem areas.If you're targeting difficult areas, like under the eyes or near the nose, you may want to fold your sponge in half for a more precise application.When you're finished, use a finishing brush to get rid of any excess powder and blend the foundation so it looks natural.

, If you want powder foundation to last for the day, primer is key. Primer is liquid makeup you apply underneath foundation. Primer makes your foundation look more natural and helps prevent it from creasing. It can also help keep foundation on all day long. When using powder foundation, make sure to apply a layer of primer first.When applying primer, start from the inside of your face and work out. Dab a few dots of primer on your nose, under your eyes, and on your cheek and chin. Then, use your fingers to spread the primer evenly across your face., Mineral or light foundation is for light to medium coverage. If you want more coverage, go for pressed powder, which tends to go on darker. You may also choose to apply a layer of mineral foundation and target problem areas with pressed powder., To see if a foundation is a good color match for your skin, dip a q-tip into the foundation. Draw a line along your jawline area on the side of your face. If the line is invisible, this makeup is a good match. If you can see this line, you'll want to try a different shade.You may have to experiment with several different colors before you find a shade that works. Try asking someone working at a department store makeup counter to help you find a match. This way, you can try out makeup on your skin before making a purchase.

, You should always use a sponge or brush when applying foundation, especially powder foundation. Using fingers tends to make your makeup look caked on, and your fingers will provide far less precision than a solid makeup brush or sponge., Foundation should not go over your entire face. Foundation is only supposed to be used on the areas where you really need it. You should apply foundation to areas prone to redness, like your nose and cheeks, and use it to cover acne, blemishes, and minor skin discolorations. Coating your entire face in foundation can make your makeup look overdone."

That means even if you know how dark or light you are, but don’t know your natural underlying pigments, you can still buy the wrong color. Think about whether your skin matches warm colors like red, yellow and orange, or cool colors like blue, green and purple.


Drape gold and silver fabric around your shoulders one at a time. This helps determine if you look better in warm or cool colors.
Your veins can be used for quick reference. If they look blue or purple, you have a cool skin tone. If your veins look green, you are warm. Sometimes, you cannot tell what color they are and may have a neutral tone.
If you burn easily in the sun, you may be cool toned.
If you do not burn easily in the sun, you may be warm or neutral.;
, Not only do makeup lines have different tones, but they also have many different shade levels to choose from. Think about if you’re fair, light, medium or dark-skinned, then narrow your choices down. Look at the shade of your foundation for reference, if you’re happy with how it matches.

, Depending on what you’re covering, concealer should be the same as your foundation or one to two shades lighter. Covering under-eye circles and highlighting should use a concealer one to two shades lighter. Concealer for blemishes should be the same shade as your foundation.


Use pink tinted concealer to neutralize blue under-eye circles.
Use green tinted concealer to better cover blemishes or red areas.
Use yellow tinted concealer to even out skin tone overall., Liquid concealer comes in a squeeze tube or in a stick-like container that already has a wand applicator tool. If your concealer doesn’t come with an applicator, decide on whether you want to use your finger, a small brush or a Q-tip.


A small brush or Q-tip is best for covering acne.
You can use your ring finger or a brush to cover under-eye circles.
A makeup sponge can be used to blend.

, Before you apply liquid concealer, it’s important to wash your face with a gentle cleanser. Exfoliate your skin, if you haven’t in a while. Using cleanser on a clean, soft cloth in circular motions works great, but you can also purchase products especially designed for exfoliation. Apply a light moisturizer, after you pat your skin dry.








, Because of liquid concealer's lightweight consistency, it’s best to apply foundation first. This will prevent all your hard work from being wiped away by a foundation sponge.Sometimes you may not want to wear foundation. In this case, concealer can be applied to trouble areas for a more natural look.







, Do not put concealer on everywhere. It is meant only for small areas that need extra coverage. It’s great for red areas around the nose, the inside corners of the eyes, and pimples. You can use a little more to highlight your brows or line the perfect lip, but don’t go overboard.








, Applying too much can look like you have a mask around your eyes or it can cake up. You can use the same tool to apply your concealer as you will to blend. If you're covering a large area, work in sections to prevent the liquid concealer from drying. Apply and blend to under-eyes, then move on to other areas.








, When brightening under-eye circles, apply the concealer from the corners that are closest to the nose and fan around the circles with your finger or applicator. It’s important to use your ring finger, if you forego a formal tool, because it will be gentle on this delicate area. You can also draw an upside down triangle under your eyes and blend for an extra lifted look.








, Take a small amount of your concealer and dot each blemish with it. Use your applicator or a sponge to gently dab and blend the liquid into the rest of your face. Set this with a loose, translucent powder. If you need more coverage, you can repeat this step until you get a flawless finish.








, After you apply your concealer in little dots, it’s important to blend it into the rest of your skin, no matter what you’re covering. Use your applicator tool to gently dab and rub the concealer in. You can pat with your ring finger to blend around your eyes. The warmth of your finger melts the concealer into your skin for an imperceptible blend. A sponge or brush will blend blemishes best.








, To prevent your concealer from slipping out of place throughout the day, it's important to top it off with powder. Use a loose, translucent powder for a natural look. If you need to even out your skin a bit more, you can apply solid, cake powder with a large brush or sponge.









Make sure non-translucent powder is one shade lighter than your foundation. Applying powder to wet concealer makes it look darker.Use blotting paper or rice paper for extra setting power, after you apply and blend concealer., If you have a concealer one to two shades lighter than your skin, you can use it to highlight. This works great under the eyes, because it lightens up the shadow there. Enhance your cheekbones, nose and brow bone like this as well.








Apply a dot to your brow bone and blend to make your eyes and any eye shadow pop.
Highlight the tops of your cheekbones.
Make your nose look more narrow by applying and blending concealer from right below the eyes to the tip of your nose.

, Just because it’s an off-label use, doesn’t mean concealer won’t work great on your lips. Regardless of the rebellious use, concealer can enhance and even change your lip shape. Use it to prevent lipstick from bleeding or fake a Kylie Jenner pout.


Apply liquid concealer around the outside of your lips to make a crisp line between your skin and a colorful pop of lipstick.
Apply over the entire lip area and set with powder to reline lips outside their natural edges.
Use it in the middle of lips for a highlight that will make them look plumper. Finish with a nude gloss.

For sensitive skin, make sure the foundation doesn’t contain dye, preservatives or fragrances.;
, Avoid powder foundation, which is drying and can look caked-on. Use liquid foundation for full coverage. Choose stick foundation for full coverage and to cover up blemishes.For anti-aging effects, choose a hydrating liquid foundation with a satin finish, ideally using glycerin or hyaluronic acid.
If you’re traveling and want to take your foundation in a carry-on, opt for the stick version.

, Don’t test the foundation on your hand or wrist. Smear a bit of foundation from a test sample onto your cheek, nose and jawline. Go out into natural daylight and see if the shade matches your skin.You can order foundation samples or ask for some at a department store makeup counter.
The lighting in a store is not an accurate reflection of how the foundation truly matches your skin.
Foundation that is too light will make you look pale. Too-dark foundation can look like you overdid bronzer.

, Wash your face and pat it dry with a clean towel. Use a washcloth to gently rub off any flakes if you have a skin blemish, and apply spot treatment to it. Apply moisturizer to your whole face.To make your makeup last even longer, spritz primer on your face after cleaning and moisturizing.

Take the time to apply your usual foundation before you begin to apply any highlighter and apply concealer if desired.








Use a sponge or makeup brush to blend your foundation well all over your face.
If you have any dark circles or minor imperfections, use some concealer to add a little extra coverage to those areas. This will make it easier for you to draw attention to the highlighted areas as well.
You can also use concealer to map out the areas where you plan to apply highlighter. Try applying a few dots of concealer onto the bridge of your nose, on your cheekbones, down the center of your forehead, under your eyes, and in the crease on your chin. Make sure that you blend the concealer well.;
, Take a blush brush or a kabuki brush and use it to apply a bit of highlighter from your temples to the tops of your cheekbone in a C-shaped curve. You can apply one layer for a subtle effect or apply multiple layers for more intense highlights.







, Get a bit of highlighter onto your fingertip and then dab it onto the tip of your nose. Move your finger back and forth to blend the highlighter. Remember that you do not need much highlighter, just a small dab.







, To accentuate the center of your forehead, you can sweep some highlighter down the center of your forehead towards the bridge of your nose.Start at the center of your hairline on your forehead and sweep straight downwards.









If you want a more dramatic highlighting effect, then you can sweep the highlighter all the way down the bridge of your nose, but this is optional.

You can apply a couple of layers if you want a more dramatic effect or just apply a light dusting for some subtle highlights.

, The areas just below your eyebrows will catch a lot of light, so this is a nice area to highlight. Try sweeping highlighter over your brow bones, the areas just under your eyebrows.








Try to keep most of the highlighter on the outer edges of your brow bone. You do no need to apply highlighter to your entire brow bone.
You can also extend the highlighter down towards the creases of your eyelids for an extra eye brightening effect., The area in the center of your upper lip is called your cupid’s bow and highlighting this area will draw more attention to your lips. Get a small amount of highlighter on your fingertip and press it onto this area.

Decide what you want your primer to accomplish.,
Evaluate your skin and decide if you need a color correcting primer.,
Figure out your skin type--oily, dry, or normal?,
Check to see if your foundation is oil- or water-based.,
Wash your face with a gentle cleanser.,
Apply moisturizer.,
Squirt a pea-sized amount of foundation on the back of your hand.,
Apply the primer to the center of your face and use gentle, circular motions to blend it outwards.,
Allow the primer to dry completely.",How to Apply Foundation Primer," Are you most concerned with wrinkles and fine lines? Discoloration? Toning down shine on oily skin? There are tons of primers on the market, so take the time to examine your skin and think about what will work best for you.Check the labels or research online to find the primer that will fit your unique needs.


If you are worried about enlarged pores or wrinkles, search for pore-reducing and anti-aging primers.
Primer should always be used if you are going to airbrush your makeup.;
, If you have dark spots on your skin or dark circles under your eyes, redness, or sallowness, you can find a color-tinted primer that will neutralize the discoloration. Complimentary colors cancel each other out, so if you have a red or ruddy skin town, the color opposite red on the color wheel (green) will neutralize the red.









Keep in mind you don't necessarily need to use a color-correcting primer at all. You can absolutely use a primer that goes on clear.
Primer with a greenish tint can correct extreme redness. This is especially helpful if you get a sunburn on your face.Yellow primer works for a light red or pinkish complexion.If you have bluish dark spots, hyperpigmentation, or bruising, try orange or peach-tinted primer.If your skin is yellowish or sallow, try a lavender tinted primer., Primers have different ingredients, weights, and textures that will work better with different skin types. If you're not sure what kind of skin you have, wash your face with a gentle cleanser and let it air dry. How does your skin feel after 15-20 minutes?


If your face feels moist or oily, you have oily skin.Try a mattifying primer to tone down shine and soak up the oil.Primers with salicylic acid also absorb excess oil.If your skin feels tight or dry, you have dry skin.Look for a gel-based or illuminating primer that won't dry out your skin.If your skin feels soft and clean, you have normal skin.Experiment with different primers to see what feels best and gives you the effect you want.

, You want to choose a primer that has the same base as your foundation so they don't repel each other.Also pay attention to whether or not the foundation has silicone, as this can sometimes interact poorly with oil-based foundations and make them appear spotty.When trying out a primer, ask for a sample first and try some on your hand. Once it is dry, apply a little of your foundation. If the foundation goes on smoothly, then you know your foundation and primer can work together.Patch-test any silicone-based primers before putting them on your entire face--some people with sensitive skin have allergic reactions to silicone.

, It's important to remove all dirt and impurities from your face before you begin covering it with makeup. Equally important: clean your hands. You may be applying your primer and other makeup with your fingers, so you don't want to be spreading dirt on your face, either.








, Primer is not a replacement for moisturizer, and you should not skip your moisturizer for fear that it will be too heavy. Moisturizer nourishes your skin and keeps it healthy and, while some primers may have moisturizing properties, their main purpose is to make your foundation last.








Make sure you allow your moisturizer to sink in and dry completely before you begin to apply primer. If your skin feels dewy, wait a few more minutes for the moisturizer to be absorbed., Using too much primer can cause your foundation to pill or clump, and you really shouldn't need more than a pea- or raisin-sized dab to cover your face and neck.







, The motion should be similar to the one you use when applying your moisturizer.Work the product evenly into your skin so you get smooth, even coverage. Make sure you blend it up to your hairline and over your neck as well.









Don't forget the skin around your eyes. If you aren't using a separate eyelid primer, then very gently pat the primer onto your lids so your eye makeup will stay on and really pop all day.
Use your ring and middle finger to gently spread the primer over your face. You can use sponge or makeup brush as well, but it's not necessary.Apply a thin coat of primer over dry lips to keep your lipstick looking bold and to keep it from settling into fine lines around your mouth., This should only take a few minutes. Some people choose to skip foundation altogether, especially if they're just looking to minimize the appearance of their pores or add brightness to their complexion. Otherwise, you can apply your makeup as normal.


Apply a light layer of foundation and build up if you need more. The presence of primer means you will actually end up using less foundation.Your foundation should glide on smoothly and should not settle into creases or wrinkles, as it would without primer.
Once you've applied your foundation, you may want to set it with a quick dusting of translucent powder. If your primer and foundation are silicone-based and oil-based, this can help keep your makeup from smudging."

The toner will help balance the pH of your skin. It will also help tighten pores and make them less noticeable. The moisturizer will help keep your skin feeling smooth and soft. It will also help prevent foundation (especially powder-based ones) from looking flaky.









If you have very sensitive skin, try using a rosewater-based toner, witch hazel, or an alcohol-free toner. This will make it sting less.
If you have oily skin, consider using a lightweight or an oil-free moisturizer.;
, You don't need a lot; a little bit goes a long way. Primer will help fill in large pores and fine lines. This will make your skin appear smoother. It will also make the foundation easier to apply and blend in.








, This will help prevent any blending issues. Keep in mind, however, that the foundation may also wipe away the concealer.If you are using any other type of foundation, hold off on the concealer for now. Apply the concealer after you put on the foundation for the best coverage.

, If the foundation is pressed, sweep a makeup sponge across it. You can also swirl a powder brush across it. If the foundation is loose, lightly dip the brush into the powder. Gently tap the handle against the counter to shake away extra powder. Do not use the makeup sponge to apply loose powder.

, Shake the bottle first. This will help mix up the pigments inside the foundation. Then, pour out some foundation onto the back of your hand or onto a little dish. This will help prevent you from accidentally picking up too much foundation.


If you are using a makeup sponge, consider soaking the sponge in water first and then squeezing it to get rid of the excess water. This will keep the sponge from soaking up too much foundation and wasting it.
Avoid using a powder brush with soft bristles. Try to get a foundation brush. It will have stiffer bristles that can hold the weight of the liquid foundation.
You can also apply liquid foundation if you are in hurry. Use your fingers to help blend the foundation, as the heat from your fingers will warm the foundation and give you a smoother appearance. This will not give you full coverage, but it will give a nice, natural look.

, Cream foundation usually comes in a compact case. It may also come in a tube, sort of like lipstick. Simply swipe the sponge or brush across the surface of the foundation. If your foundation comes in a stick, you can roll the stick over your forehead, nose, cheeks, and chin. Use your fingers or a foam sponge to blend it in.


Don't use a powder brush to apply cream foundation. The bristles will only stick together. Use a foundation brush. Its stiffer bristles will hold up to the weight of the cream foundation.

, No matter what type of foundation you are using, or what type of tool you are using to apply it, it is always a good idea to start from the center if your face. Simply brush the foundation down the center of your face.









If you are using your fingers, consider creating little dots instead. Blend these dots in with your fingers or a foam makeup sponge.

, You want the foundation to get thinner as you get closer to the sides of your face. If it gets too thin on your cheeks and you want more coverage, dab more foundation onto your cheekbones and blend it outwards.








, Brush the foundation up towards your hairline. Then, brush it to the left and right above your eyebrows.








, Use your brush, fingers, or sponge to pull the foundation down towards your chin. Then, spread it sideways along your jaw.








, Always blend from the center outward. You want the foundation to fade the closer it gets to your hairline and the sides of your face. This will create the smoothest transition and prevent any harsh lines.








, This is great for those who have dull or grayish skin on their necks.








, Use a brush or your fingers to tap it onto the area that needs to be concealed. Then, blend it into the foundation using light, feathery strokes. Always blend outward, away from the center of the concealer spot.








If you are applying concealer under your eyes, use your ring finger. This is the weakest finger on your hand, and thus the gentlest.
Applying concealer after foundation makes it easier to blend in. It also lessens the chances of the foundation getting wiped off.

, This can take anywhere from 1 to 5 minutes. Some foundations, such as cream, are oil-based and will never fully dry. Other foundations, such as powder, are already dry to begin with.

, At the point, you can apply the rest of your makeup, including your lipstick, blush, and eye makeup.








, You can use a powder foundation or a setting powder. Both will help give your skin a smoother finish and get rid of shine. They will also help soak up any excess oils.








, Most powder will be compact or pressed. If you are using a loose powder, simply dip the brush into the powder.








, You can also tap the brush handle against the counter edge. This will keep you from applying too much powder at one time, which can result in a cake-y look. You can always apply more powder later.







, Start from the middle or your face and brush outward. If needed, dip your brush into the powder and keep dusting your face. Always tap off the excess powder before you touch the brush to your face.








, Look carefully into the mirror. If you see any excess powder, take a clean brush and lightly dust it off.








, There are many different types of foundation. Some are better for certain skin types than others. The main three are: powder, liquid, and cream. Here's what you need to know based on your skin type:If you have dry skin, go for a moisturizing liquid or cream foundation. Avoid using powder foundation. It will make your skin appear even more dry. If you must use a powder foundation, choose a hydrating one.
If you have oily skin, choose a lightweight, oil-free liquid or powder foundation. You can also use mineral-based powder foundation; it will absorb the oil better. Don't use cream foundation. It will be too heavy and oily for your skin.
If you have normal skin, you can use any type of foundation you want: powder, liquid, or cream.
If you have combination skin, consider using a powder foundation. Use more on the oily parts, and less on the dry parts.

, There are also different types of foundation finishes. Some are more sheer while others are more matte. Here's what you need to know:Use a semi-matte foundation if you want a natural look. Most foundations are semi-matte.
Use a dewy or illuminizing finish if you want to give your skin a healthy glow. This is great for the cold, winter months.
Use a matte or flat finish if you want your face to look smooth. This is great for pictures. It will also get rid of shine.

, Some foundations are sheer and light, while others are thick and heavy. Use a sheer foundation if you want to just even out your skin tone, but still let your natural features (such as freckles and beauty marks) show. Use a full coverage foundation if you want to cover freckles, dark spots, and other blemishes. Keep in mind that for things like pimples, you might also need to use a concealer.

, You skin will be lighter during the winter months when there is less sunlight. It will be darker in the summer when the sun is brighter. As such, the foundation you use in the winter may be too light for your skin during the summer, and the foundation you use in the summer will be too dark for you in the winter. To avoid these problems, get a darker shade to use during the summer, and a lighter shade to use during the winter. You can mix the two shades as your skin tone lightens or darkens during the spring and fall., When shopping for foundation, choose a few shades that you think match your skin tone. Apply each one along your cheek. Wait one to two minutes before looking at the foundation again. Choose the color that blends into your skin the best., You can use powder foundation to soak up any excess oil or shine. You can also use a setting powder to set your makeup and keep it from moving around.

, The type of foundation you use will determine what you use to apply it. Here is what you need to know:Use a fluffy powder brush to apply powder foundation. This will work on both pressed and loose powder. You can also use this brush to apply setting powder when you are done doing your makeup.
Use a foam makeup sponge to apply pressed powder foundation, liquid foundation, or cream foundation. They are usually white, and come in wedge or disk shapes. They will give you the smoothest, most even coverage.
Use a foundation brush to apply liquid or cream foundation. They are made with slightly stiffer bristles than a powder brush. They are flat and have a slightly rounded tip. They will give you the most coverage.
Use your fingers to apply liquid foundation if you are in a hurry. This won't give you the best coverage or the smoothest finish, however.

Most makeup lines have a numbering system in place to help guide your choice, but each system only applies to that particular line. Most brands go with numbers from 10 to 50 or 1 to 10, with the higher numbers for darker skin.;
, Most foundation is targeted at a particular undertone, summarized as ""C"" for cool, ""N"" for neutral, or ""W"" for warm.Some makeup companies even mix tones for an even closer match to your skin, so you might also notice letter combinations like “NC” or “NW.” Picking the wrong foundation could leave you with an ashy or coppery appearance. This is especially important for people with dark skin color, but everyone can benefit from this test:








Examine your skin without makeup on, under daylight or neutral white light.
Hold a piece of yellow fabric or gold jewelry under your chin. If this gives your face a healthy glow, you have warm undertones.Hold a piece of red fabric or silver jewelry under your chin. If this complements your face well, you have cool undertones (which can range from red to blue).If it's hard to tell, you likely have a neutral tone, or you may need different foundation for different areas of your face.
Or for a quick but unreliable test, check the veins on your inner wrist. Blue means cool undertones, green means warm, and bluish-green means neutral., This is easiest with department store samples, but you can get a rough idea at the drugstore by holding the bottle up against your face and looking in a mirror to see how well it matches. Makeup fans argue quite a bit over where to test the foundation, but each side makes good points. However, don’t test the foundation on your arm because the skin here is usually darker than the skin on your face. If you want to be extra secure, test them both:








Your jawline will be at the edge of the foundation. If the color matches here, you'll have an easier time blending it in.
Your chest (if regularly exposed to sun) is usually close in color to your face. Testing it here also ensures that your face won't end up a completely different tone than your body.

, Unless you spend your day under bright department store lights, what you see in the store won't be what you get.Head outside with a mirror while you have the samples on your skin. The sample that blends in to your skin tone almost invisibly is the perfect choice of foundation. Give the foundation a few minutes to dry and oxidize before you judge it. After it has dried, check to see how it looks.









If you plan to apply bronzer and blush, your face will end up a bit darker than the foundation.In this case, it's sometimes preferable to go one-half to one shade lighter with your foundation.
If nothing is quite right, mix two foundations together on your skin.

, Both sides have strong adherents and strong detractors. Some things you may want to keep in mind when deciding which type o foundation is right for you include:









Liquid foundation provides more control during blending. However, poor blending or an imperfect tone match can leave obvious lines where the foundation ends. If your skin is oily, choose an oil-free or non-comedogenic example.
Powder foundation (especially mineral powder) absorbs oil and sweat, but can settle into a caked-on appearance, even adding definition to wrinkles and scaly skin. Use a light touch to minimize this effect.
You can wear both at the same time. Applying a liquid foundation first and then applying a light layer of powder foundation can also help to set your makeup and make it last longer.

, You've spent all this time choosing a foundation, but you have one final decision to make. The finish is a matter of personal preference, guided by a few principles:








Most foundations are semi matte (even if not labeled as any particular finish). These work well on almost all skin types.
Matte foundations work well for toning down oily skin.
Illuminating foundation increases shine and can help to diffuse wrinkles.

, The form of concealer you choose depends on your skin type and where you plan to use it:








Liquid concealer is the default option, great for covering acne and wrinkles.
Stick concealer and cream concealer are much thicker, which spells danger for oily skin. Bust one of these out for big jobs, such as dark eye circles and angry red patches.
Cream-to-powder concealer rubs on as a cream, then sets fast. This is handy for on-the-go corrections, but tends to get cakey after a few hours.

, Concealer hiding blemishes on most of your face should be as similar to your foundation as possible. If you're concealing larger dark patches, especially dark eye circles, you can afford to go one shade lighter.








Puffy eyes actually look best with slightly darker concealer, unexpected as that is. The brain interprets dark areas as shadows, making the puffy area appear further back than it really is.

, Concealers come in any finish from matte to satin. Non-matte concealers usually need to be set with powder after application.








, Vividly tinted concealer is designed to hide discoloration. This is based on the color wheel: two opposite colors will cancel each other out. If you want to hide dark eye circles, veins, or other colorful areas, read the full guide or learn these basic rules:









Cover green discoloration with red concealer, and red areas with green concealer.
Cover blue discoloration with orange concealer, and vice versa.
Cover purple areas with yellow concealer, and vice versa.
Dark eye circles are usually combination of blue, purple, and sometimes green. Experiment to find the right shade of orange, salmon, peach, or coral that works on your skin.

, Wash with warm soapy water before handling makeup tools or touching your face. Dirty hands may transfer bacteria to your face.








, This will protect your skin and make the makeup appear more natural. If the moisturizer doesn't include sun protection, apply sunscreen as well.








Optionally, apply foundation primer over the moisturizer. This is most helpful for people with oily skin, to create a smooth base for the foundation and it will also help your makeup to last longer.

, If you're covering dark eye circles, port wine birthmarks, or other colorful areas, apply the color-correcting concealer of the opposite color on the color wheel. Blend this in, but don't expect it to disappear; the foundation and the skin tone concealer will hide it.









When applying to the eye, tap the concealer on, working from the outside of the eye inward to the nose. You only need to apply it to the darkest area, then dab upward in a sweeping motion to thinly cover the rest.This is the most difficult type of concealer to use. Practice with different amounts and shades until it works out., Use a makeup sponge, your fingertips, or (for liquid foundation only) a foundation brush. Brush across your entire face and blend until the foundation is evenly applied, taking care not to wipe away too much of the color-correcting concealer. A stippling brush works well for blending.









If using liquid foundation, warm the container in your hand before applying.
Although many makeup users apply concealer first, this wastes time and product when the foundation sweeps away some of the concealer. The exception is powder foundation, which should be applied over the concealer.

, Check your jawline, where poor blending is most visible. If you see a line, extend your foundation a bit below the jawline and blend it into your neckline.This will help to give your makeup a more unified look. If the foundation looks too thick or caked on in any location, tap it with a bare powder puff.All you need is a thin layer.








, You may apply concealer to your entire face if desired, but in most cases all you need to do is cover areas of uneven tone, acne, and other blemishes. Dab gently with a finger, concealer brush, or sponge until you cannot see the break between concealer and the surrounding skin.








, Do this immediately after applying your concealer to provide a nice matte finish and hold the makeup in place. You may want to skip this step if your face is feeling extra dry, as powders can absorb moisture.








, Once the concealer and foundation are as blended as possible, you're ready to rock a natural look, or use it as a base for highlighting, contouring, and so forth. Whichever you choose, enjoy your even, blemish-free look.

Use cleansing water to reduce redness, as this suds-free cleanser is infused with anti-inflammatory agents that will calm your skin.
Cleansing balms, packed with emollients, are great for adding moisture to dry skin.
Pick a cleansing mud for oily skin, as the charcoal and clay will remove excess oil and degunk pores.
For combination skin use a cleansing gel that removes oil and still delivers light moisturization.
Choose a cleansing milk for sensitive skin, as these have less water and more nourishing ingredients.;
, Everyone should apply a moisturizer with an SPF to their skin before putting on makeup. This will help protect your skin from the sun’s damaging rays as well as create a glowing look. If you have dry skin, choose a creamy moisturizer. If you have oily skin, pick a gel-based moisturizer.







, Primer can smooth out the surface of your skin and minimize the look of pores. It also combats shine and helps your makeup stick to your skin so it doesn’t fade throughout the day. You can choose a cream, gel, or powder primer. Apply it with your fingers to work the product into your skin.







, Concealer can be applied either before or after your foundation. Cover up pimples or other blemishes with a bit of concealer. Squeeze a small amount onto the back of your hand and dot it onto the blemish with clean fingers. Be sure to blend it by lightly tapping the concealed area with a sponge or brush.







, Color-corrector should actually be applied before your foundation. Use color-corrector to cover up dark circles under your eyes or uneven patches of skin. Different color-correctors are suited to different issues:Pink corrects blue-toned spots on fair skin.
Peach targets blue or purple shadows on medium skin.
Orangey-pink conceals dark spots on dark skin.
Yellow neutralizes purple or dark shadows on olive and tan skin.
Green cancels out redness.
Lavender camouflages yellow tones.

, You don’t want a heavy, caked-on look, so it’s best to start with a little bit of foundation and add more if you need to. Dab the foundation on the center of your forehead, under your eyes, and on your nose and chin.







, Start at the center of your face and spread the foundation toward your hairline and neck. You can use your fingers, a brush, or a sponge to blend your makeup. No matter what you choose, you want to use a stippling technique, which means gently tapping it into your skin, rather than rubbing or wiping.








Use your fingers if you want only a little coverage. Be sure to wash your hands first.Use a brush for light and even coverage. A synthetic brush is best, and you should spread the foundation by buffing in small circles.Use a sponge for more coverage. Clean your sponge regularly to avoid bacteria buildup., Use your tool of choice to blend your foundation around your face. There shouldn't be any noticeable lines where your foundation starts or ends; it should blend smoothly into your ears, neck and hairline.







, If you have particularly uneven skin in certain areas, acne, dark spots, or under-eye circles, use your foundation to touch up these areas. Use a concealer brush to apply foundation more heavily on these spots. Make sure to blend it in well to prevent light or dark dots on your face.







, Finish up your entire face by applying a setting powder over your foundation. This is a translucent, matte powder that helps prevent your foundation from sliding around while also preventing oil buildup from showing through.







, It is important to know whether you have dry, oily, normal or combination skin before applying foundation. This will determine what foundation is right for you. Many foundations are specially designed for different skin types.A light foundation, such as mousse is great for oily skin. You can also choose an oil-free liquid or powder foundation.A liquid foundation with a built in moisturizing element is perfect for dry skin. You can also choose a hydrating powder or stick foundation.Apply a powder foundation if you have combination skin. This allows you to distribute more of the oil-absorbing makeup where you need it and less where you don't., As the name implies, your foundation is the basis for the rest of your makeup. To make sure that it acts as a blank canvas, choose a foundation that matches your skin tone identically. Try multiple shades of foundation on your face (rather than your hand or your neck), and stick with the color that matches your skin tone without blending., Most people can simply grab any medium coverage foundation, but if you have specific coverage needs, keep those in mind. Visit the makeup counter at a local department store and try on versions on each to determine which feels the most comfortable and looks the most realistic on your skin.Loose powder provides the lightest coverage.
Pressed powder provides light coverage.
Aerosol foundation provides medium coverage.
Liquid foundation provides full coverage.
Cream foundation provides the most coverage.

For best results, do this scrub every one to two weeks.",How to Make a Coffee Scrub Mask for Glowing Skin," This will prevent the mask from getting into your hair. With a hair tie, pull your hair into a bun or ponytail. Using a headband for extra protection is also a good idea.;
, Tons of germs and bacteria are on our hands from touching things throughout the day. Using a hand soap of your preference, lather it up between your hands and rinse it off.

, Cleaning your skin before a facial is crucial since it makes the mask work its magic more effectively. Wash your skin by using a face wash made specifically for your skin type and massage it into your skin with circular motions. Once you have massaged your skin for about a minute or two, you can now rinse off and pat dry.

, In a small bowl, add coffee grounds, coconut oil, and honey. Mix the ingredients together with a spoon until well combined.

, With your hands, scoop some of the mixture and begin to work it into your skin in a circular motion. However, don't rub too hard as this may damage your skin in the long run. Exfoliate your forehead, nose, cheeks, chin, and neck for 20-30 seconds in each area, but don't overdo it.

, After exfoliating your face, rinse the scrub off your face with cold water to close your pores, making sure there is no leftover scrub on your face.

, Using a facial moisturizer that suits your skin type, warm the moisturizer in your hands by rubbing your hands together. Then, press the palms of your hands against your face. This method helps absorb products better rather than rubbing the cream into your skin.

, Remember that you won't see drastic results immediately―it takes time, so don't get discouraged.

Keep your environment humid.,
Use rich moisturizers.,
Use superior quality cosmetics/makeup products that will help your skin balance its moisture and not lose it.",How to Hydrate Aging Skin," This is one of the most important steps in mature skincare since it removes dead skin cells buildup and freshens up the dermis, leaving the skin prepared to absorb much easier all the nutrients in your skincare routine. Plus, it makes your skin look younger by removing the accumulated debris, polishing pores and fine lines and giving an overall glowing appearance.;
, As redundant as this might sound, it is crucial to protect your skin even more as you are starting to age. Due to hormonal changes, especially in women, the skin is more sensitive to sun damage, sun spots, moles and other formations that tend to appear around this period. Protecting your skin with a good SPF lotion (the higher the better) will improve your skin's chances of safeguarding its already slowing collagen production and overall skin elasticity.

, If you stayed away from oils most of your life due to oily/combination skin problems or acne issues, now is the time to pack up for 'the drought'. Organic Rose Hip oil is highly recommended due to its light consistency, anti oxidants and fatty acids. However, you can also use avocado oil, apricot kernel oil or grapeseed oil. A tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil is more than welcome, in both daily alimentary use as well as skincare routine.

, If you're a fan of facials or facial procedures that involve steaming, try cutting back on these habits because your skin has started producing less collagen and maintaining less moisture. The harsher you treat it, the drier it will become. Make sure you clean your face properly and follow your usual cleansing program (facial treatments at the salon or at home), however be gentle when using heat.

, Make sure you drink tons of water and tea (chamomile, mint, berries, ginseng, etc). Water will not only increase your overall cell hydration but the anti oxidants contained by plants will literally prepare your skin much better than plain water and also help your organism by 'washing up' and easing the activity of your internal organs, such as kidneys and liver. Herbal teas are a good method of detoxifying your body at home or under the direction of your physician.

, Make sure you're taking two Omega 3 supplements daily, B vitamin complex as well as calcium doses. Your skin needs as many nutrients as your body and hair do.

, If you live in excessively dry climates or your workplace has a penchant for excessive heating/air conditioning, remember to place a large water bowl anywhere near you, preferably on a shelf where it cannot get uncomfortable. The slow evaporation of water will incorporate into the atmosphere and your skin will not lose as much moisture as it normally would.

, Now it's the time to splurge with those thick face cremes you probably stayed away from throughout your teens/youth and adulthood. Make sure you gently massage the creams into your skin and let it drink it up. While you don't necessarily have to go for the most expensive brand out there, make sure you pick a line/cosmetic product your skin appreciates, packed with fatty acids, fruit oils and anti oxidants. There are many famous brands that have established themselves in the anti-aging department; investing in something of quality will only improve your skin and help it become hydrated and youthful again.

, Now is the time to invest in a quality foundation and powder, switching to products for skin that's one step drier than your normal type- if you have/had oily skin, switch to normal skincare line/makeup, normal-to dry, dry-very dry. It will improve the overall condition of your skin through extra pampering and accommodate more moisture into the upper layers of the skin while allowing you to maintain your usual makeup routine.

Try a physical exfoliant.,
Use a chemical exfoliant.,
Keep your shower short.",How to Get Soft Skin in 20 Minutes1," Focus on the areas that need the most work. In good light, look for patches of skin that look scaly or extra dry., Physical exfoliants buff away dry skin through mechanical means. For instance, pumice stones and foot files are physical exfoliants. For parts of your skin that aren't as rough, body scrubs that have sand or grit in them also work well.In addition, something as simple as a washcloth can work as a gentle exfoliant.For body scrubs, rub them on your wet skin. Move your hand in a circular motion to scrub it in, concentrating on problem areas. Rinse off the scrub when you're done.For foot files and pumice stones, use them in the shower or directly after the shower to gently scrub down your rough heels or elbows., Another type of exfoliant is a chemical exfoliant. They use chemicals to break away dead skin; they can also melt away the dead skin itself. Generally, these involve acids.For dry skin, trying using products with AHAs, such lactic acid or glycolic acid. For oily skin, use ones with BHA or salicylic acid.When your skin is wet, use small circles to apply the exfoliant. If your skin is extra dry, try applying it with a loofah or a washcloth.Concentrate on problem areas. Use smaller circles in problem areas to make sure you get the exfoliant scrubbed in well.Rinse off the exfoliant., The longer you're in warm water, the more chance your skin has to dry out. Water takes off your skin's natural layer of oils, so don't shower more than 5 to 10 minutes a day."

Don't use products with ethyl alcohol.",How to Get Soft Skin in 20 Minutes2," As soon as you get out of the shower, apply a lotion or cream. You may need to use more than one type; a non-oil based one for most of your body and an oil-based one for problem areas like your feet and elbows. Applying it right after you shower traps moisture next to your skin, helping it sink in.Also, you may want a separate facial lotion, as well, that isn't oil-based., With lots of new ingredients on the market, you may find that a new moisturizer works better for you than your old one. For instance, matrixyl, ceramide, and coffee berry extracts can help moisturize skin, and creams and lotions with vitamin C can help moisturize and exfoliate, as do ones with vitamin A., This type of alcohol can dry your skin out, so look at the ingredients before buying. However, other types of alcohol, such as as cetearyl, cetyl, lanolin, and stearyl alcohols (which are actually fatty acids), are fine for your skin."

Try olive oil.,
Use honey.,
Apply coconut oil in place of a moisturizer.",How to Get Soft Skin in 20 Minutes3," Some people have luck with putting olive oil on their skin about 30 minutes before they hop in the shower. Shower as you normally would. After you shower, apply a thin layer of olive oil under your moisturizer.


You can also use olive oil to create your own physical exfoliant. Mix one part of olive oil to one part of brown sugar. Scrub it in as you would other exfoliants, by going in circles all over your body. Jump in the shower to rinse it off.

, In a pan, melt one part beeswax. Mix it together with equal parts of olive oil and unprocessed honey. Once it's cool, rub it on your skin. After about 10 minutes, take a shower to rinse it off.

, After you get out of a shower, try using a thin layer of coconut oil. Rub it in as you would lotion. Continue to massage until it disappears.

Stay hydrated.",How to Get Soft Skin in 20 Minutes4," Before going to bed, make sure to remove your makeup. You can use a cleansing cloth if you're really desperate to get to bed. However, it's best to wash your face if at all possible to help remove grease and grime. It also helps prevent acne, so that your face will stay smoother.Use a cleanser instead of soap, as it is less drying. Look for one that doesn't have sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS), as that can also dry out your skin., Stick to lukewarm showers and baths for softer skin over time. Hot water can dry out skin, leaving it rough and leathery., Foods rich in these fats can help moisturize your skin, making it softer. Try introducing fish such as salmon, herring, and tilapia to your diet.If fish isn't your thing, try walnuts, grass-fed beef, flaxseed oil, edamame, or enriched eggs., How hydrated you are affects your skin, so keep on top of your water intake. Try adding fruit slices to your water to help increase your intake.By some calculations, men should be getting 13 cups of water a day, and women should be getting 9 cups."

Talk to a doctor.",How to Heal Dry Skin on Legs," When you shower, you wash away a lot of the natural oils in your skin. Those natural oils not only keep your skin moist, they also protect your skin from damage which can cause even more dryness. If you shower too often, you might be removing more of these natural oils than your skin can replace, leading to dry legs.


Try showering every other day or every third day. If you have to shower in between, use colder water and only soap the most affected areas (like armpits).
Showering for too long or too often can also cause problems. Bathe for no more than 10 to 15 minutes at a time, no more than once per day.;
, The other part of your bathing routine that removes a lot of your natural, protective oils the temperature you set your shower or bathwater to. Really hot water clears your skin of those natural oils and dries you out. You’ll want to switch to water which is only just barely warm, if you want to keep from irritating your legs.


Most people don’t have a water thermometer they can use with their bath or shower, so how do you know how hot is too hot? Use the general rule that if you wouldn’t put a baby in it, you shouldn’t put yourself in it either. Test the temperature against the most sensitive parts of your skin (like the insides of your wrist) and otherwise keep the water as cold as you can stand it.

, Soaps which are designed to deal with oil skin or which are badly pH balanced can aggravate your sensitive skin. Look for soaps that are designed for “sensitive skin” or that include moisturizers.


One study found Dove soaps, and specifically Dove White and Dove Baby to be the most pH balanced for sensitive skin., When you go through your hygiene routine, it’s a good idea to be gentle with your skin. Your skin is very sensitive and the skin on your legs is specifically very thin and prone to problems. Treat it kindly to help your skin heal and prevent problems from coming back.


Exfoliate your skin occasionally. Exfoliating is good for your skin but you need to do it in a gentle way and not exfoliate too often. A baking soda paste or washcloth should be more than enough to remove dead skin cells, while items like loofahs and pumice stones can actually make the problem worse.
Use a fresh razor and shave gently, if you shave your legs. Dull razors can irritate your skin and make the problem worse or even cause it to begin with.

, You’ll also want to be gentle when you dry your skin after bathing. Rubbing a towel vigorously on your skin can cause it to become overly dry by irritating the skin and removing too much of the natural moisture. Let yourself air dry if you can and otherwise only lightly pat your skin dry with a soft, clean towel.

, As soon as you get out of the shower or bath, apply at least a light layer of moisturizer. This will help replace the natural oils that may have been removed by bathing and will also help lock in the moisture absorbed while you were in the water.


If you do not have time to shower but you want to moisturize your legs, wrap them in a warm, wet cloth for 10 to 20 minutes. This will moisten your skin and open up your pores, so that the moisturizer can be properly absorbed.

, Lanolin is one of the few products which is known to produce lasting effects on the skin. It is a natural product made from a wax naturally produced by wool-producing animals like sheep, which is specifically designed to protect skin.


Liberally coat your legs in lanolin cream, such as Bag Balm, every day for a week. Once this week has passed, you can move to coating with only a normal layer once every 3-4 days.
You can also coat your legs at night and then wear some old pajamas over the top, letting the product sink in while you sleep.

, Baby oil, coconut oil, body oil: you name it. Any one of these can be really helpful for getting your skin back to normality. It's not always the best long-term solution, however. If you shave your legs, the oil can cause irritation and block the hair follicle, causing ingrown hairs. For this reason, you might not want to rely on oil all of the time. However, for just helping your skin heal while you work on changes to your routine or for protecting your skin during the coldest days of winter, oil is great.

, Many other moisturizers do very, very little for your skin. Many are just a layer of goo that basically just sits on top of your skin. Look for the known ingredients which help skin, humectants and emollients, and pass on all those other cremes because they're just a waste of money.


You want products that contain ingredients like lactic acid, Propylene glycol, and urea.
One ingredient you'll really want to avoid is fragrance. Lots of fragrance chemicals are irritating to skin, so you should avoid them.

, When you don’t drink enough water, you skin will be one of your first organs to suffer. Dehydration will quickly cause dry skin, as well as a number of other health problems. Drink plenty of water every day so that you can protect your skin and the rest of your body too.


How much is enough is different for everyone. The recommendation of eight glasses a day is just a ballpark number.

, When air gets cold, moisture is naturally precipitated out of the air, leaving the air much dryer than normal. When the air is dry, it leaches moisture from your skin (to help reach a sort of balance). This is why your skin is always much dryer in winter. Protecting your skin from the cold, by wearing protective clothing and covering your skin in moisturizer, can prevent dry skin.


To protect your legs, try wearing stockings or another light layer on underneath your pants during the winter. This will help protect your skin, since denim is especially poor at keeping your skin warm and protected.

, Dry, hot air will leech moisture from your skin so increased humidity in the home will help your skin retain moisture. Keeping a small humidifier in your bedroom at night will make a big difference, and if you can keep one in the other major rooms of your house, that can also help.


Just be sure not to over humidify your home. This can cause mold problems, which will also have negative health effects.

, The sun is very harsh on your skin. Aside from just putting you at greater risk of skin cancer, it can also irritate your skin and cause dry skin. Wear light but covering clothes when you go out in the sun, such as linen pants. If you can’t or don’t want to cover your skin with fabric, you should at least use sunscreen. Use a broad spectrum (UVA/UVB) sunscreen and be sure to apply it as directed. SPF 15 should be plenty to protect your skin.

, You might know that you need vitamin C to ward off sickness or that your muscles need protein, but do you know what your skin needs to stay healthy? You skin also needs specific nutrients in order to be at its best so you’ll want to make sure your diet has an adequate amount of three major nutrients: vitamin E, vitamin A, and omega-3 fatty acids.


Good sources of these nutrients include sardines, anchovies, salmon, almonds, olive oil, carrots and kale.
You can also take supplements, although your body might not always absorb these as well as the nutrients found naturally in food.

, Invest in a pure bristle brush, but not one that is too hard or you'll hurt your skin. Proceed to slowly brush your legs, front and back, taking care to not overdo it. Then shower off and use a good quality coconut, almond or grapeseed oil after. Lotions can make it worse, so avoid these. Your legs will stop being powdery.


If you have a medical problem, talk to a doctor before dry skin brushing.

, If you’re trying all of these techniques and you find that you still suffer from really dry skin, it might be a good idea to talk to a doctor. You will want to rule out medical causes. A symptom of some diseases can be dry skin and some medications may cause dry skin as a side effect. It is important to visit with your doctor to ensure that your dry skin isn't a result of a medical or pharmacological issue.

, It's important to wear a hat, even if you're wearing sunscreen. A hat provides shade for your face, which can help reduce your overall exposure to sunlight, and may help reduce the signs of aging..


Choose a hat with a brim large enough to cover your face.Hats with tightly-woven fabric, like canvas, will be most effective at blocking UV radiation from reaching your skin. Avoid hats with a wide weave or holes, such as straw hats, as these hats will let in a lot of sunlight., If you live in a climate that gets cold during the winter, exposure to frigid wind can dry out your skin, causing skin to appear drier and more wrinkled. Protect your skin in cold weather by wearing a scarf across your face., Choose sunglasses with 100% UV protection to protect against harmful sun rays. Oversize or wraparound sunglasses provide extra protection for the sensitive skin around your eyes, which helps prevent wrinkles. Sunglasses with polarized lenses are best for your eyes, as they reduce glare which in turn reduces eye strain and fatigue., Frequent exercise increases circulation in your body which increases nutrients as well as removes waste from your system, which creates a healthy glow., Exercising your facial muscles helps prevent wrinkles from forming. A great way to reduce forehead wrinkles is to place both hands on the forehead facing inwards and spread your fingers between the hairline and eyebrows. Gently sweep your fingers outwards, applying a light pressure. Experts recommend you do the exercises for 20 minutes a day, six days a week., Exposure to cigarette smoke speeds up the natural aging process, causing more wrinkles and premature skin damage.If you are a current smoker and you're concerned about the effects of smoking on your health, talk to your doctor about how to quit smoking.

, Begin with regular less-invasive treatments such as IPL (intense pulsed light) or laser genesis. You can also try very small amounts of Botox to relax facial wrinkles and prevent them from becoming deeper. Maintenance is key to maintaining healthy, young-looking skin.

, Moisturizing your skin can help prevent skin cells from shriveling and drying out. Over time, this may help prevent or reduce the occurrence of wrinkles and fine lines, helping your skin look more youthful and healthy., New skin looks younger and more radiant, while older, dead skin cells give the face a rough, worn appearance. Exfoliating too often can be damaging to your skin, but experts recommend using an exfoliating wash once every week to keep skin looking supple and youthful.Try an exfoliator that contains salicylic acid and/or microdermabrasion for maximum results., Anti-aging creams can help reduce wrinkles while keeping skin looking young and healthy. Moisturizers and exfoliators are fairly fast-acting, but some anti-aging products can take at least six weeks to start working. Start with one anti-aging product and wait for results, as using multiple products simultaneously may cause irritation to your skin.Some common and effective ingredients to look for in an anti-aging cream include:


Retinol - this vitamin A compound has antioxidant properties. It is thought to help prevent the breakdown of skin cells that can cause wrinkles. Retinol is a common ingredient in over-the-counter wrinkle creams.Vitamin C - this vitamin is a known antioxidant, and is frequently found in wrinkle creams. Vitamin C is believed to help protect skin from damage caused by the sun, and may help prevent the signs of aging.Hydroxy acids - there are three types of hydroxy acids: alpha, beta, and poly hydroxy acids. All three hydroxy acids are commonly used as exfoliants, which can scour off dead skin and may help stimulate new growth of smoother skin.Coenzyme Q10 - this vitamin-like substance is naturally occurring in the human body and in some food sources. Though its effect on wrinkles has not yet been extensively studied, preliminary studies suggest that coenzyme Q10, when applied to the skin, may help reduce or prevent wrinkles.
Niacinamide - this known antioxidant can also help reduce water loss in the skin. Products containing niacinamide may help prevent your skin from drying out, and may make skin more supple and youthful-looking.Tea extracts - tea leaves contain antioxidant and anti-inflammatory compounds, which may help soothe skin and promote healthy, supple skin.Grape seed extract - this extract is believed to have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory compounds, much like tea extracts. Grape seed extract is also believed to aid in healing wounded skin, which may make it a useful skin treatment to prevent or reduce wrinkles., Some studies suggest that drinking at least four glasses of water each day can help your skin retain its elasticity and look healthy and youthful.Not drinking enough water each day can cause your skin to become dry, flaky, and less elastic.Dry skin is more prone to damage and premature wrinkling., Foods like green, leafy vegetables are rich in antioxidants, which may help protect the skin from damage such as premature aging.Some antioxidant-rich foods believed to help promote healthy skin include:


orange/yellow fruits and vegetables, such as carrots and apricotsgreen, leafy vegetables like spinach and kaletomatoesblueberrieslegumes like beans, peas, nuts, and lentilsfatty fish like salmon and mackerel, Antioxidants, such as Coenzyme Q-10, vitamin C, vitamin E, fish oil, B complex vitamins, zinc, calcium, and selenium, fight free radical damage and oxidation which are part of the aging process. Taking an antioxidant supplement will preserve the health of your skin cells and slow down the aging process.Talk to your doctor before incorporating new supplements into your daily diet to ensure there is no risk of harmful interaction with any other medications or supplements you are currently taking.


Beta-carotene - studies found that taking between 15 and 180 milligrams of beta-carotene each day can help prevent skin damage caused by the sun's UV radiation.Fish oil - some studies found that taking two milligrams of dietary fish oil rich in omega-3 fatty acids increased the threshold of sun exposure that causes skin damage.This does not mean that it's safe to spend as much time as you like in the sun. Rather, it means that, when combined with proactive sunscreen usage, fish oil may reduce the likelihood that your skin will be damaged during regular sun exposure.
Lycopene - similar to beta-carotene, lycopene was found to help prevent skin damage from UV radiation in people who took up to 10 milligrams each day.Vitamin C - taking two milligrams each day of this antioxidant can help prevent skin damage caused by sun exposure.Vitamin E - studies show that taking 1,000 international units (IU) of vitamin E each day can help prevent damage to the skin caused by exposure to sunlight., Though most people may not think of their diet as having a negative effect on the skin, some research suggests that an unhealthy diet, including a diet rich in processed foods, refined carbohydrates, and unhealthy fats can cause premature signs of aging and damage the skin., Sleep allows the body to heal and rebuild damaged cells. It may come as no surprise, then, that sleep is closely linked with skin health. Studies have found that people who do not get enough sleep or who get poor quality sleep had increased visible signs of aging, such as skin lines and tighter, less-flexible skin. Poor sleepers were also found to have a harder time recovering from skin damage like sunburn.Teenagers between the ages of 14 and 17 need about eight to ten hours of sleep each night.Adults between the ages of 18 and 64 need about seven to nine hours of sleep each night.Older adults ages 65 and up need about seven to eight hours of sleep each night."

In booth tanning you control the spray by twisting your body around in front of the jets. (Be sure to wash the palms of your hands afterwards.)
In salon-applied tanning, the operator moves the spray gun around your body. If you want tan only on your legs, you should discuss the strategy with the salon ahead of time.
Of course, a variety of sprays and lotions are also available for home use. Finding one that won't turn you orange is important. If it's not summer, or you just prefer, you can apply a lighter color lotion only to your legs. The best method also requires using an exfoliating scrub to remove loose skin particles. Exfoliating gloves with rough surfaces for scrubbing have also become available in some stores. Exfoliating works best in the shower. After the skin is carefully dried, apply the tanning lotion to your legs or wherever you like. Thin rubber gloves can be useful to help spread around the lotion for more evenness. Some people prefer using their hands directly for more control. The palms of the hands need to be carefully washed afterwards.

Several well-know brands offer a toeless version which is available at some drugstores. More expensive designer name brands are super-fine so that they look virtually invisible. They're quite effective in giving a smooth glow to the legs that looks very close to bare.


With all the toeless pantyhose, be sure to conceal the edge of the toe hole inside the shoe.

A little bit of a glow helps to reduce the appearance of lines., When your skin looks particularly dry, any wrinkles and fine lines will be accentuated. When you're choosing a foundation, look for ones that have moisturizing qualities. Ingredients like glycerin and hyaluronic acid will help your skin retain moisture throughout the day, while foundations containing salicylic acid can dry your skin out even more. Finally, avoid matte foundations., You can also apply sunscreen with your makeup. Before you invest in expensive ""fountain of youth"" products, don't forget to pick up some basic sunscreen. Sun damage to your sensitive facial skin can make you appear much older than you actually are. Avoid new wrinkles and sun spots by making SPF a regular part of your routine., If you don’t exfoliate regularly, this is a great routine to pick up. Mature skin can look dull and colorless, which won’t do your wrinkles any favors. Scrubbing off the dead skin cells will help to brighten your complexion. Exfoliation can also increase the production of collagen, the protein responsible for keeping skin plump and tight., Mature skin is often dry, and dry skin can make wrinkles look more prominent. A couple minutes before you’re ready to start doing your makeup, apply moisturizer to your entire skin to give it some much-needed moisture. If you’re willing to spend a bit more, find products with hyaluronic acid. These can help plump up the skin, reducing your fine lines., A makeup primer is key at any age, because it creates an even base for your makeup to go onto. When you have wrinkles, primer is even more important. Apply it over your entire face. Make sure that you get primer into your wrinkles, rather than glossing over them. You may need to pull gently at the skin to open up the wrinkle a bit, allowing the primer to get into it.Look for primers with a silicone base. These will help smooth out the skin and conceal fine lines.

, Choose a thin, light foundation. With thicker foundations, you run a greater risk of having product collect in fine lines. Just like you did with the primer, make sure to get your foundation into the wrinkles. Rather than smoothing it over the wrinkles as if to cover them, you want to make sure the product is being evenly distributed all over your skin.

By using a damp sponge to apply your foundation, you'll ensure even, natural looking coverage.

By using only a light coat, your products will stay put without looking cakey. Apply the translucent powder evenly to your entire face with a fluffy powder brush.If you don’t set your face with powder, your foundation will slip and slide, eventually settling into wrinkles and making them more defined.

, Using a smaller foundation brush, sweep a bit of bronzer on your cheekbones. Blend it upwards to your temples, adding a bit of warmth anywhere the sun would hit. Then, apply a bit of blush on the apples of your cheeks. These products helps to warm up the face, giving you a youthful glow that will make you look young and healthy. Make sure to blend both your bronzer and blush thoroughly.Make sure to put your bronzer on your cheekbones, rather than underneath them as you would in contouring.

, Use a small amount of illuminating powder or cream to make your face glow. Apply it over the very tops of your cheeks, towards your temples, to create dimension. Use a soft hand while applying to create a soft shimmer, rather than a bold highlight. This highlighter, in conjunction with your blush and bronzer, will make your skin appear youthful and glowing.Again, make sure to get highlighter into the fine lines, rather than brushing over them.

, A setting spray helps to hold the makeup in place. Once you’ve carefully applied your products and your skin is looking lovely, you don’t want anything to smudge or collect into your wrinkles.

Try olive oil.",How to Get Soft Skin on Your Legs," Whether in the bathtub or the shower, you should allow your skin and hair to soften before shaving; this will improve the closeness of your shave. Some people suggest soaking in the tub for 15–20 minutes,but according to others just three minutes in the shower is enough to do the trick.


Try doing the rest of your bathing routine first—body cleansing, shampoo, and conditioner—then following with your shave at the end. This will allow maximum time for your skin to soften, regardless of whether you’re in the bath or shower.;
, Hot water, though it might feel pleasant, dries out the skin and should be avoided.When showering or bathing, keep the water at a pleasant, moderate temperature.


Ice cold water should also be avoided, as this is very shocking to the skin.

, This is a crucial step that will keep dead skin cells from clogging your razor. It’s sometimes tempting to pass on exfoliating, but you really should put in the effort before every shave.


Use a salt or sugar scrub from the store or online—you can find a great one at a variety of price points and in a variety of scents. Some good ones to try include Arbonne Awaken Sea Salt Scrub, Soap and Glory Flake Away Body Scrub, and St. Ives Smoothing Apricot Body Wash.
You can easily make your own scrub at home. Try mixing together 1 1/4 cup of sugar, 1 1/2 cup of oil (olive, coconut, or baby oil work fine), and 3 tablespoons and lemon or lime juice.Exfoliation is also great for helping with in-grown hairs, which can be unsightly and ruin your best efforts at getting great skin on your legs., Use several soft upward strokes with a sharp razor instead of only a few firm ones. This way you’re less likely to cut yourself and you’ll be sure to get all of the little hairs.While it may seem easy to use body wash or soap since you’re using it on the rest of your body, these items will dry your skin.It’s best to use a product such as shaving cream or gel that is specifically formulated for the purpose of shaving your legs.This will help you get the smooth, glowing skin you’re after.
Pay careful attention to how your hair grows. You should be shaving against the grain, and may need to shave up or down in certain areas depending on the direction of the follicles, in order to best remove the hair.

, Cheap blades won’t get you a close shave. If your hair is fine and thin, you should do fine with a 3- or 4-blade razor, but coarse, thicker hair demands one with 5 blades. It’s also a good idea to use a razor with a built-in lubricant strip if your skin is sensitive Replace your razor frequently, anytime you notice a dull or corroded blade or that you’re not getting a good shave anymore. This will also help you to avoid cuts and unsanitary conditions.. Every three shaves is a good rule of thumb for replacing your razor., Waxing removes the root of the hair at the shaft, ensuring super smooth soft skin that lasts a lot longer than a shave does. You can wax at home with a kit from the drug store or you can get your legs waxed by a professional.


Waxing does hurt when it’s being done (though the pain is brief), so it’s not necessarily the best choice for those with very sensitive skin or who are averse to unnecessary pain.

, Depilatory creams, lotions, and sprays are chemical products that dissolve the hair on the surface of your skin.You can use these pain-free items in the shower or the bathtub, and they are formulated to remain in place on your skin until you wipe them away with a washcloth.Depilatory creams have traditionally been known for their strong odor, but newer versions aren’t nearly as offensive as their old-school counterparts. Some even have a tropical smell!
Because you’re not pulling the hair out at the root, you’ll need to use depilatory creams, etc., more frequently than you would if you were waxing., A more permanent solution for removing your leg hair is to get several (usually 3–5) laser treatments. These remove the hair from your legs by directing highly concentrated beams of light into the hair follicles.Laser hair removal is an expensive option, costing an average of $235 per session. Since it will take several sessions to see permanent results, it’s important to consider the overall cost when deciding on this route., As soon as you get out of the shower or bathtub, rub a thick lotion all over your legs. Try to do this while your legs are still a little bit wet (but not soaked), as the water will help lock in the moisture from the lotion.


Only moisturize after you shave, never before. Moisturizing before you shave will clog the pores and keep you from reaching all of the hair with your razor.Avoid lotions that contain alpha-hydroxy or alcohol, as these products can irritate skin that has just been shaven.
If your skin is particularly dry or prone to eczema, you may want to try a thicker cream as opposed to a lotion. Good options include CeraVe Moisturizing Cream and Cetaphil Moisturizing Cream, both of which are easy to find in stores and online.

, Although post-shave is the most important time to apply lotion, you will want to moisturize daily, especially if you go several days in between shaves. Try to get into a habit of doing it at the same time every day (at night or while getting dressed in the morning, for example) so that you don’t forget.


Although you want to moisturize frequently, don’t overdo it; too much lotion can lead to clogged pores. Once or twice a day is sufficient.

, Before going to bed at night, massage olive oil into your legs, wait for the skin to absorb it, then rinse in the shower. This will leave your legs feeling silky soft!"

Ask about chemical treatments.",How to Get Rid of Forehead Wrinkles," Apply a thin layer of illuminating face primer after you apply moisturizer and before you apply foundation.


Illuminating primers contain small bits of mica, a shiny mineral that can settle into your forehead wrinkles and the other lines of your face. Once there, the bits of mica reflect light away from those wrinkles, thereby reducing their appearance.
Additionally, the primer prevents foundation from settling into your wrinkles and keeping the foundation in place. Since foundation has a matte finish, it could actually emphasize your wrinkles if it sinks into those lines.;
, Even though a different hairstyle won't directly affect the appearance of forehead wrinkles, the right style can draw the eye away your forehead and make them stand out less.Ask your hair stylist to trim your bangs into a soft, choppy fringe that hangs down to your eyebrows. The bangs will cover your forehead wrinkles, hiding them from sight, and can even soften the remaining features of your face.
You can also ask your stylist to put highlights into your hair at eye level. The right highlights should brighten the color of your eyes. When your eyes look brighter and more vibrant, your forehead wrinkles will look softer.
When doing your hair at home, create a low side part positioned directly above either pupil. Center parts are a bad idea since they frame the forehead and draw unwanted attention to it.

, Immediately after washing your face in the evening, work a light coating of petroleum jelly directly into your forehead wrinkles. Continue to massage it into the wrinkles until your skin no longer feels greasy.Dry skin lacks elasticity, and that lack of elasticity can make your wrinkles stand out more. By applying petroleum jelly while your skin is still moist, you can lock in more moisture and keep your skin naturally plumper.

, Topical retinol and retinoids are among the most prevalent anti-aging creams on the market, but moisturizers that contain peptides also work well.


Topical creams like these are specifically formulated to stimulate collagen production in your skin. As a result, your skin plumps up and naturally fills in any wrinkles.
Apply the cream directly to your forehead wrinkles. Most treatments like this have narrow applicator tips, making focused application easier to manage.
Other topical treatments worth considering include those containing alpha-hydroxy acids (AHAs), vitamin C, idebenone, growth factors, and pentapeptides.

, ""Frownies"" and other anti-aging facial patches are stiff adhesive patches that physically hold your skin in place as you sleep.


Smooth out your skin and apply the patch directly over your forehead wrinkles immediately before bedtime. Make sure that the entire wrinkle is covered, and keep the patch on for at least three hours or overnight.
The muscles in your forehead will be unable to move once you apply the patch. As a result, they won't twist or contort in your sleep, and your wrinkles won't have a chance to deepen further.

, You might have more difficulties with forehead wrinkles if you use your forehead muscles to open your eyes instead of relying on your eyelids. Performing a simple exercise to train these muscles may help reduce the creases in your forehead while also correcting droopy eyelids.Curl your hands into ""C"" shapes and place them directly over your eyes. The index fingers should be positioned above each eyebrow, along the upper bone of your eye cavity, and the thumbs should be placed on either side of the nose, just above the nostril.
Press the fingers of each hand downward and sideways, then open your chest and roll down your shoulder blades.
Open your eyes as wide as possible and hold the position for five seconds. During this time, press your index fingers into your eyebrows to prevent the brows and forehead from moving.
Squint the eyes five times, then close your eyes completely and relax for five seconds.
Repeat the entire process two more times, and repeat the exercise at least once daily until you notice results.

, After washing your face in the evening, massage a few drops of slightly warm, extra virgin olive oil directly into the wrinkles and into the area around the wrinkles.


This can also be done with a small dab of coconut oil or with a combination of olive oil and coconut oil.
Both oils can moisturize the skin and improve its elasticity. The wrinkles should fade as skin elasticity improves.

, Orange, lemon, and other citrus fruits contain high levels of vitamin C and vitamin E, and both can greatly improve the smoothness and overall health of your skin.


You can apply the pulp of most citrus fruits directly to your forehead. Rinse it off with warm water after letting it sit for about 10 minutes.
To make another simple face pack, mix 1/4 cup (60 ml) of freshly squeezed orange juice with enough flour to form a creamy paste. Smooth this paste over your forehead and rinse it off with warm water after 20 minutes.

, Before washing your face in the morning or evening, massage a dollop of aloe vera gel into the wrinkles of your forehead. Let it remain in place for at least 15 minutes before washing it off with water and a gentle facial cleanser.


The acemannan and other polysaccharides in aloe vera can stimulate skin regeneration and healing. As a result, it can soothe dry, damaged skin and may soften the appearance of wrinkles.

, A healthy, balanced diet can improve your overall health, including the health of your skin. As a general rule, try to eat more fruits and vegetables to increase the amount of antioxidants in your body.


Antioxidants fight the free radical in your body, leaving you with healthier, younger-looking skin.
Salmon and other cold-water fish can also be beneficial since they contain high levels of protein and omega-3 fatty acids. Proteins are among the building blocks of healthy skin and omega-3 keeps skin more thoroughly nourished.
Consider including more soy in your diet, too. Some studies suggest that soy products can protect and heal skin damage caused by sunlight, including wrinkles.
Likewise, cocoa contains the flavanols epicatechin and catechin, both of which improve circulation to skin cells and encourage better hydration.

, Regular moderate exercise is an important part of an overall healthy lifestyle, and improving your overall health can increase circulation and skin elasticity throughout your body--including your forehead and the rest of your face.


Try taking a 30-minute walk at least once per day, five to seven days per week. Other types of moderate cardiovascular exercise can be equally as beneficial.
Include headstands among your usual exercise routine, too. They increase blood flow to your face and scalp, which can improve the health of your skin there. Headstands also force the muscles of the face to relax, thereby lessening wrinkle-producing tension.

, Frequent, unprotected exposure to sunlight can worsen your wrinkles by causing your skin to become dry and damaged.Avoid the sun when possible. When you do need to step outside, apply sunscreen to your forehead and over the rest of your body. Consider wearing a hat, as well, to further protect the skin of your face.

, Adequate sleep is just as important for your skin as it is for the rest of your body, so try to get seven to eight hours per night. When you lack sleep, the body can produce too much cortisol, and that cortisol gradually breaks down skin cells, causing deeper wrinkles to develop.


Additionally, getting more sleep allows your body to produce more human growth hormone (HGH), which can make your skin more elastic and less likely to wrinkle.
Try sleeping on your back at night, too. Sleeping on your stomach can cause sleep lines to etch into your brow. Similarly, sleeping on your side can produce wrinkles on your cheeks and chin.

, There are plenty of other reasons to quit the habit if you're currently a smoker, and the reduction of forehead wrinkles is just one more.


Cigarette smoke releases an enzyme that breaks down the collagen and elastin in your skin. As these elements break down, your skin loses elasticity, and wrinkles become more prominent.

, If you have a tendency to squint while reading, invest in a pair of reading glasses. When you squint, the muscles in your forehead and around your eyes create a groove beneath the surface of your skin, and this groove can turn into a deep wrinkle.


On a related note, you should also wear sunglasses when you step outside. Bright lights tend to make your eyes squint on impulse, and sunglasses can help prevent this from happening.

, Excessive washing and lack of an effective moisturizer are two of the most drying, damaging things you can do to the skin of your face.


Tap water and harsh soaps can strip natural oils and other forms of moisture from your skin. Try to wash your face only once or twice daily and use a gentle facial cleanser when you do.
Apply a facial moisturizing cream or lotion to your face immediately after washing it. Doing so locks in more moisture and makes existing wrinkles look less visible.

, A trained, licensed acupuncturist might be able to reduce your forehead wrinkles by toning the muscles in your face.You'll usually need between 10 to 12 treatments, which will be administered twice a week for five to six weeks.
The acupuncturist will insert fine needles into strategic points along the body and face. These needles stimulate the production of collagen and elastin. As a result, your skin naturally plumps up and the circulation to your face improves, which should cause your forehead wrinkles to visibly soften.

, Botox and other neurotoxins block the nerve impulses that cause muscle contractions in your forehead. As a result, the wrinkles you currently have look less noticeable and won't get any deeper.


Aside from Botox, other common neurotoxins include Xeomin and Dysport.
Neurotoxin treatments eventually wear off, so you will need another round of injections roughly every four months if you like the results enough to keep them.

, During this treatment, the doctor or technician will direct energy from a laser or pulsed diode light directly to your forehead. The procedure can last anywhere from 30 minutes to two hours.


The intense light will remove the top layer of skin, creating a mild wound that usually won't be visible to the naked eye. In response, your skin should activate its natural production of collagen and produce new smooth, wrinkle-free skin.

, The most common chemical treatments used to treat forehead wrinkles include chemical peels and dermabrasion.


During a chemical peel, the doctor will use different chemicals to burn the top layer of skin. Your body should respond to the damage by producing more collagen and, effectively, more smooth skin.
During dermabrasion, the doctor will use a mild chemical crystal and a vacuum device to chip away the top layer of skin. This draws evenly textured skin to the surface and should cause light wrinkles and creases to vanish.

Make a fake smile.,
Make a squished smile.,
Change up the exercises.,
Don't look for scientific evidence supporting facial exercises.",How to Get Rid of Jowls1," This exercise involves making a fake smile and then jutting your jaw forward so that you can touch the center of your lips together. You should try to use the muscles in the back of your jaw to push your jaw forward. Your lips should only touch in the center. On your last repetition, do the exercise, and hold the position for 20 seconds before releasing.When doing these exercises to get rid of jowls, do your best to focus all of your attention on the muscles around your mouth and around your jaw.
You can place each index finger on each side of your mouth to help yourself isolate the muscles in your jaw.;
, Another way to work on the muscles around the jaw line involves making a close-lipped smile and then pushing the jaw forward to contract the muscles underneath the lips and along the jaw line.You can be sure you’re doing this correctly by gently placing 2 or 3 fingers from each hand on either side of your mouth, just underneath and to the sides of your lips.
With this exercise, it is a good idea to look in the mirror while you do it. This is because you want to try and keep the rest of your muscles in your face as relaxed as possible while you do the exercise.
As with the first exercise, when you are on your final repetition, you should hold the exercise for 20 seconds.

, When you are just starting out, you can pick one exercise to focus on for 2 or 3 weeks, and then switch to a different exercise. This will help target the muscles differently in order to help you get rid of your jowls.


You can start with just doing 15 repetitions of each exercise once per day, and move up to doing more repetitions as you feel yourself progressing.

, At present, there are little to no scientific studies examining the effectiveness of facial exercise as a means of reducing saggy skin. However, just because these studies don’t exist does not mean it won’t be useful for you.It may work, but it will likely take time and dedication to doing the exercises consistently. Don’t expect an overnight fix with this method.

Understand what it is.,
Learn about the costs.,
Prepare for the procedure.,
Understand the risks.",How to Get Rid of Jowls2," Radiofrequency treatment is a non-surgical method for tightening the skin. It is best for people who have mild or moderate sagging of the skin, and may not be as effective if you have deep lines and lots of sagging.This method of treatment works well on people of all skin colors and tones.
Generally, this method is suitable for people between the ages of 40-50. After the age of 60, you may experience some results with this method, but you may not get the results that you would get from a surgical procedure, such as a facelift.

, In most cases, this is not a procedure that will be covered by insurance. Ask your treatment professional about installment plans if you cannot afford to pay the full amount all at once. Prices will vary based on the specific radiofrequency machine used. Some of the newer radiofrequency machines need only one session to achieve great results, but these prices will be much higher.Businesses using an older machine are still effective, and may cost less; however, you will need to go for several sessions to get the results you hope for.
Regardless of the machine used, this method does not pose a permanent solution to the problem. You will have to go for follow-up sessions every 3 to 6 months to maintain your tightened skin.

, Before you undergo the procedure, you will want to avoid irritating your skin as much as possible. For example, you will especially want to avoid getting a sunburn as this will make the procedure more painful than it needs to be. In some cases, your skin care professional may ask you to reschedule your treatment if you have a sunburn or otherwise irritated skin on your face.You may experience a bit of redness after the treatment is complete, but this is normal. Generally, you should be able to resume your normal activities right away. Some professionals may recommend soothing gels or creams that you will apply to your skin.
If you do experience discomfort after the procedure, you can apply a cold compress to the skin or mist your skin with cool water to help soothe it.

, When receiving the treatment from a trained professional, this method is quite safe. However, it can be somewhat uncomfortable for some people because heat is being applied directly to the skin.If you are worried about the pain, be sure to ask about any pain medication you can take, or whether or not they will apply a cream to your skin that will help numb the skin some.
Some people experience swelling, bumps, and/or blisters around the treatment area. If you experience these symptoms, it may be a good idea to give your practitioner a call, but it is generally nothing to worry about.
The most serious potential complication can occur if the professional applying the treatment heats an area of the skin too much. This can cause what is called a “depression,” which is a sunken area of the skin. Be sure to look into your treatment professional’s credentials before undergoing this treatment.

Understand the cost.,
Learn about the surgery.,
Prepare for surgery.,
Be aware of the recovery time.",How to Get Rid of Jowls3," As of 2014, the average cost of a neck lift in the United States was around $4,300. However, the price can vary significantly. While this procedure is expensive, this is because it is a surgery that should be done by a board certified plastic surgeon.Unless you can demonstrate to your insurance company that you need a neck lift for a medical reason, it likely will not be covered.

, A neck lift is not a minor surgery. You will be sedated, and the surgery will generally last two to three hours. Excess skin will be removed around the jaw area, and the surgeon may also alter the muscles to give you the appearance you want.If you have medical issues such as diabetes, alcoholism, heart disease, high blood pressure, or depression, you may not be a good candidate for cosmetic surgery. Additionally, smokers are sometimes not good candidates for cosmetic surgery., As this is a major surgery, you will need to undergo a thorough medical examination. You may have to stop taking certain medications, and if you smoke, you will need to quit. Your doctor will advise you on the risks to be aware of, as well as how to take care of yourself during recovery time.Before the surgery, you should avoid taking aspirin or other anti-inflammatory drugs because they can cause excess bleeding.
Be sure to arrange transportation home from the surgery. As you will undergo general anesthesia, it will not be a good idea to try and drive yourself.

, As this is an invasive surgery, you will need time to recover. You will likely be asked to refrain from exercising for at least three weeks. During recovery, you may experience discomfort around your jaw. For example, you might experience swelling and bruising, a pulling sensation, tingling, or even burning.As with all surgeries, infection is a risk. As you are recovering, keep an eye on your temperature. If you develop a fever, contact your doctor right away.

Re-apply moisturizer throughout the day until the dry skin clears up.,
Ask your doctor if you need a prescription cream.,
Watch for signs of infection.",How to Get Rid of Dry Skin Under Your Nose1," The first step in caring for dry skin under the nose is to clean the area to remove any dirt and loose, dead skin. Dry, scaly skin can easily lead to open wounds and cause bacterial infection, so keeping the area clean is important.Avoid using harsh soaps that can dry your skin even more. Instead, use cleansers with added moisturizers or mild soaps with added oils.
Also avoid antibacterial detergents or cleansers with fragrance or alcohol as these may promote dryness.;
, Do not rub or use a harsh towel to dry the skin as this may cause more irritation. Instead, use a soft towel and gently pat dry the skin under the nose.

, If the dry skin under your nose is red, swollen, and/or painful (inflamed) apply an ice cube wrapped in a paper towel over the area for a few minutes to reduce inflammation and pain.Do not apply the ice cube directly over the skin as this may cause more skin damage. Instead, wrap it inside a clean paper towel or cloth.
If the skin under your nose is just dry without any signs of inflammation (redness, swelling, pain), you can skip the icing and move to the next step.

, Creams and ointments prevent water from escaping from the skin and help seal in your skin’s natural moisture. Apply a rich moisturizing cream under the nose.Use moisturizers that are thicker or hypoallergenic (such as over-the-counter Eucerin and Cetaphil). Most lotions are not thick or moisturizing enough for the really dry skin under your nose, although they can be used for larger areas of your body.
Avoid using moisturizers that contain fragrances, alcohol, retinoids, or alpha-hydroxy acid (AHA).Do not use over-the-counter anti-inflammatory creams or lotions unless directed by your doctor. These products can contain chemicals that may irritate the skin more. If the cream you applied increases burning and itching, stop using it., Some natural products can be used to help combat persistent dry skin. You may want to try some of the following to see what works best for you:


Sunflower seed and hemp seed oil are mild oils packed with fatty acids and vitamin E and may help repair dry skin.Coconut oil is also very moisturizing when applied directly to the skin.Raw honey has antibacterial and antiseptic qualities and can help keep skin moist., Certain factors or conditions can draw moisture out of your skin, such as cold weather or eczema. Thus, it is important you re-apply the moisturizer as needed to keep the skin under the nose well-moisturized throughout the day and night.


For the night, you may want to try ointments that contain petroleum jelly, such as Vaseline or Aquaphor. You can also use these during the day but due to their greasiness, you may prefer to use these only before bedtime.
If you have extremely dry skin, your dermatologists may recommend a nonprescription ointment (such as those that contain lactic acid and urea). Use these only as directed and do not exceed the recommended number of applications per day., Typically, dry skin under the nose is temporary and responds well to regular moisturizing and at home care. However, if the dry skin is caused by a more serious skin condition, such as atopic dermatitis or psoriasis, your doctor may recommend a prescription ointment in addition to home care. These ointments typically include a topical corticosteroid or a topical antibiotic.If the dry skin does not improve or continues with at home care, consult your doctor or a dermatologist.

, Sometimes, dry skin can lead to infections. Impetigo (a superficial skin infection) can be very common under or around your nose. See your doctor if you notice any signs of infection, including:Increased redness
Red bumps
Swelling
Pus
Boils
If the irritated area suddenly gets worse, or becomes painful or swollen, this could be signs of an allergic reaction. See your doctor as soon as possible.

Use a humidifier to add moisture in the air.",How to Get Rid of Dry Skin Under Your Nose2," Excess bathing may strip away some of the skin’s oily layer and cause it to lose moisture. Limit your daily baths or showers to 5 to 10 minutes and avoid washing your face and the skin under your nose more than twice a day., Hot water can wash away natural oils from the skin. Opt to shower or wash your face in lukewarm water., Avoid using harsh soaps that can dry your skin even more. Instead, choose moisturizing, soap-free cleansers designed for your face, such as Cetaphil and Aquanil, and moisturizing shower gels (such as Dove and Olay).Optionally, you can add oils to the bath water if you prefer to take baths.

, This helps seal the spaces between your skin cells and lock in your skin natural moisture. Apply the moisturizer within a few minutes after washing your face or taking a bath, while your skin is still moist.If the skin under your nose is extremely dry, you can apply oil (such as baby oil) immediately after washing your skin. Oil may prevent the evaporation of water from the surface of your skin better than moisturizers. If your skin stays “oily,” you may consider using oil only at bedtime., If you apply cosmetics over the skin under your nose (such as makeup or shaving cream), opt for products that have added moisturizers in them.


Avoid using products that contain alcohol, retinoids, or alpha-hydroxy acid (AHA).Also, opt for products that are fragrance-free and/or meant for sensitive skin.
If you cannot find a good product or are unsure what to choose, consult your doctor and ask whether you should be using prescription ointments.
Remember to apply sunscreen of at least 30SPF, or choose a facial product that includes sunscreen, whenever you go outside.

, Shaving can irritate the skin under your nose. Shave after a warm shower, or apply a warm, damp cloth to your face for a few minutes to soften the hair and open your pores. You can also try the following to help avoid shaving irritation:Never ""dry shave."" This can seriously irritate the skin. Always use a lubricating shave cream or gel. If you have sensitive skin, look for hypoallergenic shave gels.
Use a sharp razor. Dull razors will mean you have to move them over the same patch of skin several times, increasing the likelihood of irritation.
Shave in the same direction your hair grows. For your face, this is usually downwards. Shaving ""against the grain"" can irritate your skin and cause ingrown hairs.

, This can irritate the dry skin and even cause bleeding if the cracks in your skin have become deep enough. If your skin itches, try applying ice over it for a few minutes. This may help reduce swelling and itching.If your skin is bleeding, press a clean towel over the skin to stop the bleeding. You may want to apply antibiotic ointment to reduce the risk of secondary bacterial infection. If the bleeding doesn’t stop or the skin continues to “open” several times a day, consult a doctor., Paper towels may be too harsh and can irritate the skin more. Only use facial tissues or tissues with added moisturizers.

, The winter months tend to be dryer and may cause your skin to lose more moisture. Use a humidifier during the night and set it to around 60%. This should help replenish the moisture in the top layer of the skin.If you live in a desert climate, you may want to use a humidifier throughout the year.

, Pencil eyeliner or eyeshadow (applied with a thin brush) is best for this look, as it creates a more feminine and softer approach than liquid one. Black is too heavy, so stick with a dark brown, dark blue or dark purple; staying close to the lashline is going to let your lashes look fuller. Avoid cat-eyes!

As you exhale, slowly release all those muscles. Widen your eyes and stick your tongue out and down towards your chin, opening your mouth wide.

Point your toes slightly inward. Place your hands on your hips, elbows out, and on an inhale, fold your body forward from your hips.
Keep bending forward, if you can, until the top of your head touches the floor. Release your hands to the floor. If you can get the crown of your head to the floor, you can rest your thumbs on your chin with your fingers along your cheek to get an additional stretch for your face.
If you can't bend all the way to the floor, bend as far as you comfortably can, and rest your hands on your knees or your shins.
Stay bent for several breaths, breathing deeply in through the nose and out through the mouth. On an exhale, slowly roll back up to stand.

After five seconds, relax. Take a couple breaths, then repeat the move twice more.

",How to Apply 1920S Makeup," You may have to use an older variety, such as pancake, or a cream meant more for theater than for everyday use. To allow your skin to breathe, thin down cream foundation by moistening your sponge before dipping in the base. If your skin is naturally porcelain or alabaster-toned, play it up.;
, Thin eyebrows were fashionable in the 20s, so this step works most accurately if your brows are already on the thin side. If not, you don't have to start tweezing away--you can cover your brows with a 1920s-style hat or with bangs chopped straight across as part of a bob cut.

, Pick a gray-based shadow to keep your eyes on the sooty side, which is what you're aiming for. Use a black kohl eyeliner on both top and bottom lash lines. Don't scrimp--you want all the dark tones to meld together. Color top and bottom lashes with blackest black mascara. You want them dark so as to appear like you used paint to blacken them. You may want to use a waterproof formulation for all of your eye makeup to avoid unwanted smudging as much as possible.

Consider your finished look.",How to Apply Makeup for a Fancy Party," Before you apply makeup, you'll want to wash your face and remove any excess oils or dirt. Use a gentle cleanser and wash your face with warm water. Carefully, pat your face dry with a towel. If you are going to an evening party and have makeup on from the day, remove the makeup with makeup remover cloths or solutions before you wash your face.


You can leave your makeup on from earlier if you prefer or if you are short on time. But, your makeup will look best on a fresh face. Wearing old makeup can make it look caked on or old, especially if you apply new makeup over the old. But, if you don't have much time, wipe your face with a warm washcloth and remove your eye makeup if possible.;
, Use a moisturizer suited for your skin type. Look for one that is oil-free and noncomedogenic, so that it won't clog pores. Apply a quarter size drop of moisturizer to your face and blend it in.Moisturizer is important to apply before makeup because it restores the natural oils to your face and keeps your skin from drying out or becoming flaky.

, Primer goes on before the rest of your makeup and helps your makeup last longer. If you are going to be up late or at a party where you won't be able to reapply your makeup, primer will prevent you from having to continually reapply your makeup. Primers are available in a variety of finishes, so you can create a matte, dewy, or glowing look. Apply a few small dots of primer across your forehead, nose, and cheeks and then blend it in with your fingers or a sponge. After you have applied your primer, let it sit for a few minutes before you apply your foundation. A little goes a long way with primer. Don't apply too much since it's only supposed to be a light application. Try avoid the eye area since you will apply an eyelid primer later. Make sure you allow your moisturizer to dry before you apply your primer.

, After your primer has dried, apply foundation to your skin, blending it in with a foam sponge, your fingers, or a foundation brush. Apply foundation to the center points of your face (your forehead, nose, cheeks, and chin). Blend the foundation outwards, going from the center of your face, to the outside of your face.








Use a foundation that is suited for and matches your skin type and color. If you aren't sure, first test it on your jawline and then look at your skin in the light, making sure the color blends in.

, Using a concealer that also matches your skin color, dab your blemish areas with a small dot of concealer. Then, blend it in softly with your ring finger (which applies the least pressure on the delicate skin of the eye area). As you blend, don't press too hard or blend it in too much since this can create redness or even remove the concealer. This is why using your ring finger is better, because with your index finger you may apply more pressure.









You can also highlight the waterline of the lower lids with a flesh, peace, cream, or white eyeliner. This will open up your eyes and make them appear larger. If you want to apply concealer under your eyes, be sure to extend the concealer in a triangle shape down along your nose. This helps it blend with the rest of your face.

, Powder also helps your makeup stay put and keeps your face from looking extra oily. Use a powder brush and dip it into loose or pressed powder. Then, gently pat the powder across your face so that it doesn't ruin your foundation.









Make sure you choose a powder that also matches your skin color. Translucent powders are also available. These appear white but suit every skin color when applied.

, Contour your face using a highlighter. Apply highlight to your upper cheekbones, the flat part of your nose, a little on your forehead, near the middle of your chin, and along your jawline. This can create a glowing effect if you don't also use a bronzer. Select a highlighter that works with your skin tone:








For fair skin: Choose pearl-colored (avoid bronze tones) tones.
For light skin: Look for an ivory or vanilla colored tones.
For medium skin: Find a champagne tone with a little bit of color.
For olive skin: Choose a peachy-gold highlighter with yellow undertones (and avoid pink tones).
For golden skin: Look for bronze tones in a shimmer or satin finish.
For dark skin: Pick a gold or deep yellow tone (and avoid white, pink, or champagne tones).
For deep skin: Use a darker peach or orange highlighter.

, Use a bronzer to create a glowing and tanned look by applying it where the sun would normally fall on your face. Choose a bronzer that is one to two shades darker than your skin color. Use a fluffy brush to apply and blend the bronzer like you would a highlight. Sweep it across the top of your cheekbones, the middle of your forehead, the center of you chin, and down the center of your nose.








If you have pale skin, you may want to skip or use very little bronzer. You don't want to unnaturally darken up your face.

, Dip your ring finger into the primer and apply a thin layer on your upper eyelid just below the crease. This primer will help your eyeshadow last longer, just like the other primer you applied. Allow the primer to absorb into your skin and sit for a minute or so before you apply the rest of your makeup.









Choose a primer that matches the color and finish you'd like to achieve., There are so many different color combinations you can do for fancy makeup. If you are going to a more formal event you may want to stick to browns and greys. If you are going to a fun event you may choose to use a shimmery eyeshadow. If you aren't sure what looks best on you, try out some different shades before your party. It is really your personal preference, but here are some guidelines for eyeshadow colors:For brown eyes: Because brown is a neutral color, you have a lot of options for your eyeshadow. You can go with coppers, purples, and blues. Really, brown eyes can get away with most colors, but usually darker shades look better.
For hazel eyes: Pastels and metallics look best for this eye color because they help make light brown eyes sparkle. Heavy shadows can hide the subtle green and gold in your eyes.
For blue eyes: Soft tones like coral and champagne often look best on blue eyes. Very dark, smoky looks can distract from your eye color, so sticking to the lighter shades will draw attention to your eyes without distracting from your eye color.
For green eyes: Build on the color you already have in your eyes. Choose eyeshadows in shimmery browns or even a muted purple.
Using a color wheel to find your eye color's opposite is a great way to make sure your eyes stand out. For example, orange is blue's opposite, so eye shadows with orange tones will help blue eyes pop, etc.

, Start by applying a light, neutral shade of eyeshadow to your upper eyelid, below the crease and blend it into the crease with an eyebrow brush. Apply a light, shimmery eyeshadow like cream or white to the inner corners of your eyes for an extra highlight. Then, blend a darker shade into the crease of your eye. You want the color to be one or two shades darker than your eyelid color. Add a dark color right above your crease and blend it into your crease with an eyeshadow brush. Make sure that your eyeshadow doesn't meet your eyebrow. It should end a little bit above the crease of your eye and not any higher.


For blue eyes, you might consider using a light champagne color for your eyelid, a peach, coral color for your crease, and a light brown, gold, or darker peach above your crease.For brown eyes, choose a light color for your eyelids and go darker as you move your way up. Try to stay in the same shades though. For example, don't use a purple on your crease and a brown above your crease.
For hazel eyes, you can do a light smoky eye by using a light, shimmery grey above the crease of your eye, or you can do a purple eye. Use a light color on your eyelid, move to a pale or pastel purple on your crease and then apply a rich purple above your crease (don't go as dark as plum though).
For green eyes, go for a shimmery brown look. Choose a light champagne for your eyelid, fill in your crease with a golden or beige eyeshadow, and then use a shimmery bronze above your crease.
To achieve a smokey eye look for events especially fancy, start with the lightest tone of eyeshadow in your inner eye (usually shiny whites, peaches, or very light browns), then move across the eye (towards the ears) with every shade getting progressively darker. For example, on a blue eye, you could start with a light white on the inner corners of your eyes, then cover most of your lid with a peach color shadow, and finish with a darker peach/gold/bronze (or whichever darker color matches the shadows you've used) on the outer corners of your eyes, blending into the outer portion of your crease and around the edges of the outer eye.

, You can use a liquid or pencil eyeliner on your eyelids. Draw a thin line of eyeliner on your top eyelid above your lash line, starting from the corner of your eye and moving to the end of your eyelid. For a more dramatic line, you can create a wing or cat eye with your eyeliner, drawing the line out past your eyelid half an inch or so.









When doing top eyeliner, it can be helpful to place a piece of tape next to your eye, so that your eyeliner has a nice boundary. Take a piece of scotch tape one inch long, and line it up with the outer edge of your lower eyelid. Place it at an angle so that extends away from your upper eyelid towards the end of your eyebrow.The color you choose for your eyeliner is up to you. Black is good for a fancy party, but if you have naturally light lashes, a light or dark brown may be better suited for you. You can also choose a fun color like a shimmery bronze or blue if you want to add some glitter to your eyes.
You can use eyeliner on your lower lash line as well, but this often makes people's eyes look smaller. Instead, apply a white liner to your waterline and a brown liner from your outer corner to almost halfway under your eye. Smudge it slightly to soften it and make your eyes appear larger.
A thin slanted eyeshadow/eyebrow brush can be used to help smooth out any eyeliner bumps and perfect that fierce wing. Simply place a small bit of eyeliner onto the tip of the brush and carefully touch up any issues.

, Use a medium shadow (like a beige or brown) and apply a thin line of eyeshadow from the outer corner of your eye to the middle of your eye using a thin eyeshadow brush. Smudge and blend it in with ring your finger or with an eyeshadow brush.It is really your personal preference what you want to do under your eyes. Start by applying your upper eye makeup and if you feel like you need something more, you can add under eye eyeliner or eyeshadow. If you like the way you look without something under your eye, then leave it at that. You could also choose a fun color for under your eye like a light blue or purple.

, For the final touches to your eye, choose a mascara (they often come in black, brown, or black brown). Dip your mascara brush in your bottle (making sure you don't pump it as this can dry out the mascara) and start at the base of your top lashes, underneath them. Wiggle your mascara brush through your lashes. After you have applied one coat, apply one or two more coats until you have your desired color.








Repeat this step on your lower lashes, but apply the mascara to the top of the lashes instead of underneath them.
Choose a warmer brown mascara for daytime or casual looks. Use black mascara for more glamorous events or for an evening look.
Before you apply your mascara you can use an eyelash curler to add definition to your eyelashes.

, If you plan on taking a lot of pictures at your party, blush is important because it can help highlight your cheekbones and prevent your face from looking pale or washed out. Smile to locate the apple of your cheeks and then sweep on blush with a blush brush, blending it in until you get you desired color. Choose a blush color suited for your skin tone:








Fair/ivory skin: Choose a baby pink or pale pink for your blush color. This is the most natural look for very fair skin because other shades can look orange. For fair skin that is a little bit darker, you can use a peach blush in a satin or sheer texture. If you want to go a little more dramatic for a night out, you can use a plum colored blush in a translucent shade. Choose a plum colored blush that is a shade or two darker than your lip color.
Medium skin: Wear a blush that is an apricot shade to bring out the natural warm colors in your skin. You can also wear a pink-berry color. A medium pink will look good on medium skin. For a more dramatic look, choose a muted mauve (pale purple) color that has a hint of plum.
Olive skin: Look for warm tones like an orange-peach which will hide the green undertones in your skin. Wear a rose or bronze colored blush for a more dramatic look that will add warmth to your skin and help boost the olive color. If you have fair olive skin, you can use these same colors. Just don't apply as much blush.
Dark skin: Go for bold, highly pigmented shades like raisin, brick, and cranberry. For a dramatic look, choose a bright tangerine that will be pretty and subtle on dark skin.

, Apply a sugar or exfoliating scrub to your lips. Rinse it off and apply a layer of lip balm. Allow the lip balm to sit on your lips for a few minutes, then blot it off with a soft tissue.This step is important if you are going to be wearing lipstick for a long time. Moisturizing your lips helps prep them for your lipstick by removing any dryness.

, Choose a lip pencil or liner that is slightly darker than your natural lip color. This will help contour your lips, making them appear fuller. To keep the color from fading from your lips you can also color in your lips with your lip liner.








Filling in your lips with liner can keep the lipstick color intact. It will also be less noticeable if your lipstick wears off.

, Choose a color that works well with your eye makeup, even if it's a nude lipstick. Start from the center of your top lip and swipe a thin layer of lipstick outwards, trying to stay inside your lips. Apply lipstick to your bottom lip and rub your lips together to evenly coat them. You can choose a bright red, dark red, or pink. If you want something simple or natural, choose a neutral color. Here are some ideas for lip colors:








For fair skin: Choose berry colors or blue-based shades of reds and purples, light pinks like candy pinks and sugars, nudes like pearl, honey, and peachy coral, honey browns, and deep plums for a dramatic look.
Medium/tan skin: Choose bright, orange based reds, bright or berry colored pinks, shimmery peaches and corals, gold-based browns and deep berries.
Olive skin: Choose brick or rusty reds, light and glossy pinks, brown-based shades of peach and tan, berry browns with hints of pink, medium shades of plum or berry.
Dark skin: Choose ruby, candy apple, and garnet reds, punch and fuchsia pinks, coppery peach nudes, deep, rich browns, mulberry and deep plum.

, Once you have applied your lipstick, you may want to remove some of the color or any excess lipstick. Take a tissue and fold it in half, and then place it between your lips. Press your lips down firmly over the tissue a few times until no more lipstick comes off of your lips when applied to the tissue. Touch up the edge or outside of your lips with tissue and concealer.


Another way to blot lipstick is to carefully hold a tissue over your lips and dab at your lips with a big fluffy brush (like a blush brush). This takes the excess lip color evenly off of your lips without getting any on your face or the brush (as long as you only dab your lips and don't dab too hard.

, After you have applied all your makeup, you can spritz a setting spray to your face so that your makeup will last longer. Hold the spray a foot or so away from your face and spray a light layer across your face. Allow it to dry.This spray is suitable for all skin types, but if you have sensitive or dry skin try to avoid sprays with alcohol since they can dry out your skin.

, Decide if your makeup is complete. It's a good idea to always start with a light layer of makeup and add on from there. It's much easier to add makeup than take it off.


Remember that your look should match the type of party you're attending. If you are going to a formal party, then a more natural looking makeup may look better. If you are going to a party like prom or a dance then darker, bolder colors may be better.

, Lauren prefers using a moisturizer with SPF to protect the delicate skin on her face from the harsh California sun. , Use a concealer brush to dab and blend in concealer on trouble spots throughout your face. Usually, a green-tinted concealer can cover up redness from acne and Rosacea, whereas an orange-tinted concealer can cover blue tones under eyes. Use your best judgment with what works on your skin.

, Generally, Lauren has a dewy tone to her skin that can be easily achieved with a liquid or cream foundation. A powder foundation will matte your skin tone. Use a foundation brush or the up-and-coming egg-shaped spongeto blend the foundation into your skin. Be sure to blend into your neck and along your hairline.

, Make sure they are neat and tidy in whichever shape of brow you choose. Fill in any missing spots with an eyebrow pencil or eyeshadow that is the same tone as your eyebrows. Use short strokes to mimic the appearance of eyebrow hairs, instead of one long swipe along the brow.

, Lauren lives in California so she has a tan all year round. Use the ""3 E"" rule, starting at the forehead, rounding back to your temples, going down your cheekbone, back to your jawline and down to your chin on both sides. Lightly run the brush down your t-zone for an extra sunkissed look.

Allow the moisturizer to absorb into your skin fully before applying foundation, or it will be streaky and runny.;
, Liquid foundation should be applied with a brush, because a brush will use less foundation and blend the makeup better than your fingers or a sponge.Apply cream foundations with a sponge.


For liquid foundation, choose a synthetic brush with a dense and flat top.If you have oily skin and want to use cream foundation, apply it with a damp sponge instead of a dry one.It’s always better to use a brush or sponge to apply foundation, because your fingers can leave streaks, won’t rub the foundation in evenly, and can transfer dirt and bacteria to your face., Pour, pump, or scoop the foundation onto the back of your non-dominant hand so that you can easily access it with the brush.To apply a thin layer of cream foundation evenly, mix it with a few drops of primer on the back of your hand. This will make for lighter coverage, and help the foundation spread and blend more easily.You can add more foundation later if you find you need extra to cover all the essential spots.
One of the keys to even foundation is using it sparingly, and only using foundation where it’s actually needed., Dip the application tool into the foundation and pick up about half the foundation that’s there.Use the brush or sponge to dab a row of evenly spaced dots around the border of your face. Then put a few dots on each cheek, one or two on the chin, and one on your nose.Use dabs that are evenly sized so that you'll have even foundation coverage.Remember to concentrate on the areas that need the most coverage, which is usually the center of the face around the eyes and nose. If you need less around the outer edges of your face, only place a few dabs around the border.

, Starting with your nose, start blending the foundation into your skin with the tip of the brush or sponge. Work in small areas to spread the foundation.


When you're finished with the nose, move on to the cheeks, spreading and blending the dabs of foundation. Spread to cover the cheeks, but also focus on working the foundation inward toward the center of your face.
After your cheeks, move on to the foundation around the border of your face, followed by the chin. Make sure you cover the areas you're working on, but also concentrate on spreading the foundation toward the center., You may need to put some more foundation on your brush at this point. Dab small amounts of foundation around your mouth, under your eyes, and near your hair line.


Spread and blend the foundation as before. Make sure you blend the new foundation seamlessly into the foundation that was already applied, and blend well around the hairline so you don’t leave a noticeable border.
Make sure you only apply small amounts around your mouth, otherwise you may end up with noticeable foundation marks in the creases and smile lines.

, To ensure that there isn't a defined line of color between your face and neck, apply a small amount of foundation below your jaw and where your ears connect with your head.


Blend the foundation under your jaw and around your ears inward and upward to connect it with the foundation on your face, as well as out and down to blend it into the skin on your neck., Use the remaining foundation on your hand to brush foundation to any areas that have been missed. Avoid adding more foundation to areas that have already been covered, or it will be thicker and unevenly applied in those spots.


Only apply as much foundation as needed to cover the remaining areas, and blend well into the existing foundation on your face.

, Foundation can get into the fine lines and wrinkles on your face, and if this happens, it will leave creases that accentuate your wrinkles and make your foundation uneven.


Apply smaller amounts of foundation in areas where you have more wrinkles or lines, and blend very well in these areas. You can also use a clean brush or sponge to remove excess foundation from these areas as you blend., Using the same brush or sponge that you used for application, go over your entire face to buff the foundation and even it out. Work the brush or sponge in small circles to remove excess, blend fully, and give the foundation a more natural skin texture.


Go over your entire face two or three times like this, making sure to get under your eyes, under the jaw, and around the hairline as well., Foundation needs about three minutes to dry and set properly. If you skip this step, you risk smudging the foundation and making it appear uneven in areas.If necessary, buff certain areas again during this time, or blot excess foundation from areas using a tissue.

, Concealer goes on after foundation to cover blemishes, redness, and dark spots. With your finger, dab on small amounts of concealer as needed, such as on your cheeks, on pimples, or under your eyes. Then use the same finger to gently massage and blend the concealer into your foundation.To cover flaws properly, use a salmon concealer for blue or purple spots under the eyes, and use a green-tinted concealer for reddish blemishes. Avoid beige concealers or concealers that match the color of your skin tone.

, A setting powder will stick to your foundation and concealer and prevent it from smudging on your face, meaning your foundation will stay even and perfect all day. Setting powders also make great bases for other makeup.Dip a large powder brush into your powder, and tap the brush to remove excess. Then apply the powder to your face using circular motions with the brush.
With a smaller, denser brush, go over the powder on your face in a circular motion to blend the powder evenly and cover more fine lines.
Setting and finishing powders are different, and setting powder usually goes on after foundation, then finishing powder goes on top.

, Your undertone is the true color of your skin underneath sun tans, wind burns, acne and pimples, and redness and discoloration. It never changes, and it’s what you should use to determine what colors best complement you when it comes to things like clothes, makeup, hair, and jewelry. There are three different undertones that you could be, and they are:


Cool: this means you have green, blue, or grey eyes paired with black, blond, or brown hair.You will look best in silver jewelry, and you may turn red or burn easily in the sun.
Warm: this means you probably have brown, amber, or hazel eyes paired with black, strawberry blond, or auburn hair. You look better in gold jewelry, and you tend to tan or bronze in the sun.Neutral: you can have any combination of hair and eye color, you look good in both silver and gold jewelry, and you probably have bluish-green veins on your inner wrist., While undertones can be cool, warm, or neutral, these designations actually refer to the true shade of your skin, meaning you'll have different complementary colors based on your undertone.Cool: opt for tan, cocoa, sable, and fawn shades, and foundations with a blue or red base.
Warm: try golden, chestnut, honey, and caramel shades, and foundations with a gold or yellow base.
Neutral: you can wear them all, but look for something in the middle of pink and yellow, such as ivory, praline, or dark tan.

, Your skin type might be oily or dry, for instance, and the best foundation for you will be specifically formulated to manage that condition.But no matter your skin type or what foundation you choose, always look for one that offers broad-spectrum protection from the sun.


Oily skin: choose an oil-free or oil-absorbing foundation with a matte finish.
Dry skin: look for a moisturizing cream foundation.
Sensitive skin: try hypoallergenic foundations that are mineral-based and fragrance-free.
Combination skin: go for a powder foundation.Uneven complexion: choose a medium- or full-coverage foundation.

, To ensure that a new foundation is the right shade and match for your skin, you should always test it out before wearing it. To test a new foundation:On one side of your face, use a sponge or your finger to apply a small streak of foundation under your eye, around your nose, on your cheek, and on your jawline. Blend the foundation in to your skin slightly.
In a mirror, compare the makeup-free and makeup sides of your face. Ideally, you want the foundation to disappear into your skin so that the foundation and non-foundation sides of your face still match.
If the foundation is noticeable and doesn’t look natural, choose another shade.
When necessary, go one shade darker than your actual skin rather than lighter, as this will provide better coverage for flaws and will look a little more natural than a shade that’s too light.

Choose your crease shade.,
Find the right brush.,
Find your crease.,
Grab your crease brush and tip it into the product.,
Place the brush into your crease.,
Grab a piece of scotch tape and put it on the back of your hand.,
Place this strip on your eye- from the outer part of your eyelid, lining up to the end of the eyebrow.

,
Apply crease eyeshadow like you normally would, allowing the shadow to go over the tape, too.

,
Carefully, and gently, remove the tape from your eye!,
Done!",How to Apply Eyeshadow in Your Crease," Apply certain eyeshadow to your crease to define it, and contour it. It's also the transition between your lid color and your highlight.


Look for a matte, medium brown color. You want it to be matte, especially for a natural look, to be a good transitional shade for your highlight. Matte is where the color has no sparkle or shimmer. Light to medium browns will do the best.
Even if you are doing a dramatic, smokey, cut crease look, or a simply everyday makeup look, that matte medium brown shade will do the trick. This particular brown might be labeled as: mocha, hot chocolate, soft brown, etc. You can also use a dark brown, but the application process will take longer, because you have to use less product, and then you have to built up the intensity, if you are doing a natural look with the dark brown shade.

, The best brush to use is a round, fluffy brush. If you have a deeper crease, you should go for a more tapered brush. Your crease's skin is extremely thin, so you want to be gentle. Don't use a brush with pointy, sharp bristles. Use something soft and fluffy.

, Everybody's eyes are different. Find out where your crease is. Basically, your crease is the hollow part of your eye. It's between your brown bone, and your lid. The crease is the skin that unfolds when you close your eyes. Simply find the bottom of your browbone.

, Make sure you know how dark and pigmented your eye shadow is. Pigmented means that the product has a lot of color payoff.


If your eyeshadow is not that pigmented, you can swirl your brush in it a couple times. If it IS pigmented, dip the brush in it lightly, and tap off the excess. Rub your finger in the product to test how pigmented it is. Also, if the product is really dark, make sure to dip the brush in it EXTRA lightly! Even the lightest shadows can make mistakes!

, Make sure to go from the end of your eyebrow, to at least 3/4 of the inner part of your eye. You don't have to blend it all the way to the inner corner. The blending will expand the color.


But, for now, just slide the brush back and forth in the crease. Don't go too far outside from the eyebrow line, and don't go too much inside the eye either- it may take a few tries to find out the perfect way to apply it to your specific eye shape. Add more eyeshadow to intensify the color.
Every time you apply the shadow, you must always go back and forth. Now, it's time to blend. Swipe your brush, again, back and forth without any product on it. Spread it around until it fades the way you want it to. Using a lighter brown shadow for a natural look would be much simpler. You don't even have to blend sometimes, with a lighter color.

, Rip it off and put it back on and rip it off again until you lose some of the stickiness.;
,,, Your eye look now has a cat eye twist to it. You can even apply winged eyeliner to make the look even more dramatic.

, Now you can apply highlighter to your brow bone. Practice your crease eyeshadow, and you'll get the hang of it! Crease eyeshadow can be applied alone, to add full dimension to your eye, OR with eyeshadow- whether it's natural, or intense.

It will also catch any loose bits of powder. If you don't have any plastic, resealable bags, cover the broken powder with a sheet of plastic wrap. Make sure that it is wrapped firmly over the edges, or the powder will escape.This method will use rubbing alcohol. The rubbing alcohol will evaporate, and leave behind the hardened powder.It is considered safe, but if you have very sensitive skin, you might want to consider the method.;
, Use a spoon, mini spatula, or the base of a makeup brush to do this. Keep smashing the powder until you end up with a fine dust. Make sure that there are no clumps or chunks left, or your compact will be very grainy.









This may seem like you are only making things worse, but it will help give you a smoother finish in the end.

, If any powder got out, try to carefully tip it back into the compact. Break it up into a fine dust, if necessary.








, Depending on how big the compact is, this could be as little as a few drops, to as much as a capful. Use enough rubbing alcohol so that the powder is damp, but not so much that it starts to float.








Try to use at least 70% rubbing alcohol.The higher the percentage, the faster it will evaporate/dry.If you added too much rubbing alcohol, dip the corner of a tissue into it. The tissue will soak up the excess rubbing alcohol.

, Keep smooshing the powder around until you get an even, creamy consistency. There should be no clumps or chunks.

Finished.

",How to Restore Broken Compact Powder2," It is possible to set broken powder using just pressure, but it will be very fragile. The heat from the iron will help set the powder further and make it more durable.


Because this method contains no rubbing alcohol, it is safe for sensitive skin.Most compact powders will come in a metal pan set into a plastic tray. Make sure that your compact powder has this metal pan.

, You can use anything hard, such as a toothpick or fork. This may seem like you are only making things worse, but it will help give you a smoother finish.

, Make sure that you get all of the powder out. If you need to, use a toothpick or the end of a fork to get the powder out of the corners. You will be breaking the powder up further inside this bag.

, The easiest way to do this is to simply press down on it with the flat side of a fork. You can use anything you'd like however, even a spoon. Make sure that there are no clumps or crumbs however; the powder must be very fine. If you leave any clumps or crumbs, your finished powder will be very grainy.

, Most powdered makeup will come in a metal pan that is glued into a plastic case. You will need to pull this metal pan out before you move on to the next step. The easiest way to do this is to hook a butter knife under the lip of the pan, and then pry/pop it out.


If you don't pull the pan out, you will risk melting the plastic tray.

, Open up your resealable bag, and tip the powder into the pan. Don't worry if you lose some powder.

, Place the bowl of the spoon onto the powder, and press down on it until it becomes firm. Start around the edges of the powder, and work your way towards the center. Try not to push any of the powder out of the pan. When you are done, the powder should be packed firmly into the pan.


At this point, the powder may look as good as new, but it is very fragile and may shatter again with the smallest bump. You will need to set it further using heat.

, By now, your iron should be nice and hot. Turn it off and unplug it. This is very important. It will ensure that no water gets into your powdered makeup, which can ruin it.


Make sure that the steam option on your iron is turned off. You want to use dry heat.

, Make sure that you are pressing down as hard as your can. Do not move the iron up-and-down or side-to-side like you would when ironing clothes. The heat of the iron will help ""set"" the powder., When you lift the iron, you may notice that your powder is looking a lot smoother already. You will need to do the pressing process one more time, however. Again, make sure that you are pressing down hard, and that you are not moving the iron around.

, While the pan cools, swirl some glue inside the cavity in the plastic case. Then, carefully lift the metal pan up, and press it back into the plastic case. Wait for the glue to dry before closing the case.

Don’t feel badly about such circles or blemishes, though. You can cover them up with concealer. Apply the concealer in an upside-down pyramid shape.You generally want concealer that matches your skin. Make sure also that your concealer matches your foundation tone. If you have dark circles, however, use a concealer with orange tones under your eye to neutralize the color.
Do not use a concealer lighter than your skin tone. Instead, match the concealer to the lightest part of your face. This will look natural and brighten your complexion.
Use your ring finger when you apply the concealer across your skin (or a makeup brush). The ring finger is good to use for applying makeup because it will provide a softer touch to the skin. Using your finger will help melt and blend the concealer for a flawless look.;
, Foundation will complete the base. You should either apply tinted moisturizer or a liquid foundation. This is a different product than the primer.









Use a foundation brush to apply the foundation, rather than a sponge. The brush will smooth out the application of the foundation and make it look more evenly applied on your face.It’s critically important that you find the right color foundation. You should try to match the color along your jawline. Don’t use too much foundation. You want it to even out your skin tone, not appear like a mask.
Choose foundation from the yellow family if you are concerned about dark circles under your eyes. Matching the foundation color to your chest is a good way to find the right color for your face., Don’t want to put foundation all over your face because you prefer a more natural look? You could try using a foundation stick.


This is also a less time-consuming way to apply base makeup. Use the stick as if it’s a giant marker. Draw thick lines down your cheekbones, on the sides of your nose, and above your eyebrows, and then blend it in.
If you want to look bronzed, you could use a stick that’s a little darker, and put it in the same places over the lighter foundation. Blend both together.

, You can also use powder or compact foundation that is not in liquid form.









To apply this type of foundation, you will want to use a small makeup brush. Sometimes these brushes come with the makeup, and sometimes you have to apply them separately.
Hold the brush horizontally. Brush it across the powder with short strokes. Press the brush to your face in slightly rolling motions. Then, dust the powder over your face., Powder is an important step when completing base makeup because it will set the foundation and finish off the look.


Set the foundation with loose powder. Buy a large powder brush to apply it. Foundation will last longer if you use powder on top of it. Use translucent powder. It will control shine and provide a matte finish to your face. It's not designed to add color, but rather to set your makeup.
Make sure you dust areas of your face that get very oily. Do this first, especially in the T-zone. Then, dust the powder throughout the rest of your face.

, Now that you’ve got the base makeup down, you should apply blush or bronzer in order to highlight your cheekbones.









Put bronzer on your face, your neck, and your chest. This will even out the tone of your skin. Make sure to use a brush, and make sure the bronzer is blended.Smile before applying blusher. Then start by applying the blush on the apple of your cheek. Blend it back towards the top of your ear, and then brush it down toward your jawline. Blend it in so it doesn’t look too stark.

, Contouring is a makeup trick used by many movie stars in order to alter the shape of their faces. The first step to contouring is to create a sound base using the steps above.









Then, suck your cheeks in, and sweep bronzing powder on the hollows of your cheekbones. Now, take cream highlighter. Apply it above the bronzer.Make sure that you blend the cream in. Use stick foundations. With a darker one, trace your temples and carry it up to your hairline. To make your cheekbones stand out, place the pigment right above the cheekbones. For the nose, you can apply the stick on either side, either narrower at the top or carry it to the brow. Take a sponge and blend the contouring makeup into your base makeup. Now take the lighter stick, and apply it underneath your eyes. You could put some in the center of your forehead, on your chin, and on the bridge of your nose too. Dust the face with lose powder., This is really important. Before you apply base makeup, you will want to start with a fresh palette.


Don’t forget to clean your hands, though, in addition to your face. Use a cleanser so you aren’t treating your face to harsh chemicals or soaps. Makeup remover or wipes can do a great job.After you clean your face and hands, apply moisturizer to your face, and make sure that it contains SPF! Wearing daily SPF is the best way to make sure your skin is protected and looks good.

, By exfoliating your face, you remove dry skin from it. This evens out your skin tone, and it makes your skin look healthier and glowing.








After you've cleaned your face with your regular cleanser, you are ready to exfoliate it. You should do this process about twice a week.
Mix three tablespoons of white sugar with a tablespoon of water for a homemade technique (you can also buy exfoliating scrubs at the store). Put some of the paste on a washcloth, and gently rub it all over your face in small circular motions. Then, rinse it off., Primer is a really good way to prep your skin and to make it look smoother and more flawless. You can get it at many department store makeup counters.


Think of primer as a much lighter foundation. You shouldn’t be able to tell it’s there. It provides the foundation for the rest of your makeup, and will make it last longer and be less likely to smudge.
Make sure that you apply it evenly throughout your face, including underneath your eyes. Don’t choose primer that’s dramatically darker than your skin. You can buy primer for different skin types, including oily, dry and combination skin.When choosing the color of your primer, understand that different colors correct different issues. Yellow and green-based primers are designed to stop redness. Pink-based primers add life to dull skin. Peach and salmon primers are good if you have darker patches or circles under your eyes."

Drink lots of water.,
Apply sunscreen regularly.,
Exercise regularly.,
Forego junk food and eat fresh fruits and vegetables instead.",How to Even Out Skin Complexion1," Water is responsible for cleansing skin from the inside out and preventing wrinkles. Keeping well hydrated will keep your skin looking plump and fresh as a child’s.


Try to drink at least 64 ounces of fluid a day, including water. Try to make water your primary drink, substituting it for sugary drinks or alcohol.Avoid sodas and alcohol which can affect skin negatively. The sugar and chemicals in soda and sugary drinks causes acne and oil buildup, while drinking alcohol steals moisture from your skin and gives the appearance of premature aging.
Try adding cucumber or lemon slices to your water, as both have proven to have extra skin-boosting benefits and add a refreshing twist to your H2O.;
, Sun damage is one of the top causes of an uneven skin tone, so protect yourself by using a minimum SPF15 on a daily basis.


Avoid tanning beds and laying out in the sun for hours whenever possible, as these are incredibly dangerous due to their carcinogenic properties.
Although SPF 15 is the minimum level of sun protection, to really save your skin apply at least an SPF 30.
Apply sunscreen on a daily basis, even if it is cloudy out. 80% of the sun’s radiation penetrates cloud cover, meaning you can still receive sun damage when it’s gray and rainy.
Use an SPF that has both UVA and UVB protection. UVA are the rays from the sun that cause wrinkles and age spots, while UVB rays are responsible for burning your skin.Keep in mind that many facial moisturizers and foundations contain sunscreen. Check the label to be sure. If your makeup or moisturizer does not contain sunscreen then you can always wear sunscreen under your makeup.

, Working out doesn’t just affect your size and weight, but helps to generate new skin cells which keeps your complexion even and young.


Heavy workouts aren’t required to get healthy looking skin. Instead, focus on just getting your blood pumping for a few minutes every day.
If you get dirty during your workout, be sure to wash your face afterwards to keep oil and dirt from getting trapped in your pores and causing your skin to break out.

, Healthy eating in general can help to promote a clear complexion. However, in the beginning you might notice you are breaking out a bit more due to your skin pushing out all the toxins. The chemicals, oils, and sugar in junk food cause your skin to create more oil, which clogs your pores.


Instead of completely cutting junk food out of your diet, slowly incorporate more fresh food and less processed food to help your skin.
Some foods like blueberries and salmon, which are high in antioxidants, are great for evening out your complexion.

Concealers come in either your natural skin color (a shade of brown or tan), or in colors such as yellow, green, and lavender. These colored concealers (also known as color correctors) are used to neutralize redness or acne spots in your skin.
Always use a concealer brush, which is a small, stiff, round-edged makeup brush, to apply concealer. Using your fingertips can expose your pores to more bacteria, worsening your acne or redness.
Don’t rub concealer in, but rather dab it on and blend the edges with your brush. You can also use a clean sponge to blend in your concealer.
Make sure your concealer isn’t too dark, as this will result in rusty orange colored spots on your face instead of sun or age spots. It is better to use a concealer that is too light rather than one that is too dark, as applying foundation over the top will help to darken the concealer. Be sure to sue a color corrector first and then apply concealer over that.

, Foundation is the makeup used to cover your whole face to even out your entire skin tone. Foundations come in many variations, including powders, liquids, creams, and aerosol sprays. Although any of these work, powders tend to be the longest lasting and will cover up any natural oils on your skin.


Always use a large foundation brush, sometimes called a kabuki brush, to apply your foundation. This is regardless of whether your foundation is a powder or liquid; the brush gives an even application and will help to blend the color. Using your fingers spreads bacteria that can make your skin worse, and will not give as even of an application. Using a beauty blender sponge also helps to ensure that your foundation is even.

You can use either a powder or cream blush, but find one that matches your skin texture and needs the best.
Blushes are available in hues of pink, peach, and violet. For very fair skin, go with a pink shade. Medium and beige skin tones benefit from a peachy hue. For dark rich skin coloring, use a plum or violet blush.

, Use a bronzer in the hollows under your cheekbones and a highlighter above to mimic the natural shadows that occur with the light.


Sweep the bronzer on starting near your hairline towards your nose, avoiding a heavy application. Be sure to blend well.
Use a highlighter to add light to the parts of your face that are kissed by the sun. This is typically a light, slightly metallic cream or powder that can be applied with a brush or rolled on. Put the highlighter on your face under your eyebrows, at the corner of your inner eye, and in a “C” shape from the bottom of your cheekbones to the base of your forehead. You can also add some highlighter along the cupid’s bow on your upper lip and going down the bridge of your nose.

Facials often differ depending on your specific skin problems. Look for facials that target acne, sun damage, skin disorders, or aging depending on your needs.
Facials can be expensive, but it is better to pay a bit more for an esthetician you trust than to try to be cheap. They aren’t particularly dangerous, but for the best results it is worth a higher price.

, These help fight age spots and wrinkles, but can only be performed by a dermatologist. Keep in mind that this might be a bit expensive and may not be covered by insurance.


A laser treatment works by sending short, strong pulses of light to remove layers of skin. Because of this, it is sometimes also called a laser peel.
Avoid getting a laser treatment if you have acne, as this could worsen the condition.
Recovery from a laser treatment takes up to two weeks. This is the time in which the skin will regrow and all discoloration or scabbing has disappeared., This is a combination of a peel and exfoliant that helps to remove dead skin and discoloration. These are available from your dermatologist and some spas.


Microdermabrasion is essentially “sanding” away skin with a peel and a special brush or tool. Therefore, it works best for dark spots and dull skin.

",How to Apply Contour Makeup," Using a foundation the same (or close) color as your skin evens your skin tone and provides a base you can build upon when you contour using lightest and darkest shades. Contouring your face without first applying foundation is much more difficult, since skin tends to be uneven in color. Your face could end up looking patchy instead of smooth and contoured.








Use a foundation composed of the same material as the other products you'll be using; for example, use all cream products or all powder products, rather than mixing the two. Mixing textures can result in a caked-on look. The only exception is your finishing layer of powder, which you either way to help your look last longer.
If you're having trouble figuring out what color to get, try matching your foundation to the skin on your neck. Your neck skin tends to be a bit paler than your face, and matching your foundation to your neck will ensure your face doesn't end up looking darker when you're finished doing your makeup.

, Facial contouring consists of highlighting places you want to stand out, and shading places you want to recede. For your highlighting product, you need foundation that's about two shades paler than your base foundation.








Don't go much lighter than two shades, or your makeup won't look natural.
You can use a lighter concealer or eye shadow in place of foundation.

, The darker tone will be used to shade the parts of your face that you want to draw attention away from. You'll be creating strategic shadows that make your cheekbones appear sharper and your chin more narrow.









Don't go darker than two shades below your normal skin tone, or your makeup won't look natural.
Bronzer, darker eye shadow or darker concealer work as well as foundation. Just remember to make sure all your products are either cream or powder; don't mix the two.

, Since your face will be wearing several different shades, it's important to get a good blending brush. If the different colors aren't well-blended your makeup will look unnatural. You want a big, bushy foundation brush or blending brush, rather than a smaller brush. Go for one with natural bristles to leave the softest-looking finish.









If you don't have a brush, the next best tool to use is your fingers. The warmth from your fingers will help the makeup blend smoothly. This is especially useful when you're working with cream foundation.

, Contouring makeup reaches up to your hairline at the top of your forehead, past your temples and down the sides of your face. Pull your hair away from your face so you'll be able to see what you're doing without it getting in the way.








, When you contour your face, you want to start with a completely blank canvas. Remove all your makeup, wash your face, and pat it dry with a towel. Exfoliate if necessary to remove dead skin, then apply moisturizer. Let your moisturizer soak in for several minutes before you apply your makeup.









Prepping is essential if you want a smooth, flawless finish. You don't want to go to the trouble of contouring your face, only to have your makeup smudge or look dirty.

, Use your fingers or a foundation brush to apply a light layer of your normal foundation all over your face, stretching all the way to the top of your forehead and below your chin. Use a blending brush or your fingers to blend your foundation under your chin and around your neck so there won't be a line separating your face from your neck.









You may want to apply concealer at this stage as well. Focus on under-eye circles and any blemishes.

, Take the foundation that's a few shades lighter than your normal skin tone. Use your finger or a clean foundation brush to apply a 1/2 inch to 1 inch stroke of foundation to the places on your face where the sun would naturally hit. To help you figure out where the sun would hit, stand in a well-lit room with overhead lighting and look at where it hits your face. Here's where you want to apply light foundation:









In the center of your forehead.
Along the top of your brow lines.
Along the bridge of your nose.
On the apples of your cheeks (to find them, smile).
On your cupid's bow (the section between the tip of your nose and the top of your lip).
In the center of your chin.

, Apply your contour in the shape of a 3, starting from your forehead, coming in just under your cheekbones and going down towards your chin. These are the places your face would naturally be shadowed from the sun. Here's where you want to apply the dark foundation:









Right below your hairline at the top of your forehead.
On the right and left sides of your forehead, near your hairline on either side.
Along the right and left sides of your nose.
In the hollows of your cheeks (to find them, suck your cheeks in).
Along your jawline on both sides, from your ears to the tip of your chin.

, Use your fingers or the foundation brush to blend the colors for a natural finish. Take care not to spread the colors around too much; you want them to stay in the general area where you placed them. Make sure the edges are blended well so that there are no sharp divisions between the lighter and darker foundation.








, If you want the light areas to stand out even more, add a highlighter product to enhance the look. Cream highlighter is slightly shimmery, so it catches the light more than regular foundation. Apply it in the exact same places where you applied the lighter foundation.








, If you feel your face looks a little wan without some pink color, apply a small amount of blush to the apples of your cheeks. Be sure to blend the blush well with the other products on your face.







, Setting powder is helpful to use when your products are cream-based. It helps to keep everything in place and gives the look a smooth finish. Use a clean powder brush to add a light coating of setting powder over your entire face.








, If you're going out on the town, you may want to add some shimmer and shine. Choose a shimmery, translucent face powder an apply a light layer to your face, focusing on the highlighted areas. Apply a bit to your neck and chest as well.







, Make sure everything is completely blended and set before you start applying eye and lip makeup. Contouring is a bold look, so you may want to choose either heavy eye makeup or a bright lip, but not both.

",How to Apply Concealer," Concealer comes in a variety of shapes and colors, so analyze your skin first to determine what you need. Are you trying to cover up acne? Under eye circles? Scars or birthmarks? Once you determine what you want to conceal, you can choose the appropriate color and shade. Use the color wheel to help you figure out which color corrector to use. Match the opposite color on the color wheel to cancel it out.









Green tinted concealer is used to reduce redness.
Yellow tinted concealer will brighten your face.
Lavender concealer can help even out complexions with yellow tones.
Orange or red-tinted concealer is used to cover purple or dark spots.
For scars or under eye circles, use a concealer 1-2 shades lighter than your natural skin tone. Determine whether your skin tone is warm or cool before picking a shade. Be careful not to get too light of a shade, or your complexion might look ashy.
Test skin tone concealer on your face, not on your hands, in order to get a true color match. make sure that you test your concealer without any other makeup on first.;
, Concealers come in many different forms. There are sticks, potted creams, and pencils. These all offer different types of coverage, and some may be better for certain skin types than others.


If you have large pores and oily skin, you may want to avoid cream or stick concealers, as they may make your pores look bigger. Look for a liquid concealer instead.Use a pencil concealer for acne, as the pointed edge makes it easier to apply around the acne spots. Thicker, cream concealers are also effective as they can be molded and blended over the blemish.

, Before you apply any concealer, wash your face with a mild face cleanser and apply a moisturizer. Use makeup remover and a q-tip to get rid of any darkness under your eyes that might be the result of old mascara. Your concealer is the first step in your makeup application, and will go on most smoothly over a blank canvas.








, Use a concealer brush or your fingertips (the former is more sanitary) to dab concealer under your eyes. Apply the concealer in the shape of an upside down triangle. Draw a triangle from one end of your eye to the other, bringing the point down your cheek to your nose crease. Blend the concealer in around the edges, so that there is not an obvious change in tone between your skin and the concealer.









Never rub the concealer in around your eyes, as the skin here is damaged very easily. Simply pat or dab the concealer with the tips of your finger or brush in order to blend it. This will also give you lots more coverage than rubbing.
Work the concealer up on the inside of your nose if your eyes are deep-set. This area is often neglected by concealer application, and will leave you still looking sleepy.
Be sure to apply your concealer all the way to the very base of your lash line, directly under your waterline.
Dotting concealer under your eye in a U-shape will appear less natural, and it may be noticeable in photographs.

, If you have any acne, dark spots, sun spots, scars, or birthmarks, now is the time to cover them up. Dab your concealer onto the top of each mark, and then blend softly outwards to your skin. Use a thin layer of concealer to avoid having a caked-on look, and apply more if necessary.









If you have acne, avoid using your fingers to blend the concealer. Using your fingers may spread bacteria that will worsen your breakout, and it will melt the concealer, giving you less coverage. Instead, use a clean makeup brush.
If you are using concealer over a wide area (to cover rosacea, for example), use an especially thin layer and blend the edges very well. The more concealer you wear, the more likely it will become apparent over the course of the day. You can set your concealer with powder to keep it looking natural all day long.

, When you are certain all your dark spots and under eye circles have been covered and blended, add a layer of foundation over the top of your concealer. To kill two birds with one stone, use a loose or compact powder foundation. You can also use a cream or liquid foundation, but you will have to add an additional setting powder over the top.









Spread your foundation over the entirety of your face. Use a translucent setting powder with a large brush over the top of your foundation to set it for a solid 12 hours.
Use a brush to reach the inside corners of your eyes and under your lash line; make sure that you cover every part of your face that also has concealer.
Dab a little extra powder over the areas where you put concealer to make sure that they won’t run off over the course of the day., Once you have finished applying your concealer to your liking, the next step is to put on your foundation. Choose between liquid, cream, powder, or mist foundations to create a smooth skin tone and blank canvas for the rest of your makeup.








, Covering your face with concealer and foundation completely smooths out your complexion, but also removes any natural shadows or bronzed areas that your skin has. Apply a bronzer to your cheekbones, inside contours of your nose, and around the perimeter of your face to add dimension to your makeup.








, Although not everyone has a natural rosy tint to their cheeks, it is typical to have a slight blush appear naturally on your face. Add blush to recreate this over the top of your flat foundation.









To apply blush, smile, and brush the blush on the apples of your cheek. Blend it upwards towards your temples.

, To add even further depth to your face makeup, use a cream or powder highlighter along the tops of your cheekbones, under your brow bones, and the inside corner of your eyes. This will make your face pop and set off your entire makeup look.








, It is likely that with all the makeup that you've been throwing around that your eyebrows have gotten a little colored and look a bit dull. Fill in your eyebrows to create a natural darkness and draw attention to your eyes and the shape of your face.

Often times, a disorganized collection can be the result of an inadequate storage system. Your storage container or containers may be too small for your collection, or their compartments may not be the right sizes for your makeup items. In this case, you will want to get new makeup storage.;
, You don’t necessarily have to buy new makeup storage. You can find containers around your home that can act as excellent storage for your makeup. Bring all of these over to your makeup. If you end up not using them, you can put them back.Clear mason jars are great containers to hold items like makeup brushes.
Spice racks can be great makeup organizers, because they can display your makeup in tiers so that you can see all of your products clearly.
Ice cube trays are great organizational systems for small compact makeup items such as individual eye shadows.
Silverware drawer organizers are also great for storing makeup because they have multiple compartments.
If you can afford it, go to your dollar store to get a tray with dividers.

, If you don’t have a good enough makeup storage system at your home, you will need to buy some containers. Before going out to purchase them, take a picture of your makeup, and of the separate categories you have created. Write down the specific categories of makeup that you don’t have room for.


For instance, if you don't have enough room for lipstick, write down ""Lipstick"" and take a picture so you can remember about how much you have.

, There are containers and displays made specifically for storing makeup. These containers have compartments that are sized specifically for makeup products and are clear so you can easily see your makeup. You can buy these containers at stores like The Container Store, as well as at stores like Target or Walmart., If you need storage for your blushes and powder, don’t buy a container meant to store small items like eye shadows or lipsticks. Refer to the pictures that you took of your makeup. See what items you need to store, and then find containers that are built for these items.Containers with deep, narrow compartments are best for lipsticks and eyeliners so the product can stand upright.
Wide, shallow containers are good for items like blush, bronzer or powders.
Small, shallow containers are well suited for individual eyeliners.
You can often find acrylic organizers that have a variety of compartments meant for different makeup items.

, You want to be sure that the makeup organizer you are buying not only has enough space for the products you have now, but will fit products you buy in the future. This way you can avoid more organizational problems down the road.

, If you have a lot of loose eye shadow pans, buy a magnetic makeup palette like a Z palette. Glue magnets to the back of your eyeshadow pans, then put them in the palette. This is a great way of consolidating your eyeshadows.If you have eye shadows that are still in their little pod packaging, you can pry the flat circular pan of the eyeshadow out of the packaging and put them in the magnetic palette.
Take a sharp object like tweezers or a thin spatula to pry the pan out of the packaging. Then you can glue a magnet to the back and put it in the palette., If you are a professional makeup artist, you probably have a huge collection. Buy a makeup trunk at a beauty supply store that will fit your entire collection. This will give you a way to easily transport your makeup to your different appointments.

, Your new makeup organizers may take up more space than your system before. Clear out enough space on whatever surface you use to display your makeup to comfortably fit all of your makeup organizers and containers. A crammed, crowded space can make your collection look disorderly and unorganized.

, This will help you transfer items into the containers. Place makeup items into containers. Put your brushes in the cup/can (bristles facing upward) and then divide your makeup into sections.Doing the dividing will help you not have to dig through things. Also, you can put hair ties in other sections if wanted. Also pins, clips ties ect.

Put foundations, powders, and concealers in one section. That way, you will have them at hand without having to dig through your makeup.
Put mascaras and eyeliners in another section. This will help tremendously because you will have all products in one place.
Put lip products in one section. It's good to have all of these products separated so you don't have to dig around or if you leave a product open, it won't get on another.
Put eye pallets in another section. If you have any other products that I have not mentioned, divide them up and put them into sections also.

Throw away makeup you never use.,
Organize lipsticks by color.,
Organize eyeliners by type.,
Organize eye shadows by shade.,
Put products you don’t often use somewhere separate.,
Organize your makeup by brand if you are a professional makeup artist.",How to Organize Your Makeup Collection2," Lay out all of your makeup and look at it with a critical eye. Think about what items you never use, or are used up. You don’t need old, dried out mascara, or that sparkly green eyeliner you loved four years ago. Throw out items that you don’t use anymore., Take your lipsticks and organize them by color. Put all the reds together, all the pinks together, all the purples together, etc. This will make it easy to find the shade you want if you are in a hurry, and don't have time to look at each individual lipstick carefully., Separate your liquid, gel and pencil eyeliners. If you have a large collection of eyeliners, you can also make subcategories according to color. For instance, you can put all brown liquid eyeliners to one side and all black liquid eyeliners to another.

, Take your eye shadows and split them into different groups. You can organize them by color, but you can also divide them between brights and neutrals, or between mattes and shimmer eye shadows. In general, organizing them by color tends to be the most practical, but do what works best for you and your individual collection.If you’ve put your eye shadows into a magnetic palette, you can rearrange them as you see fit.

, These aren’t products that you want to get rid of, but they may be things like black lipstick or orange eye shadow that you use occasionally for only specific or dramatic looks. Put these products in a box or plastic bag and store them in a drawer or closet, or move them to the back of your organizer. You don’t want them to take up space, and there is no point in displaying them prominently if you almost never use them.

, If you are a professional makeup artist, you probably have the entire collection of some makeup brands. Make subcategories of brand as you are organizing.


For example, still categorize by type of makeup, but put all Mac lipsticks together, all Urban Decay lipsticks together, all Clinique lipsticks together, etc.
Your clients often will want their makeup done using one brand. If you also categorize by brand, this will help you find the products your client wants to use.

Put often-used products in their own organizer.,
Put all your makeup tools in the same place.,
Have separate sections for eye products, lip products and face products.,
Put your makeup back after you use it.",How to Organize Your Makeup Collection3," Even if you don’t use makeup every day, there are probably products that you reach for every time you do your makeup. These are likely basic products like your favorite foundation, concealer, eyeliner and mascara. Take these products and put them in their own organizer. You can even just put them in a small tray in front of your organizer for easy access.If you don’t have a separate organizer to use for these products, put them in the front of your organizer so that they are easily accessible.

, Take all your brushes and put them in clear makeup jars or a tall compartment in your makeup organizer. Take any other tools that you use and store them together so you know where they are., When you are doing your makeup, you generally work on one area of your face at a time, so having your makeup organized by eyes, lips and face will make the process of applying makeup easier.Eye shadows in individual packaging are best organized in small, shallow compartments. Put your mascaras and other eye products in a compartment next to your shadows and liners. This way you only have one place to look when you are doing your eye makeup.
Put face products like foundation, concealer, powder, blush and bronzer in the same area in your organizer. Since many of these products are in pans or are free-standing, they work best in wide, shallow containers.
Put all your lip products together. Lipstick is best displayed upright in deep compartments, or laid flat in trays. Also put any products like lipliner or lipgloss next to your lipsticks.

, Now that you have organized your collection, do your best to maintain it. Even if you’re in a hurry, always put your makeup items back in their proper place. This can save you the headache of reorganizing later, and it will make your makeup collection look impeccable!"

However, you don’t want it to be too big or it may not fit in your purse, backpack, or other bag. Look for a makeup bag that’s just large enough to hold all of your essentials.It’s also a good idea to consider the color of your makeup bag carefully. If you have a large purse or bag, a makeup bag can easily get lost inside. Choose one in a color that will stand out against the inside of your bag so you can find it in a hurry when you need it. A bright color such as red, yellow, or magenta is a good option.;
, No matter how careful you are with your makeup, chances are that some of it is going to spill, leak, or stain the inside of the bag. Look for a bag with a washable lining, so you can easily clean it if gets dirty.A vinyl lining is usually the easiest to clean. You can even wipe it down with a makeup wipe if you’re in a hurry.

, In a full makeup bag, it’s easy to lose track of items. Opting for a bag that has multiple compartments allows you to separate your makeup products so you can find what you’re looking for more quickly. For example, you might keep lip products in one pocket and eye products in another.If you can’t find a bag with compartments, consider using bags within bags. Find a couple of smaller bags that will fit inside your larger makeup bag so you can separate your items.

, A bottle of foundation would take up too much space in an emergency makeup bag, but you should carry a concealer. It’s perfect for touchups throughout the day if your foundation starts to fade or for cleaning up any makeup smudges under the eyes.If you’re going out after a long day at school or work, applying some concealer under your eyes can help you look fresher and more awake for an evening out.

, Throughout the day, it’s normal for your skin to get a little oily. Having powder in your emergency bag allows you to touch up your makeup so you don’t look too shiny. Add a pressed or loose powder, especially if you have oily skin.Loose powder tends to be more lightweight than pressed, but they can be messy to use on the go. Pressed powder compacts usually have a mirror inside too, which means you don’t have to toss a separate mirror into your makeup bag.
A translucent powder is usually the best option for an emergency makeup bag because it doesn’t add much coverage so you don’t have to worry about looking cakey. However, if you’re concerned about your foundation fading throughout the day, you may prefer a colored powder that provides some coverage instead.
If you don’t want to touch up with powder because you have dry skin or you’re concerned about looking cakey, you can substitute blotting papers or sheets. They remove excess oil and shine without disturbing your makeup or adding any more product to your face.
Depending on your makeup routine, you may also want to include a blush and/or bronzer in your emergency makeup bag. For example, if you often go out after school or work, you may want to freshen up your blush in case it’s faded. Bronzer can also add color to your face, and double as an eyeshadow when you need one.

, There’s no need to carry a bunch of lipsticks and glosses in your emergency bag. Include one neutral colored lipstick that will go with other makeup in a variety of colors, and a clear lip balm for moisturizing your lips and adding shine when needed.A neutral lip color is a shade that doesn’t lean warm or cool, so it works with most other shades. You might opt for a nude lipstick, but you can find neutral pinks too. The best bet is to choose a lipstick that’s similar in color to your natural lip color but slightly darker.
If you want to have multiple lip color options, mix in a few lip pencils, which won’t take up as much space as lipsticks. You can layer the pencils with the lipstick or each other to create the color that you want.

, If you go out after school or work on a regular basis, having a mascara in your emergency makeup bag comes in handy. Adding another coat can help freshen up mascara that’s flaked off or make your lashes look thicker for a night out.Travel or sample size mascaras are a good option for an emergency makeup bag because they don’t take up much space.

, For transitioning a daytime eye makeup look to a evening out look, add an eyeshadow duo or quad with dark, dramatic shades. That will allow you to create a smoky eye that’s more appropriate for an evening out.Look for shadow duos or quads that contain shades like black, gray, silver, navy, bronze, or chocolate brown. They work well for smoky eye looks.

, Eyeliner is another makeup item that tends to fade as the day goes on, and you may want to touch up. A black eyeliner is the best option for your emergency makeup bag because it will coordinate with virtually any eye makeup look.If you don’t wear black liner because it’s too harsh, substitute a dark brown or charcoal liner instead.

, While many makeup items come with applicators, they’re often not ideal for a precise makeup application. Consider adding a travel-size set of makeup brushes to your bag. They’re smaller so they won’t take up as much space as full-size brushes.You don’t necessarily need an entire set of brushes. You can just throw in a couple that serve multiple purposes. For example, you might include just one eye brush and one large fluffy face brush that you can use for powder, blush, and bronzer.

, If your makeup runs or smears during the day, you may need to clean it up. Include a small package of makeup removing wipes and cotton swabs that will allow you to easily get rid of any smudges or smears. You can also remove all of your makeup if necessary., In addition to makeup, it’s a good idea to have some hair ties or bobby pins in your emergency bag. You can fix your hair if it gets messy or pin it into an updo for an evening out if necessary.You may also want to include a hairbrush or comb in your makeup bag.
You may want to throw in a travel-size bottle of dry shampoo too. If you hair starts to look greasy during the day, spray some of the shampoo into your roots to soak up the excess oil.

Finished.",How to Organize a Beginner's Makeup Collection," Walmart, Target and hundreds of other stores sell really cute, practical, inexpensive cosmetic bags. You can use a bags you already have if you like.;
, Many products come with applicators and brushes, but these brushes are apparently best for one time use. Choose the best brushes you can afford.

, All you need, apparently, is a simple, light coverage one. Nothing too heavy, since you are just beginning. Covergirl makes a great foundation called Natureluxe, it's great, say some. Make sure that the foundation product is really, really close to your skin tone, if that's important to you. You can use powder, liquid, a combination moisturiser and foundation, anything you like. You can look paler or darker than you are if you like err.

, Concealer is a lifesaver! It is perfect for those days when you don't want to wear foundation but still want to cover up any blemishes or flaws. Concealer is great if you are having a bad skin day and you need more coverage than just your foundation. All you have to do is apply it over your foundation! You can buy a concealer stick, which easier to apply, or one that comes in a tube. Covergirl Ready Set Gorgeous is a good one, some say.

, This will keep the foundation/concealer from coming off throughout the day.

, This is key, even if you are just beginning. An eyeshadow primer will keep the shadows from creasing. It also helps make it last longer. NYX has some really good primers. You can buy their stuff at Ulta Beauty, or online.

, This will give you a variety. If you want a lighter look, which is suggested for beginners, choose a sheer or light lipstick. Rimmel Cake Moss is really good.

, Only one or two should get you by. A lighter color for during the day and a darker color for the nighttime is perfect.

, One black one and one brown one will be good. If they are pencils, purchase a sharpener but if they are retractable don't worry about that. You can buy a liquid one or a pencil. Try using a pencil one first. If you want winged eyeliner, use the liquid form.

, If you have red hair or blonde hair and have really light eyelashes, brown mascara would work best for you, considering that black might be too dramatic. You can find good mascaras at Sephora. Even Walmart has good brands, like Maybelline.

, Trios are great, because it's easy to figure out where to put the colors. Same with blush, you should get one trio for every day wear and a darker trio for nights out. (The Milani Baked Blushes are really good!) Colors really depend on your skin tone, so find some that suit you.

, Gradually, you can step into higher-end products once you think you are good at makeup. Feel free to experiment!

Be sure to get exact measurements for width and height of the mirror. Buy a mirror that fits your dimensions from a home goods store, home improvement store, or even thrift store.Make sure that the mirror you choose has a border that's wide enough to attach your vanity light bars to.;
, You probably have several things you need already lying around your house. Find two extension cords, scissors, and picture hanging strips (the ones with adhesive that pull off). You may need to go to a hardware or lighting store for vanity light bars and light bulbs. Use the type of light bulbs that your vanity light bars' manufacturer recommends.You can also find vanity light bars online in a variety of sizes.

, Take the two light bars out of their boxes. Remove the caps that surround the sides of each socket. Set the caps aside and take care not to lose them since you'll need to reinsert them after you install the light bars.








These are usually reflective like the mirror so they hide the bases of the light bulbs when re-installed.

, Set the light bars on opposite sides of mirror. Place the bars where you ultimately want them so they lay flush against the frame. Depending on which light bars you purchase, you'll see holes for screws in several places. Use a screw driver or a drill to secure the light bar to your mirror.


Your vanity light bars will probably come with the screws you need to attach the bars.

, Take a pair of scissors and cut off the adapter end of your extension cord. Do this for both extension cords and take care not to cut yourself while using the scissors. Make a 1








You should cut in between the two thin cords that are connected.

, Once you've cut in between the cords, hold one cord in each hand and carefully pull them apart. Keep pulling until you have about 5 inches of separated wires. Use your scissors to cut just the plastic covering the copper wire about an inch from the end. Once you've made the cut, slide the plastic off the end so you see the copper wire. Do this for both of the wires on both sets of extension cords.








Take care not to cut into the copper wire while you're cutting away the plastic covering.

, Lift off the top bar of the vanity light bar. You should now see copper wiring (covered in black plastic and white plastic). Feel the copper ends of the cord you split. Take the one that feels smooth and twist it together with the black vanity cord. Take the one that feels rough and twist it together with the white vanity cord.








You can simply twist the cords by crossing them over repeatedly like they're twist ties.

, Your vanity light bars should come with plastic wire nuts (these are usually orange or yellow and cone-shaped, with internal threading). Take one plastic wire nut and firmly place it onto the exposed copper wire that you just twisted. Twist the wire nut until it's affixed securely. Repeat this for each connection between the light bar and extension cord wires so that all the copper wire ends are covered.The wire nuts are necessary to securely connect the wire and reduce the likelihood of electrical fires, so it's important to use them.

, Make sure the wire nuts for both the white and black wires in the light bar are affixed firmly. Set the cover back onto the vanity light bar so that all the cords are covered.








When doing this, try to keep the white and black wires separate from each other within the light bar. Separating the cords can prevent the cords from touching, which can cause the circuit breaker to trip, or even cause a fire.

, Take the metallic caps that you set aside earlier and set them back into place around the sides of each electrical socket. Screw one light bulb into each electrical socket so that it's firmly in place. Plug the extension cords into power outlets and turn on your vanity lights.








If you're using a wireless remote control, you may need to follow the manufacturer's instructions regarding setup.

, Mark the back of the mirror where you'd like to screw in hardware. Some mirrors already come with hooks attached to the back, so you simply need to hang the mirror on the wall. Measure the distance between the hooks. Measure the same distance on the wall where you're hanging the mirror and make a small mark. Use a drill to attach hardware (like a wall anchor or screw) to the wall so you can hang your mirror.Make sure you weigh the mirror and use hardware that supports that weight. Otherwise, your makeup mirror may damage your wall or fall down.

Some companies also sell foundation based on skin undertone: warm, neutral, and cool. These will match your skin color even better; wearing the wrong undertone can make your face look ""off."" You can purchase foundation in cream, liquid, or powder form.


Cream foundation will give you the most coverage and is best for normal or dry skin types.
Liquid foundation can give you light to medium coverage. It is great for all skin types and easy to apply.
Powder will give you the least coverage. It is not recommended for those with dry skin, but it is great for those with oily skin.
Consider investing in a couple different foundations: powder foundation to use on days when you want light coverage, and liquid or cream foundation to use when you want more coverage.;
, Most foundations will even out your skin tone and conceal any redness, but can make your face look plain and one-dimensional. Bring a little life back into your face with some blush. It comes in either powder or cream form. Here are some tips on choosing blush color:If you have fair skin, go for rosy pinks. Some peaches may look good on you too.
If you have medium skin, go for pinks and peaches. A slight mauve tint will look great on cool skin undertones.
If you have dark skin, try berries, corals, oranges, and rich bronzes.
Try getting a lighter shade for daily wear, and a darker shade for evening wear.

, Eye shadow can make your eyes appear larger and brighter. Consider buying two or three different sets of eye shadow. That way, you can wear different colors with different outfits. Be sure to have a lighter set for daily wear, and a darker or brighter set for nights out. Here are some shades for you to try:If you have brown eyes, you can wear almost any shade, including: aqua, bronze/copper/gold, browns, blues, greens, purples, and silver.
If you have hazel eyes, stick with: brown, bronze/gold, green, and purple. Avoid blue.
If you have blue eyes, go for warm colors, such as: dark brown, gold, and orange. You can also wear cool colors, such as blues, silver, purple, and pale pink.
If you have green eyes, try: beige and tans, bronze/copper/gold, browns, purples and peaches, and green.

, Black eyeliner is classic, but brown eyeliner makes a great addition to any kit; it is subtle and great for natural, daytime looks. You can buy eyeliner in liquid and pencil form; it is entirely up to you. Pencil eyeliner is the easiest to apply, but you may find that you like the look of liquid better.


Try brown eyeliner pencil for a natural look, and a black, liquid eyeliner for a dramatic evening look.

, Like eyeliner, black is the most classic. Brown will give you a more subtle look, especially if you have light-colored hair. Look for mascaras that add volume, lengthen your lashes or both!

, Consider getting a dark shade to wear on those special nights out, and a lighter/natural shade to wear during the daytime. Be sure to match your lipstick and lip liner shades.

, If you suffer from pimples, want to cover dark circles, or hide a mole, concealer can be a life saver. You can purchase them in liquid, cream, or stick form.

, If you plan on wearing your makeup on a daily basis, you will want a good quality makeup remover. You will need a basic remover for your face, and a gentler remover for eye makeup.

, The toner will help make the pores appear smaller, and the moisturizer will hydrate your skin. Moisturizer is especially important for those with dry skin, which can look flaky under foundation.

, You will need a small assortment of brushes to apply your eye shadow and powder. You can buy the brushes individually, or you can buy them as a set.


Lipstick can be applied straight out of the tube, or it can be applied with a lipstick brush.
Eye shadow will require several brushes: a fluffy brush, a crease brush, and a blending brush.
Powder brushes are great for applying setting powder, powder foundation, and blush.
Foundation brushes may be used to apply liquid foundation. You can also apply liquid foundation and cream foundation using makeup sponges.

, This will help keep your makeup clean and organized. It will also allow you to bring your makeup with you if you are going on a trip, or need to apply it on the run.

, While not necessary, face primer can help your foundation appear smoother by filling in all those tiny pores and imperfections. You can get primers with different finishes, including matte.

, These are especially useful for those with straight lashes. Curling your eyelashes may make an even more dramatic difference than using mascara.

, Make sure to buy some eye lash glue as well. False lashes are great for those special nights out, and will lend you a more glamorous look. Keep in mind that most false lashes can only be worn a few times before having to be replaced.

, They usually include a brush, powder, and a cream or gel. You can use this kit to tame and groom your eyebrows, and to fill them in.

, Moisturizer is an important part of skincare and should be used every day. There may be days, however, where you don't want to put on a lot of makeup. Tinted moisturizer is a great option for those days. It will give you enough coverage to even out your skin, but it will also be light enough to leave your face feeling makeup-free. Best of all, it will leave your face feeling hydrated and replenished.

, You can use lip gloss directly on top of your lip stick, or you can use it alone for days when you don't feel like wearing much. Lip gloss does not have to be matched to lipstick, since it is translucent. Try getting a few different colors; most lip glosses also come in different flavors.

, While not absolutely necessary, setting powder an setting spray can help your makeup last longer, especially on a hot day.

, This will help you decide which brands you do and don't like. Look online or ask at a department store for any free samples you can try. Be sure to keep a list so that you will remember what to buy next time (and avoid buying).

, Nail polish always is some bling for your nails. If you don't want to buy a large collection of nail polish, use beige or nude colored polish and clear, but don't forget nail polish remover! If you're on a budget, try to buy used bottles.

Have a clothes swapping party with your friends.

Donate your old clothes and shoes to a charity organization or thrift shop.
Ask a neighbor or family member if he/she would like to have your old clothes.

Hold a yard sale.;
, There are many wikiHows available for using old torn clothing to make things and recycle them instead of creating more trash for the environment.

, Don't let it take up valuable space in your closet if you don't wear it on a weekly basis.

, Chances are you're not wearing it because it's not ready to go out. If you don't take them to be repaired in one month, then you know you're really not that crazy about it.

,, Your mistake could be someone else's party dress.

, The first thing to put back in the closet are those out-of-season clothes. Keep them separated to avoid confusion. A garment bigger will do the job.

,


If you have several outfits, consider putting them in another garment bag.
In the bottom of the bag, store jewelry, shoes, hose, and other accessories that are used only with this clothing.
Right in front of you when you open your closet should be only clothes you wear all the time.

,, How many black shirts do you really need? Keep the higher quality, better made items.

, Install one on the inside of the closet door, or use a freestanding mirror. You need to see your clothing in its entirety to see if an item is really working for you.

, It is absolutely necessary to have a bright light installed in your closet. You need to see what you have in order to wear it. If that old pull string light bulb hasn't been changed since last Christmas, then now's the time to do so.

, Dump every cosmetic you own in a big pile on several layers of newspaper to prevent any loose particles and dirty mess from staining your floor. Separate everything by category. Lipstick should go in one pile, shadows in another, etc.


Toss anything you haven't used in six months. Old makeup contains bacteria. You don't want to get sick.
Get rid of anything that has an odor, is messy, or is running.
Dump foundation and any other cosmetic that has separated or is gooey.

Prepare a dish of warm, soapy water.,
Soak the sponge for 30 minutes.,
Massage cleanser into the sponge.,
Rinse the sponge free of soap.,
Analyze whether or not the sponge is clean enough by the clarity of the water while rinsing.,
Dry using paper towels.",How to Clean Beauty Blender1," Fill a small dish with warm water, then squeeze a dollop of gentle hand soap or shampoo into it. Mix lightly until suds form on the surface of the water. Dish soap is generally not recommended, as it can irritate your skin when you need to use the sponge later.









Baby shampoo and “gentle formula” organic shampoos work especially well, but most soaps that are safe for use on your skin or hair can be used here.;
, Drop the sponge into the dish of soapy water. Squeeze it two or three times with your hand, then allow it to soak for approximately 30 minutes.








The dish should have enough water in it to completely cover the blender sponge. If there isn't enough water initially, simply add more as needed.
As the sponge soaks, the water will likely begin to change color. Expect the water to take on a dingy beige or tan hue as it draws the foundation and other cosmetics out of the sponge.
The sponge should also expand to its full size as it soaks in the soapy water.

, Gently rub solid ""Blender Cleanser"" or an equivalent soap directly into the most heavily soiled areas of the sponge.You must use a gentle cleanser to avoid damaging the sponge. If you prefer solid soaps, castille soap usually works well. If you'd rather choose a liquid soap, consider moisturizing baby shampoo or an organic shampoo with a gentle formula.









Spend 2-3 patient minutes massaging the cleanser into the sponge. Only use your fingertips; do not use a scrubbing brush or other abrasive tool since doing so could damage the sponge.

, Rinse the sponge under warm, running water until all of the cleanser washes out of it. Any additional makeup sitting near the surface of the sponge should get rinsed out during this step as well.









You may need to gently squeeze the sponge under the running water to help remove the soaps and makeup.

, If the rinse water runs clear beneath the blender sponge, it should be adequately clean and you can move directly to the drying step. If the rinse water still seems dingy, skip the drying step and move into the deep cleaning method (see the “Deep Cleaning” section of this article).

, Wring out excess water by gently squeezing the sponge with your hand, then roll the sponge in clean, dry paper towels to absorb any water still inside.









If the sponge is still damp after you blot out the water with paper towels, let it sit in a dry location to continue air drying. Wait until the sponge is completely dry before using it as an applicator.

Deep clean the sponge only as needed.,
Wet the sponge.,
Apply cleanser to the soiled areas.,
Rub the sponge against your palm.,
Rinse while continuing to scrub.,
Test the sponge.,
Dry the sponge.",How to Clean Beauty Blender2," As a general rule, you'll only need to perform deep cleaning on your blender sponge if the sponge still appears dirty after following basic cleansing procedures outlined above.









This is more likely to happen if you use your blender sponge multiple times per day or if you forget to clean it for one or more weeks.
You'll know if your blender sponge needs deep cleaning by looking at it. If the rinse water at the end of your basic cleansing routine seems dirty, or if there are visible stains on the sponge after it dries, try deep cleaning it.

, Hold the sponge under warm, running water for 30 to 60 seconds, or until it absorbs enough water to expand to its full size.









Alternatively, you could place the blender sponge in a bowl of warm water for 5 to 10 minutes. You do not need to use soapy water, nor do you need to wait for the water to change color before continuing to the next step.

, Dab solid or liquid cleanser directly onto the most heavily soiled areas of the sponge.









As with the basic cleaning procedure, you should only use gentle cleansers on your sponge. Specially formulated “Blender Cleanser” works well, but if you'd prefer another option, solid castille soap, liquid baby shampoo, or “sensitive formula” organic shampoos will also work.

, Rub the coated portions of the sponge against the center of your palm, working the sponge in small circular motions. Continue rubbing the sponge for approximately 30 seconds.








The scrubbing should be vigorous and more intense than the scrubbing used during your basic cleansing routine. Note, however, that it should still be gentle enough to avoid distorting the shape of the sponge or tearing the sponge material.
As you scrub, the cosmetics lying deeper inside the sponge will be drawn out through the surface. You should notice the suds on your palm becoming tinted with the color of your foundation.

, Rinse the sponge under warm, running water while continuing the rub it against your palm in circular movements. Keep rinsing the sponge until all of the suds are gone.









You may need to rinse the sponge for several minutes before you clean out all the soap. It's important that you rinse out all of the soap, though, so don't rush the process.

, Rinse the sponge under running water again until all of the suds disappear. Make sure that the water you squeeze out is clear and clean.









Apply more cleanser to the sponge and rub it against your palm. If the resulting lather is white instead of gray or beige, the sponge should now be clean.

, Gently wring out most of the excess moisture by squeezing the sponge with your hand. Roll the sponge over clean, dry paper towels to dry it off even more.









The sponge will probably still be damp after this, so set it aside in a dry place and allow it to air dry. Only use the blender sponge as an applicator once it is completely dry.

Sterilize the sponge monthly.,
Place the sponge in a dish of water.,
Microwave for 30 seconds.,
Let it rest.,
Dry the sponge.",How to Clean Beauty Blender3," Even if you clean your sponge on a weekly basis, you should still sterilize it using heat at least once a month. This is especially important if you use your blender sponge on a daily basis. Standard cleaning removes surface bacteria, but the only way to kill bacteria lying deeper in the sponge is by killing it with a short burst of intense heat.


You may need to sterilize the sponge more than once a month if you notice the bacteria building up more rapidly. Signs of intense bacteria build-up include uncharacteristic acne breakouts and a foul/unusual odor coming from within the sponge.
Note that you'll still need to perform a basic cleaning procedure after sterilizing the sponge. Sterilization will only kill the bacteria; it will not remove any cosmetic stains or foundation.

, Fill a microwave-safe bowl with approximately 1 inch (2.5 cm) of water. Lay the sponge down in the center of the water puddle.


You must sit the blender sponge in water. Do not microwave a fully dry sponge since doing so could damage the material or cause the sponge to catch fire.

, Place the uncovered bowl in your microwave and run the appliance at full power for 30 seconds.Keep an eye on the blender sponge as you microwave it. Don't be alarmed if it expands slightly or if small trails of smoke develop, but stop the microwave immediately if it balloons up past its full size or if heavy smoke starts to form.

, Wait one or two minutes before removing the bowl from the microwave and removing the sponge from the water.


The sponge will likely be very hot once the microwave cycle ends, and the waiting period is primarily for your own protection. You can actually handle the sponge as soon as it is cool enough to touch.

, Gently roll the sponge in clean, dry paper towels. Let it sit out at room temperature until it feels completely dry.


If you plan on performing a basic cleansing routine on the sponge after sterilizing it with heat, you can do so immediately after pulling it out of the microwave. You do not need to dry the sponge first.
Wait until the blender sponge is completely dry before using it as an applicator.

Use lemon juice.,
Apply sour milk, sour cream, or buttermilk.,
Purchase a bleaching or fading cream.,
Create a fruit peel.,
Use a self tanner.",How to Fade Freckles1," Lemon juice works well as a bleaching agent, and just like it works to bleach your hair, you can also bleach your freckles with it. Lemon juice won't completely remove your freckles, but over time it should fade them as it bleaches your skin. Apply lemon juice by squeezing the juice out of fresh lemons, and then using a cotton ball to dab it on your freckles.Continue this process, applying lemon juice every few days for several months. Overtime you should see that your freckles have faded. However, because it is only a temporary solution, you will have to continue applying lemon juice to keep your freckles a lighter shade.
Any exposure to the sun during this time can erase any progress you've made, so make sure you apply sunscreen when going outside and wear protective clothing. If your freckles are exposed to the sun, even if you have been treating them with lemon juice, they will likely reappear.;
, All of these dairy products contain lactic acid, which may help to bleach your skin, thus fading your freckles. Use sour milk as a facial cleanser, applying it to your skin and then washing it off with water. Sour cream or buttermilk should be applied as a face mask, once a day for about 15 minutes. Then, wash your face with water.When treating your face with sour cream, begin by applying the sour cream once a day, and as fading begins, reduce treatment to once or twice a week.
Buttermilk not only has lactic acid, but also has a peeling effect which may allow you to remove layers of skin with sun damage. It may be better to soak a cheesecloth in buttermilk and lay it across your face, at five minute increments, re-soaking after each five minute mark.

, You can often find these at your local drug store in the cosmetics department, and they help reduce melanin in your skin. Look for a bleaching or fading cream that has kojic acid and arbutus, if you want a more organic product. Make sure you buy a cream that won't irritate your skin. Some popular products are Meladerm, Revitol, and SkinBright., These peels will dry on your skin, and once peeled off will peel off the top layer of your skin, thus removing the skin affected by the sun. You can use many types of fruits, but some of the best to create a dry mask are strawberries, papaya, cucumber, and pineapple blended together. Once applied, let it dry and then peel or wipe the mask off with a damp rag.To create a fruit peel blend two strawberries, a small piece of papaya, and a few pieces of cucumber and pineapple. When these fruits are blended together they create a gummy mask, which will glue to your skin as it dries. So, when you wipe away the mask the layer of skin underneath it will be wiped away also.

, One way to fade freckles is to help them blend in with the rest of your skin. You can use a sunless tanner to help darken skin and achieve a natural glow without damaging your skin. Choose a shade that is somewhat close to your natural skin color, so that as your skin gradually gets darker it will look natural."

Visit a laser resurfacing clinic.,
Use chemical peels.,
Try Intense Pulse Light Therapy.",How to Fade Freckles2," A somewhat expensive treatment, laser freckle removal is a satisfactory way to remove or fade freckles from your face. The laser essentially removes the melanin pigment in your skin that causes freckles. Following the treatment you may experience crusting or bruising on your skin, but after a week or two your skin should recover.Although not completely permanent, laser treatments do a better job of fading or removing your freckles than other treatments or creams, but before you have laser removal it could be beneficial to talk to a dermatologist or doctor.

, Chemical peels also do a decent job of removing or fading freckles. Usually these treatments are not a one-time treatment but occur over a period of time. The chemical peels use intensive exfoliation techniques to remove the top layer of skin. After the treatment has been applied and the top layer of skin peeled off, a new layer of skin will grow that has little to no sun damage.These peels can be very harsh on your skin, and it may prevent you from going out in public for a time as your skin heels. Also, after your new skin has grown back, your freckles can easily come back with a small amount of sun exposure.

, This treatment is relatively new, but has proven to help remove or fade freckles from your face. Light pulses penetrate the skin, creating heat in your skin tissue. You body then removes the tissue through natural processes, and this results in a more even skin tone and appearance.These treatments usually last one to two sessions, and you may experience some redness a few hours after your treatment. The beneficial thing about these treatments is they only last 15 to 30 minutes.

Moisturize your face.,
Apply concealer to heavy areas.,
Use an airbrush makeup.,
Set your makeup with powder.,
Apply makeup as usual.",How to Fade Freckles3," Before you apply any makeup to your face it's important to moisturize your face. Choose a lotion that is suited for your skin type to help restore natural oils to your face and to keep it from drying out. You might try a anti-aging moisturizer or tone correcting moisturizer to help begin fading those freckles and evening out our your skin tone.

, Taking a concealer that is a slight shade darker than your skin tone, swipe lines of it under your eyes, across your forehead, on your chin and cheeks, essentially wherever you have a lot of freckles. Gently dab it into your skin by using your middle finger to smooth it out.You don't want to use too much force here, because if you rub it in too much it won't be able to cover up your freckles. You want the concealer to look as natural as possibly while still doing the job it is intended for. Using a corrective concealer may be more helpful than a generic concealer as it is designed to even out your skin tone.

, After you have applied your first layer of concealer, to better cover up your freckles, try using a concealer or foundation in liquid form that can be used with an airbrush. Lightly spray the makeup onto your face for even coverage. This type of makeup is helpful because it won't create a ""caked on"" look like it might if you used a thick layer of concealer.


If you don't want to add any more concealer to your face you can choose to use a bronzer here, which will also be effective in fading those freckles as it should darken your skin a little.
Make sure that when you apply concealer and makeup to your face that you apply some to your neck as well, especially if your neck has freckles.
You can also do this step before you apply the first layer of concealer if you prefer to apply your foundation first.

, The final step to fading those freckles is applying powder to your face. Choose a powder that is a similar shade to your natural skin color. Then, taking a thick makeup brush, dab it in the powder, and gently brush over your face, including your eyelids and your neck area. This will help the powder blend in with the rest of your skin., After you have concealed your freckles you can proceed to apply your eye makeup and blush as usual. Your freckles may still be noticeable, but with concealer and powder you should have been able to fade them somewhat.

Avoid sun exposure.,
Use sunscreen.,
Be careful when using treatments.,
Love your freckles.",How to Fade Freckles4," Because freckles often appear when the skin has increased exposure to the sun, the best way to avoid getting freckles, or to at least prevent your freckles from becoming more pronounced, is to avoid too much sun. When going outside, try to wear a hat and clothing that will cover up areas of your body that are prone to freckles.


Of course, if you are someone who has a redhead complexion or whose skin always has freckles, you can't avoid them completely, but to keep from getting more freckles and from damaging your skin, avoid the sun when you can.
The sun's rays are strongest between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., so during these times seek shade., This is the obvious answer to keep your skin from being damaged, but it is often neglected when it shouldn't be. No matter what your skin type, you should always wear sunscreen. Choose a sunscreen that has an SPF of at least 30 and is water resistant. Your sunscreen should also be broad-spectrum protection, protecting against both UVA and UVB rays.People often neglect sunscreen on cloudier days, but even on those days your skin can be penetrated by up to 80 percent of the sun's rays. Be careful around sand, snow or water because they can easily reflect the sun's rays, increasing the risk of damaging your skin.
Reapply sunscreen about every two hours, or according to the directions on the bottle. If you are swimming, make sure you leave enough time for the sunscreen to dry on your skin before you get into the water.

, Many treatments and some natural products like lemon juice make your skin more susceptible to sun damage, as the pigmentation is affected. If you are receiving a treatment from a clinic, always consult with your dermatologist about how to best care for your skin. When possible, avoid going outside shortly after treatments so your skin can heal before exposed to the sun.

, If you have freckles because of genetics or fair skin, as opposed to sun damage, then you should learn to love them and embrace them. Don't feel ashamed by your natural skin -- you'll deal with a lot less hassle if you just accept them as they are, rather than trying to find ways to cover up your freckles. Also, freckles tend to fade over time so if you feel yours are too dark, take comfort in knowing that as you get older their color tends to fade.

Make the scrub using home goods.,
Wet the dry and affected area.,
Apply the scrub.,
Rinse off the scrub.",How to Exfoliate Dry Skin1," Simply combine half a cup of sugar with just a dash of olive oil in order to wet it. The more coarse the sugar, the better the scrub will work. If you have access to unprocessed, unbleached organic sugar, use this in the scrub as it will be less likely to irritate your skin., Wash your face with a clean washcloth and clean hands, using warm water. The washcloth should be as soft as possible to prevent irritation; many dermatologists recommend a muslin washcloth.A hair elastic can effectively keep hair off of your face while washing. A headband can also work, especially for people with bangs.

, Once your skin is wet, apply the scrub with your fingers, rubbing it in gentle circles to exfoliate the skin. In areas where the skin is less delicate, you can scrub more vigorously, but pay close attention to how your skin feels and how it is reacting to the scrubbing.If using this method on the face, be sure to use a more fine-grain sugar with less oil. Scrub very gently and be sure to wash the face with a doctor-recommended face wash to remove the excess oil. If your skin feels irritated, or begins to redden, stop scrubbing immediately as your skin may be having a reaction.

, Wet a clean washcloth with warm water, and use it to remove the scrub. Avoid using water that is too hot, since this can dry out sensitive skin. Moisturize your face with an oil-free facial product after washing."

Although effective, keep in mind that this method may cause hair in the exfoliated area to lighten or even become removed completely with sustained use., Lather the area with soap using body wash, preferably with a product that is designed to aid in softening of the skin. Look for products that boast ""Dermatologist-Recommended"" or those that are specifically designed to treat dry skin.

, When using a pumice stone, use light pressure and quick, brisk strokes on wet skin. You should only use the stone for a minute or two in each affected area. Avoid pressing too hard, since this will lead to sore skin and reddened areas.

, Apply a moisturizing lotion to the affected area. Look for doctor-recommended lotions that are proven to soothe chronically dry skin."

Obtain a natural bristle body brush.,
Apply pressure to skin with the brush.,
Rinse off in the shower after brushing.,
Dry your skin and moisturize.",How to Exfoliate Dry Skin3," A loofah can also work well to brush sensitive skin. Avoid using a synthetic brush, as it will be too stiff and can cause scratches on the surface of the skin, which could lead to even more dry skin. Use a soft brush with a long handle for ease of use and maximum comfort.

, Using firm, but gentle pressure, work the brush in a circular motion over the skin. Always work the brush toward the heart. Dry brushing can also improve circulation., Wash your skin thoroughly to remove any excess dead skin. Use water that is warm as hot water can further dry out your skin.


Hot water strips oils from the skin faster than warm water. Avoid taking long, hot showers and instead use lukewarm water for a quick, 10-minute shower or bath., Products that are designed to leave pores clog-free are best to use. Look for moisturizers that are labeled as “non-comedogenic” or that are described as “oil-free.”Moisturizers retain water in the outermost layer of skin, acting as a shield for your skin. They can protect your skin from dangerous effects of the sun, wind, and various other environmental concerns.

, If you experienced discomfort when you tried to exfoliate, let your dermatologist know.If you have a rash, blemish, or bump that isn't going away, bring this up during your appointment. The dermatologist can also let you know if any moles that you may have look troubling.Bring information about your medical history to your appointment, including any allergies you may have or medications that you have been using. Be prepared with a pen and notepad so that you can take note of the doctor's advice., For extreme cases, your dermatologist may suggest a chemical peel for exfoliation. High pH levels in chemical peels can help prevent skin irritation and tissue damage, along with making moisturizers and anti-aging treatments more effective, and lessening the effects of acne."

, Fragrances and dyes are often irritating to the skin and can cause further redness and dryness. Choose cleansers and moisturizes which are fragrance and dye free.


If you're having trouble sorting through selection at the drugstore, try looking for products designed for babies. They are typically much milder and are often fragrance and dye-free.

, Don't over-exfoliate; scrubbing your skin too roughly will only further strip your skin of important moisturizing oils. It's recommended that you use your hands or a soft washcloth to exfoliate. , An important step to curing your cracked and dry elbows is to properly moisture and smooth them out. Not all moisturizes are created equally, though.


Products with ceramide and hyaluronic acid will help your skin retain moisture. Products with dimethicone and glycerin are useful for drawing water to the skin. Products with lanolin, mineral oil, and/or petroleum jelly are also recommended and are excellent at helping you retain water. Look for lotions with lactic acid; beyond moisturizing your elbows, the lactic acid gently exfoliates your flaky skin. , Don't dry off completely; it's better to apply lotion while your skin is still damp.

, Your dry, cracked elbows may find relief from a variety of home remedies starting in the kitchen.


Use yogurt on your elbows. Yogurt is high in lactic acid, which will gently help exfoliate your flaky skin. Greek variety yogurt is particularly thick and concentrated. Leave on your elbows for up to 15 minutes. Try using organic honey on your ailing elbows, which has long been lauded as an excellent remedy for dry chapped skin. You can mix the honey with your yogurt spread (above), or apply straight to your elbows. Treat your elbows with lemon. The citric acid in lemon can work to lighten the dark and dry skin on your elbows, and will also help to gently exfoliate. Use natural food oils, like olive oil, avocado oil, or coconut oil as a moisturizer. Apply these straight to your elbows for a long-acting dose of moisture.

, After you've applied your moisturizing lotion or oil, cover your elbows with soft tube socks (cut off the toes and the tight elastic). This will help protect your elbows as you sleep, keep the product from rubbing off, and lock in the moisture as you sleep.

, Dry skin and cracked elbows can become a problem at any time of the year, but they are particularly common during the winter months as the air tends to be drier.


Experts recommend you resist the urge to crank up the heat when the temperature outside falls.
Keep the temperature slightly cooler, at 68 degrees. , In an effort to counteract dry indoor air, you may want to use a humidifier in order to keep the air moist. Set it at 45-55% humidity. , Fewer things are more relaxing than a long, hot, steamy shower, but hot temperatures, and indeed exposure to water, have a drying effect upon our skin.


In order to maintain your skin's natural protecting oils, it's best to keep your water temperature on the cooler side.
Try to keep your bathing time as short as possible, 5-10 minutes top. , Swimming is an excellent source of exercise, but the exposure to harsh chemicals such as chlorine can contribute to your dry skin. You should either limit your time in the water or avoid it altogether until you are able to heal your dry skin.

, If you're suffering from dry skin in general, you'll find it helpful to protect your skin from the wind and the sun. Our elbows take extra abuse, so particularly while you are working on curing them, you may want to wear long sleeves.


Wear natural fibers, such as cotton, and avoid synthetic fabrics which may be irritating.
Wool, while a natural fiber, can often be irritating to the skin, so you may want to avoid shirts and sweaters spun from wool, regardless of their wintry appeal.

, In order to treat your dry skin and elbows from the inside out, be sure to drink plenty of water.

, Foods that are rich in Omega-3 fatty acids have been shown to help protect our skin from harsh environmental factors and bolster our oil-protecting barriers.Fish such as salmon, halibut, and sardines are excellent sources of Omega-3.
Walnuts, safflower oil and flaxseed are similarly good sources of Omega-3 and are relatively easy to add to your diet.
Before making any changes to your diet or taking fish-oil supplements, you should of course consult with your physician.

Apply the soap directly to the brush head and let it seep in.Antibacterial hand soap or mild liquid dish detergent can be readily found in most homes and will typically be strong enough to get the job done.
Some dermatologists also recommend using a sulfate shampoo, as it contains compounds that are formulated to cut through oil, dead skin cells and other gunk., Use your fingers to work the soap into a thick lather. Make sure the soap is able to penetrate down to the base of the bristles. Continue scrubbing the brush head until it’s clear of all visible dirt and discoloration.Rubbing the bristles along the palm of your hand while you scrub will create more friction to remove caked-on residue.

, Think if you have any skin-related issue like wrinkles, marks, pimples, blackheads, or acne, you can buy products to help with that. Certain products may also cause burning or itching, or aggravate sensitive skin, so you want to be particularly careful if your skin is already sensitive., Read the ingredients of the skin products to avoid any issues., The price of skin care products varies a lot between brands. You don't necessarily have to spend a lot to get good results., If you have specific skin issues and aren't sure how best to help them, talk to a dermatologist., At first, buy a smaller amount, and don't directly apply on face. Try on other area of your skin to see how you react to it. If you don't suffer any bad reactions, you're fine to use it more broadly. Then if you like the product, you can always buy more., Exfoliation is one of the mainstays of improving your skin’s youthfulness by using the human body’s own amazing healing power. The two primary products for exfoliating are microdermabrasion creams and glycolic acid cleansers.


Both serve to remove the outer layer of dull, dead skin cells in your skin. This process has a two fold benefit: not only is younger, fresher skin revealed, but the exfoliation process also stimulates the production of new skin cells. People with dry skin will want to use the microdermabrasion cream. Those with oily or combination skin do best using glycolic acid.
One of several Alpha Hydroxyl Acids available, glycolic acid is the most effective due to its small molecule size, which allows it to penetrate into the skin. When you purchase your glycolic acid, be sure to buy one with a concentration no greater than 10% - anything stronger should be administered by a licensed esthetician or dermatologist. However, a 10% solution can safely be used at home on a daily basis.
As for your microdermabrasion cream, you should buy one with the same mineral crystals used by the professionals – this would be aluminum oxide. Because of the abrasive nature of the microdermabrasion cream, be sure you purchase one that also contains soothing oils such as Jojoba or Shea Butter. Note that after any exfoliation procedure, it is important to use a good quality sunblock or avoid sun exposure for up to a week afterwards.

, There are no magic pills or topical creams that can replace your skin’s collagen.


Fortunately, there is a clever way to accelerate your body’s production of this important skin component: Peptides.
When collagen breaks down, certain peptides are released. These signal your skin that it has been damaged and needs to manufacture new collagen.
The direct application of peptides to your skin will make it think it has recently lost collagen and has to make more.
The most frequently used “signal” peptide for skin care in this function is palmitoyl pentapeptide (Matrixyl). Regular use of peptides can turn back the clock of time by many years. No adverse side effects have ever been reported in the use of peptides.

, While this is the last place you want to use “bargain” products, as stated earlier, be sure you are not paying for fancy packaging and heavy advertising budgets and above all, read the label carefully.


The ingredients are listed in order of concentration, so if the active ingredient is way down the list, the product only contains a token amount.
Without question, the most effective skin hydrating ingredient you can find is Hyaluronic Acid. This amazing compound holds 1,000 times its weight in moisture. Hyaluronic Acid is often touted for its ability to ""reverse"" or stop aging and has been called the ""key to the fountain of youth.""
This is because the substance occurs naturally (and quite abundantly) in humans and animals, and is found in young skin, neonatal tissues, and joint fluid. HA is a component of the body's connective tissues, and is known to cushion and lubricate.
As you age, however, the forces of nature destroy this vital skin substance and it needs to be replenished.

, Once you have your arsenal of skin care products on hand, following a careful regimen will give you the younger looking, radiant, smooth skin you desire. Here is the process you need to use. Follow it faithfully and you will see amazing results within a few weeks.


Morning: wash your face with a quality skin cleanser, apply a moisturizer containing hyaluronic acid, then a UVA/UVB sunblock and finally, your makeup.
Evening: depending on your skin type, exfoliate daily with 10% glycolic acid or 2-3 times a week with microdermabrasion cream. Rinse well with clear water, then apply a multi-peptide cream before bedtime.

Simply moisten a standard terry washcloth with lukewarm water, wring out the excess, and gently buff the skin you wish to exfoliate.If you have severely sensitive, dry, or damaged skin, you might consider switching to a konjac sponge. These sponges are made from natural fibers found in the konjac plant. They're soft and slightly rubbery, and the texture is finer than that of a loofah or washcloth. Soften the sponge in warm water for five minutes; wring out the excess, then massage the skin in light, circular movements.;
, Many fruits contain natural acids that can gently scrub away dead skin. To make these cleansers even gentler, stick with mildly acidic fruits like papaya and strawberry while avoiding stronger citrus fruits (e.g., lemons or limes). You should also dilute the fruits with a base of oil, water, or yogurt for added protection against the acids.For example, try mixing 1 Tbsp (15 ml) full-fat Greek yogurt, 1 tsp (5 ml) papaya puree, 1 tsp (5 ml) strawberry puree, 1 tsp (5 ml) raw honey, and 2 tsp (10 ml) granulated sugar. Apply the mask to your skin and allow it to sit for about 10 minutes before gently rinsing with lukewarm water.Never leave any fruit mask on for more than 10 minutes. If the mask starts to sting, rinse it off before the full 10 minutes pass.

, Sugar-based scrubs are gentler than salt-based scrubs, making them safer to use on sensitive or dry skin. Sugar particles act as mechanical exfoliants, and they also contain glycolic acid, which acts as a gentle chemical exfoliant.

Try mixing 2 Tbsp (30 ml) of almond or apricot oil with about 1 cup (250 ml) of raw sugar. Add 5 to 6 drops of essential oil, if desired. Lightly buff the sugar scrub over the dead skin and rinse it away with lukewarm water. Keep any excess in an airtight container and use within one month., Oatmeal is generally safe for sensitive skin and works well as a mechanical exfoliant. Grind a handful of whole oats in a food processor until a find powder forms. Add water, 1 Tbsp (15 ml) at a time, to the ground oats until a thick paste forms. Use this paste to exfoliate.Since oatmeal also absorbs oil, it can act as a cleanser, too.

, Gently rub this paste onto damp skin for 2 to 3 minutes, then rinse with warm water.If desired, you can also add the liquid from one liquid-gel pill of Vitamin E to boost the healing properties of this product., While it may sound counterintuitive, many over-the-counter exfoliants using acids are actually quite gentle. In fact, some might be more gentle than scrubs containing large, harsh beads. Look for exfoliating cleansers, toners, or serums containing glycolic acid, alpha-hydroxy acids (AHAs), or beta-hydroxy acids (BHAs).For the gentlest option, stick with AHAs since these are more effective at preventing moisture loss than glycolic acid. BHAs, like salicylic acid, are a good option if you suffer from both sensitive skin and frequent acne., Many DIY exfoliators rely on the acid in fruit, and you can find some commercial products that also harness the same natural ingredients. As a general rule, mildly acidic fruits—e.g., papaya, strawberry—are less damaging than harsh citrus fruits., Eraser exfoliants work by bonding and gently lifting away loose skin cells. Apply the clear gel to your skin and allow it to sit for several seconds. While it sits, the gel should turn white as it bonds to the dead skin cells, then eventually dry up into particles. Rinse these particles away using lukewarm water.The particles will look similar to the dust that forms when using a standard pencil eraser on paper. For that reason, these exfoliators are often called “eraser” exfoliants.

, Many exfoliating products containing beads are among the harshest over-the-counter options. If you prefer bead-based exfoliants, however, your best option might be to look for one containing jojoba beads.These are small and almost perfectly round, so they tend to be gentler than many other options.

Note that ""natural"" is not necessarily the same as ""gentle"" when selecting a microbead exfoliant. Some products may rely on things like nut shells, seeds, bamboo, and rice.While these elements are likely gentler than plastic microbeads, they're often rougher than gentle acidic products. Jojoba beds are your best option if you're looking for a mechanical microbead exfoliant.

, Another way to exfoliate your skin is to use either a cleanser or moisturizer that contains an exfoliating acid or exfoliating particles. Opting for one of these products may make the exfoliating process less harsh on your skin, but do not use another exfoliating product after use.

For exfoliating cleansers, consider using a foaming scrub instead of a gel cleanser. Since the texture of these cleansers will be lighter than gel cleansers, any mechanical exfoliants they rely on are generally smaller and less abrasive.When choosing exfoliating moisturizers, look for something marketed as a “repair cream.” The moisturizers in these products are usually rich enough to prevent dryness, but the products also contain chemical or mechanical exfoliants capable of lightly buffing away rough skin., Exfoliating too often can actually irritate your skin, causing more damage, dryness, and flakiness.If you don't know how sensitive or damaged your skin is, you should try exfoliating only once a week.If your skin still needs an added boost after several weeks, consider increasing the number of days you exfoliate to two times--but never increase the among past three days per week, and immediately decrease the amount of your skin starts looking red or irritated.
Regardless of how often you exfoliate, always exfoliate at night to allow your skin time to heal and rejuvenate while you sleep. Furthermore, UV rays from the sun can damage newly exfoliated skin.

, Avoid using hot water since it can cause further dryness and irritation. Similarly, harsh cleansers can also worsen your skin quality. It's best to use warm water and gentle cleansers, especially before you plan to exfoliate.

Examine your skin every few weeks. If or when a previously healthy patch of skin begins to dull, extend your exfoliating routine to that spot. If the problem does not return the following week, you may return to omitting that location until it needs attention again.

A heavier, oil-based moisturizer generally works best for dry skin. You may even want to consider petroleum based products if your skin is cracking; however, if your skin tends to have other issues in addition to dryness you might want to consider adding a couple different types of moisturizer to your skin care regimen.If your skin is oily, making it prone to acne breakouts, try applying a lighter moisturizer to your face after washing. Areas that tend to be oily, such as the face or scalp, will not need the same treatments as other areas of the body.If your skin is easily irritated and you're prone to redness and rashes, ingredients like aloe and chamomile can help. These soothing components smooth over cracked, dry skin.

If you have a lot of redness on your face in addition to dry skin, try a moisturizing concealer in a green shade. Green-based concealer can help to counteract redness on your face., If your lips tend to get dry, use a lipstick or lip balm that is hydrating. Look for lipstick that contains moisturizing ingredients like glycerin, shea butter, or jojoba oil. For extra hydration, apply lip balm or lip chap first and then apply lipstick on top of the balm.To help keep your lips moist, exfoliate your lips weekly with a mixture of honey and sugar. Use a clean washcloth to gently exfoliate your lips with the sugar and honey until they feel soft and moist.

, You may notice that your makeup looks dry or flaky after several hours of wear. If this happens to you often, invest in a skin refresher that you can carry in your bag. Make your own skin refresher with water and a soothing essential oil like lavender, tea tree, or jojoba. You can also buy skin refresher in a small spray bottle.Apply the skin refresher as needed throughout the day so your skin does not get flaky or dry.

Try washing with water only.,
Consider the oil cleansing method.,
Exfoliate your face a few times a week.,
Moisturize in the morning.,
Avoid moisturizers that contain alcohol.,
Do a deep moisturizing treatment.,
Moisturize on the go with coconut oil.,
Use a humidifier in your bedroom.,
Examine your makeup routine.,
Protect your face from the sun.,
Be healthy from the inside out.",How to Treat Dry Facial Skin," One of the biggest skin care mistakes you can make is washing your face with harsh cleansers. If your skin is dry, it’s under-producing oils that protect your skin from flaking off. Harsh cleansers wash away the oils you do produce, making the problem worse. Instead of washing with soap of any kind, try washing with just plain water, especially when you’re not wearing makeup.


Warm, not hot water should be used, since hot water can be drying. Wet a washcloth with warm water and gently run it over your face. Then pat your face dry with a clean soft towel.
Even cleansers that are labeled as having moisturizing properties probably contain ingredients that are drying. Look at the label and read the ingredients: if you see sulfates, any type of alcohol, or salicylic acid, don’t use it on your face.;
, This is the best method for washing your face at night when plain water isn’t going to cut it. The oil cleansing method removes makeup, dirt, sweat, and everything else without drying out your skin. It might sound counterintuitive to use oil to clean your skin, but adding oil actually attracts the oils that are there, acting as a gentle cleanser. You can tell your friends with acne to try it, too, since this method is healing for all skin types.


Start by making an oil blend that suits your skin type. For very dry skin, jojoba oil, argan oil and almond oil are all quite effective and nondrying. If you have oily spots, too, add some castor oil to your blend.
Splash some warm water on your face, then use your fingers to rub the oil blend all over. This is an effective way to remove eye makeup, too, even the waterproof kind.
Use a washcloth wet with warm water to gently remove the oil. Wipe it off using a circular motion, rinsing it out every so often. Continue until all the oil is gone.
Repeat if you still have makeup on your face.
Rinse your face with warm water and pat dry with a soft towel.

, Dry skin is actually a layer of dead skin cells that build up and begin to slough off. Removing this layer of dead, dry skin a few times a week reveals the fresh, healthy skin underneath. Try one of the following methods for exfoliating your skin:


Use a scrub. You can make a scrub by mixing a tablespoon of honey and a teaspoon of ground oatmeal. Simply rub it over the dry spots in a circular motion, then rinse it off.
If you have more buildup than a scrub can handle, try using glycolic acid or another alpha-hydroxy acid. These acids are derived from fruit or sugar, and they exfoliate dead skin cells while strengthening the skin underneath.
Don’t scrub your skin with a brush or cloth, or use a harsh body scrub. This damages and weakens the skin.

, The jury is out on whether it’s a good idea to cover your face in cream at night. Some research seems to indicate that facial cell renewal happens at night, and if you cover your face with cream, it won’t naturally renew itself with healthy cells. Moisturizing in the morning, however, is a great idea, since it protects your face from pollutants, dirt, dry air, hot air, and everything else you’ll encounter throughout the day that could dry out your skin. After using a washcloth wet with warm water to cleanse your face, apply a moisturizer.

, With so many moisturizers to choose from, it can be difficult to figure out which one is best for your face. One easy way to distinguish the good from the bad is to check the ingredients for alcohol. This ingredient is drying, so there’s no reason to use it on your face, especially when you have dry skin. If a moisturizer has a long list of ingredients containing lots of words ending in -ohol, avoid it.


Look for a natural moisturizer made from a blend of oils and lanolin. These protect your skin and won’t dry it out.
On the days when your skin is really dry, try pure argan oil or coconut oil. Choose unrefined coconut oil, since that’s better for your skin than refined coconut oil.

, Once a week or so, treat your face to a deeply moisturizing mask that will help your skin feel renewed. Mix up a mask from natural ingredients, smooth it over your face, then rinse it off with warm water after 15 minutes. Try the following combinations:


1 tablespoon olive oil, 1 tablespoon honey, and 1 smashed banana
1 tablespoon coconut oil, 1 tablespoon honey, and 1 smashed avocado
1 tablespoon grapeseed oil, 1 tablespoon honey, and 1 tablespoon milk

, Bring a little container of coconut oil with you wherever you go. When you see a patch of flaky skin, apply a little oil to hydrate it and make your skin look smoother and healthier. You can also use coconut oil to treat dry, flaky lips.

, If the air in your home is dry, it could be making your skin dry out, too. Set up a humidifier in your bedroom to keep your skin moist while you sleep. This is especially helpful during the winter, when heating systems tend to make the air inside extremely dry.

, The ingredients in your makeup may be contributing to your dry skin problem. If you can go without makeup, that would be best, but if you don’t want to stop wearing it, consider switching to oil-based makeup that doesn’t contain alcohol and other harsh ingredients. Look for makeup composed of ingredients like coconut oil, shea butter, almond oil, beeswax, and other all-natural items that won’t dry out your skin - in fact they’ll nourish it.

, The sun’s rays can dry out your skin. Once the healthy glow fades, the skin begins to flake and fall off. A certain amount of sun is a good thing, but it’s important to protect yourself from getting burned. As someone with dry skin, however, you need to watch what ingredients your sunscreen contains. Alcohols and other chemicals can dry out your skin, so look for all-natural sunscreens.


Consider wearing a hat instead of sunscreen, or doubling up and wearing both. It’s the old-fashioned way to protect your face from the sun, and it works.
After sun exposure, moisturize your skin right away with aloe and other rich moisturizers.

, The items you ingest have a big impact on the health of your skin. If you want your skin to look hydrated, healthy and glowing, adopt the following good habits. Not only will your facial skin look better, your whole body will feel healthier:


Drink a lot of water. If you’re dehydrated, it’ll show up in your skin.
Eat vitamin-rich foods, especially healthy fats like omega-3 fatty acids. These are found in fish, fish oil, avocados, and nuts.
Don’t smoke, drink too much alcohol or take drugs. Tobacco, alcohol, and other drugs have a big effect on your skin. They can dry it out and make it look older than your true age. Cut back on these products for healthier skin.

, In order to prepare your skin for a TCA peel and make the treatment more effective, you should use a face product that contains AHAs, such as glycolic or lactic acids. There are a variety of creams, lotions, and toners available for your skin. Begin using this product approximately five to seven days before applying the peel., TCA peels can be purchased through online retailers or through a dermatologist. Once you have acquired a TCA solution, you should read and follow all of the instructions provided by the manufacturer. TCA peels can be highly acidic so it is very important that you follow all directions., This way you will be able to determine if the acid solution is too strong or if you are allergic to the solution. For example, if you want to apply a TCA peel to your face, you should test a small patch of skin under your ear. This area is out of the way and will not be overly visible if you have a negative reaction. Always test the skin near the area you want to treat.Rinse the test patch of skin once it starts to burn.

, This way you will know how the peel will react on your skin. If the spot that was tested becomes itchy, red, or bumpy, you should not apply the peel to your skin. This is likely a sign that you are experiencing an allergic reaction., Immediately before you apply a TCA peel, you need to completely clean your skin. If you are applying the TCA peel to your face, you should remove all of your make up. Washing your face will help to remove any surface oils allowing the TCA solution to peel away a layer of skin., Some TCA peels will come with a prep solution that should be applied to your skin prior to administering the peel. These solutions help to fully dry out your skin and remove any lingering surface oils.If you did not purchase a prep solution, you can apply witch hazel or diluted rubbing alcohol to your skin using gauze.

, If you are applying a TCA peel to your face, you want to protect some sensitive areas from the acid. In order to do this, use a cotton swab to apply a bit of petroleum jelly to your lips, and the skin around your eyes and nostrils. This will prevent the acid from damaging these sensitive areas.You may want to wear safety goggles to prevent any TCA solution from dripping into your eyes. You will still have to apply petroleum jelly to your nose and mouth, however.

, While working with the TCA solution, you want to be careful that the acid does not touch other areas of skin. As a result, you should always wear latex gloves to protect your hands from the acid. This is especially important if you are applying the TCA using gauze because it will likely come into contact with your fingers., Place a small dish on your counter and pour some of the TCA solution into the dish. This will make it easy for you to dip your brush or gauze into the solution while you are applying the TCA to your skin.

, Dip a piece of gauze into the TCA solution. Then squeeze the gauze gently. You want the gauze to be wet, but not dripping. This will prevent the solution from running into your eyes. Then apply a thin layer of TCA to the desired area of skin. If you are applying the TCA to your face, you may want to divide the area into sections.For example, start by applying the TCA solution to the right side of your face, then the left side, and do the forehead last. This will help prevent you from overlapping the solution.
You can also apply TCA using a makeup brush, but a brush is more likely to cause dripping.

, Once the solution has been applied to your skin, you should wait approximately two to five minutes. The time will vary depending on the strength of the solution, the number of peels you have performed, and your own skin type. It is normal for your skin to turn red and sting a bit while the peel is on your face.If your skin begins to frost (i.e. turn white) or sting uncomfortably, you should begin neutralizing immediately by washing the solution off with water.
This is more likely to occur when using a stronger TCA of 15% or higher.

, If you begin to experience frosting, you should apply a post-peel neutralizer to your skin. This typically comes with the TCA peel kit. Apply the neutralizer to your skin using a gauze or a soft cloth dipped in the neutralizer.You can also make your own neutralizer by mixing 2 tablespoons of baking soda with 1 and a half cups (355 ml) of water.

, After the peel has been on for five minutes, you should wash it off by splashing water onto your face. You can also apply water by dabbing your skin with a wet cloth. This will help to remove the TCA from your skin and will help to neutralize the area., Once your skin is dry, apply a healing ointment to the skin. For example, try using emu oil or Bacitracin to help heal your skin following a TCA peel. You should re-apply this solution a few times a day for at least 48 hours following the peel., Your skin will likely peel for approximately five to seven days following the procedure and during this time you should avoid exposing your skin to the sun. Make sure to use a sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher during this time., TCA peels will dry out your skin. You can replenish the liquids in your skin by drinking lots of water. Try and consume at least eight cups of water per day following the application of a TCA peel.

, If you used a stronger TCA solution, you skin will likely peel for a few days following the treatment. Do not pick at your skin. Instead, let it peel on its own. Picking the skin can lead to skin damage., Do not apply another peel during this time. Although your skin may stop peeling prior to 14 days, the solution is still working on your face and the results will not fully appear for 10-14 days. Once the results are visible, you can determine if another treatment is necessary. TCA peels are quite strong, so if you notice positive results after the first peel, you likely do not need to perform another peel.

Use hydroquinone.,
Use Retin-A.,
Use products containing glycolic acid.,
Use sunscreen.",How to Remove Age Spots1," Hydroquinone is a very effective bleaching cream which can significantly reduce the appearance of age spots.


It is available in concentrations up to 2% over-the-counter, but higher concentrations will require a prescription from your doctor.
Be aware that hydroquinone has been banned in many European and Asian countries, due to its potential carcinogenic properties. However, it is still widely available in the US.;
, Retin-A is an excellent anti-aging skin care product which is used to combat fine lines and wrinkles, improve the skin's texture and elasticity and fade discoloration and sun damage, including age spots.


Retin-A is a vitamin A derivative which is available in cream or gel form, in a variety of different strengths. It is only available by prescription, so you will need to see your doctor before you start using it.
It helps to eliminate age spots by exfoliating the skin, removing the outer hyperpigmented layer and revealing the fresh, new skin underneath., Glycolic acid is type of alpha hydroxy acid which is commonly used in chemical peels. It works by exfoliating the skin, diminishing the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles and age spots.


When sold OTC, glycolic acid is found in cream or lotion form, which is usually applied and left to sit on the skin for a few minutes, before being rinsed off.
Glycolic acid can be quite harsh on the skin, sometimes causing redness and discomfort. You should always moisturize your skin after using glycolic acid products., Sunscreen won't actually help to reduce the appearance of your existing age spots, but it will prevent new ones from forming (as they are caused primarily by sun damage).


In addition, the sunscreen will prevent your existing sun spots from becoming any darker or more noticeable.
You should wear a sunscreen with a zinc oxide base and an SPF of at least 15 everyday, even if it's not hot or sunny.

Use lemon juice.,
Use buttermilk.,
Use honey and yogurt.,
Use apple cider vinegar.,
Use aloe vera.,
Use castor oil.,
Use sandalwood.",How to Remove Age Spots2," Lemon juice contains citric acid, which can help to bleach age spots. Simply dab a little fresh lemon juice directly onto the sunspot and leave to sit for 30 minutes before rinsing off. Do this twice a day and you should start to see results in a month or two.


Lemon juice makes your skin more sensitive to sunlight (and could make the age spot worse) so never leave lemon juice on your skin if you're going outside.
If you have very sensitive skin, the lemon juice might be irritating on your skin, so try diluting it to half strength with water or rosewater before applying.

, Buttermilk contains lactic acid, which bleaches the skin in the same way as the citric acid in lemon juice. Apply a little buttermilk directly onto your age spots and leave for 15 minutes to half an hour before rinsing off. Do this twice a day.


If you tend to have very oily skin, it's a good idea to mix the buttermilk with a little lemon juice before applying, as this will prevent your skin from becoming greasy.
For added benefit, mix a little tomato juice in with the buttermilk, as tomato also contains bleaching properties which can help to reduce age spots.

, A combination of honey and yogurt is believed to be beneficial when it comes to reducing age spots.


Simply mix equal parts of honey and plain yogurt together and apply directly onto the age spots.
Leave for 15 to 20 minutes before rinsing off. Do this twice a day.

, Apple cider vinegar is an important ingredient in many home remedies, including one for age spots! Apply a little apple cider vinegar directly onto the age spots and leave for 30 minutes before rinsing off.


Only use this treatment once a day, as apple cider vinegar can be drying on the skin. You should start to see an improvement in the appearance of the age spots after about six weeks.
For added benefit, mix one part apple cider vinegar with one part onion juice (which you can extract by pushing chopped onion through a strainer) and apply this to the age spots instead., Aloe vera is commonly used to treat a number of skin ailments, including age spots. Simply rub a little fresh aloe vera gel (taken directly from the plant) onto the affected area and leave to soak in.


As aloe vera is very gentle, there is no need to rinse it off. However, you may want to rinse it off if it starts to feel sticky.
If you don't have access to the gel from an aloe vera plant, you can bu fresh aloe vera juice at the market or health food store. This works just as well.

, Castor oil is known for its skin healing properties and has proven effective in the treatment of age spots. Apply a little castor oil directly onto the age spots and massage into the skin for a minute or two until absorbed.


Do this once in the morning and once in the evening, and you should start to see an improvement in about a month.
If you suffer from dry skin, you can mix a little coconut oil, olive oil or almond oil in with the castor oil for added moisturization.

, Sandalwood is believed to contain effective anti-aging properties, and is often used to reduce the appearance of age spots.


Mix a pinch of sandalwood powder with a couple of drops each of rose water , glycerin and lemon juice. Apply this paste onto the age spots and leave to dry for 20 minutes before rinsing off with cold water.
Alternatively, you could massage a drop of pure sandalwood essential oil directly onto the age spots.

Use laser technology to remove age spots.,
Try microdermabrasion treatments to remove age spots.,
Get a chemical peel.",How to Remove Age Spots3," During the treatment, an intense laser light penetrates the epidermis and causes the skin to rejuvenate. The intensity of the light scatters the skin pigments and destroys the discoloration.


The laser treatment is not painful, but may cause minimal discomfort. An anesthetic cream is applied 30 to 45 minutes before the procedure to ease the discomfort.
The number of sessions required will depend on the size of the area and number of spots to be treated. Generally, 2 to 3 sessions will be required. Each session can last from 30 to 45 minutes.
The treatment requires no downtime, but redness, puffiness and sensitivity to sunlight may occur.
Although laser treatment is extremely effective, its major downside is the cost. Depending on the type of laser used (Q-switched ruby, alexandrite or Fraxel dual laser) and the number of age spots requiring treatment, prices can range from $400 to $1500 per session., Microdermabrasion is a noninvasive skin treatment that uses a wand with air pressure. The wand blasts crystals, zinc or other abrasive materials directly against the skin, exfoliating the top layers to remove the dark, hyperpigmented skin.


Microdermabrasion requires no down time and there are no side effects.
A session can be from 30 minutes to 1 hour, depending on the area being treated. Treatment sessions are given in 2- to 3-week intervals.
Typically, 2 to 3 sessions will be required. Prices range can be $75 or more per session.

, A chemical peel works by dissolving dead skin so new radiant skin will surface. During a chemical peel, the area to be treated is thoroughly cleansed and a gel-like acidic substance is applied. The area is then neutralized to stop the chemical process.


Side effects include redness, peeling and sensitivity, which may require down time.
Generally, two treatment sessions are required, which are given in 3- to 4-week intervals. The prices can be $250 or more per session."

Wear the proper clothing when working out.,
Switch from cotton underwear to hiking underwear if you are going to be active outside.,
Change out of sweaty clothes right away.,
Keep the area clean.,
Try Bandelettes.,
Wear boxer briefs under skirts and dresses.",How to Prevent Chafing1," When exercising, its important to wear workout clothes that aren’t too tight and are made out of synthetic fibers, not cotton. Unlike cotton, synthetic fibers lift moisture from your body as you sweat. So there will be less of a chance of wet skin rubbing against each other, which leads to chafing.Wear compression shorts if you are cycling or running long distances to prevent chafing between your legs.
Choose exercise clothing and sports bras that have smooth seams to avoid rubbing against your skin, especially your underarm area.
If you notice your skin chafes when you wear a certain pair of shorts or pants during your workout, switch to a different pair.;
, If you are a runner or hiker and want to prevent chafing in your groin area, wear underwear that is made of synthetic fibers.Avoid underwear made out of modal, rayon, viscose, tencel, lyocell, and bamboo. These are all wood fibers and behave very similarly to cotton when they get damp or wet.

, To prevent chafing, its important to stay dry as wet skin can make chafing worse. So don’t stay in wet or sweaty clothing after a workout or a long day in the heat. Change into dry, clean clothes right away., If you are experiencing chafing between your thighs, gently clean the area to remove any dirt or sweat. If you are experiencing chafing in another part of your body, like your nipples, or your underarms, clean this area well after a workout or a long day outside.


Do not scrub or rub the area. Instead, wipe it gently with a warm wet cloth. Use mild soap that is unscented so it won’t irritate your skin.

, Bandelettes are bands of stretchy lace 6” long that also have a silicone grip that fits on your thighs.They prevent rubbing by forming a barrier between your thighs.Order Bandelettes online and measure your thighs to find the right size.
This is a great option if you are squeamish of lubricants or powders and want a product you can slip on easily.

, A pair of fitted men’s boxer-briefs are super breathable, as they are made with cotton, and they fall at the perfect spot on your thighs to prevent any touching or rubbing."
"
Apply a lubricant to reduce friction on your skin.,
Use a powder to remove moisture on your skin.,
Put bandaids on your nipples.",How to Prevent Chafing2," One of the most popular products used by runners to prevent chafing is body glide.Simply apply it to areas that are prone to chafing, like between your legs, under your arms, and on your nipples. The lubricant should stay on your skin and absorb moisture during even the hottest days of the year.Another lubricant that you can get over the counter is Monistat Soothing Care Chafing Relief Powder Gel.Other popular lubricant products include HikeGoo and Red11., Look for a powder that has micro-particle polymers that glide over your skin and absorb sweat.


Try a powder that will keep your skin dry, like the bizarrely named Lady Anti Monkey Butt Powder., Thought this may be a bit DIY, cutting band aids in half and applying them to your nipples will create a barrier between your clothing and your skin as you run.You can also apply NipGuardto the area before a run to prevent chafing in the nipple area.

Apply petroleum jelly to the area.,
Use natural oils.,
Make your own lubricant.,
Apply baby powder or talcum powder to any chafe prone areas.",How to Prevent Chafing3," Before you step out for a run or for a walk on a hot day, apply petroleum jelly to any areas on your body that are prone to chafing, like between your thighs or under your arms., Baby oil, almond oil, and lavender oil can help to soothe any irritated areas on your skin and keep your skin from rubbing together., If petroleum jelly is not enough to stop the chafing, create your own lubricant by mixing together vitamin creams and natural creams.Mix equal parts Vitamin A and Vitamin D ointment with vaseline. Then, add Vitamin E cream and Aloe Vera cream to the mixture. The aloe vera should give the homemade cream a nice smell and consistency.
Aloe Vera is a great addition because it protects your skin from chafing and can help to heal any irritated skin.

, This will help to keep your skin dry and prevent any chafing, especially on a hot day."
"
Clean the chafed area.,
Apply petroleum jelly or aloe vera gel to the area.,
Let your skin heal before being active again.",How to Prevent Chafing4," Gently wipe between your thighs, under your arms, or over your nipples with water, or a warm wet cloth. Be sure to dry the area well after washing it., This will sooth and heal the chafed skin.If the area is very painful, swollen, bleeding, or crusty looking, talk to your doctor about a prescription for a medicated ointment.

, Continued friction in the area will only make it worse and could lead to infection. So take a break from your morning run or walk. Switch to pants instead of shorts for a few days.If the chafing does not improve after several days, talk to your doctor. You may need medicated ointment or cream to heal the chafing.

",How to Have Soft Skin," Exfoliation makes your skin softer by removing dirt, oil, and dead skin cells. You can scrub your face with coffee grounds mixed with some mild soap,or a store-bought exfoliation product. For relief of redness as well, look for something that contains green tea extracts and glycolic acid.Avoid exfoliating more than once or twice a week, as exfoliating too often can cause skin irritation.;
, Moisture loss and removing your skin’s natural oils can lead to dry and flaky skin, and bathing too often, bathing for too long, and using hot water can all increase moisture and oil loss. Bathe every other day if you can, use cooler water, use your hand or a soft cloth instead of a scrubber to apply soap,and limit your shower time to five or 10 minutes.After your shower or bath, don’t rub your skin dry, as this can remove moisture and oil. Instead, gently pat or rub yourself with a fluffy towel.When your skin is still somewhat damp, apply your favorite moisturizer.

, If you choose to shave, save shaving for last when you’re bathing, because this will give your skin time to soften up. Use a moisturizing shaving cream and sharp razors with multiple blades. It’s also important to shave downward, or with the direction of your hair growth to prevent irritation.Don’t shave first thing in the morning when you’re retaining water, as you won’t get as close a shave.
Treat razor burn with a warm compress, and always moisturize after shaving.
To avoid the added cost of shaving cream, you can use hair conditioner as a substitute, but avoid soap as it won’t lubricate your skin enough.

, Your skin doesn’t seem to mind what kind of moisturizer you prefer, as long as you use it often and regularly.Always moisturize after bathing or shaving, before applying makeup, after removing makeup, and after doing dishes or getting your skin wet.


Look for a moisturizer that has plant-based oils and hydrating ingredients like vitamin A, vitamin E,cocoa butter, shea butter, lavender, and chamomile.For particularly dry skin, try a deep overnight skin conditioning. Before bed, apply a heavy-duty moisturizing cream to dry areas like your hands, feet, and elbows. Then, put on cotton socks and gloves, and wrap your elbows with a soft cloth., Makeup brushes can harbor bacteria and spread from one area of your body to another, clogging pores and causing irritation. To avoid this, wash your brushes weekly with liquid soap and warm water. Allow them to dry out again before use., For people who choose to wear makeup, sleeping with it on can clog your pores and lead to infections.Before bed, use a gentle cleanser, lukewarm water, and soft cloth to remove your makeup. Pat your face dry and apply moisturizer.


Use makeup sparingly if you do choose to wear it, as it can dehydrate and dry your skin. Look for brands that don’t contain dangerous ingredients, and that are hypoallergenic., There are many skin-friendly foods that are good to use both inside and outside of your body. For instance, potatoes can help reduce puffiness, while avocado can make your skin look fresh and plump. Citrus fruits, which shouldn’t be applied to the face, can be used as exfoliants, and pineapple has been known to brighten skin., Not only are massages relaxing and wonderful, but they also increase circulation, which helps bring nutrients, hydrating water, and a radiant glow to your skin. Moreover, oil massages can also be very moisturizing, so even if you don’t opt for a professional massage, treat yourself by massaging your hands, face, arms, legs, and body with your favorite oil before bed a couple nights a week.

, Humidity levels tend to drop in colder weather, which means less moisture in the air, and drier skin. To make matters worse, artificial heat further reduces moisture, leaving you with dry, itchy, flaky skin. You can help prevent dry skin by:


Showering less in the winter.
Moisturizing more.
Installing a humidifier to add moisture back to the air in your home or office., The cold, dry air of winter isn’t the only environmental factor that can cause your skin to be less soft. Exposure to wind can cause dryness and irritation, while UV exposure can cause premature aging, wrinkles, leathery skin, and more serious medical issues like skin cancer.


Protect your skin from the sun with sunscreen, sun-protective apparel, and SPF makeups and moisturizers.
Protect your skin from the cold and wind with gloves, hats, scarves, and other winter gear.

, There are many things that can cause your skin to become blotchy, red, itchy, and flaky, including fabrics like wool, harsh detergents and fabric softeners, perfumes and fragrances, dyes, and non-hypoallergenic cosmetics and creams., Stay away from alcohol-based products that go on your skin, and anything containing sodium lauryl sulfate.It’s also important to watch what goes into your body, as diuretics like caffeine, alcohol, and cigarettes can dehydrate your skin, lead to wrinkles, and make your skin look sallow., Many healthy foods contain ingredients and nutrients that will keep your skin soft and radiant. Eat a balanced diet that’s loaded with fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, and a moderate amount of healthy fats. Skin-friendly foods include:


Foods with a high water content, such as kiwi, cantaloupe, apple, watermelon, celery, cucumber, and zucchini.Foods that contain vitamin C and zinc, which help with collagen and elastin production. These include dark leafy greens, nuts and seeds, beans, mushrooms, citrus fruits, and berries.
Omega-rich foods that fight wrinkles, such as hemp and flax.Antioxidants like tomatoes, red and yellow peppers, berries, and other red, orange, and yellow foods. , While the eight cups of water rule is a generalization, it is important to stay hydrated. If you feel thirsty, your body is telling you that you need water, so drink up!


Don’t fret over the natural sugar found in fruits, but you should avoid drinks like pop that contain lots of added sugar, which can lead to wrinkles and saggy skin., Along with improving overall physical and mental health, exercise also increases circulation, bringing nutrients to your skin that make it soft and healthy. Also, the sweat helps to wick dirt and bacteria away from your skin, which can help to keep pores clear. Always be sure to at least rinse off with cool water after a workout to remove sweat and dirt.

, Collagen is the protein that keeps your skin taut and wrinkle-free, and this is created thanks to growth hormones that are secreted during sleep. A good night of rest, therefore, is necessary for smooth and soft skin., Many skin-related problems can lead to rough, red, blotchy skin that isn’t smooth or soft. Often, redness, scaly skin, itching, blisters, and excessive pimples can be treated with special medications or ointments, depending on the cause. Talk to your doctor or dermatologist about diagnosis and treatment if you suspect you may have skin problems such as:


Acne
Eczema
Psoriasis
Dermatitis

Use a creamy, oil-free face wash to hydrate skin and whisk away impurities.,
Lightly massage the face wash into your skin using gentle, circular motions.,
Using a warm, wet towel, pat your face dry.,
Mix up or apply a collagen mask to prevent wrinkles and firm up your skin.,
Apply an anti-wrinkle cream around wrinkle-prone areas.,
Pat in some eye concentrate to prevent wrinkles in the most common areas.,
Apply an anti-wrinkly moisturizing body lotion to your body, especially your upper chest and neckline.",How to Prevent Wrinkles1," Skin is much more flexible when it is moisturized, allowing it to move and slide freely across your face without damage. This sort of damage will compound itself over your lifetime, leading to wrinkles, if you don't take proper care of your skin now.


Use lukewarm water, not cold or hot, to protect your skin;
, Use your fingers to work the wash into your face. Get around the eyes and forehead as well, using the tips of your fingers to work up a nice, gentle lather.








, Don't rub or scrub with a towel, as this will irritate your skin and lead to redness. Your wash has removed a lot of the dead skin, oil, and dirt, so scrubbing now is just hurting the new, younger skin underneath.








, Firm, flexible skin is the enemy of wrinkles. Masks are a way to soak your skin in collagen (a naturally occurring human protein) as well as essential anti-oxidants, vitamins and minerals. Let the mask rest for 15 minutes to absorb into your skin.








Some modern masks come in pre-soaked pads, which you can simply stick to your face instead of mixing up and painting on a traditional wet mask.
When done, pat in any remaining mask essence (sold with the pads) lightly onto your face.

, Most of these are very concentrated, so you only need a pea-sized amount. Focus on your outer eyes, forehead, chin, and around your mouth. Pat the cream onto your face instead of rubbing it on.









If you have some extra cream, don't forget about your neck -- this is one of the wrinkle spots many people forget.

, Crows feet, the wrinkles right around the eyes, are the most common and quickest wrinkles you'll develop. Using some eye concentrate around the eyes targets these wrinkles specifically.









Make sure you get a cream that is paraben-free, as these chemicals may hurt your skin over time., Your body skin needs protection too, and many of the same principles used to prevent wrinkles on your face can be applied to your body, too. A daily full-body moisturizing, focusing on frequently exposed areas like the arms, legs, and upper chest, will help fight body wrinkles.









Look for moisturizing creams that aren't oil-based, which can leave you feeling greasy.
Again, search for natural, paraben-free products for the best results.

Protect your skin from the sun.,
Eat, drink, and slather on the antioxidants.,
Massage your face with Omega-3.,
Splash cold water on your face.,
Wear sunglasses with UV protection regularly.,
Sleep on your back to prevent sleep lines.,
Stop smoking.,
Control your facial expressions.,
Be happy.,
Don't blame it on your genes.,
See a doctor when over-the-counter products fail to work and you are bothered by your indomitable wrinkles.",How to Prevent Wrinkles2," As you get older, the genes that control inflammation, the production and strength of collagen, and your skin's ability to retain water begin encourage the formation of wrinkles. A study found that aged skin that hadn't been exposed to the sun had about 3,800 genetic mutations while skin that had been exposed to the sun had around 10,000 mutations in the same genes!If the risk of skin cancer isn't enough to get you to wear sunblock and wide-brimmed hats, let vanity persuade you.









The sun provides vital Vitamin D, so make sure you're taking a supplement if you're worried about Vitamin D levels. This is a much safer way to get the vitamin than sunbathing., When UV rays are absorbed by your skin, they create free radicals, which are volatile molecules. Those free radicals can latch onto your DNA and cause the mutations that cause wrinkles. Antioxidants help your body defend against free radicals.Combat wrinkles by eating foods and drinking beverages that contain antioxidants (pomegranates, açai, blueberries, green tea) and using creams or moisturizers that contain them.








, Oils containing long chain polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids (your basic Omega-3s) work wonders in promoting intracellular repair. Examples of omega-3 oils are almond oil, egg oil and milk cream. Fish oils also contain omega-3, and can often be taken as gel pills.








Salmon and other cold-water fish are excellent sources of Omega-3s., Splashing cold water on your face first thing in the morning stimulates micro-circulation and regenerates dermal membrane. Preferably, fill your mouth with water while you splash so as to stretch the facial skin.









Hit your skin with cool or cold water for 15 seconds after showering -- this closes up pores and helps your skin dry naturally. Big, warm pores allow oils out.

, Wearing sunglasses protect the delicate skin around your eyes from the sun, but it'll also help prevent squinting, which directly contributes to wrinkling.







, These may eventually turn into wrinkles. Moreover, sleeping on your back or left side is better for your spinal health as well.







, Heavy smokers are almost 5 times more likely to show excessive wrinkling than nonsmokers. Smoking can damage collagen, and the squinting and lip pursing that comes with smoking directly create wrinkles over time.







, More animated expressions mean more creases, and creases eventually become wrinkles.It might be difficult, but try to do away with frowning, eyebrow raising, and squinting. Don't stop smiling or laughing, however. A genuine smile causes crow's feet around your eyesbut the power of sincere joy against wrinkles may be stronger than the effects of not smiling at all.








, In a study of female identical twins (i.e. people with the same genes), researchers found that divorced women looked older than their married or widowed twins, and women on antidepressants looked older than their twins who weren't.It's unclear whether the antidepressants or the depression itself causes increased aging, but these findings imply that being in a happy relationship and having an optimistic, laid back approach to life might prevent wrinkles. At the very least, being happy will help you not care so much about the wrinkles.








, It's true that some people age more gracefully than others. And while scientists are beginning to gain a deeper understanding of how genetics can influence the aging process, they're also discovering how much your lifestyle choices can affect your genes. Your genes only govern 30% of how you age; the other 70% is up to you.








No one can completely prevent wrinkles. They are a natural part of aging. But you can help control how severe they are., Prescription retinoic acid can minimize the appearance of wrinkles. Wrinkles arising solely from excessive muscular contractions, such as forehead horizontal lines or crows' feet, should be injected with botulinum toxin. Deep wrinkles may need filler injections.

Have a bath or shower.,
Get a textured sponge to wash your skin.,
Scrub your body gently with your sponge starting from the ankles upward.,
Add wet sand to your full body exfoliation.,
Rinse with hot water.",How to Exfoliate Your Body for Soft Skin1," While not part of the exfoliating process per se, immersing your body in hot water will open up your pores, making your skin much more susceptible to cleaning. It also helps to do this process in the bathroom, as you'll need a ready supply of hot water and somewhere to wash away the dead skin flakes once they've been scrubbed off. Use a skin-friendly, perfume-free detergent for bath and allow at least 15 minutes to soften (macerating) the skin surface. It is good when the skin surface looks a bit ""deformed"". Remove ""dead skin"" by rubbing it away with your hands. It will work well, especially at your feet, toes and heels.;
, Tending to your skin with it will help rub away excess skin flakes, leaving your skin softer and cleaner than before. It is recommended you have a sponge ready for use once you have finished up your shower. It should feel slightly rough on your skin, but if it's abrasive to the point of pain, exfoliating wash cloths are a suitable, gentler alternative. Exfoliating can also be done with a rough washcloth.
A natural bristle brush makes for a good alternative, particularly while scrubbing the backs of arms or legs.
If you're the do-it-yourself type, you might look into making your own loofah from home.


, Scrub the sponge over your skin in small, circular motions. Make sure to apply some pressure to feel the sponge's rough texture on your skin; that way, it will rub the surface-layer dead skin away. Starting at the ankles is recommended because it helps to encourage positive blood circulation during the exfoliation process.If you're exfoliating your entire body, make sure to give extra attention to your heels, elbows, and knees. These are generally considered to be the driest parts of one's skin, and should be given greater attention accordingly.

, If you've ever walked along the beach barefoot, you may have noticed your foot callouses soften. Sand granules are a naturally occurring exfoliant, and their grainy texture is well-suited to scraping away your excess skin flakes. Acquire a cup of sand, soften it with water, and rub it over your body. Although you cannot add a scrub or lotion to the sand like you can with a loofah or wash cloth, the sand's malleable form makes it a more relaxing and enjoyable way to exfoliate mechanically. Be forewarned: Using sand in the bath can cause a bigger mess than more common exfoliants. Although it is recommended to try it out at least once, it may not be the best course of action if you don't have the added time in your routine available to do a bit of cleaning up afterwards. Getting sand down a drain could completely ruin the plumbing pipes if done often.
If using sand, it should be cleaned, even bleached, because getting it from outdoors could introduce bacteria and using that to exfoliate would do more harm than good. Choose sand with small granules, not big, because the smaller granules are more gentle on the skin. Focus on the tougher skin of the arms and legs because sand can be more intense than exfoliating scrubs.

, Closing up shop with a body rinse is a relaxing and effective way to finish your exfoliation. Although it's recommended you repeat this process at least three times a week, you should notice an immediate softness with your skin.

",How to Exfoliate Your Body for Soft Skin2," Although calling it 'chemical exfoliation' may carry the pejorative impression of being unhealthy or unnatural for the skin, most chemical exfoliators are actually based in natural ingredients, like fruits, milks, or sugars. Many exfoliators are relatively affordable and readily available at your nearest supermarket.

, Attaching the exfoliating process to an existing part of your daily schedule will make it that much easier to make it part of your routine; keep in mind that exfoliation is best approached as a regular part of your life. You may have softer skin immediately after an exfoliating cleanse, but repetition will yield longer lasting results.

, Squirt some exfoliator onto your hands, and begin to rub it onto your skin. Before applying the exfoliator, it's important to make sure your hands are clean; otherwise, you may very well be spreading bacteria to your skin and face. In a gentle, circular motion, swirl the exfoliator around your skin to sweep away any grime and dead skin cells. Take particular care towards exfoliating your face; not only is it the part of you people are going to notice the most, it also carries more oil than other parts of your skin. Three minutes on the face alone should suffice; the rest of the body should warrant a less intensive, but nonetheless attentive do-over with your exfoliator.


When exfoliating your face, take proper care to focus on the central area of your face, from the forehead to the nose to the chin. Collectively, this is referred to as the 'T-Zone', and is notorious for its oiliness.

, Take some water in your hands and wash the product away. Making sure the exfoliant is entirely gone will ensure it doesn't irritate your skin later on. Although the chemical exfoliating process requires less of a 'physical' element than its mechanical counterpart, you should find your skin just as soft and smooth following a proper ritual as you would if you'd used the loofah the whole way through.

, If you have a specific product in mind, read product reviews online – hearing what others have to say about the product can help you choose one that’s right for you.


If you have any allergies, be sure to research your desired product to make sure it doesn’t contain something that will make you break out.

, If you have a friend who uses fermented products, ask which are their favorites and where you can get them. Check in with a beauty professional who you trust, such as someone who works in your favorite salon, spa, or makeup store – they may have personal or professional experience with these products.


Check with your doctor or dermatologist before starting a new skin care regimen, especially if you have sensitive skin or any allergies.

, Visit your beauty supply store and ask if they carry fermented skin care products. If they do, tell them you’ve never tried these products before and you’d like to test out a sample. Most stores should be happy to let you use a tester in the store, or give you a small sample to take home.

, Because more natural ingredients are being used in these products, some products may contain fewer preservatives. That means they might not last as long as other products. Unopened products will usually last 24 to 36 months, but once you open your beauty product you should use it within 6 to 12 months.Check each individual product for its shelf-life or expiration date, and throw away expired products.

Apply a lemon juice solution.,
Try a lemon milk soak.,
Make a yogurt honey mask.,
Try a lightening paste.",How to Naturally Whiten Skin at Home1," Lemon juice has been used for thousands of years as a natural skin lightener. It contains acids that lightly bleach the skin and exfoliate the top layer of darker skin cells. Since pure lemon juice can be irritating to skin, make a lemon juice solution by mixing one part lemon juice to one part water. Take a cotton ball and spread the solution on your skin. Let it sit for 15 minutes, then wash it off with warm water.


Limit your application of lemon juice solution to just two to three times per week. Applying it more often could lead to skin irritation. Apply a moisturizer after rinsing off the lemon juice because the juice can dry out your skin.
You should begin to see results after three to four weeks of using the solution several times per week. While lemon juice doesn’t provide instant lightening effects, it’s the most effective natural solution available.
Use caution if you ever attempt to put any kind of citrus juice on your face. Phytophotodermatitis can be caused by a reaction between UV light and photosynthesizing chemicals found in citrus fruits.While it's fine to use lemon juice on your skin, you need to wash it off thoroughly before going out in the sun.;
, For a soothing full-body lightening treatment, start by drawing a bath of warm water. Pour in a cup of full-fat milk and squeeze the juice of an entire lemon into the tub. Swirl the mixture around so that the milk and lemon are evenly distributed in the tub. Soak in the bath for 20 minutes, then rinse yourself off with clean water.


The milk in this soak has enzymes that gently lighten the skin. It also moisturizes the skin, offsetting the drying properties of the lemon juice.
Try a milk soak once a week, and you should see results after a month or so.

, Like milk, yogurt contains enzymes that can gently lighten skin. Honey has moisturizing and antibacterial properties. Together, the two ingredients make a nourishing mask. Mix one part honey and one part yogurt, then spread the mixture on your face and body. Allow it to sit for 15 minutes, then rinse it away with warm water.


Be sure to use plain, unsweetened yogurt. Sugary or flavored yogurt will get too sticky.
In place of honey, try mashing up an avocado or using aloe instead. Both ingredients have a wonderful moisturizing effect.

, For more concentrated benefits, try making a thick paste using natural ingredients that help lighten the skin. Spread a paste on your freshly washed face, leave it in place for 15 minutes, then rinse it away with warm water. Here are two recipes for natural lightening pastes:


Gram flour paste. Pour ¼ cup of gram flour into a bowl. Add enough lemon juice or milk to make a thick paste.
Turmeric paste. Pour 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) of turmeric into a bowl. Add enough lemon juice or milk to make a thick paste.

Obtain some Sea Kelp Ferment.,
Make a fermented yogurt facemask.,
Try a honey and sour cream mask.,
Create a moisturizing lotion.",How to Try Fermented Skin Care2," You can purchase kombucha tea from the grocery store – the kind you would usually drink – or try brewing your own at home. Either way, try using kombucha tea as a facewash twice a day instead of a store-bought cleanser. Simply splash it onto your face, over the sink, like you would when washing with water.This may be an inexpensive alternative to pricey fermented skin care products.


You can also try using the SCOBY as a facemask (the kombucha “mother,” or Symbiotic Culture of Bacteria and Yeast – that slimy-looking glob in the tea). Apply it evenly to your skin, let it sit for 10-15 minutes, and rinse it off with cool or lukewarm water. It’ll feel sticky and slimy while on, but not afterwards. Keep a towel handy – this can be messy!, Sea kelp ferment, or sea kelp BioFerment, is a fermented kelp extract. Visit your local health food store to see if they have any available. If not, shop online at a reputable site to obtain some.Use this ingredient as a base for moisturizing lotion or a skin serum that you make at home, or mix it into a product you already have.


Look for whatever fermented ingredient you want to use – botanicals like fermented aloe and dandelion can be found in health food stores or online, as can other natural products like fermented soy and ginseng.

, Add your product – sea kelp ferment, for instance – to some plain yogurt (the probiotic kind with live cultures). Apply this as a facemask and let it sit for 20-30 minutes. Wash it off with cool water, and moisturize afterwards with your regular moisturizing lotion.You can also blend the ingredients in a blender for a smoother consistency.


To make your mask more hydrating, add 2 teaspoons of a high-quality olive oil for every 1 tablespoon of plain Greek yogurt. Massage this onto your skin then wipe it off with a warm, damp washcloth right away. This is especially good for dry skin.

, Mix 2 parts sour cream to 2 parts honey and 1 part apply cider vinegar or lemon juice, plus your special fermented ingredient. Wash your face with your regular face wash then apply this mask, and let sit for 20 minutes. Rinse with cool water.


You can do this twice a week to possibly brighten, tighten, exfoliate, and moisturize your skin.

Pour some toner onto some cotton batting.,
Apply a good moisturizer with natural oils such as rosemary or almond.,
Use the same family of products.",How to Make Your Skin Glow in Minutes1," Exfoliation removes dead skin cells, impurities and excess oil while preparing your skin for cleansing and toning.


After scrubbing, use a cleanser on your skin. Gently massage your skin in circular motions for a few minutes to promote blood circulation, to remove makeup and to eliminate excess oil, or sebum.
Many cleansers contain exfoliating beads or other ingredients that allow you to accomplish both tasks at once. Just avoid cleansers that have drying ingredients like deodorants, colors or fragrances. Also, skip cleansers that have ""antibacterial"" on the label.;
, Rub the toner over your face until no excess dirt remains.

, Massage the cream into your skin for hydration and a dewy look.


Use a moisturizer with at least SPF 15 to prevent premature aging from sun exposure.
Look for moisturizer containing humectants like glycerin, propylene glycol or urea. Humectants attract water when you apply them to your skin and improve its hydration.
Choose moisturizers with alpha-hydroxy acids (AHAs). AHAs improve dead skin cell turnover, which results in decreased dryness, acne, wrinkles and age spots.
Switch moisturizers according to the season. In the summer, use a lighter product. In the winter, choose something thicker and heavier.

, If you use 1 brand of cleanser, choose your toning and moisturizing products from the same brand. Taking a unified approach is often better for your skin, because mixed brands don't always interact well with one another.

Never use bleach or other dangerous chemicals on your skin.,
Don’t buy into false beauty standards.",How to Naturally Whiten Skin at Home2," There are a few dangerous myths going around regarding using bleach, ammonia, and other household cleaning products on your skin to try to lighten it. These chemicals are extremely harmful to skin, and they can do long-term damage. Damaged skin actually looks darker, so using these chemicals will end up doing the opposite of what you want. Avoid them.

, No matter what your skin color might be, it’s beautiful just the way it is. It’s fine to use safe items like lemon juice to lighten your skin a little, but don’t seek to completely change your skin color from its natural state. Instead of trying to have a different skin color, accept yourself for who you are. If you were born with dark skin, embrace your beauty, and don’t let anyone tell you to change.


Many women across the world hold themselves to beauty standards that prize light skin over darker skin. Many other women go to great lengths to get darker skin, paying for tanning beds and risking skin cancer to get a few shades darker. Doesn’t make a lot of sense, does it?
When it comes to having beautiful skin, the most important thing you can do is keep your skin healthy. It’s your body’s largest organ, and it deserves a high level of care. Eat well, stay hydrated, and exfoliate and moisturize your skin to keep it looking vibrant and healthy.

Exfoliate your skin.,
Keep it moisturized.,
Limit your sun exposure.",How to Naturally Whiten Skin at Home3," The buildup of dead skin cells on the surface of your skin can make the skin appear a little dull. To brighten your skin, it’s important to exfoliate regularly. One excellent way to exfoliate the skin is to use a body scrub composed of sugar or salt. In the bath or shower, wet your skin and rub the scrub in a gentle circular motion over your entire body. In this way you can “polish” your skin until it has a healthy gleam.


To exfoliate your face, use a gentler facial scrub. Ground up oatmeal or almonds have good exfoliating properties that won’t damage your fragile facial skin.
Using a dry brush to brush the dead skin cells from your body is another good exfoliating method Find a brush made from natural fibers, and brush your body before you get into the bath or shower.

, Keeping your skin moisturized will prevent dead skin cells from building up and sloughing off so quickly. For brighter skin, use a daily moisturizer after you get out of the bath or shower. Choose a creamy moisturizer that doesn’t contain alcohol, since alcohol can actually dry out your skin.


Coconut oil is another great moisturizer that keeps skin looking glowing and youthful. Spread coconut oil on your arms and legs after getting out of the shower. Wait ten minutes for it to absorb into your skin before you put your clothes on.
Jojoba oil also has moisturizing properties and is great for the skin. Olive oil or almond oil can also work wonders.

, It’s hard to stay out of the sun every day, but exposure to the sun darkens your skin. You don’t have to stay cooped up inside, though — just spend some time preparing your skin for sun exposure before you go out for the day. To keep your skin from getting too tanned, take the following measures:


Use sunscreen with a high SPF. 30 SPF or high is best, since lower SPF sunscreen still allows the sun’s rays to tan your skin. Reapply it throughout the day as necessary.
Wear a wide-brimmed hat. This will keep the sun out of your face and off of your neck and shoulders.
Wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants. During the summer, choose cool, swishy fabrics so you won’t get too hot.
Be careful not to stay out of the sun completely. Your body depends on some sun exposure to produce vitamin D, which is essential to bone health and other vital functions.

Be aware of the risks associated with skin lightening creams.,
Try a skin lightening cream.,
Try chemical peels or microdermabrasion.",How to Make Your Skin Lighter3," Many natural bleaching agents can lead to allergy or irritation. Prolonged use of skin lightening products can also lead to premature aging of skin because of increased sensitivity to UVA/UVB rays. A lot of what you put on your skin gets absorbed into your bloodstream, so it is important to avoid products that contain harmful ingredients.Steroids in some skin lightening products can increase the chance of infection and increase the likelihood of acne.
Hydroquinone may cause permanent skin discoloration and if taken by mouth is known to cause cancer.

, Look for a cream that contains beneficial rather than harmful ingredients. Purchase an over-the-counter cream containing kojic acid, glycolic acid, alpha hydroxy acids, vitamin C or arbutin (also known as bearberry extract). Alternatively, get a dermatologist to prescribe a stronger skin lightening cream containing retinoids (acidic form of vitamin A) or an ingredient called hydroquinone.All of these skin lightening products work by reducing melanin, which is a pigment that causes skin to tan when exposed to sunlight.

, Chemical peels and microdermabrasion treatments are sometimes recommended by dermatologists to achieve skin lightening. Both of these treatments work to peel or exfoliate away the outer, darker pigmented skin, revealing the fresher, lighter colored skin underneath. These treatments can also help with acne scars, brown spots, and other pigmentation problems.A chemical peel involves having a concentrated acidic solution applied to the skin by a dermatologist. The acid will burn away the outer, pigmented layers of skin, leaving lighter skin behind.
Microdermabrasion achieves the same results, but uses a different method. With microdermabrasion, a rotating wire brush is used to slough off the top layers of pigmented skin.

, Keeping your skin hydrated helps your skin stay healthy. This allows old, pigmented layers to fade away and reveal fresh, new ones underneath. Drink at least 6 to 8 glasses a day for best results.Keep a bottle of water with you to make keeping yourself hydrated a little easier.
Add lemon or another type of fruit if you don’t like the taste of water alone.

, Cleanse your face twice a day with a foaming cleanser or soap and follow with a good moisturizer. You should also use gentle skincare products formulated for your skin type. If you use products unsuitable for your skin it may cause redness. Along with a daily routine, exfoliate at least once a week to remove dead skin cells.Always take your makeup off before bed. Otherwise, the oils could clog your pores, leading to uneven skin tone or even breakouts.

Use a toner after you cleanse but before you moisturize. Wipe your face dry, then apply a bit of toner — depending on what form of toner you buy, you could spray it on, wipe it on, or rub it on — and then moisturize.
If your skin is hardy, apply the toner every day to minimize the appearance of pores and reduce excess shine. If your skin is more sensitive, use a toner every other day or every third day to reduce the risk of over-drying.

, Astringents are much like toners, except they are often stronger and alcohol-based. They cause facial tissue to constrict and tighten, reducing the appearance of pore size. Alcohol- or acetone-based astringents are only recommended for tolerant, oily skin. Astringents like these may be too harsh and drying for sensitive, dry skin.


Natural astringents can also be found. They include the following:

Witch Hazel
Rose Water
Orange Blossom Water
Green Tea
Apple Cider Vinegar
Cucumber
Elderflower



, Exfoliation means to wipe away the dead layer of skin on top of the epidermis, called the stratum corneum. You can physically exfoliate your skin by wiping a cleanser onto your face with a buff puff (don't wipe too vigorously) or by using a gritty scrub, such as one that has ground-up peach cores in it. Exfoliate at most two times a week.








, For a stronger variant, try chemical peels. Chemical peels are a little stronger than physical exfoliants, so be sure to use sparingly or to ramp up use slowly so that your skin gets used to higher concentrations gradually.









Tretinoin is a common chemical exfoliant. It's a retinoid, meaning it's related to vitamin A, and it's prescription, meaning you'll have to visit a doctor to get it. It's worth it, however.
Alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs) are another class of chemical exfoliant. AHAs can be purchased in the store and used at home for professional-grade chemical exfoliation. Look for AHAs that are glycolic acid-based.
Beta hydroxy acids (BHAs) are helpful, too. BHAs are oil-soluble where AHAs aren't, meaning they can penetrate deep into oily skin and exfoliate from the inside out. BHAs are suitable for people with especially acne-prone skin.

, Sun can not only damage your skin, it can also exaggerate the size of your pores. In order to counteract this, wear a gentle, noncomedogenic sunscreen when you plan on spending significant amounts of time outside.

Exfoliate daily.",How to Love Your Dark Skin," As someone with dark skin, you might be tempted to compare yourself to others, especially those with lighter skin tones. Try your best to avoid comparing yourself to other people. Ideally, the only competitor you should have in life is yourself. Work towards being the best version of yourself.Focusing on bettering yourself through accomplishments rather than physical attributes can be helpful. Instead of basing your value on the color of your skin, base it on how good of a person you are. Work on being a good person, not just a beautiful one.;
, Understand that the media promotes a certain image of what is beautiful, and tends not to acknowledge types of beauty that exist outside of this set ideal. But, in many parts of the world, those with darker skin are seen as the ideal image of beauty. Recognize that despite what the media might be telling you, you are still beautiful.Rather than assuming your skin is a negative aspect of your physical appearance, remind yourself daily that your skin color is just another special part of what makes you unique and diverse.

, Instead of letting yourself feel bad, turn those negative feelings around and encourage yourself to look at things in a more positive light. Reroute those negative thoughts into more positive ones.Instead of thinking or saying something like “I wish my skin were lighter” or “My skin is unattractive,” say something like “My dark skin makes me different from others and that makes me special.”
Tell yourself: “My dark skin is beautiful. I am more than my outward appearance.”

, Keep a list of the things that you think are great about you. Maybe you have a really lovely smile, maybe you have a knack for making people laugh, or maybe you are a great friend. Focus on the things you love about yourself, and you might find that you begin to love other parts of yourself in the process.Take the time to get to know yourself on a deeper level. Rather than simply staring into the mirror, take an inventory of the qualities you possess that aren’t visible to the naked eye.

, By doing some self-praise and celebrating the things that make you unique and beautiful, you can begin to accept and love yourself for you who are. By channeling your energy into loving and accepting yourself rather than criticizing your attributes, you might begin to feel more at home in your own skin.When you want to say or think something negative about yourself, including anything negative about your dark skin, consider this: would you say it to a loved one? Would you put down a loved one in the same way? Loving yourself means treating yourself better, starting from the inside out. Try to speak to yourself the way you would a dear friend or a loved one.

, There are many celebrities and famous figures with dark skin who are admired and adored by people around the world. Actresses like Lupita Nyong’o and athletes like Michael Jordan are great role models for self-acceptance and a positive self-image, and are admired and respected.


Lupita Nyong’o said that until she found other dark skinned women to look up to, such as Oprah and Whoopi Goldberg, she never imagined being an actress was possible.By looking up to successful people with dark skin, you may be inspired to believe better, more positive things about yourself.

, Colorism is when people of color are treated in a discriminatory way, simply due to the color of their skin. People of color being met with prejudice is also a form of colorism. By educating yourself on this issue, you can work towards joining the efforts to eliminate it.Colorism is different from racism in that it addresses the color of one’s skin, rather than their racial background. Still, colorism can be just as damaging and problematic.

, If you notice that you are stereotyping others, try to correct this behavior. Avoid lumping people into categories or assuming things about them based on their physical appearance. By ending this practice in your own life, you might be able to encourage others to do so in their own.If you notice this behavior in yourself, or in someone close to you, acknowledge it. Remind yourself—and others—that people are more than stereotypes.

, Work towards accepting yourself for you who are, and accepting others for who they are. Practicing acceptance is one of the keys to being a happier person, yet many people seem to struggle with it more than other interpersonal skills. Work on being more aware of your self-acceptance, as well as of how willing you are to accept others.Accepting yourself is the first step to loving yourself exactly as you are. If you are focused on your dark skin as something you cannot accept about yourself, you will have trouble loving your skin, and in turn, yourself.

, The Dark is Beautiful campaign by Women of Worth works to promote the idea that every person is beautiful, regardless of their skin color. There are many other campaigns out there that promote this idea, and supporting these campaigns can help you become more involved in the issue.Using your social media outlets to promote self-love and the idea that all skin colors are beautiful is another way to get involved with the issue. Many campaigns like Dark is Beautiful have social media pages you can follow and promote.
Follow and post with the hashtag #IWillNotApologizeForBeingDarkSkin to show your support for the cause, and to engage with a growing social media movement., When it comes to caring for your skin, it’s more important to know your skin type rather than focusing on its pigment. For example, the fact that you are prone to oily skin will have more of an effect on your skincare routine than the fact that your skin is dark.Read labels on skincare products. Look for products that cater to your skin’s specific needs. If you have especially oily skin, you might want to get a cleanser that is oil-free. Or, if you have especially dry skin, you might want to look for a gentle moisturizer.

, Even though those with dark skin have more melanin, which helps protect your skin from sunburn, UV rays can still damage dark skin. Increased melanin does not protect against melanoma, which is a form of skin cancer, so wearing sunscreen every day is vital, regardless of your skin color.There are even many daily moisturizing creams you can wear that are lightweight and oil-free while carrying a sun protection factor (SPF) of 30 or higher. Try to stick with at least this level of protection or higher.

, Use a gentle exfoliating scrub each day to keep your skin healthy, clear, and glowing. Daily exfoliation can help improve your skin’s tone and texture, as it buffs away dead skin and gets rid of any product build-up that might be present.There are exfoliating products for your face that are a bit more gentle than those for use all over your body. Look for face washes that have exfoliating beads, and body scrubs that also contain moisturizers for a one-step process.

Don't forget to use a primer underneath your makeup.,
Use a concealer.,
Wash your makeup off every night.",How to Make Your Pores Smaller2," If you ""prime"" your skin before it accepts the final layer of makeup, that makeup will tend to look smoother and more even. As many makeup artists are won't to say: ""Not to prime is a crime."" Be sure you incorporate this into your morning routine for visibly smaller-looking pores.









If you're already applied makeup but have forgotten the primer, don't fret. You can apply certain primers on top of makeup while still staying at the height of classy. Make sure the primer you're applying on top of your makeup is specifically designed to do so.

, Concealers are used to make skin a more uniform color, hiding blemishes and deeper pockets of pores. Go for concealers that last for 12+ hours.








, What good is your makeup if using it is what's causing your clogged, larger-looking pores? Not very much good, is it? Be sure to wash your makeup off before you go to sleep. Incorporate this into your regular skin-care routine. Remember that clogged pores appear bigger than unclogged pores.









If you're the type who sometimes skips washing right before bed, grab yourself some makeup remover wipes — or better yet, make yourself some — and stash them close to your bed so that you can use them in a pinch.

Drink plenty of water throughout the day.,
Pay attention to your diet.,
For a quick fix, apply an ice cube to pores in order to shrink them.",How to Make Your Pores Smaller3," Water is the lifeblood of your organs: they need it to stay alive and look healthy. Some doctors recommend drinking at least 2 liters (0.5 US gal) of water a day, while others recommend that you drink water whenever you're thirsty or parched. Drinking water — and cutting sugary soft drinks, juices, and energy drinks from your regimen — may help your pores look smaller.

, Although there hasn't been a proven scientific link yet, many people believe that unhealthy diets can contribute to larger pores. That's because poor diets can contribute to excessive sebum production, which gets caught in pores and keeps them from looking lovely and lithe.

, We learned earlier that ice can shrink pores by constricting blood vessels and tightening the surrounding skin. If you're in a pinch and need visibly smaller pores for a short period of time, try this trick.

Drink enough water.",How to Look More Pale Without Makeup1," Lemon juice is one of the best-known and most effective lightening and bleaching ingredients. Many use lemon to lighten hair, but it also is effective in lightening the tone of your skin.To prepare the lemon juice, squeeze several small lemons into a small bowl. Prepare your skin by washing your face and any other parts of your body that you wish to be paler with a gentle face or body wash. Apply the lemon juice to your face or other parts of your body by brushing on the lemon juice with a large clean brush or by dabbing the mixture on with a paper towel.
Let the lemon juice sit on your skin for 20 minutes, then wash it off with cool water.
For an especially effective lightener, keep the lemon juice on overnight and then wash it off in the morning.;
, Tomato is also a natural lightening agent that has several other health benefits, among which is the reduction of oil production to prevent acne.To create a tomato mask, mash a tomato in a large bowl with a potato masher until it is a pulpy liquid, then squeeze the juice of one lemon into the tomato mixture and stir. Wash your face and/or body with a gentle face or body wash and pat them dry. Then use a pastry brush or paper towel to apply a layer of the tomato honey mixture on your skin.
Wait a few minutes until the layer is dry, then apply another layer of the pulp. Leave the mask on for 20 minutes, then wash it off with cool water.
Tomato is a very mild ingredient, so you can use this mask multiple times a week.

, A milk mask is a very mild and nourishing skin treatment that also can give you a paler skin tone if used several times a week. Before using the mask, clean your face with a gentle cleanser and pat it dry.Pat milk on your face as well as any other parts of your body that you want to be paler. Massage the milk into your skin until it dries, then rinse it off with cool water.
To make this mask more effective, mash potatoes into a paste, either in a food processor or with a potato masher. Then add one part mashed potato to two parts milk and pat the mask into your face.
Use sugarless milk rather than milk with added sugar.

, Honey and cinnamon are two ingredients that are excellent for your skin. Although this paste can be sticky, it gives your skin a healthy and luminous glow by removing dead skin cells and moisturizing.To make honey-cinnamon paste, add a teaspoon (4.9 ml) of ground cinnamon to a tablespoon (14.78 ml) of honey and mix. Then spread the paste on your face and let it sit for about 20 minutes. Wash the paste off your face with water, or a gentle face wash if necessary.
You can also add a pinch of nutmeg, which helps to exfoliate.

, Vitamin C battles free radicals that can age and darken skin pigmentation, and it also helps to get rid of dead skin cells to expose the lighter and brighter skin cells below.Foods rich in Vitamin C include strawberries, tomatoes, cantaloupes, green peas and sweet peppers.
Getting more Vitamin C every day won’t make as big of an impact on your skin as regularly applying skin masks, but it will make a difference over time and has numerous other health benefits.

, Drinking water helps to flush out your skin to brighten and renew it. It can also rejuvenate your skin after getting a tan so that the pigmented layer of skin fades faster. Aim to drink at least eight glasses of water a day to keep your skin radiant and healthy."

Wash your face daily with a mild cleanser.,

Choose products made for sensitive skin and try them one at a time.,
Use only gentle exfoliates.",How to Take Care of Pale Skin1," If you have extra sensitive skin, or any time your skin becomes irritated, wash it only once a day with a basic cleanser. Use gentle makeup remover wipes or micellar water to wipe off makeup and dirt for your second cleansing routine.Use cleanser in the morning or night, whichever works best for your schedule and skin.
Micellar water, used by French women for years, is enriched with micelles, molecules that literally eat up dirt and oil, and is extremely gentle.;
,""Fixing"" sun-damaged skin with after-sun products containing antioxidants is not nearly as effective as applying antioxidants along with sunscreen.
Almost all moisturizers today contain some level of SPF protection. If your favorite brand only has SPF 15, though, you also need to apply a sunscreen with SPF 30 either before moisturizer or after makeup.Make your own moisturizer with a cucumber and honey. Cucumber juice is excellent for your skin. Mash a cucumber, mix with honey, and apply directly to skin.Remember this doesn't offer any sun protection, so you should apply an SPF lotion as well.

, A thick moisturizer will help replace antioxidants lost throughout the day while you sleep. Look for one made for your skin type, whether oily, dry or a combination of the two.You don’t have to spend big bucks to get a good face cream. Neutrogena and Cetaphil work just as well as pricier designer brands.Avoid anti-aging night creams and other products that claim to defy aging. They are usually too harsh for fair, sensitive skin and are unnecessary if you take care of your skin in the first place., All fair skin is not equal, and a product that works great for your friend or sister may react differently with your skin.If products for regular skin are causing redness or irritation, switch to using only sensitive skin formulas. Trying out new products one at a time ensures you will know the cause of any irritation that occurs.


If any products you use cause redness, blotchiness, or puffing, discontinue immediately.
Many retailers will allow you to return or exchange products even if they are open, so you don't waste money trying to find a great one for your skin. Check store policies before purchasing anything pricey.
Look online for product reviews before you buy. Do an online search by product name and check out makeup and skincare blogs, and/or fashion magazine websites.

, Sensitive skin can't take harsh treatments at all, and fair skin is more likely to become sensitive if you use these products often. Try using exfoliating products without granules or gritty additives — try face peels or exfoliating gels instead. These contain ingredients that draw dirt and oil out of your skin without having to scrub.Make your own exfoliating mask with strawberries or papaya mixed with yogurt, water or oil. Fruits contain antioxidants that eat up dirt and dead cells. Don't leave this mixture on your face for longer than 10 minutes, though.You can also mix organic sugar with honey, or use oatmeal instead of sugar for a gentler mask. Rub on face gently in small circles and rinse off with warm water.Always avoid products with very rough ingredients like nut shells or seed pods. These sharp fragments are too harsh for any skin type.

Limit your time in the sun.,
Wear sunscreen every day.,
Wash and exfoliate your skin regularly.,
Don’t smoke cigarettes.",How to Look More Pale Without Makeup2," The best way to become paler is also the most intuitive: limiting your time in the sun to protect your skin and avoid tanning. Instead of all together avoiding going outside on sunny days, instead try to spend your time in the shade, or else wear protective clothing like sunglasses and a sunhat if you are going to be in direct sunlight.Don’t completely avoid the sun. Sunlight is a vital source of Vitamin D, which has numerous and invaluable health benefits. A good 10-20 minutes in the sun (wearing sunblock) is enough to get your daily dose of Vitamin D.

, In addition to avoiding direct sunlight, wearing sunscreen is also an essential part of protecting your skin from the sun. Wear at least SPF 30, preferably a formula that contain zinc and titanium dioxide, which directly block both UVA and UVB rays and begin working as soon as you put them on your skin. Since sunscreen is white, it may also you’re your skin look paler, even when it is completely rubbed in.Wear sunblock every day on your face and any other parts of your body that will be exposed to the sun. Use water-resistant sunblock if you are going to be swimming.
While you are in direct sunlight, reapply sunblock every two hours.
To apply sunblock, use at least a quarter-sized amount on your face and any other exposed parts of your body. Rub the sunblock fully into your skin to ensure that it will work properly., Another important way to promote pale and luminous skin is to wash your face in the morning and before bed. Washing your face properly and consistently removes oil and dirt from the surface of your skin, making your complexion lighter and more radiant.Try to use a face wash with lemon or Aloe Vera extract, which both have deep cleansing properties.
Once a week, use an exfoliating face wash along with a textured cloth or a loofa. Gently scrub your skin in circular motions to remove excess dead and dry skin cells from the surface of your skin. Don’t exfoliate more than once a week, as it can be harsh on your skin to over-exfoliate.
Moisturize your face every time after washing it, making sure to use a sheer moisturizer rather than a tinted moisturizer.
Apply sunblock after using moisturizer, or use a moisturizing sunblock that is at least SPF 30.

, Not only does smoking have a negative effect on your health, it can also dramatically alter the appearance of your skin. Smoking can cause premature aging of the skin, as well as breakouts and sallowness from a loss of natural “glow.” Consider quitting or cutting back your smoking if you are a regular smoker."
"
Wear dark clothing.,
Dye your hair a dark color.,
Wear dark contacts.",How to Look More Pale Without Makeup3," An easy way to make yourself appear paler is to wear black clothing or other dark colors. Dark clothing creates contrast so that your skin looks lighter by comparison. It’s an easy way to instantly look paler and more dramatic.

, If you are willing to dramatically change your appearance, dying your hair a dark brown or black, or even a deep maroon or purple, will make your skin look paler. Because your hair frames your face, a dark hair color provides the perfect backdrop to make your face look paler by comparison., It's well known that wearing black or brown eyeliner helps to emphasize eye and skin contrast, but if you don’t want to wear makeup, wearing colored contacts can also be a good solution. If you have blue eyes, consider wearing brown contact lenses to heighten contrast and make your skin appear paler."
"
Wear a broad-spectrum sunscreen with at least SPF 30 every day.,
Use a sunscreen with SPF 50 when spending extended time in the sun.,
Wear a wide-brimmed hat and wrap-around sunglasses.,
Don’t avoid the sun completely.,
Avoid tanning and use self-tanners instead.",How to Take Care of Pale Skin2," Pale skin has less melanin, the component that prevents skin from being burnt by the sun's rays, and is therefore highly susceptible to sun damage and skin cancer. If your moisturizer does not have any SPF protection, or has less than SPF 30, get a lightweight sunscreen to apply every morning, even during winter and on cloudy days. Make sure the product states that it protects against both UVA and UVB rays.Clouds don't provide protection from the sun. About 80% of the sun's rays can penetrate cloud cover.Always wear sun protection, no matter what your plans for the day may be. Pale skin can burn in as little as an hour., If you will be outside for extended periods on sunny days or between 11 and 4, when the sun’s rays are strongest, you need SPF 50.Apply at least 20 minutes before going outside and reapply every two hours.Make sure to check the expiration date. Sunscreens have a shelf life of two to three years.Sunscreens claiming to contain SPF 100+ are both unnecessary and provide no more protection than SPF 50., In addition to your sunscreen, wearing a hat with a wide brim can keep your face and neck from absorbing too many UV rays. Wrap style sunglasses protect your eyes from damage and the skin around them from wrinkling due to squinting. If you are at the beach, fishing, watching an outside sports game in the sun, etc., you should always wear a hat and sunglasses.Baseball caps do not protect your neck.
Fair skinned people especially need to wear sunscreen in addition to (not instead of) a hat and glasses.

, Your body needs some sun exposure to make vitamin D. Spend about 20 minutes in the sun two to three times a week in summer. Wear short sleeves and let your face get some exposure.


Sunscreen blocks UVB rays, which are necessary to synthesize vitamin D; however, most people do not use enough sunscreen to completely block UVB rays. You should still wear sunscreen when you are outside, even when you're stepping out to make some vitamin D.Fair-skinned people might be unable to get enough sun exposure for the body to create sufficient vitamin D without burning. Taking supplements and eating more foods like fish and eggs can bridge the gap.

, Tans are literally evidence of skin damage and are not healthy for anyone.Tanning beds are just as dangerous as sun exposure, if not more so. Instead, use self-tanners or bronzers to achieve a tanned look.


Just one trip to a tanning bed before age 35 may increase your risk of melanoma by 59%, and the risk increases with each use.Bronzers are like makeup since they can be washed off. Self-tanners give skin the appearance of a tan without the UV damage.
Fair skin is extremely susceptible to sun damage since it doesn’t contain enough melanin to turn cells dark easily. Therefore, you are more likely to burn than tan anyway.Tanning also causes premature aging through wrinkles and sunspots.

Accept your freckles.,
Don’t smoke.",How to Take Care of Pale Skin3," They can help you deal with specific skin issues like acne and blotchiness, and also monitor your skin for signs of cancer.Avoid ones that try to sell you their own skincare products or one brand they “recommend.” Most dermatologists learn about skin care from cosmetics companies, not from school.
People with fairer skin often have a genetic predisposition to developing moles, regardless of how well they protect their skin from the sun. Sun exposure will create more or bigger moles, but in addition to wearing sunscreen every day, see a dermatologist to help keep track of any you already have., Picking out colors and shades of makeup for pale skin is easy if you follow a few general rules. Only accentuate one feature at a time: either your eyes or your lips; not both! Beware of dark or very brightly colored eye shadows since they may overshadow your gorgeous skin or wash you out. Always make sure your foundation, if you wear one, matches your skin.Stick with metallic or shimmery shades for eye shadow: bronze or earth tones if your skin has warm undertones, and gold, silvery, or jewel shades for cool undertones. Determining your skin tone is easy.
Wear brown eyeliner instead of black. It may be too drastic for light skin.
Wear pink or rose colored blush, and be careful if adding bronzer not to overdo it. These should accentuate your natural face, not look like you added makeup.
If your eyes are very neutral, consider a bright red lipstick (bluish red for cool undertones, orange-red for warm undertones). If you are accentuating your eyes, stick with a more neutral tone like pink, peach or rose.

, Many people with pale skin also have lots of freckles, whether born with them or gaining them yearly from sun exposure.The only way to really get rid of freckles is laser treatments, which can be expensive. Instead of trying to work around your freckles, work with them by choosing makeup that accentuates them.Never leave the house without sunscreen to prevent getting more freckles, even if you have had them removed previously.
Avoid thick foundation and use tinted moisturizer instead.
Stick with peachy or coral blush to accentuate your freckles.

, If you do, quit. Smoking accelerates aging, causing wrinkles in women as young as 20. It also dries and thickens your skin, leading to a leathery texture and appearance."

Don’t go outside in the heat of the day.,
Eat fruits and veggies.,
Exfoliate your skin.,
Find a good skin care routine.,
Don't use harsh face products.,
Stop smoking.",How to Maintain a Pale Complexion," Sunscreen should be applied every day, regardless of the time of year. SPF 15 or above is recommended. In case you’re uncertain as to which type of SPF you need, remember that the number of SPF helps to determine how long the product will be effective in protecting you before having to reapply it. In other words, it helps you to figure out how long you can stay in the sun without burning.In order to determine the effectiveness of an SPF on your skin, take the SPF number (for example, 15) and multiply that by the time it takes your skin to burn. If your skin burns in 30 minutes and you apply SPF 10, you’ll be protected for 300 minutes.
Makeup is not a substitute for sunscreen. In fact, wearing too much makeup may contribute to skin damage and a poor complexion. Therefore, it's best to avoid heavy makeup when possible.Be sure to reapply your sunscreen, particularly if you are in the water. Use the calculation from above to determine how often you need to reapply, but a general rule of thumb is every 3-4 hours.;
, Wear wide-brimmed hats to protect your face and neck, as these are the areas most commonly affected by sun damage.It’s important to note that hats should be worn along with and not in lieu of, sunscreen.


While men may be inclined to protect themselves with baseball hats, it's important to note their lack of effectiveness in protecting the neck, lower face and ears.Consider a cotton neck protector. They can be worn under baseball hats if you don’t have an alternative hat to wear. Neck protectors are inexpensive to purchase and can be found at most major retail stores.

, Sun rays are particularly strong between 10:00 AM and 4:00 PM, regardless of whether it's a cloudy/hazy day or a bright, sunny one.Try to plan your outdoor activities for the morning and evening times. You should still wear sunscreen though, regardless of whether you’re out and about during peak times!
If you do need to be outside during the day, find shady spots. If you’re going to the beach where there’s not a lot of shade, bring an umbrella to sit under.

, Fruits such as apples, guavas, pears and peaches may positively affect your skin color, so feel free to eat them in order to maintain your pale skin.Anything that is rich in vitamins and minerals helps give skin that healthy glow, so eat up!


Aim for a rainbow of colors when it comes to fruit and vegetables and try to eat at least five portions a day., Despite cleansing, moisturizing, and applying sunscreen, your skin may not be as healthy as it could be if you forget to exfoliate.There are many different ways to exfoliate, from at home scrubs, to professional services that don’t require scrubbing. Choose what works for you based on your skin type.


If your skin is extremely sensitive it may make sense to consult a professional. Otherwise, you should be able to use a scrub at home.
Always read the directions carefully and do not scrub your face hard.
Try exfoliating your skin once a week if you’re doing it at home. If you’ve chosen to consult a professional, ask them how often you should be exfoliating.

, In addition to exfoliating, find a nightly skin care routine that works for you. This includes washing your face with a mild cleanser and then applying moisturizer.


Regardless of your skin type, get in the habit of moisturizing after washing your face. This helps to improve skin tone and texture and can cover imperfections.Moisturizers can vary, so find one that works for your particular skin tone. It is beneficial to find one that has an SPF, but again, products aren't a substitute for sunscreen!

, Pale skin tends to be rather sensitive, so do your best to avoid using harsh products, which contain ingredients such as salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide.There are healthy, natural alternatives you can try. Raw honey is one option. In addition to containing anti-bacterial and probiotic properties, honey helps to reduce breakouts and prevent new ones by removing dirt and impurities., In addition to being bad for your overall health, smoking has a negative effect on your skin, as it may take on an orange or grey hue.Therefore, if you’re trying to maintain a pale complexion, smoking will have an adverse effect on your efforts.


Smoking negatively impacts the condition of the skin as well. By continuing to smoke, you may develop skin conditions such as psoriasis, which gives your skin a scaly quality."

If you’re having trouble figuring out which foundation might look best on you, ask one of the salespeople to help -- they often are very experienced., For the foundation to look its best and spread properly, your skin must be clean. Use whatever you typically use to wash your face, making sure that it’s gentle on your skin., This makes a base for the foundation. If your face is not moisturized, makeup can dry out your skin. Moisturizer is also a great way to protect your face -- many moisturizers include sunscreen., Since you’re going a shade darker than normal, you will need to make sure that it looks natural on every part of your face.

If you want lighter skin, you have to care for it properly, using a sunscreen with a high Sun Protection Factor (SPF) rating.









When you expose your skin to UVA and UVB light, your body produces melanin which makes your skin appear darker. Therefore, the number one most important thing you can do to lighten your skin is to wear sunscreen every day you'll be outdoors, even when it's not super-hot or sunny.
You can also protect your skin by wearing light, long-sleeved clothing and by wearing a hat and sunglasses when you're in the sun for long periods of time.;
, Taking good care of your skin involves following a strict skincare routine where skin is properly cleansed, exfoliated and moisturized.









Thoroughly cleanse your face twice a day, once in the morning and once at night. This removes dirt and oil, which is important for a healthy, clear complexion.
Moisturize with a product suited to your skin type. If you have oily or blemish prone skin, you should go for light lotions, while people with very dry skin should go for heavier creams.
Exfoliate a couple of times a week. This is important as it removes the darker, dead skin cells and reveals the new, lighter skin beneath. You can exfoliate using a product containing small particles, or by gently rubbing your face with a clean, damp washcloth.

, Drinking water and eating right won't magically make your skin lighter, but it will help skin to rejuvenate itself.


When skin rejuvenates, the old, pigmented layers fade away and fresh, new skin is revealed, leaving your skin looking brighter and healthier. Drinking more water speeds up this process, so you try to drink between six and eight glasses a day.
A good diet also helps to keep your skin looking fresh and healthy by providing it with the vitamins and nutrients it needs. Try to eat as much fresh fruit and vegetables as possible (especially those high in vitamins A, C and E) and stay away from processed, high-calorie foods.
You should also consider taking a vitamin supplement containing ingredients such as Grapeseed Extract (which provides anti-oxident benefits) and Flaxseed or Fish oil, both of which contain Omega-3 and are excellent for hair, skin and nails.

, Everyone knows that smoking is bad for your health, but not everyone is aware of the damage it can do to your skin. Smoking contributes to premature aging, causing fine lines and wrinkles. It also prevents blood flow to the face, causing it to become ashen or grey-looking.

Choose your bronzer or blush color.,
Select a bronzer that works for your skin type.,
Apply bronzer with a big brush.",How to Look Less Pale2," Don’t use a bronzer that is more than one skin tone darker than your own. Check carefully when buying it at the store and test out a few on your face to see which color will work best for you. Avoid bronzers with orange tints -- these typically do not look good on pale skin. Go for bronzers that lean toward brown., Different products work well for oily, combination, and dry skins. Using testers, check at the store which products feel and spread best on your skin. Bronzers are supposed to add a healthy-looking shine to your skin, and can be very useful for making pale skin appear slightly darker. (They are not designed to make your skin look bronze, despite their name.), After getting some on the brush, tap off any excess before applying. Focus on your temples and cheekbones. Use only a little on your nose and chin, and blend a little on your neck."
"
Choose a self-tanning product that appeals to you.,
Find the best shade for your skin.,
Exfoliate.,
Prepare your skin for the self-tanner.,
Apply the self-tanner in sections.,
Pay attention to your wrists, ankles, knees, and elbows.,
Stay dry and cool.",How to Look Less Pale3," There are a number of products that are designed to give you a tanned look without the risk of UV exposure. Self-tanners come in an array of forms, from sprays and lotions to gels and serums. Read the instructions on each product to make sure that it will do what you want. At the makeup counter, try a little on your skin to determine which will be most comfortable on your skin., Pale skin does not work well with the orange tint of many self-tanners, so look for a product that is more golden. Gradual tanning products also work well with pale skin, since they just add a hint of color. Again, try each product at the store before committing to it., Use a wet washcloth to slough off any dry skin on any of the areas that you will be applying the self-tanner. This will allow you to spread the product easily and your skin will absorb it evenly. Pay special attention to knees and elbows, that often have drier, tougher skin., Pat it dry with a towel. Apply moisturizer evenly over the areas you will be applying the self-tanner. Use more on those areas with drier skin, like your knees and elbows. Try to use moisturizer with sunscreen -- self-tanners typically do not help protect your skin from the sun’s harmful rays.

, By dividing your skin into sections (face, arms, torso, legs), you can wash your hands in between so your palms don’t get stained. Be sure to read the instructions on your product carefully -- each one has a different set of guidelines, depending on its form.

, Your wrist and ankle joints will require more blending. Move your hands and feet back and forth on your joints to make sure you have all of the skin covered. Your knees and elbows will require less self-tanner because they absorb more product than other parts of your skin. You can dilute the self-tanner (check to see how on your particular product) or put lotion on top of the self-tanner., Give your skin time to absorb the self-tanner. Wearing loose clothing and staying out of the sun (and situations where you might sweat) will give your skin the best chance to get an even color. After a few hours, your self-tanner should be completely absorbed.

"
"
Do not wear strong colors.,
Avoid oranges in both clothing and hair color.,
Choose shades of blonde or light brown for your hair.",How to Look Less Pale4," Pale skin can look even paler when paired with deep colors. Try lighter, softer shades to make your skin look less pale. Some good choices might be:Pale pink
Peach
Ivory
Light yellow

, Most people with pale skin do not have orange undertones, and the color is often very unflattering to those with pale skin. It’s a strong color that essentially clashes with your skin color.

, These light shades will complement your fair skin. Hair colors with golden or orange undertones are not going to be flattering (and will probably make you look even paler)."
"
Purchase a tanning light for your home.,
Use a tanning bed.,
Go sunbathing.",How to Look Less Pale5," Though these are a fast way to give your skin some color, the UV rays from the light are harmful for your skin. The FDA and major cancer organizations caution against tanning in this way because of the risk of skin cancer., Even though this might seem like an easy and quick solution, the World Health Organization and other medical research groups caution against their use. Tanning beds are linked to an increased risk of skin cancer. The UV rays emitted by the sunlamps can cause skin cancer., Again, the risk of skin cancer is high for those who sit outside in the sun’s UV rays without proper protection. Pale skin is also typically more prone to sunburn, which increases the risk of melanoma."
"
Try a skin lightening cream.,
Use retinoids.,
Get a chemical peel.,
Try microdermabrasion.",How to Lighten Your Skin2," There are an abundance of skin lightening creams available over-the-counter. They all work by reducing melanin (the pigment which causes tanning and sun spots) in the skin.









Look for products containing effective skin-lightening ingredients such as kojic acid, glycolic acid, alpha hydroxy acids, vitamin C or arbutin.
These products tend to be pretty safe to use, but be sure to follow the directions on the packaging and to stop immediately if your skin has a bad reaction.
Never use a skin lightening cream which contains mercury as the active ingredient. Mercury-based skin creams are banned in the US, but are still available in other parts of the world.

, Retinoid creams are made from an acidic form of Vitamin A and can effectively lighten skin through exfoliating the skin and speeding up cell turnover.









Not only do retinoid creams lighten skin and clear discoloration, they are also highly effective at smoothing out fine lines and wrinkles, plumping up the skin and making it look brighter and younger. In higher concentrations, it can also help to clear acne.
Retinoid creams can cause dryness, redness and flakiness at first, but these symptoms should subside once your skin gets used to the product. Retinoids also make your skin more sensitive to sunlight, so you should only apply them at night and be sure to wear sunscreen during the day.
Retinoids are only available with a prescription, so you should make an appointment with your dermatologist if you are interested in pursuing this treatment. However, a less potent version of retinoid cream, known as retinol, is available in many over-the-counter beauty products., Chemical peels can be very effective at lightening the skin. They work by burning away the top layers of skin which are highly pigmented or discolored, revealing the fresher, lighter-colored skin underneath.









With a chemical peel, an acidic substance (such as alpha hydroxy acid) is applied to the skin and left to sit for 5 to 10 minutes. The peel may cause a tingling, stinging or burning sensation on the skin can often leave it looking red or swollen for a couple of days afterwards.
A series of chemical peels (done 2 to 4 weeks apart) is usually recommended. During this time it is important to avoid the sun and to be vigilant about wearing sunscreen, as your skin is extra sensitive., Microdermabrasion is a good alternative option for people whose skin is sensitive to acid peels and creams. It essentially exfoliates or ""polishes"" the skin, removing dull, darker layers and leaving skin brighter and fresher.


During the treatment, a small closed vacuum with a rotating diamond tip is applied to the face. Dead skin cells are removed and sucked into the vacuum.
The treatment usually takes somewhere between 15 and 20 minutes, although 6 to 12 treatments may be necessary to achieve noticeable results.
Some people may experience a little redness or dryness after the treatment but, in general, microdermabrasion has fewer side effects than other treatments."

Thoroughly rinse your skin when you're done, then apply a good moisturizer as lemon juice can be very drying. Repeat this treatment 2 to 3 times a week (no more) for best results., Turmeric is an Indian spice which has been used in skin lightening treatments for thousands of years. While the effects haven't been studied, turmeric is believed to inhibit melanin production, thereby preventing the skin from becoming tanned.









Mix turmeric with some olive oil and chickpea flour to form a paste. Apply the paste to the skin using gentle circular motions. This will help to exfoliate the skin.
Leave the turmeric paste to sit on the skin for 15 to 20 minutes before rinsing off. The Turmeric may stain your skin slightly yellow, but this should quickly wear off.
Repeat this treatment once or twice a week for best results. You can also use turmeric in your Indian cooking!, Raw potato is believed to have mild bleaching properties, due to its high vitamin C content. Vitamin C is used as a lightening ingredient in many OTC skin creams. To use:


Simply cut a raw potato in half, then rub the exposed flesh over the skin you wish to lighten. Leave the potato juice to sit on the skin for 15 to 20 minutes before rinsing.
You will need to repeat this treatment several times a week in order to get any beneficial results. Instead of a potato you could use a tomato or cucumber, as both of these foods also have a high vitamin C content., Aloe vera is a very soothing substance, which can help to ease redness and fade discoloration. It is also very moisturizing on the skin, which aids skin rejuvenation.


To use aloe vera, break a leave off of an aloe vera plant and rub the gel-like sap over the skin.
Aloe vera is very gentle so it's not necessary to rinse it off, however you may prefer to remove it if it makes your skin feel sticky.

, According to some dermatologists, papaya can be used to tighten, brighten, and otherwise improve tired-looking skin. Rich in Vitamins, A, E, and C, papaya is also packed with alpha-hydroxy acids (AHA), a common ingredient in anti-aging skin formulas.While eating papaya can have many overall health benefits, if you want to use a papaya for skincare, try this:


Cut a ripe papaya into half, then remove the seeds. Add half a cup of water. Blend the papaya until it is a purée. Place the purée in a small container. Keep refrigerated. Apply it to your skin three times a week for best results.

, Hydroquinone is a highly effective skin bleaching cream which can be used to lighten large areas of skin, or to bleach sun spots and moles. Although hydroquinone is FDA-approved as a skin lightener in the US, it has been banned in large parts of Europe and Asia due to research that claimed the ingredient was a potential carcinogen. It may also cause permanent skin discoloration, so use this product with caution.


Discuss treatment with your doctor or dermatologist first. Concentrations up to 2% are available OTC, while stronger concentrations (up to 4%) require a prescription."

Look upward and place the towel just beneath your lower lashes, pressing gently for another fifteen seconds on each eye. Let your skin eye dry. Repeat if necessary.


Do not scrub your eyes or use soap.
Some people like to mix in about 1 tsp (5 mL) table salt in 1 cup (240 mL) ice water. Don't try this if you have red, irritated skin.;
, Wet a soft, fluffy cloth with ice cold water. Wring it out, then fold the cloth over your eyes for about ten minutes. The cold should constrict the blood vessels around your eyes, reducing the swelling.


You can get similar results with an ice pack or a bag of frozen peas. You can even make your own cold pack by stuffing a sock full of raw rice and tossing it in the freezer. Don't use a bag of large, chunky vegetables, since it can't mold around your eyes.

, Choose a pair of metal teaspoons that fit closely over your eyes. Freeze them for about two minutes or keep them in the fridge for 5—10 minutes. Place them over your eyes with slight pressure. Leave them until they warm up.


If you have time, freeze six spoons instead. Replace the spoons with a new, cold pair once they warm up. Stop after the third pair to avoid skin damage from prolonged cold.
You can also try adding cold teabags to your eyes to reduce puffiness.

, Lightly tap the puffy areas of your eyelids, using your ring finger. This can stimulate blood flow, moving pooled blood out of the area.

, Close your eyes and massage the upper area of your nose. Focus on the skin to the right and left of the nose, where a pair of glasses would rest. This can relieve sinus pressure, which may have built up as you were crying.

, Place two or three pillows underneath your head to keep it above the rest of your body. Lie with your neck straight, close your eyes, and relax. Even a short break can lower your blood pressure.

, Refrigerate moisturizing face cream for about ten minutes, then rub gently into skin. The cold will treat puffiness, while the cream will soften and brighten your skin.

Drink plenty of water.,
Soothe your eyes with something cold.You've probably heard that placing cucumbers over your eyes will help reduce bags, but it's actually the cool temperature that soothes the area.,
Put on some concealer.,
Use teabags.",How to Get Rid of Bags Under Your Eyes1," Under-eye bags are often caused by the retention of water due to high salt concentration in the area. You might wake up with bags after eating a salty dinner or crying; whether it's from tears or food, salt can draw water to your face and cause it to collect under your eyes.


Flush excess salt from your system by drinking water. Avoid salty foods for the rest of the day.
Stay away from drinks that cause you to become dehydrated, like coffee and alcohol.;
, Cucumbers happen to be the perfect shape, size and texture to treat under-eye bags, so go ahead and slice one up - just make sure it's been chilling in the refrigerator beforehand.


If you don't have a cucumber, wet a few teabags and chill them in the freezer or refrigerator before placing them over your eyes. Use a soothing tea, like chamomile or peppermint, so you get the benefits of aromatherapy at the same time.
Cold spoons will also work. Leave 2 spoons in the freezer overnight, and place them on your eyes for 10-15 minutes.

, In the short term, concealing under-eye bags and circles with a little makeup is the quickest and most effective solution. The right makeup can greatly reduce the appearance of bags and keep you looking fresh all day. Follow these steps to apply concealing makeup:



Choose a concealer that matches your skin tone. If your under-eye bags are dark, you could also go one shade lighter. Apply the concealer with your finger or a cotton ball. Make sure you dab it on lightly instead of rubbing it into your skin. The makeup will conceal your bags more effectively if it stays on the surface of your skin.
Follow the concealer with a brush of powder to help it set and stay in place all day. Use a matte powder (not one with shimmer) and a blush brush to apply a little powder under your eyes.

, The tannin in the teabag can sometimes help ease down under-eye bags.


Boil water and dunk two teabags into the hot water.
Bob it up and down until they are soaked through.
Remove and allow to cool on a plate. If wished, cover face, nose, eyes, with paper towel or face washers.

Use a cold washcloth instead of tea bags.,
Stay away from food remedies.,
Keep irritating medications away from eyes.",How to Get Rid of Puffy Eyes from Crying3," Many people place a cold, wet tea bag over puffy eyes. This works simply because of the cold temperature. Different practitioners swear by black tea, green tea, or various herbal varieties. Many of these have not been studied, but caffeine — the ingredient most likely to work — seems to have no effect.A washcloth is probably just as effective and has a lower risk of bacterial infection.

, Cucumber slices are one of the most common treatments for puffy eyes. This is effective, but only because of the cucumber's cool temperature. It's best to use a cold washcloth or ice pack to reduce the chance of bacterial infection from food.


If you do use a food treatment, rinsed cucumber is probably one of the safest. Stay away from potatoes, egg whites, yogurt, and acidic food such as strawberries or lemon juice.

, Some home remedies are dangerous to use around your eyes, due to the risk of severe pain or damage. Do not treat puffy eyes with hemorrhoid cream (Preparation H), heat rubs (BenGay, Icy Hot), or hydrocortisone."

Use eye shadow to make your eyes look bigger.,
Shape your eyebrows.,
Use an eyelash curler.,
Thicken your lashes with mascara.,
Wear fake eyelashes.",How to Get Beautiful Eyes1," Concealer is a base foundation that can offset the color of a dark circle under your eye. Choose a color of concealer that has opposite tones of color from the tones that are in your dark circles. For example, if your dark circles have yellow tones, use a concealer with a purple tone. This will help neutralize the dark color under your eyes. Alternately, you can choose a concealer that is one skin tone lighter than your own skin tone. Gently dab the concealer under your eyes and tap at it with your finger, blending it across the skin under your eyes to make sure it is not noticeable. If you aren't able to buy concealer you can make your own by mixing equal parts of lotion and a powder that suits your skin colour then apply it.





;
, Using a dark eyeliner, draw a line about halfway or two-thirds across both the bottom and top of the eye, right along the lash line. Drawing all the way across your eye to the inner corner will make your eye look smaller. Eyeliner that is applied about halfway across will help make the eye look elongated. Draw back and forth across the lash line with your eyeliner pencil a few times.








Try a light-colored eyeliner. By using a light eyeliner or even white eyeliner, your eyes will attract and reflect light, which will help make it seem like your eyes are larger. Line the bottom lash line with a white or silver eyeliner. Your eyes will reflect more light, and your eyes will give the illusion of being brighter and wider.You can also use a white eyeliner pencil to line the inner corner of your eye on the top and bottom lids. This will help make your eyes look further apart., You can accomplish this by using three different shades of eye shadow: light, medium and dark. Use the light colored shadow on the lid and brow bone, and apply medium colored shadow in the crease of your eye. Use a dark shadow or eyeliner along your lash line. Then add a shimmery colored shadow in the corners of your eyes, which will attract and reflect light.








If you wear glasses, think about how your glasses look with your eye makeup. A general rule of thumb is to wear bolder, brighter eye colors with lightweight, transparent frames. If you wear heavier frames, think about toning down your eye makeup., Your eyebrows are frames for your eyes, and their shape can make your eyes appear to be certain shapes as well. Pluck, thread or wax your eyebrows to give them shape.Remove stray hairs regularly, but be careful not to overpluck your brows. Or, you can use an eyebrow pencil to fill in your eyebrows, especially if they are thin, light, or irregularly shaped.Use an eyebrow gel in your natural color to seal your eyebrows so they don’t smudge.








, An eyelash curler, which is readily available at drug stores and grocery stores for about $5 to $6, will clamp your eyelashes and bend them upwards in a curl. Curling your lashes upward will make your eyes appear to be bigger and more open. They can also draw attention to your eyes by making your eyelashes appear longer., 







, Use a thick mascara that coats your lashes thoroughly. There are many different kinds of mascara, from thickening to lengthening to waterproof. Try out a few different kinds to see how they look with your eyes. Get close to the roots of your lashes, applying mascara at the lash line. Try a fan brushor a brush that is curved, which will apply the mascara closer to the roots on all of your lashes. Or, try holding a business card above your lashes as you apply and brush the mascara into your lashes against the card. 







, If your eyelashes are short or you would like an especially dramatic look, attach fake eyelashes. Also known as “falsies,” these are available in various lengths, colors and textures, and can transform your eyes into something spectacular.

If all else fails, use a skin-lightening cream.",How to Have Light Skin2," This helps remove the outermost layer of skin that is darkened and/or damaged by contact with the sun. Avoid over-exfoliating, however, as this can interfere with you skin’s natural oil production and cause greasiness.


One cheap and effective homemade exfoliant is brown sugar mixed with honey. On its own, honey can make skin feel remarkably soft; coupled with the gritty sugar texture, the two make for a very effective scrub. As a bonus, honey is an antibacterial agentthat can help keep you from breaking out.

, By scattering light, the powder will not only make your skin appear brighter, but also even out blemishes.


Baby powder can do this, too. It's light enough to fill in your pores like a powder foundation, but heavy (and white) enough to subtly affect your skin tone. Make sure not to apply too much, though, or you'll end up looking like an 18th-century Geisha.

, Be forewarned, however, that hydroquinone – the active ingredient in many bleaching creams – has been banned in many countries due to studies suggesting that it is carcinogenic.


Bearberry (Beta-Arbutin) and kojic acid are also recent trends in skin lightening. However, recently bearberry has been linked to hydroquinone and has also been deemed unsafe; kojic acid, on the other hand, has passed its tests. Used at levels of 2% (no higher) in cosmetic products, it's safe. Note: in lab testing, skin lightening results were seen at 4%."

Treat your allergies.,
Change your sleeping position.People who sleep on their stomachs or sides have a greater chance of waking up with under-eye bags, since these positions allow fluid to collect under the eyes during the night.,
Treat your face gently.,
Change your dietary habits.",How to Get Rid of Bags Under Your Eyes2," Under-eye bags are often the result of allergies that lead to inflammation in the face.Since the skin around your eyes is thinner than skin on the rest of your body, fluid tends to collect there and puff out the skin.


Use an allergy medication to treat hay fever and other seasonal allergies. Try an over-the-counter medicine or get a prescription from your doctor.
Avoid spending time near allergy sources, like flowers, dust or animals. Make sure your house is well-vacuumed and wash your linens frequently.

, Side sleepers may actually notice that the eye on the side they sleep on has a larger bag than the eye on the other side.


Try gradually sleeping on your back more often than your stomach or side. It's not easy to change sleeping positions, so you may have a little difficulty getting used to it at first. You can try adding pillows to your sides to make it easier to sleep on your back.
Use a second pillow under your head if you're a back sleeper. With your head at a slightly downward angle, fluid won't collect under your eyes at night.

, Since facial skin, and especially under-eye skin, is thin and fragile, it's easy to damage it and make it weaker, which leads to even bigger bags. Use the following methods to start treating your under-eye skin with more care:



Don't go to sleep wearing makeup. Wearing makeup to bed is one of the most common things to do that causes eye bags. The chemicals in makeup can irritate your eyes at night. Washing your face before going to sleep is an important part of good facial hygiene.
Be sure to wash off any makeup before bed. Mascara and eyeliner can smudge overnight, making circles look darker. Use a good eye makeup remover to gently wipe away makeup, then splash your face with water a few times and pat it dry with a soft towel. Be gentle – too much scrubbing can weaken skin around the eyes.
Moisturize your face every night. Making sure your face, and especially your eye area, gets enough moisture helps the skin retain elasticity and strength. Use a face moisturizing lotion or oil every night before bed.
Use sunscreen every day. The sun's rays can cause the thin skin around your eyes to become even more fragile. Make sure you protect your skin there every day, even during the winter.

, A salty dinner paired with a few cocktails is fine every once in a while, but if you make a daily habit of eating salt and drinking alcohol, it can have a long-term effect on your eye bags. Years of water retention in the facial area can lead to permanently stretched-out bags. To prevent this from happening to you, try making the following changes:



Reduce the amount of salt you use in everyday cooking. Try cutting it in half or cutting it out entirely - you'd be surprised how flavorful food can be without the addition of a lot of salt. Try cutting back the salt you use in baked goods and avoiding salt altogether at dinnertime, since your body won't have time to balance things out before you sleep.
Drink less alcohol. Drinking alcohol causes water retention, so the less you drink, the less puffy your under-eye bags will look in the morning. On the nights when you do drink, follow each drink with an equal amount of water. Try to stop drinking early in the evening rather than having your last one just before bed.

Fillers usually cost several hundred dollars, and can lead to negative side effects like bruising and swelling.

, As people age, fat deposits move down from the eyeballs and accumulate in the under-eye area, leading to bags. Blepharoplasty is the process of removing or changing the position of the fat that has accumulated, followed by a laser treatment to tighten the skin in the area.Blepharoplasty procedures usually cost between $2,000 and $5,000 dollars.

Massage olive oil into your skin.,
Steam.,
Exfoliate.",How to Use Olive Oil to Remove Scars1," The most common way to use olive oil to remove scars is to simply massage it into your skin. Use only a drop or so of olive oil and apply it to troublesome areas.


Move your finger tips in small circles to massage the oil into scarred skin. Use deep pressure and massage for 4 to 5 minutes.
Once your skin's pores absorb some of the olive oil, use a clean paper towel to wipe the excess oil off your skin.
Repeat this process again. When you finish for the second time, let the oil sit on your skin for 15 to 20 minutes.
Do this twice a day and see if you see any improvement.;

Facial steams are fairly easy to do at home with only a few supplies and they work by opening the pores to release sweat and debris. This can help the overall health of skin and lessen the appearance of scars.


Put a pot of water on the stove and wait for it to steam. Do not allow the water to get so hot it's boiling, however, as this can burn your skin. Just wait until it's producing steam.
Add a few drops of olive oil to the water and stir. Wrap a towel around your head and lean over the pot. Keep your face about 18 inches away from the water. Any closer could cause discomfort.
Stand over the steam for 8 to 10 minutes. Then, remove the towel and wipe off your face, neck, and shoulders.

Rub for about 3 to 4 minutes. Then, use a wet cloth to wipe the mixture from your face.

Dark spots: these types of marks are not actually scars, but a type of post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, usually caused by mosquito or other insect bites.;
, You should begin treating your scar - with a suitable cream or other treatment - as soon as the wound has completely healed. Most scar treatments will be much more effective on newer scars than on old ones, thus saving you time and money down the road.

, Most scars will eventually disappear on their own as skin rejuvenates itself - shedding old layers of skin and growing new ones. You can help this process along by exfoliating your skin regularly in the shower, using a body scrub or a bristled brush.

, This is one often overlooked piece of advice that can significantly reduce the appearance of scars. What many people fail to realize is that new scars are extremely sensitive to UVA rays, and exposure to sunlight can cause them to become much darker than they would be otherwise. By applying a sunscreen of at least SPF 30 to newly scarred skin, you can significantly minimize discoloration.

, Regularly massaging your legs can help to break down the fibrous tissue which causes scarring. It also improves circulation which can aid with discoloration. Your can massage legs in the shower using a body brush, or you can use your hands to rub each leg using long, circular strokes.

, A good concealer can do wonders to hide scars on the legs. Make sure to get a concealer that matches your skin tone, and that you blend it in well with the surrounding skin. A waterproof concealer is best if you will be exposing your legs to unpredictable weather conditions, and theatrical make-up (which is much thicker than regular make-up) can work wonders for those with particularly bad scars.

Silicone will not make your scar disappear, but it will reduce scar thickness, discoloration, and discomfort.Fully evaluate the silicon/silicone toxicity studies and associated problemsbefore pursuing this avenue. You are likely to experience side effects from this treatment, some of which might reduce your quality of life.

, Keeping a scar covered and hydrated will help it heal. Massage recent scars with oil or moisturizer twice a day for about a minute. Massage helps reorganize immature collagen bundles that form while the skin is scarring. Do not massage or apply oil to an unhealed wound. Ask your dermatologist to recommend the right lotion or cream products for your skin.


Opt for an inexpensive substance such as olive oil or petroleum jelly.
Avoid expensive skin treatments such as lotions that boast cocoa butter or vitamin E, as their effectiveness has not been scientifically proven.
No over the counter lotion has been shown to be as effective as silicone sheets.
Wearing oil on your skin may promote acne. Speak to your dermatologist or doctor about the best skincare routine for your type of skin.

If you are prone to acne, you may want to use a brush or sponge to apply your makeup. Clean your brushes and sponges at least twice a week.
You can use primer with SPF for added protection from the sun.
Match concealer to your skin tone. Concealer that is too light or dark will highlight your scars. Mix two shades of concealer if you cannot find one that matches your skin.
If you are trying to hide hyperpigmentation, try applying a green concealer, or another color that contrasts with the discoloration. Cover well with foundation.

, Buy a microdermabrasion kit, or skincare kit that includes microdermabrasion. These kits are less expensive and less intensive than being resurfaced by a dermatologist. If your scars are not severe, or if your skin is particularly sensitive, it may be a better choice for you than surgical dermabrasion.

Use vitamin E oil.,
Try cocoa butter.,
Apply lemon juice.,
Use Aloe Vera.,
Give olive oil a try.,
Try cucumber.",How to Remove Scars on Legs2," Vitamin E has been used in many health and beauty treatments for many years and many people swear by it as a successful treatment for scars. Vitamin E oil is moisturizing and contains powerful antioxidants, helping it to repair skin and improve the appearance of damaged tissue.


You can take vitamin E capsules orally or you can apply the oil topically by bursting a capsule with a pin and applying the oil to the affected area.You may want to test the vitamin E oil on a small patch of skin first, before you apply it to any large areas of skin, as vitamin E oil may cause an allergic reaction in some people, resulting in contact dermatitis., Cocoa butter is a natural product, which helps to reduce the appearance of scars by moisturizing and softening the outer and middle layers of skin, while simultaneously smoothing out the surface of the skin. You can use pure cocoa or use a lotion containing cocoa butter, which you should apply to the scarred area between 2 and 4 times a day.You should massage the cocoa butter into the skin using circular motions, making sure that it is almost completely absorbed by the skin.
Be aware that cocoa butter will be most effective on newer scars than older scars, though you should still see an improvement either way.

, Lemon juice is a common home remedy for scar treatment, which receives mixed reviews. It is believed to lessen the appearance of scars by acting as a bleaching agent to minimize redness, while also exfoliating, to help skin regenerate. While lemon juice has helped some people to reduce their scars, this method is not recommended by dermatologists, as lemon juice can be harsh and drying on the skin, and has not been scientifically proven to remove scars.If you do decide to try lemon juice on your scars, cut a small slice of lemon and squeeze the juice directly onto your scars. Leave the lemon juice on overnight or for several hours. Do not apply fresh juice more than once a day.
If you feel the pure lemon juice is too strong, you can dilute it with water before applying or mix it with some blended cucumber to limit the harshness of the treatment.

, Aloe vera is a plant whose sap has well-known moisturizing and soothing properties. It is often used to treat burns, but can also be used as an effective natural scar treatment. Aloe vera contains anti-inflammatory and anti-bacterial properties, making it most effective in the treatment of fresh scars (though it should not be applied to open wounds). The aloe vera soothes the skin and helps it to regenerate, thus reducing the appearance of scars over time.To apply, break a leaf from an aloe vera plant and squeeze the clear, gel-like sap directly onto the scarred skin. Massage the sap into the skin using small circular motions. Aloe vera is very gentle on the skin, so you can reapply the sap up to four times a day.
If you cannot get your hands on an aloe vera plant (though they should be available at most plant nurseries) there are many creams and lotions available which contain aloe vera extract, that may be equally effective.

, Olive oil is another natural treatment which has been said to improve the appearance of scars. Extra virgin olive oil, in particular, is believed to produce the best results as it has a higher acidity level than other olive oils and a greater quantity of vitamins E and K. The oil works by softening and moisturizing the skin, causing the scar tissue to slacken, while acidity in the oil exfoliates the skin.


Apply a teaspoon of extra virgin olive oil to the affected area and massage using small circular motions until the oil is absorbed. You can also use the olive oil as an exfoliating scrub by mixing it with a teaspoon of baking soda, which you can massage into the scars before rinsing off with warm water.
You can increase the effectiveness of the olive oil treatment by blending it with another oil. Combine two parts olive oil with one part rosehip, chamomile or calendula oil and apply this blend to the scars. The added oils will increase the soothing properties of the olive oil.

, Cucumber is a safe natural treatment which has been said to break down scar tissue, while cooling and soothing any inflamed skin around the scar. Again, this treatment will work better on fresh scars than on older ones. To use, peel a cucumber, chop roughly and blend in a food processor until it achieves a paste-like consistency. Apply a light layer of this paste to the scarred skin and leave it on overnight, or apply a thicker layer and wash off after 20 minutes.The remaining cucumber paste will keep covered in the fridge for several days, and you should continue to apply it to the affected area each night.
You can increase the effectiveness of this treatment by mixing the cucumber paste with some of the aforementioned products, such as lemon juice, olive oil or aloe vera.

Try scar reducing creams and gels.,
Use a silicone based scar sheet.,
Try bleaching creams.",How to Remove Scars on Legs3," There are many products available over-the-counter at the pharmacy that claim to reduce the appearance or even remove scars. Whether these products will work for you, will depend on the type and severity of your scarring.


Though medical professionals may be skeptical about the success rates of such creams, many people have found products like Mederma and Vita-K to be effective.
Mederma works well for stretch marks and other types of scarring, if it is systematically applied 3 to 4 times a day, for up to six months. It works by softening and smoothing the scars, on the legs or any other area of the body., Silicone scar sheets are a great, innovative way to deal with scars, especially those that may look unsightly. The scar sheets are self-adhesive, so they will stick to your skin while the silicone technology works to hydrate, soften, and fade the scars. The silicone sheets are available for purchase over-the-counter or online and each box will usually provide an 8 to 12 week supply.


The silicone sheets have been proven effective in treating scars, but it will take time and patience to achieve noticeable results. The sheets must be worn over the scar every day, for 12 hours a day, over a 2 to 3 month period., Bleaching creams, such as those containing the ingredient hydroquinone, reduce the appearance of scars such as stretch marks and dark spots by targeting the hyperpigmentation, which causes dark brown, black, bright red or purple scars. These creams will effectively lighten the color of the scars, causing them to become less noticeable over time.


Be aware that hydroquinone-based creams, though effective, have been banned in the European Union as they are thought to contain carcinogenic properties and heighten the risk of skin cancer.Hydroquinone products are still available over-the-counter in the US, in concentrations up to 2%. Anything higher than that requires a prescription.

Try dermabrasion.,
Get a chemical peel.,
Try laser treatments.,
Get steroid injections.,
Try collagen or other fillers.",How to Remove Scars on Legs4," Dermabrasion is a method of exfoliating the skin, using a rotating wire brush or diamond wheel, which removes the top layers of skin over and around the scar. In the weeks following the procedure, new skin will grow back, and the appearance of the scar will be greatly reduced. Dermabrasion is usually used for acne and other facial scars, though it can be performed on the legs by a qualified surgeon. Dermabrasion on the legs is a delicate procedure as the skin on the legs is very thin and runs the risk of doing more harm than good if done incorrectly.Dermabrasion on the legs is usually only recommend for dark spots or indented scars caused by mosquito bites, etc. Keloid or hypertrophic scars (raised scars) should not be treated with dermabrasion.
Make an appointment with a board-certified plastic surgeon who can analyse your scarring and decide whether you are a good candidate for dermabrasion. Be aware that these kinds of aesthetic procedures are not usually covered by insurance.

, Chemical peels can be used to treat superficially scarring on the legs, and works particularly well for scars caused by hyperpigmentation. During a chemical peel, a dermatologist will apply a layer of acidic solution to the scarred skin and leave it on for approximately two minutes. You will experience a burning sensation, which should cease once the acid has been neutralized and the solution washed off. In the two weeks following the procedure, the top layers of skin will begin to peel away, leaving smooth, new skin behind.Depending on the scarring, you may need to go through several chemical peel procedures before you see a noticeable difference in the appearance of your skin.
Be aware the new skin that is exposed after a chemical peel will be particularly sensitive and you will need to protect it by avoiding sun exposure and using a sunscreen with a high SPF for several weeks.

, Laser treatment is a great option for improving the appearance of deeper scars than those targeted by dermabrasion and chemical peels. Laser treatment works by burning away the scar tissue, allowing fresh, new skin to grow and replace the scarred surface. The area is numbed with a special cream before the procedure, so the treatment is not particularly painful. Another advantage is that the laser can pinpoint the scar precisely, so the surrounding skin remains unaffected.Laser treatment should only be received at a reputable clinic with a well-trained staff, as lasers can be dangerous if used incorrectly.
You may need to return to the clinic for a series of treatments to fully remove the scar. The downside of this option is that laser treatment can be expensive, ranging from $1000 to $5000, depending on the size and depth of the scar.

, Steroid injections have been successfully used to treat keloid scars, which are notoriously difficult to get rid of. For small keloids the steroid injections, which contain substances such as hydrocortisone, are injected directly into the skin around the scar. Larger keloids are sometimes sliced or frozen off before the steroids are used.Steroid treatment is a process rather than a once-off procedure, and you will need to return to the clinic every two to three weeks to receive another injection.
This treatment has a high rate of success, but is relatively costly and may cause skin discoloration in darker skinned patients. Consult with a cosmetic surgeon to decide if this treatment is best for you., Injections of collagen or other fats can be very helpful in improving the appearance of indented scars, such as the pockmarks caused by chicken pox. Collagen is a natural animal protein, which is injected into the skin with a fine needle, thus filling in the indented scars. Though very effective, the results of collagen treatments are not permanent, as the body absorbs the natural collagen. You will need to get the scar refilled after about four months.Each collagen injection costs approximately $250, so this going down this route for scar treatment can be costly.
You will need to have a skin test done before you receive any collagen injections, to ensure that you will not have an allergic reaction to the treatment.

Ask about injections.,
Ask about resurfacing.,
Ask about cryosurgery.",How to Reduce the Appearance of Scars from Your Face2," If you have raised or sunken scars, treating them with injections may smooth them. You dermatologist will administer them in his or her office. You may need to get a series of injections, and they may wear off over time. Injections cost around $50-75 dollars each, so make sure you have the budget to pay for repeated treatments.


You may experience side effects such as bruising, tissue death, dilated blood vessels, lightened patches of skin, or hyperpigmentation.Discontinue injection treatment if you have an allergic reaction.

, If you have shallow, sunken scars, especially acne scars, you may want to try laser resurfacing, dermabrasion, or a chemical peel. These techniques remove scar tissue on your face, giving new skin the opportunity to grow. Some damage in the form of redness, sun sensitivity, dilated blood vessels, cysts, acne, eczema, hyperpigmentation, lightened skin patches, and even new scarring is to be expected.


Resurfacing techniques are unlikely to work on raised or very deep scars.
If you choose dermabrasion, your dermatologist will use an abrasive tool to rub your scar down. They may use sandpaper or a wire brush.If you choose laser resurfacing, your dermatologist will pass over your scars 1-3 times with a laser. This technique can take minutes or a full hour, depending on the extent of the scarring.
If you choose to have a chemical peel, chemicals will be applied to your face. You may be given a ""lunchtime,"" a medium, or a deep peel. Deep peels require general anaesthesia and require you to stay out of the sun for up to 6 months.Resurfacing techniques require skill. Choose a dermatologist who is experienced, trusted, and highly-rated.

, Cryosurgery freezes scar tissue with liquid nitrogen, causing it to die and fall from your face. This treatment is sometimes recommended for severely raised scars. It is recommended more frequently for use on lighter skins, as it can cause spotty bleaching. After cryosurgery, you may be recovering from blistering, swelling, and hyperpigmentation for up to 4 weeks.Cryosurgery is also called cryoablation and cryotherapy.

, How long you choose to leave the lemon juice on your skin probably depends on two things — whether you're targeting scars or acne, and how sensitive your skin is:



Scars or acne? If you're trying to treat scars only, you have a little bit more leeway, because you're using the lemon juice to lighten skin, not heal acne. In this case, you can afford to leave it on for several hours to overnight. If you're treating acne, try leaving it on for less time.

Sensitive skin or not? People with sensitive skin have a harder time leaving lemon juice on for longer periods. If your skin is very sensitive, reddens easily, or generally doesn't behave, stick with a couple hours at first before experimenting with longer durations.

, Apply the lemon juice every 1 - 3 days for a period of several weeks for best results. If lemon juice doesn't work, try seeing a dermatologist or consult other sources on treating acne fast and naturally.

, Lemon juice is incredibly acidic, leeching out natural oils and disrupting your skin's natural pH.

Just because a little is good doesn't mean a lot is better!

, If your acne is bad and you've got open sores or lesions, lemon juice probably isn't what you want. While it may fight the acne, it probably hurts the surrounding skin, leaving it worse off.

1 tablespoon (15 ml) lemon juice
1 tablespoon (15 ml) honey
1 tablespoon (15 ml) olive oil

, If you've got sensitive skin but still want to take advantage of the potency of lemon juice, you don't have to forgo it altogether. Try mixing 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of lemon juice with 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of water for a less concentrated solution. Then dip the Q-tip in the diluted solution and use as instructed.


If you really have sensitive skin and want a cooling touch when you apply the lemon juice with a Q-tip, try soaking the Q-tip in the diluted lemon juice and then placing it in the freezer for 10 - 20 minutes or until it freezes. Then, when you apply the Q-tip to your skin, it will be cool to the touch!

Keeping your skin clean and moisturized will encourage skin rejuvenation — this means that the older, scarred skin will be sloughed away and replaced with the newer, smoother layers underneath.


Wash the scarred skin at least once a day (twice if it's on your face) with a gentle cleanser that contains no colors or fragrances. Be sure not to over wash the skin, however, as this can dry it out and cause irritation.
Moisturize the skin after cleansing to keep it hydrated. You can use a gentle store-bought moisturizer or apply a natural oil such as coconut or olive oil.;
, Scarred skin is particularly sensitive, making it prone to burning and hyperpigmentation caused by the the harmful rays of the sun. As a result, it is important to apply suntan lotion to keloid scars if you intend to spend any time outside throughout the day.


Use a high SPF of thirty or above, and remember to apply it to the skin at least thirty minutes before going outside.
The sun's rays can be damaging on the skin, even when it's not hot or sunny outside. Therefore, it's important to apply suntan lotion regardless of the weather.

, When you have a cut or small scar on the skin, it can be very tempting to pick at it. However, this is a bad idea as it often leads to infection and the formation of keloid scars.


Try to leave any cuts alone to prevent the formation of keloids and avoid touching any existing keloids, as this can simply aggravate them further.
If you leave your scars alone, there's a good chance that they will disappear on their own over time, without the need for medical intervention.

, Recent studies have shown promising data with scar creams that contain onion extract when it comes to reducing the height of scar tissue.This product will also work in helping to prevent raised scar tissue if you apply it to a healing tissue injury that you fear may develop a keloid., You can apply lemon juice to darker scars in order to lighten them. Vitamin C is important in normal wound healing, and the high concentration of vitamin C in lemon juice can help lighten scars.Use a cotton ball soaked in lemon juice and apply directly to the scar. Allow the lemon juice to air dry and rinse with warm water. Repeat once a day.


Be aware that exposing the lemon-juice treated skin to sunlight may result in bleaching.
While most steps described later in this method can be used in conjunction, do not try mixing lemon juice with other remedies. If you want to use other methods that you apply to the scar concurrently, then rinse off the lemon juice and wait two to three hours beforehand.

, Castor oil has the ability to penetrate deep into the skin and slowly break down scar tissue. In healthy skin cells, it helps to increase circulation and eliminate toxins.


To treat keloids, soak a piece of clean cloth in castor oil and press it onto the keloid for an hour or two every day. Alternatively, you can just rub castor oil directly onto the keloid everyday.
You may also use castor oil to prevent keloid formation in the first place by applying the oil directly onto cuts or scrapes. This promotes better healing.

, Aloe vera has been shown to help reduce the appearance of burn scars, and you can safely try it to reduce the appearance of a keloid as well.Aloe vera is an anti-inflammatory herb. The reduction of inflammation, especially during the early stages of scar formation may be important for increasing the elasticity of the new tissue.

, Researchers believe that green tea may reduce scarring because of its antioxidant activity.Steep a bag of organic green tea in warm water. Use the tea bag directly on the scar three to four times a day for ten or fifteen minutes.


You can also soak a cotton towel in green tea, squeeze out the excess, and place over the scar three or four times a day for ten to fifteen minutes.

, Honey is a natural moisturizer that has shown some promise in reducing the size of keloids.Apply a thin layer of honey directly to the scar. Massage the honey into the scar for five minutes. Allow it to sit for an hour before rinsing off the honey.


Manuka honey or Tualang honey is generally recommended for medicinal use.
You can cover the honey with gauze to help prevent it from sticking to clothing.

, This herb has been used in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) for centuries to reduce scarring. Recent studies have indicated that it can reduce the numbers and functions of scar-forming cells.To use the powder, mix half a teaspoon of the powder or one-quarter teaspoon of the concentrated herb with one to two tablespoons of castor oil. Massage the mixture into the scar tissue three to four times a day.


You may have to go to a local TCM practitioner in your area to find this herb.

, Many of these methods can take several months to produce a significant difference in reducing the appearance of your keloid scars. You can try using several of these methods at a time to help increase the chances of reducing your scar.


If you do prefer using the methods one at a time to determine which is most effective, then try the method for at least two to three weeks. If there is no change, move to another method or consider consulting your doctor about a medical procedure for removing your keloid.

See your doctor.",How to Reduce Scars Naturally," The ultraviolet rays of the sun can increase healing time and cause your scar to become darker or even discolored. If you do need to get out in the sun, make sure to cover your scars with clothing and wear a sunscreen with a Sun Protection Factor (SPF) of 15 or higher., The citric acid in lemon juice has a potent bleaching compound which can help lighten and thereby minimize the appearance of scars. Indeed, lemon juice has been used as a natural skin lightener throughout history. In addition, the vitamin C in lemon juice is essential to wound healing, which can in turn help prevent scar development. Cut a lemon in half, and spread all of its juice all over your scar. Leave it to soak in for at least 10 minutes or until dry. Alternatively, you could soak a cotton ball or Q-tip in the fresh lemon juice and apply it onto the scar or place slices of lemon directly onto the scarred tissue for 10 minutes. The acidic properties of the lemon will help by getting rid of the top layer of skin on your scar: the dead layer.
Avoid sun exposure if using lemon juice on the skin as the bleaching effect of the juice can become stronger.

, Like lemon juice, tomato juice is acidic and may have a natural bleaching property that can help reduce the visibility of your scars. Tomato juice also has high levels of antioxidants which can react with your skin's pigments and result in lightening.


Cut a fresh tomato and apply the juice, which you can squeeze from it, right to your scar for about 10 minutes. Then, rinse the area and pat it dry. You can repeat this procedure once every day to see results.
If you prefer, you can also apply slices of whole tomato directly to the scarred area. Rinse off the tomato juice with warm water when done.

, Honey is a natural moisturizer in addition to having antimicrobial properties. Honey can help treat skin wounds and regenerate skin tissue. Honey also has beneficial antibacterial and antifungal properties that can halt bacteria and fungus from exacerbating scars.Mix two tablespoons of honey with two tablespoons of baking soda. Massage the mixture into your scarred area for several minutes. Then, place a warm towel over the affected area. Let the towel cool and then use it to wipe away the mixture from your skin.

, This plant gel can be massaged into scars to soften the tissue. Aloe vera has been studied primarily for its effects on burn scars, but appears to improve the general characteristics of scars and reduce the appearance of at least burn scars. Aloe vera is an anti-inflammatory herb and the reduction of inflammation, especially during the early stages of scar formation, may be important for increasing the elasticity of the new tissue. Aloe is gentle, so you won’t have to worry about it causing additional damage or irritation to your skin. In addition, aloe is a natural moisturizer and will improve the softness of skin as well.Your best bet is to get an aloe plant and break off a small piece of a leaf and peel away the outer leaf to expose the gel. Squeeze the fresh gel right onto your scar. Then, massage the gel into your skin. Leave the gel on for at least 30 minutes so it can soak into your skin. Apply the gel twice daily.
If purchasing aloe vera from a drugstore or pharmacy, make sure to use only 100% pure aloe vera gel and not a lotion or other formula.

, High in antioxidants, which are helpful in regenerating skin tissue, green tea can be a helpful remedy in minimizing scarring.Steep a bag of organic green tea in warm water. Use the tea bag directly on the scar three to four times a day for 10 to 15 minutes. Make sure the water is only warm, and not hot, before applying it to your skin. You don't want to burn yourself.
You can also soak a cotton towel in green tea, squeeze out the excess and place the towel over the scar. Repeat this process three to four times a day for 10-15 minutes.

, There are a number of essential oils that can help to reduce scarring. Here are some options:


Lavender oil is a traditional remedy used to reduce scars naturally. Place two to three drops of lavender oil in two tablespoons of castor oil and massage into the scar. Repeat three to four times a day.St John’s wort promotes wound healing and has been used to reduce C-section scars. St John’s wort oil can be mixed with castor oil and massaged directly into the scar. Use two to three drops of essential oil in two tablespoons of castor oil and massage into the scar. Repeat three to four times daily., Scars can be caused by burns, cuts, lacerations, surgery, bites, war injuries and skin disorders such as acne. Physiologically, scars result when the skin has been disrupted at a level deeper than about ⅓ of the entire depth of the skin. In essences, scars are the replacement for the original skin. However, since they are the result of some injury, this replacement skin is often thicker, is weaker and has different pigmentation, all of which make it make it appear more visible.Scarring is natural. It's part of how the body heals itself after an injury.
The size and appearance of a scar is variable and depends on the depth, size, location and type of injury that has been sustained as well as the individual's age, sex, ethnicity, and genetics.

, The best time to minimize scarring is during the immediate healing period. Any wound to your skin should be bandaged with special bandages or special silicone sheeting with the lowest level of tension possible. There should be a constant but even and low pressure on the wound, which helps to flatten any scarring. Cover any cuts with breathable material; this will help form a scab, which will in turn speed up healing.Massage the area gently with your fingertips once the wound has healed. Massaging works to break down the dense bands of collagen, which contribute to scarring, from forming in the skin tissue beneath the wound.
Never use hydrogen peroxide on a wound as this can cause the skin nearby to become damaged.

, Scars can cause physical disfigurement and emotional and mental distress. Some potential physical and psychological side effects of scarring include:Itching
Tenderness
Pain
Difficulty sleeping
Anxiety or depression
Loss of self-esteem
Stress

, There are various remedies that can help minimize the appearance of scars, but most of us live with some bodily scars regardless. Even though it can be psychologically difficult to live with visible scars, you can try to reframe how you think about your scars. Rather than consider them disfiguring, think of scars as a part of what makes you distinctive and unique. Scars act as evidence of your life experiences, whether good or bad, and contribute to your individualism. Even if you have scars, you're still intact and present. You have prevailed over whatever caused the scars in the first place.

, If you are suffering from any mental health issues or physical problems related to your scars, consult your physician for further guidance and treatment.Get any scars that become raised, red, or extremely itchy checked out by your doctor. These are potential signs that the skin has become infected.
If you feel low self-esteem or stigmatized because of your scars, consider seeking therapy and counseling to learn how to cope effectively with your situation.

Massage the scars with your fingers.,
Apply vitamin E lotion the scars.,
Make a lemon juice, sugar, and honey scrub.,
Use olive oil and a warm towel on the scars.",How to Soften Facial Scars1," Scar massage can help to flatten and soften scars, especially during the immature phase of scarring, where the scar is in the healing stages or has just healed. Applying pressure to the scars through massage can encourage collagen production, help to decrease any itchiness, and give the scar more moisture and flexibility. However, scar massage will not work on scars that are more than two years old. To massage your scars:Use non scented lotion on the scars that will not irritate your skin. Start by applying lotion and then using two fingers to put light pressure on the scars, making small circles over the length of the scars and the skin around them. You can then massage the scars up and down with two fingers and side to side. You should use enough pressure to make the scars area appear light in color or turn white.
Always use lotion on the scars before you massage them, as they will likely be sensitive or dry as they heals. Massage the scars two to three times a day for ten minutes at a time, at least six months after the scar develops. You can continue to massage the scars after six months to promote healing and to soften the scars.
Stop massaging the scars if you experience redness, bleeding, increased pain around or on the scars, and if the scars feel warmer than the skin around them.;
, Lotion that contains vitamin E has been known to soften scars and encourage healing. However, only put vitamin E lotion on scars that have had one month to heal, as putting lotion on before then can lead to a further buildup of scar tissue.Always try a small amount of product on your face before putting it on any facial scars to ensure you do not have an allergic reaction to the product.

, Lemon juice is a natural astringent and can help to fade acne scars. Because it is acidic, it can help to remove dead skin cells and soften any acne scars so they gradually fade away. Apply a lemon juice based face mask to help soften your scars and encourage the scars to fade.Prepare the scrub right before you are planning to use it so it is fresh. Combine two tablespoons of honey, one tablespoon of lemon juice, one tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil and one and a half tablespoons of sugar.
Using clean fingers, gently massage the scrub onto your facial scars. Use gentle circular motions to ensure the scars are well scrubbed for five to ten minutes and then rinse with warm water.
If you feel a burning or stinging sensation on your skin after you apply the scrub due to the acidity of the lemon juice, you can dilute the scrub with two tablespoons of water.

, Olive oil is a natural oil that can help to soften your scars and help them to heal. Try to use organic olive oil as you do not want to put any additives or chemicals on your skin.


Pour one tablespoon of olive oil in a bowl. Dip your fingers into the olive oil and massage your scars gently and slowly.
Place a steaming towel over your face to open your pores and allow the olive oil to soften your scars. Once the towel cools down, use it to wipe any remaining oil off your skin.

Consult your doctor.,
Ask about a corticosteroid injection.,
Ask about cryotherapy.,
Look into 5-FU treatment.,
Ask about laser therapy options.,
Look into excision of the keloid.",How to Remove Keloid Scars at Home2," If none of the natural methods help to reduce your keloid scar tissue, then the next step is to consult your doctor for a professional medical solution.

, The most common solution for small and newer keloid scars is an injection of corticosteroids (intralesional triamcinolone acetonide), which reduce the synthesis of the keloid tissue.Your individual scar may react different to the treatment, but the average process requires three to four injections over the course of a month., Your doctor may suggest cryotherapy (freezing of the tissue) in conjunction with the injections. Cryotherapy damages the keloid tissue and helps lead to necrosis (death) of the keloid tissue to break it down faster than the corticosteroid injections alone.You can expect three to six sessions of cryotherapy for an average keloid scar.A cryoneedle is a recent innovation to this technique that your doctor may suggest. This specialized needle allows your doctor to inject liquid nitrogen into the tissue as opposed to simply applying it to the top of the tissue. This can quicken the process., Another option that is commonly used in association with corticosteroid injections is 5-FU, which is a drug that inhibits fibroblast cells (important cells in the process of healing wounded tissue) in such a way as to reduce keloids., Laser therapy options are becoming increasingly common in the treatment of keloid scars. The laser is used to break down the capillaries that feed the keloid tissue and to alter the production of collagen in the area around the tissue.Anywhere from two to six laser therapy treatments can vastly improve the color, height, and texture of a keloid scar., Depending on the height and area of the keloid, your doctor may also suggest excision (cutting away) of the tissue. This is usually only proposed for keloids more than one year old since the tissue can often flatten by itself over this time period. Excision of the keloid would result in a fresh wound that requires specific care to help avoid the potential for another keloid developing.Always follow the exact care instructions provided by your surgeon to help heal any wound with the best achievable results.

Use lemon juice.,
Apply rosehip seed oil.,
Use Aloe Vera.",How to Reduce the Appearance of Old Scars2," Lemon is a potential option for removing or reducing the appearance of scars without formal medical treatment. By applying lemon juice over a long period of time, you might slowly reduce the visibility of scars.

Cut a lemon in half.
Apply the lemon to scar for several minutes.
Repeat as needed.
Discontinue use if you experience any negative or unexpected symptoms., Rosehip seed oil is a common ingredient in many scar reducing medications. As a result, using pure rosehip oil may be extremely beneficial in reducing the appearance of old scars.

Squeeze several drops into your finger.
Rub the oil onto scar-affected skin.
Repeat this up to two times a day.
Discontinue use after two weeks., Aloe Vera is a plant that has medicinal and healing properties. It is also commonly used as a homeopathic remedy for scar removal. By using Aloe Vera, you’ll be relying on a remedy that has been tried and tested for years.

Cut an aloe leaf in half.
Squeeze Aloe Vera onto your finger.
Rub the Aloe Vera onto the scar in question.
Repeat application for up to several weeks.
Consult your physician if you have any unexpected symptoms."

Learn about scar revision surgery.,
Find a specialist.,
Decide on surgery.",How to Reduce the Appearance of Old Scars3," Scar revision surgery is a complicated procedure that comes with risks and costs. As a result, you need to spend some time learning about scar revision surgery so you can make an educated decision about whether it is a worthwhile option for you.

Understand the limitations of surgery and have realistic expectations. Know that surgery may not be able to completely remove all evidence of a scar. In fact, in the worst case scenario, it might make it worse.
Think about the cost. The cost of scar revision surgery can be thousands of dollars, depending on what doctor and where you live.
Consider the risks. While surgery can – in some cases – be the most effective treatment for reducing scars, it may also carry the greatest risk of complications including death., After you’ve learned about surgery and considered the risks, you need to spend a little time searching for the proper specialist. Your choice in specialist is important, as some surgeons are much more skilled than others.

Consider reviews online.
Pick a surgeon you’re comfortable with.
Think about recommendations from other medical professionals., Surgery is perhaps the most drastic way of reducing the appearance of old scars. Ultimately, while surgery can be successful, it may not be. In addition, it may offer dangers greater than homeopathethic or prescription solutions. Different types of surgery include:

Grafts. A graft includes taking a piece of skin from another location on your body and grafting it to an area of damaged skin.
Excision. Excision involves removing a scarred or damaged area of skin.
Dermabrasion. Dermabrasion involves removing the top layer of skin to improve the appearance of a scarred area.
Laser surgery. Laser surgery involves using a concentrated laser beam to remove a scarred area of skin."
"
Apply makeup.,
Wear certain colors.,
Grow your hair out, if appropriate.",How to Reduce the Appearance of Old Scars4," A great way to reduce the visibility of old scars is with makeup. Makeup will not only obscure a scar, but may completely cover it.

Match your skin tone to a concealer or base product.
Clean your skin. Use rubbing alcohol or some other skin cleaning product.
Apply the concealer or base product., You can also try to wear certain color clothing that might divert people's attention from your scar. This might be an easy and non-invasive approach to take.

Avoid wearing colors that bring out the color of your scar. This might vary based on your skin tone.
Wear bright colors that match your other features. For instance, if you have blue or green eyes, wear colors that bring out the blue or green in your eyes., Another way to reduce the appearance of old scars is to grow your hair out. Depending on the location of your scar, growing longer hair or facial hair may obscure or reduce the visibility of an old scar.

If the scar is on an area of your face that can be covered with facial hair, grow a beard or mustache. Mutton chops might also be an option.
If the scar is on your forehead or the side of your face, longer hair or bangs might obscure it."

Talk to a dermatologist about dermabrasion and chemical peels.,
Speak to your dermatologist about laser resurfacing and punch grafts.,
Ask your dermatologist about collagen injections.",How to Soften Facial Scars2," Over time your scars will fade, but if you want to speed up the process by softening them, you can use medical treatments to improve the appearance of the scars. Dermabrasion works by removing the top layers of skin with an electrical machine that abrades the skin. The skin then heals from the procedure, appearing smoother and less noticeable. Dermabrasion should be performed by a dermatologist in a medical setting.Chemical peels are another option to reduce the appearance of facial scars. During this procedure, the top layer of skin is removed with a chemical application, allowing the skin to regenerate and the scars to appear less prominent.

, These two procedures can be effective on fine or deep scars due to acne or surgery. However, they should always be done by a certified dermatologist.Laser resurfacing is done by using high-energy light to burn away damaged, scarred skin.
Punch grafts are small skin grafts that can be used to replace damaged or scarred skin. During this procedure, the dermatologist punches a hole in your skin to remove the scar. The hole is then replaced with unscarred skin, often from the back of your earlobe.

, Collagen is used by dermatologists to treat wrinkles, facial lines, and scars. For facial scarring, your dermatologist might use purified bovine(cow) collagen, which can replace the natural collagen that has been lost in the scars.As well, some cortisone-like injections have been known to soften and shrink hard scars on the body, including the face.

Clean the wound.,
Determine if you need medical attention.,
Apply petroleum jelly.,
Use hydrogel sheets or silicone gel bandages.,
Cover the injury.,
Change the dressings every day.,
Monitor for infection.,
Massage the area.,
Apply pressure.,
Apply elastic tape.,
Minimize movement.,
Protect your injury from sun exposure.,
Eat a diet that promotes wound healing.,
Increase your consumption of curcumin.,
Apply honey to your wound.,
Apply aloe vera.,
Avoid using vitamin E. Although we have heard for years of the healing power and scar prevention capability of applying topical vitamin E to a new injury, recent research has proven that vitamin E does not help to prevent the tissues from forming a scar.Some research suggests that vitamin E applied topically may actually impair the natural healing process.,
Avoid applying antibiotic creams or ointments.",How to Prevent Scarring," The first step in allowing the wound to start the natural healing process is to clean the area. Be sure there are no unwanted materials lodged inside the injured area that could lead to infection.Use soap and water. Gently wash the area with mild soap and warm water to clean the injury. Use clean, dry materials to apply pressure to stop the bleeding.
Avoid using hydrogen peroxide to clean the area. As your body starts to immediately produce new skin cells, the peroxide destroys those new cells and increases the chances of a scar beginning to form in the early stages of treatment.;
, Examples of wounds that may need medical attention include those that were caused by an object that deeply punctured the skin; wounds that continue to bleed freely; are deep; involve a broken bone; have visible internal tendons, ligaments, or bone; are on the face; involve an animal bite; have layers of skin that are torn or jagged; or have caused an existing wound to re-open.

Depending on the severity of the injury, stitches or sutures may be needed. Actually, sutures may help to reduce the risk of scarring. Once you have ruled out the need for medical attention and/or stitches, proceed with taking care of the wound at home.
If you have an injury on your face, you may wish to have a plastic surgeon do the sutures, as she will be particularly capable of using techniques that will minimize scarring.

, Petroleum jelly keeps the injured area moist, promotes healing, and prevents the formation of a scab. Petroleum jelly does not interfere with the natural healing of the injury. In fact, it can speed up the process.If a scar does form, using petroleum jelly can minimize the size of the scar as the tissues heal.
Scabs are the body’s natural way of forming a protective covering over a fresh injury; however, just beneath the scab is where the scar is starting to form.
As your body heals itself, collagen is brought to the surface of the skin to reconnect the broken and damaged tissue.
Then a temporary crusty covering, the scab, forms above the collagen. As the collagen works to mend the broken tissue, it also starts the formation of the scar just beneath the scab.

, Some evidence suggests that hydrogel sheets or silicone gel can reduce scarring. These dressings provide moisture to the injured tissues during the healing process and help in reducing the formation of scars.Hydrogel and silicone gel dressings work by supporting the natural fluid exchange between your healthy tissues and the injury. They are pressure dressings that keep the tissues moist, thereby assisting in the prevention of scars.
Follow the directions on the packaging if you choose to use one of these products. They are available without a prescription. Product manufacturers have recommendations of use specific to their products.
Similar products are available at a reduced cost. Ask your doctor or pharmacist about recommending over-the-counter scar therapy cosmetic pads.
Continue the use of moisture/pressure dressings for several weeks or even longer to reduce the formation and size of scars.
The use of petroleum jelly is not needed if you choose to apply hydrogel, silicone gel dressings, or the less expensive alternatives, as long as they provide adequate moisture to the wound.
Examine your wound daily to determine their effectiveness in your specific situation. Consider changing your dressing materials if the tissues are not moist and scab tissue is forming.

, Use a bandage that is appropriate to the size of the area, provides protection to the wound, keeps the area closed, and covers the injury completely. Exposure to air does not interfere with healing but it also does not help with scar prevention. In fact, you may be more likely to develop a scar if you leave the injury uncovered and unprotected.Exposure to air encourages the injury to dry out and leads to the formation of scabs. Scabs act as a barrier that contributes to the formation of a scar.
If you have skin that is sensitive to adhesive, use dressing pads that are non-adhesive and use paper or medical tape to secure the edges.
Use butterfly wound closures if needed. This type of bandage pulls together areas where the skin is split. Be sure to use closures that are long enough to allow for the petroleum jelly without compromising their ability to adhere to the surrounding skin.
Even with butterfly closures, you still need to cover the area with gauze or a dressing pad large enough to cover the entire area to reduce the risk of infection or further accidental injury.

, Clean the area each day, check for signs of infection, keep the injury moist by re-applying petroleum jelly, and cover it back up.If the butterfly closures are secure and there are no signs of infection beneath them, then you can leave them in place.
Continue to examine the injury daily for improvement, or possible signs of infections, as you clean the wound, change the dressings, and re-apply the petroleum jelly.
Once you see that new skin has grown together in a healthy manner, which may take as many as seven to 10 days, you can extend the time between your dressing changes to several days as long as you keep the area moist. Discontinue your treatments once the area is fully healed.

, Change the dressing daily, clean the area with each dressing change using mild soap and water and clean materials, and check for changes that may indicate an infection. Even the best cared for wounds can develop an infection.


See your doctor as soon as possible if you notice signs of an infection. He or she may recommend that you proceed with the use of topical antibiotic products or may prescribe an oral antibiotic to take for a period of time.
Signs of infections in a wound include redness or swelling in the area, warmth to the touch, red streaks protruding from the skin around the injury, pus or fluid accumulating under the skin, near the wound, or draining from the wound, an odor coming from the wound, throbbing or unusual tenderness in the area, and having chills or running a fever.

, Once the healing process is underway, massaging the area helps to breakdown the formation of collagen that leads to scar tissue. Be careful not to re-open a wound that is still trying to heal.Massaging the area breaks the formation of collagen bonds and prevents the formation of solid areas of collagen that attach to the new skin growth. This action prevents scars from forming or minimizes their size.
Massage the area several times each day using a circular motion for 15 to 30 seconds each time.
Use a lotion or cream recommended for scar prevention to help with the massage. Several products are available without a prescription that can be used.
One popular products contain varying strengths of an ingredients including onion skin extract and has been shown to provide some efficacy. Other products contain a combination of ingredients that help to maintain moisture in the skin to reduce scarring.

, Gentle and consistent pressure to the wound helps prevent or minimize scarring. Focus the pressure along the area most likely to scar.Bandages are available that help with applying pressure. Other than the hydrogel and silicone sheeting previously mentioned, other products designed to add constant pressure to the wound area as well as provide protection are available.
Ask your doctor about ways to safely create a custom fitting pressure application bandage. Options include using regular dressing materials to create a thicker area of a standard bandage that can be applied directly over the potential scar.
For larger or more prominent areas of scarring, pressure appliances are available that are worn during the daytime hours and for as long as four to six months. This is a costly venture and would require evaluation and recommendation by a physician or wound care specialist.
One research study done in animals using scar compression therapy resulted in significant and sustained improvement in areas of scarring, decreased thickness of the dermal skin layer where the scars were located, and increased blood flow in the areas treated., Once the area has healed and there is no risk of pulling the wound open, use elastic tape in specific patterns to lift the skin, improve circulation to the area just beneath the injury, and prevent the development of scars.The most familiar brand name of this type of tape is also the name of the taping procedure, Kinesio Taping.
Wait two to four weeks after the initial injury to be sure the wound is well healed.
Different patterns of taping are recommended depending on the location, depth, and length of the injury. Work with your doctor, a physical therapist, or sports trainer, to understand the most appropriate patterns to use for your injury.
One common taping pattern to prevent scarring involves applying a single layer or strip of elastic tape along the length of the injury. Stretch the tape to about 25 to 50% of its elasticity. Massage the tape into place over the wounded area.
Gradually increase the tension of the tape application over time, provided the skin is able to tolerate this without pulling or tearing.
Kinesio taping works best to prevent scars by using patterns that lift the skin, aid in circulation, and break up collagen formations. Talk to your doctor, physical therapist, or sports trainer to understand the best patterns for your injury.

, Tension and motion will cause the scar to widen, so try your best to avoid activity that tightly pulls the skin around the wound.


Use gentle movements if the injury is located on a joint area, like an elbow or knee. You want to regain your range of motion, but you need to take care not to re-open the wound.
Continue with any regular exercise or daily routines provided that the injury is not negatively impacted by those activities. Exercise helps to promote circulation throughout your body which is important in healing your injury.

, Use sunscreen to protect the new skin from sun exposure once your injury is healing and you no longer need to maintain constant dressings to cover the area.The ultraviolet rays from the sun can slow the healing process. Be sure your injury is healing nicely before you remove the dressing materials that provide a barrier between it and the rays of the sun.
The sun also triggers pigments in your skin. This can cause the new skin growth to be susceptible to a red or brown discoloration, making a scar more obvious if one did develop.
Use a product with broad spectrum coverage and an SPF of at least 30.

, Maintaining a healthy diet provides important nutrients that promote the healing of damaged tissues. Key ingredients in a diet designed to promote tissue healing are vitamin C, protein, and zinc.Increase foods rich in Vitamin C in your daily diet. There is evidence to support the recommendation to increase your intake of vitamin C to prevent scarring of tissues after a recent injury. While vitamin C supplements are available, it is possible to get enough from your diet.Check with your doctor about dose. Most people can increase foods that are rich in vitamin C to get enough to help promote the healing process. In some cases, a higher than average dose may be justified but only after consulting with your doctor.
Vitamin C is quickly used up by your body, so include foods that contain vitamin C at each meal and possibly even as a snack.
Vegetables that are rich in vitamin C include bell peppers, broccoli, potatoes, tomatoes, and cabbage. Fruits that contain high levels of vitamin C include oranges, strawberries, grapefruit, cantaloupe, and tangerines.
Some recent work suggests that consuming more vitamin C in your diet, or possibly in supplement form, accompanied by using a topical cream made from vitamin C may help to prevent scarring. Topical vitamin C products are available in strengths that range from 5% to 10%.
Increase the amount of zinc in your diet by eating foods like beef, liver, and seafood like crab. Zinc is also found in sunflower seeds, almonds, peanut butter, and dairy products like milk and eggs.
Protein is key in providing the nutrients your body needs to heal damaged skin. Good sources of protein include dairy products like eggs, milk, and cheese, plus fish, shellfish, tuna, chicken, turkey, and red meat.

, Curcumin is a spice that is a derivative of ginger, is a primary compound found in turmeric, and is often used in preparing Indian style foods.One research study done in animals found a positive correlation in controlling the inflammatory response leading to improved wound-healing. The authors conclude that there may be a positive relationship in promoting the healing process of damaged tissues and preventing scarring.
There is limited evidence to support the use of curcumin beyond this one animal study.

, The research regarding the use of honey to promote wound healing is controversial, yet there is enough evidence to support the use of medicinal honey in speeding up the healing process of some types of wounds. Scar formation is less likely when wounds heal themselves faster.The most recommended form of medicinal honey used to treat wounds is called Manuka honey. Manuka honey was approved by the FDA in 2007 as a recommended option for treating wounds.
It is difficult to find since it is generally only made in certain parts of the globe where Manuka trees grow naturally.
The high demand of Manuka honey makes it likely that some products may be counterfeit, so use caution if you choose to purchase this type of honey.
Make a wound dressing by using small amounts of Manuka honey applied to the dressing material, such as a sterile pad. Apply the dressing to the wound, and seal the edges with the appropriate type of medical type to prevent leakage.Clean the wound and change the dressing several times each day. Always check for signs of infection.

, The scientific research is limited. Manufacturers continue to claim benefit in the wound healing properties of aloe vera, and traditional Chinese medicine and other cultures continue to use aloe vera both topically and orally.The most recent review of published literature does not provide adequate evidence to support benefit in wound healing. However, study authors recommend more controlled trials to appropriately study and report on the healing properties of aloe vera.
Manufactured gel products of aloe vera for topical use are usually combined with vitamins A, B, C, and E, along with enzymes, amino acids, sugars and minerals.
Taking aloe vera orally is not recommended due to the lack of evidence to support an efficacy and the toxicities related to ingesting aloe vera.

,
Other work has discovered that topical vitamin E can result in new allergic reactions in as many as 30% of people that use vitamin E in this manner.

, Unless there are signs of an infection or you are told to do so by your doctor, there is no need to use over-the-counter antibiotic creams or ointments.More people are becoming resistant to antibiotics due to unnecessary, repeated, or prolonged use of these agents.
This includes the topical use of over-the-counter antibiotic products.

Keep an eye on your birthmark.",How to Lighten Birthmarks Naturally," Papaya contains the enzyme papain, which exfoliates the skin by uncovering new cells and bringing these new cells to the surface of the skin, giving it a lighter appearance. You can get papaya soaps and creams, which you can apply to your birthmark two to three times a day. Apricots also contain enzymes that may lighten birthmarks in some individuals, and there are a number of apricot skin scrubs on the market.


Alternatively, use fresh fruit and apply slices of the fruit directly onto the birthmark for 10 minutes. Repeat daily and rinse off the fruit juice with warm water.;
, Healthcare practitioners believe that the citric acid in lemon juice may have a potent bleaching compound which can help lighten the birthmark on your skin. Lemon juice has been used traditionally to lighten areas of skin. This bleaching effect becomes stronger in the sun, though it is advisable to stay out of the sun while the lemon juice is on your skin because there is no way to predict how much of a bleaching effect the combination of sun and lemon juice might have.To use lemon juice:


Cut a lemon in half using a knife. Apply the lemon juice directly to the birthmark while squeezing it. Make sure to cover the entire area for at least 10 minutes and then wash thoroughly with warm water. Pat the area dry with a clean towel. Repeat this process three times a day.
Apply lemon slices to the area of the birthmark if you prefer. Leave the lemon slices on for 10 minutes. Rinse off the lemon juice with warm water when done. Repeat daily.

, Tomato juice is slightly acidic and contains high levels of antioxidants which can, in theory, react with skin pigments and lighten the birthmark. Like lemons, it seems that tomatoes may have antioxidant properties that can help to minimize skin damage. It also may have a natural bleaching property similar to the citric acid found in lemon juice.To use a tomato to lighten your birthmark:


Take the juice of a fresh-cut tomato and apply it directly to the pigmented birthmark. Apply the juice for at least 10 minutes and then wash and dry your skin. Repeat this process once daily.
You can also use slices of tomato if you prefer. Leave this on for 10 minutes and repeat daily. Rinse off the tomato juice with warm water when done.

, Olive oil is considered to be a natural moisturizer. It may rehydrate damaged skin cells, which in turn can help to lighten a birthmark.To apply olive oil:


Apply a few drops of olive oil to a cotton ball so that the cotton ball is soaked but not dripping. Hold the cotton ball against your birthmark for five minutes before rinsing the skin with warm water and patting it dry. Repeat this process two or three times a day.

, Ice and cold compresses can help your skin retain moisture and develop a softer texture. As a result, the stains or pigmentations that form a birthmark are lightened. It can also tighten the pores of the skin which can minimize skin discoloration.Wrap two to three pieces of ice in a clean cloth. This will help protect your skin from cold damage; never apply ice directly to the skin. Hold the wrapped ice against your skin for 15 to 20 minutes. Do not leave the ice pack on your skin for longer than 20 minutes, as it can begin to damage your skin. Let your skin rest for an hour, and then repeat as needed.

, Vitamin A stimulates cell division and the production of collagen (the most abundant protein in the skin).Vitamin A helps to renew and exfoliate the skin where the birthmark is, which may help to reduce the pigmentation of the birthmark.


Apply the cream to the birthmark at least two to three times a day. Make sure to cover the entire birthmark.

, Vitamin E, with its anti-oxidizing properties, can fight the free radical damage in the skin and minimize damage to your skin cells. In essence, this helps exfoliate the skin and can make the birthmark appear lighter.Apply the oil to the birthmark two to three times a day so that the mark is entirely covered.

, Kojic acid is a white crystalline powder that is derived from a fungus in Asia. It suppresses the function of tyrosinase, which is the protein responsible for producing the brown pigment, melanin.Kojic acid is available in the form of soaps and other products which you can purchase at pharmacies and grocery stores near you. Always do a test patch by applying a small amount of the product on your skin and seeing how your skin reacts. Always follow all manufacturer's instructions. Apply kojic acid to the birthmark two to three times a day.
Kojic acid as been used to successfully treat melasma, a temporary skin darkening that occurs in pregnancy., Pigmented birthmarks are usually not medically treated, though larger birthmarks may be surgically removed. Vascular birthmarks, particularly port wine stains and some hemangiomas (sometimes called strawberry marks because of their appearance as bright red nodules), can be treated with a pulsed-dye laser (PDL). In this treatment, a laser is used to heat up and destroy the cells in birthmark. Repeated treatments may be needed, but this usually helps the birthmarks fade.A newer type of treatment is called Photodynamic Therapy (PDT), in which a drug that reacts to light is used to treat the birthmark. When stimulated by a specific wavelength of light, the drug (photosensitizer) is “activated” and destroys the cells within the birthmark. PDT was originally designed to treat skin cancer and has been adapted to treat birthmarks.Both PDL and PDT appear to have similar success rates., This is a type of birthmark that leaves excessive amounts of pigments or color in the skin. Common examples of pigmentation birthmarks include:



Mole (Congenital Nevi) - These are generally relatively small, round brownish areas, but can be pink, natural-skin colored or very dark black. They can be flat or raised and can disappear spontaneously. Moles are not generally dangerous, though if they begin to itch or bleed, they should be examined by a dermatologist as soon as possible because some moles can become cancerous.Cafe au lait spots - These birthmarks have the color of coffee with cream. On darker skin, they can appear darker than the surrounding skin. Some cafe au lait spots lighten with age, but rarely fade away completely.Mongolian spots - These are marks that are characterized by flat, slate blue-grey patches on the skin, usually located on the back or buttocks. These birthmarks are often mistaken for bruises. These are usually found in children and commonly disappear as children get older., This type of birthmark can form anywhere on the body and does not usually go away over time. Natural lightening treatments will also not have an affect on a vascular birthmark. Instead, you may want to consider medical treatment if you want to diminish or remove a vascular birthmark. Common types of vascular birthmarks include:



Hemangiomas - These can be flat or raised collections of blood vessels. Raised birthmarks are often called strawberry hemangiomas because of their bright, strawberry red color. Hemangiomas that are flat tend to be bluish or purplish. Both types of hemangiomas usually shrink and fade with age. By the age of 10, most hemangiomas have essentially disappeared, leaving a light, colored area in their place.Salmon or macular patches - These birthmarks are flat with a pinkish or reddish color. They are sometimes called “ angel’s kisses” or “stork bites”. In general, salmon patches don’t fade with age, though are often able to be covered with light makeup. They typically occur above the hairline at the back of the neck, between the eyes or on the eyelids. These birthmarks usually affect younger children but are relatively safe and don't require any treatment.Port wine stains - These types of birthmarks are often the most problematic and are quite common. They are named port wine stains because they look as if someone had spilled dark wine on the body. These birthmarks can become bigger and darker with age., They seem to appear randomly and are not a result of something your mother ate or did while pregnant. Nor do birthmarks seem to be particularly associated with being either lucky or unlucky!


Contrary to their name, birthmarks are not necessarily always immediately evident at birth. Some, like hemangiomas, can develop even weeks later., In general, birthmarks tend to be harmless. Unless they begin to bleed, itch, change color or shape, they are not dangerous. If, however, you notice that your birthmark has changed in any way (other than fading and getting smaller), be safe and have the birthmark evaluated by a dermatologist.Changes in the size, shape, and color of a birthmark, along with bleeding, crusting, or itching, can be an early warning sign of some forms of skin cancer.

Identify the risk factors for keloid scar formation.,
Know who is at risk for hypertrophic scar formation.,
Talk to your doctor.,
Avoid non-essential cosmetic surgeries.",How to Prevent Keloid and Hypertrophic Scars1," Keloid scars are more commonly found on the arms, upper chest, and upper back. They grow beyond the borders of the original abrasion and appear as red, raised nodules. Keloids are the result of an overgrowth of dense fibrous tissue that usually develops after healing of a skin injury. You can also develop a keloid scar from a cut, a piercing, or acne.


Keloid scars are more difficult to prevent and treat, but early recognition can lead to either prevention or at least reduction.
People with darker complexions, pregnant women, teens, individuals under 30, and others with a history of keloid scarring may be more susceptible to keloid scar formation.;
, Hypertrophic scars are less visible and stay within the boundaries of the original damage. They become flatter and paler over time. While men and women are equally susceptible to hypertrophic scarring, there are specific groups that are more prone to it. People at higher risk include those who:

Everyone's skin is different and every scar causing injury is different too. Your doctor will be able to tell you whether simple silicone coverings will work or if more extreme measures are necessary to reduce the size of scars or to get rid of them all together., If you have a history of keloidal scarring, then you may want to avoid any non-essential surgeries to prevent scarring. All surgical wounds should be closed with the least amount of tension around the incision. Incisions should not cross joint spaces, which are prone to excessive stretching. Mid-chest incisions should be avoided for the same reason.If you have to get surgery and a scar is unavoidable, there are laser techniques surgeons can use to reduce the appearance of scars."

Choose a thick makeup.,
Use a brush to apply.,
Apply a small amount at first.,
Try using a scar camouflaging kit.",How to Hide Self Harm Scars1," There are many brands that formulate their makeup specifically to cover tattoos or discoloration, and these are also the best types to use to try to cover scarring. You may have to find these in specialty stores or online.


Look for a brand that has a good variety of shades to choose from. You want to match the shade you select to the skin around your scar, not to the scar itself.
Look for a brand that specifically claims to cover or camouflage tattoos or scars; there are several highly rated ones you can search for online or in stores. If you can't find any of these in stores near you, try any ""full coverage"" or ""maximum coverage"" foundation or concealer, especially those available in stick form, as they tend to be more covering than liquids.;
, Brushes create the smoothest application and help to blend makeup into crevices.


Look for a small, rounded brush that is advertised as a concealer brush.

, Using the brush, gently pat a small amount of concealer or foundation across your scars and the surrounding skin. Add another thin layer if one layer is not enough.


If you want to, you can set it with translucent pressed or loose powder to help it last longer.

, A kit generally contains several products that are designed to work together to cover scars. These kits can be more expensive than regular makeup, and more time intensive to apply. But if you have an important event like a wedding or job interview, it might be a good investment.


Search for ""tattoo covering kit"" or ""scar covering kit"" online to find many different options along with user reviews.

Assess the wound.,
Wash your hands thoroughly.,

Rinse the area with clean water.,
Remove any debris.,
Apply a topical antibiotic.,
Consider using a liquid bandage.,
Cover the cut.,
Change your bandage regularly.,
Keep an eye out for infection.",How to Hide Cuts1," Is your cut is less than 1/4 inch deep? Did it come from a from a reasonably clean source such as a kitchen knife or your razor? Are the edges fairly straight? If the answer to these questions is ""yes,"" you can probably treat your cut yourself. See a doctor for treatment if your cut falls into any of the following categories:


Large areas of skin have been torn, the cut is jagged or gaping, or you can see bone, tendon, or muscle in the cut.
The cut is a puncture wound, or the object that cut you was made of rusty metal. You will need a tetanus shot if it has been more than five years since your last booster.
You are unable to remove all dirt and debris from the cut.
The cut is from an animal or human bite.
The area you've injured feels numb.;
, Cleaning your hands with warm water and soap will help prevent infection. Consider donning disposable protective gloves if you have some available -- and especially if you are treating another person's injury., Most minor cuts will stop bleeding on their own. If this does not seem to be happening right away, use medical gauze or a clean cloth and press firmly on the wound until the bleeding stops.Note that cuts on your hands or head may bleed more heavily than elsewhere due to the extra blood vessels present in these parts of your body.Seek medical assistance if you are unable to stop the bleeding after a few minutes.

, You can wash the area around the cut with soap and water. Avoid getting soap into the cut itself, however, as this can cause irritation and discomfort.


Avoid using hydrogen peroxide, iodine, or rubbing alcohol to rinse your wound. Medical professionals have determined they are not necessary, and they can irritate your injury., Rinse a pair of tweezers with rubbing alcohol and then use them to remove debris particles such as gravel or splinters., A thin layer of antibiotic ointment will help protect the wound, discourage infection, and keep it moist for more effective healing.


Note that using antibiotic ointment will not actually speed the healing process.
Some people have skin sensitive to the ingredients in antibiotic ointment. If you notice a mild rash, discontinue use of the ointment., If you have liquid bandage handy, it’s a great way to seal up cuts and scratches and keep them from getting infection. Bring the sides of the cut together with your fingers and apply liquid bandage evenly over the cut., Use a bandage, medical gauze and tape, or a liquid bandage product to cover your cut. This will keep it clean and help you avoid infection.


Minor scratches or scrapes may be left uncovered, as exposing the injury to air will aid in healing.Liquid bandage products seal your cut after one application. They are applied by painting the bandage solution over your (thoroughly cleaned) cut and allowing time for the solution to dry and form a seal. Liquid bandages are waterproof and will last several days, falling off naturally as the cut heals. Avoid rubbing or scrubbing the site of the bandage., This should be done at least once a day, or whenever the bandage gets wet or dirty. If you are allergic to bandage adhesive, consider using paper tape, rolled gauze, or a loose elastic bandage., If you notice swelling, unusual firmness, redness, red streaks, warmth, or drainage, in the cut area, see a doctor. These are usually signs of infection."

Apply silicone gel sheets.,
Use Vaseline.,
Put sunscreen on the scar.,
Use corticosteroid injections.,
Apply aloe vera.",How to Heal Scars Fast1," Silicone gel sheets have been shown to be very effective in healing scars quickly. These can be purchased over-the-counter from a local pharmacy. Follow the instructions on the box to apply them to your scar.In most cases, silicone gel sheets should be left on the site of the scar for 12 hours or more. You’ll have to reapply another sheet the following day.
Healing time will vary from person to person. You may see your scar reduced in days, weeks, or months.;
, Vaseline (petroleum jelly) has the effect of moisturizing skin and scars. Moisture on skin will increase skin growth and regeneration. This may, in some circumstances, decrease the appearance of scars and help them heal quickly., By applying sunscreen, you’ll help reduce the chance of red or brown discoloration occurring around the cut or scar. In addition, sunscreen will protect the skin, keep it moist and promote new skin growth.


Rely on a broad-spectrum sunscreen of 30 SPF or higher.
You should continue to apply sunscreen for several weeks.
If you have dermatological issues, you may want to consult your dermatologist., Talk to your doctor about getting corticosteroid injections. By injecting corticosteroids into the site of a scar, you may be able to heal it or reduce its appearance.


Steroids undermine the bonds of collagen fibers in your skin, which will help break down scar tissue. Once the scar tissue is broken down, new skin will grow in its place., Aloe vera is widely believed to help heal cuts and scars. By applying aloe vera to your scar, you’ll promote quick healing. To use aloe vera, simply take some and rub it on your wound or scar. Apply it up to three times a day to help it heal quickly."

Apply a protective silicone sheet over the affected area.,
Use silicone sheets as prescribed by your doctor.,
Consider silicone dioxide.,
Consider cotton wool pressure dressings.",How to Prevent Keloid and Hypertrophic Scars2," Silicone sheeting is a medical device used to reduce the formation of chronic scarring. It can alter the way scars form and even reduce the thickness and roughness of the tissue.


Silicone sheets keep healing wounds moist, while reducing bacterial growth. They also reduce general itching., Normally, your doctor will tell you to apply the silicone sheeting after the wound has fully closed. If you apply them earlier, you could promote the growth of anaerobic bacteria under the skin, which will lead to greater infections. The sheet is worn on the area for 12 to 23 hours a day depending on the severity and placement of the scar. This treatment may be prescribed for up to three months., This mixture can be applied to the injured area in either a gel or a pad form. This compound is also found in silicone sheets. It will help soften the scar tissue and decrease the redness associated with the formation of a keloid scar., In burn cases, pressure garments are often used to treat specific areas. These pressure garments are worn 23 hours a day for up to one year. These dressings do not cut off air to the tissue and can be customized to the specific injury. Pressure dressings are anecdotally effective in management of hypertrophic scars and burn scars.However, there is no evidence to support the use of pressure dressings to improve the appearance of normal post-surgical scars."

Ask your doctor about steroid injections.,
Try cryotherapy.,
Ask about radiation therapy.,
Discuss surgical excision with your doctor.",How to Prevent Keloid and Hypertrophic Scars3," Steroids are injected straight into the scar tissue to help decrease itching, redness, and general discomfort. Some doctors note that the treatment of these symptoms with steroidal injections can also reduce the appearance of scars.Steroid injections (triamcinolone) are given every two to six weeks until improvement is seen. Occasionally, injections can cause a network of surface veins to develop (telangiectasias), or lightening or thinning of the surrounding skin., Research has shown that cryotherapy can decrease the thickness of the scar tissue by up to 58%. The earlier the treatment and thinner the keloid scar, the better the results. Cryotherapy is performed in the physician office using medical instruments that instantly freeze the tissue and kill it on contact.


Cryotherapy can cause burns, more scar formation and damage to nearby healthy tissue if done improperly. When cryotherapy is used to treat keloid tissue, further preventative methods must be used as the area heals, such as silicone dioxide, silicone gel sheets and steroid injections. , Another option for reducing the appearance of keloid scars is radiation therapy. Some plastic surgeons avoid this method of scar removal due to concerns about causing tumors, but studies have shown that this is a safe method as long as surrounding tissues are protected., By itself, surgery can often cause further aggravation and create more scars, but if performed in combination with a number of other treatments (e.g. silicone sheeting and silicone dioxide), surgery can reduce the visibility of such scarring. Once the surgical excision has healed, discuss the use of silicone gel sheets to reduce the recurrence of the scar formation.If you decide to go the surgical route, ask your doctor about Imiquimod. It is a cream that enhances healing and is often used after surgery to prevent scarring. The cream is applied on alternate nights for eight weeks after surgery. Although the trials have been small, the post-surgical recurrence rate averaged only 28 percent over a six- to nine-month follow-up period, with best results (2.9 percent recurrence) in low skin tension areas such as earlobes."

Look for cuff style bracelets for the most coverage. There are lots of styles available, from men's leather cuff bracelets to women's engraved silver or gold cuffs. Some stylish brands include Rustic Cuff and Fossil, but you can get original, gorgeous cuffs handmade from the craft website Etsy or even learn to make your own.

, This can hide the scars on your upper arms, and depending on the length of the sleeves can even hide scars on your wrist.Try shirts with thumb hole cuffs. This is a trendy look that helps by keeping your sleeve pulled down, so that your wrists are not inadvertently exposed. You can make your own by cutting a hole in the sleeves that are too long for you, or you can purchase them online. Just search ""shirt thumb hole"" on a retailer website like Amazon.
In summertime, look for light, gauzy material like silk or thin cotton. These are breathable to keep you cool. Be aware that if you wear long-sleeved shirts on hot summer days, you might get questions from people who are curious about why. This can also be a red flag to concerned parents., If you're a girl with scars on your thighs, a traditional swimsuit will expose them, but you can wear swimming shorts to cover them.


If the scars are at the top of your thighs, most board shorts will hide them, and since they are actually made for swimming, you're not likely to get a lot of questions from your friends.
Board shorts come in all lengths, so if your scars are lower on your thighs, try longer board shorts or even men's swimming trunks.

, If board shorts are not enough to cover your scars while swimming, there are other options for you.


You can also wear a rash-guard style swim top to cover scars on your arms while swimming. These come in short- and long-sleeved styles and are available for men and women; long-sleeved rash guard tops can cover scars even on your wrists.

Decide if a tattoo is a good option for you.,
Choose a design.,
Find a reputable tattoo artist.",How to Hide Self Harm Scars3," Tattoos are a popular way for people who no longer self harm to cover the scars permanently without completely eliminating it. You will still be able to feel the ridges of your scars under the tattoo, so it can serve as a reminder of what you've been through and where you are now.


A tattoo might be a good choice if you like the look of tattoos, are old enough (18 and up in most places), and you are in a profession where a tattoo will not negatively affect your career.
You should wait at least two years after self harming episodes have ended before getting a tattoo. This is because the scars are still healing and fresh scars do not always reliably take ink.A tattoo can be relatively simple if the scars cover a small surface area, but larger affected surfaces (like an entire thigh) will require a large, intricate tattoo, which can be more expensive and painful.
Be aware that some very substantial, large scars (from deep wounds) might not take the ink. Talk to an experienced tattoo artist about whether your scars are likely to take the ink., A tattoo is permanent, so it's important to choose something that you want to look at for the rest of your life. Depending on the amount of surface area covered by your scars, you may need a large, intricate design.


Many people who tattoo their self-harm scars choose a custom design that represents survival, overcoming, newfound confidence, or another positive perspective on life. This can be a great way to turn something that was once negative into something positive, and reclaim your body.Try searching online for search terms like ""tattoos to cover self harm scars."" Some ideas include a phoenix, a mythological bird who dies and is reborn from its own ashes; a verse of poetry or other inspiring words like ""hope,"" or ""just when the caterpillar thought the world was over, she became a butterfly""; a bird escaping from a cage; or any intricate, beautiful design that you love.

, Most people find their tattoo artist by asking someone who has had work done that they admire. If you don't know anyone, feel free to start a conversation with a stranger and compliment them on their art. Most people with tattoos like to know that others find it as gorgeous as they do.Check out potential artists' studios in person, and make sure everything is clean up to date on inspections and relevant certifications (depending on where you live, this will vary). Ask to see a portfolio of pieces the artist has done recently. Find out if the artist has any experience covering scars. If not, ask if they know someone who does; tattoo artists tend to have large networks and want you to get the best work for your needs.

Make the decision to show your scars.,
Start small.,
Practice responding to comments.",How to Hide Self Harm Scars5," Most people who hide their scars are still self-harming, but making the decision to stop hiding your scars can help you gain confidence, be open about your struggles, and even spread awareness that self-harm is a serious condition that affects many people.

, You don't have to just start wearing spaghetti straps or shorts that show off your scars to just anyone. You can ease yourself into it by choosing to expose your scars in certain situations, or to certain people you trust at first, with the goal of gaining enough confidence to ditch the makeup and extra clothes for good.


Consider showing your scars at home. After school or work, take off the extra clothing or makeup and just be yourself, scars and all. This can be a tough step if your parents or roommates do not know that you have harmed yourself. You might want to start by telling them you harmed yourself.Pick a day to go public. One day a week, don't take any extra steps to hide your scars. Whether it’s a weekday or weekend day is up to you., One reason many people are hesitant to expose their scars to others is for fear of what people might say. It's true, many people might make rude or uncomfortable comments if they see your scars. Knowing how to respond in the moment can help make you feel more at ease. Your response will likely vary depending on who is commenting (is it your boss, a child, your grandmother, a stranger?) and why (are they curious, ignorant, or purposely trying to hurt you.


One option is to ignore them completely. Your body is nobody else's business, and you are totally justified in ignoring rude or personal comments, just like you would ignore comments about your body size or facial features.
Tell the commenter the truth. If someone asks what your scars are from, you have the option of telling them the truth, but in an appropriately abbreviated form. You may not have the time or desire to tell your whole, personal story, and that's OK (it's really not their business anyway). But you can say, ""I cut myself,"" or ""I used to cut myself when I was struggling"" and leave it at that. Most people won't press for more details.
Tell the commenter to mind his own business. You can do this in a polite or not-so-polite way, depending on how you prefer to respond, who the person is, what their relationship is to you, and whether they were polite to you or not. One polite way to respond would be to say, ""I really don't feel comfortable talking about that."" A less polite but still effective option is, ""That is not your business.""
Try a sarcastic, humorous, or biting response. If someone is rude in their approach, giving them a taste of their own medicine can help them see how misguided their questions are. Try something like ""Do you always ask other people personal questions, or am I just lucky?"" or ""These scars? I was attacked by a herd of rabid caterpillars."" Then roll your eyes and walk away.

Wear long-sleeved shirts or pants.,
Wear bracelets or a watch.,
Use makeup to cover minor cuts and scratches.,
Make your bandage a fashion statement.",How to Hide Cuts2," If you have cuts or scratches on your arms or legs, long-sleeved shirts or pants are an easy way to hide them without looking too obvious. Women may consider wearing thick tights under skirts. During the summer months, consider lightweight garments and cover-ups such as lace tops, ""burnout"" fabrics, maxi skirts, capri pants, or surfer shorts.Wear a clean bandage under your clothes to keep them from rubbing and irritating the cut.

, If you have a cut on your wrist area, a chunky bangle or watch will help hide it. Wear a bandage under the jewelry to keep the cut from getting irritated.

, If you have shallow scratches or cuts on your arms or legs, such as those made by a cat, you can use makeup to cover them up. Select one that has yellow and pink undertones for the best match.You can use a liner brush and concealer that’s a little darker than your skin tone to dab the makeup over the area.
Don’t use makeup on a fresh wound or a deep cut, as this can cause infection.

, Purchase bandages in fun prints or patterns to ""hide"" your cut in plain view. A favorite cartoon character or print might help boost your mood, as well.

"
Rinse the cut with cold water.,
Apply an ice cube to the area.,
Apply lip balm or nick gel to the cut.,
Apply concealer to the area.",How to Hide Cuts3," Don’t use soap and don’t rub your face with a washcloth, as the skin on your face is usually very thin and irritates easily. Instead, gently splash the cold water on your face.

, The cold will help shrink blood vessels and allow the cut to stop bleeding.


Eye drops such as Visine may have a similar effect., While “shaving nick balms” are available for purchase, basic lip balm works as well. These products help seal the cut and prevent it from getting infected. Allow this to dry for a few minutes.Use an unflavored, uncolored lip balm for best results. You can also use unscented petroleum jelly.

, Pick a concealer that’s either the same shade as your skin or a shade lighter.


Use a q-tip or liner brush to gently dab concealer onto the center of the cut.
Blend the concealer by dabbing the brush onto the cut, or use your finger to blend the concealer outwards towards the edges.
Set the concealer with powder. Pick a translucent or colorless powder so that you don’t draw extra attention to the area. Use a puff or powder brush to dab the powder over the cut, then blend using sweeping circular motions.

"
"
Use sunscreen.,
Apply petroleum jelly.,
Consider purchasing silicon gel sheeting.",How to Hide Cuts4," A sunscreen with zinc or titanium dioxide will block the UVA and UVB rays that can cause any scar from your cut to develop hyperpigmentation, or excessive color change as a result of sun exposure.

, While various companies sell expensive creams proclaiming that their ingredients will reduce scarring, there is little evidence that these vitamin E or cocoa butter-based products work better than simple petroleum jelly. The key to reducing scarring is keeping your scab moist, and petroleum jelly accomplishes this well.

, This product is available at many pharmacies and is applied daily. Bear in mind this is not a short-term solution; silicon gel sheeting should be used at least three months to produce optimum results."

Understand why you might be cutting yourself.,
Seek help.,
Recognize you have great worth.",How to Hide Cuts5," Self-cutting behavior usually emerges during your teen years, though some kids begin doing so as early as age 11 or 12. Recognizing what causes you to cut might provide some hints as to how you might seek help.


Powerful, overwhelming emotions. Does cutting feel like the only way you can express or interrupt feelings that are too overwhelming to ignore? Do you feel pressure to be perfect, or like you can never measure up? Do you feel others are placing you under unbearable pressure? Does cutting help you ""feel"" pain that comes from other trauma in your life?
A need to focus pain on something specific and visible. Do you feel like you need to gain control over the source of your pain? Is cutting something that can replace invisible -- but very real -- inner pain?
A sense of relief. Do you feel feel relieved when you cut? You might be benefiting from endorphins, hormones that are released during both physical exertion and injury. Alternatively, actually ""seeing"" the emotional pain you feel may provide you with a sense of relief.
Feeling addicted to cutting. Do you feel like you've formed a habit of cutting? Does it take more self-injury to accomplish the same sense of release or relief?
Other mental health concerns. Are you experiencing symptoms of other mental health issues such as depression, bipolar disorder, or other personality disorders? Are you experiencing post-traumatic stress?
Peer pressure. Are others influencing you to try self-cutting? Are you cutting to win the approval of a friend, or to be accepted by a group?, If you are engaging in self-cutting for any of the reasons outlined, you need to seek treatment. Your health and well-being are important. Speak with a trusted friend or loved one, or consider going to a school counselor or health center -- anywhere you feel safe.


Develop a ""quit date,"" and seek the help of family and/or friends in holding you to your commitment.
Substitute positive behaviors. If you find you experience a sense of relief through cutting, for example, lace on your running or walking shoes when you feel the urge to cut and get outside for some exercise. Can you replace the endorphin rush of cutting with the endorphin rush of jogging? If friends are pushing you to cut, remove yourself from the situation by joining a new club or activity.
Obtain therapeutic treatment to address the underlying factors contributing to your self-cutting behavior. Your therapist will help you understand why you're cutting and work with you to find better ways to cope with your sources of stress and emotional turmoil. They will also be able to diagnose underlying mental health conditions that could impact your desire to self-harm.
Consider a self-harm rehabilitation center if you're really struggling with this medical condition. You'll find support and friendship in this group setting and develop valuable coping tools., It's vital that you commit yourself fully to overcoming your self-cutting behavior.Your therapist can help you develop positive coping behaviors and tools to recognize the many wonderful attributes you bring to this world. You are a valuable person.

Avoid using Vitamin E. While many people believe that Vitamin E helps scars, it can actually cause rashes or irritation.,
Don’t use hydrogen peroxide.,
Cover your cut.,
Avoid frequent sun exposure.",How to Heal Scars Fast2," To be safe, don't put Vitamin E oil, gel, or capsules on your scar., Hydrogen peroxide has the effect of destroying skin cells. By using hydrogen peroxide, you’ll inhibit the growth of healthy cells and prolong the longevity of a scar.


Instead of using hydrogen peroxide to clean a wound, try antibiotic ointment or aloe vera., Many people recommend allowing a cut or scar to “breathe.” Unfortunately, this has the impact of inhibiting cell growth. Instead, cover your cut and keep it moist with aloe vera or something similar.


Use an adhesive bandage or gauze to cover the cut or scar., Whenever a wound or scar is healing, you should stay out of the sun. Sun exposure could undermine the ability of the skin to heal correctly. It could make the scar worse. As a result, if you must go outside, make sure to wear a wide-brimmed hat, long clothes, and sunscreen."

Get a tan.,
Start toning your legs.,
Strength train.,
Try anti-cellulite clothing.",How to Help Make Cellulite Less Visible1," Whether it’s a spray tan or a natural one, tanned butts and legs don’t show cellulite as much.


If you already have a dark complexion, you’re lucky because darker skin doesn’t show cellulite as much as pale skin does.
Always take caution when tanning, though. The sun’s rays can lead to skin cancer, so it's usually a better choice to get an authentic looking fake tan. There are many ways to do this: airbrush or booth spray tanning at a salon and home products such as foam, lotion, or spray.
When applying tanning lotion, start by exfoliating the skin with a body scrub, as well as shaving any areas where you don't want hair. Then, using gloves, apply the lotion all over your body, starting with the head area, and taking care not to get it into your eyes. Apply petroleum jelly to your eyebrows to prevent them from becoming discolored.When spray tanning, it’s very important that you wear recommended protective gear (over eyes, nose, and other body openings) so you don’t ingest the tanning particles during the process.If using a booth, you will be instructed to turn inside the booth as a nozzle sprays you with the solution.;
, While genetics might make you more susceptible to cellulite, toned legs with strong muscle definition tend to show cellulite less.


Run up a staircase, go for a long walk or jog, and use a stair master or elliptical trainer. All of these exercises and equipment target the leg and butt areas where cellulite resides.
Contrary to popular myth, cellulite is not caused by toxins in the body. It’s caused by a lack of exercise and muscle tone, excess fat, poor circulation, genetics and hormones.
Leg lifts and squats are among the exercises that can help you tone your legs., Although running and other cardio can reduce your weight, which can make cellulite less obvious, strength training will be best at getting rid of the dimpled look.


Yoga routines help tone the body and reduce the appearance of cellulite, as do strength-training routines that build muscle.
Studies have shown that people who combine cardio with strength training (weight lifting, some circuit training routines) added muscle in addition to losing fat, and improved the overall look of their bodies.
As little as 15 minutes of cardio (such as running) and 15 minutes of strength training (such as weight lifting) three times a week can make a difference over time (at least eight weeks).

, It doesn’t work for everyone, but some clothing manufacturers make clothing marketed to reduce the look of cellulite.


These pieces of clothing, such as capri leggings, are designed to generate heat that in turn helps break down cellulite cells.
Elastic underwear has the opposite effect; it can make cellulite look worse. Wear non-elastic undergarments made of smooth fabric.
Loose fitting clothing helps reduce cellulite because tighter clothing impairs blood flow throughout the day.

Add a skin firming serum, body lotion or anti-cellulite gel before you apply the massaging motions. Cellulite is caused by fat deposits that push through the skin’s connective tissue, usually in the buttocks and thighs.Massaging the skin stimulates the lymphatic system that lies right underneath the skin’s surface. This circulates toxins and causes the body to release them more quickly. Add a few drops of olive and juniper oil to the skin before massaging it."

Apply your self-tanner of choice all over your legs. Do not use it merely on the back of your thighs, since doing so will cause your skin to look uneven and only draw attention to the area.

, As with any other type of fat, getting rid of unwanted cellulite in your thighs begins with eating a balanced diet filled with foods that can help you shed fat cells.


Fiber, which can be obtained in large quantities from whole grains, fruits, and leafy vegetables, regulates your body and helps clear waste and toxins out through the intestines.
Protein, which can be found in meats and nuts, can help repair broken and damaged collagen and connective tissues. As a result, your skin becomes firmer, and the dimpled, wrinkled cellulite in the back of your thighs will be reduced. In general, sources of lean protein like fish are preferred over fatty protein sources like red meat.
You should also avoid saturated fats and trans fats as much as possible. In particular, avoid “junk food” like greasy fast food, potato chips, and candy, since junk food tends to be high in trans fats.

, In order to get rid of cellulite, you need to burn fat. In order to burn fat, you need to burn more calories than you consume.


Determine your ideal weight based on your BMI, or body mass index.
If you exercise three to four times weekly for at least 60 minutes, multiply your goal weight by 15. If you do not exercise, multiply it by 13. If you exercise an hour a day or more, multiply by 20. The product equals the number of daily calories you should aim to consume.Pay attention to the number of calories you consume at the end of one week. Subtract the number of daily calories you should consume from this amount to determine how many calories you need to work on cutting out of your diet to lose weight and shed fat.

, More water will help your body shed toxins and fat, so cellulite all over your body will be reduced, including the cellulite gathering in your thighs.


Water can also improve the strength of collagen and connective tissue in your skin, making your skin much firmer. This can help reduce the wrinkled appearance of collagen and create a smoother look on the back of your thighs.
You should try to increase the amount of water you drink on a daily basis. The optimal amount for the human body is eight 8-oz (250-ml) glasses of water, but most people do not get this amount. Increase your intake to this ideal if you have not yet reached it. If you already drink this much water, consider drinking another glass or two extra.

, Any walk or other form of cardiovascular exercise will do the trick, though. Cardiovascular exercise improves circulation, allowing you to burn off more fat overall.


Other simple types of cardiovascular activity include jogging, swimming, and jump-roping.
Try to perform cardiovascular exercise a few times weekly for optimal results.
If you plan to walk off the excess cellulite on your thighs, try to walk 45 to 60 minutes each evening for six evenings, giving yourself one day of rest. Walk at a brisk pace, but go at a rate that feels comfortable for you. Keep at it with your shoulders back and your head up, but slow down if your legs get stiff or if you feel dizzy and out of breath.

, Aside from exercises that get your blood pumping, exercises that can help build muscles in your thighs can help tone your legs and minimize the appearance of fat that gathers there.


Effective weight training will target your thighs and lower body overall. There are many different types of exercises you could try, but only a few are noted in this article.

, Raise your legs, starting at a spot just a bit above your knees, so that your feet are 4 inches (10 cm) or so off the ground.


Your neck and head should not be flat on the ground, but you should not bend them back unnaturally, either. Keep your head slightly up, still facing downward at an angle, however, and fold your arms in front of you for the duration of the exercise.

, Slowly bend your knees while keeping them off the ground. Hold the position for 5 seconds when you start out.


Eventually, you should try to hold the position for 15 seconds.
Your knees should not be quite perpendicular to the floor.

, Gradually unbend your knees, straightening the leg out as you go. Finish by lowering your straight legs back down to the ground.


Repeat 10 times or so during each routine.

, Your forearms should be flat against the ground and your shins should be nearly flat against the ground, as well.


Keep your head, neck, and back in a natural position. They should be straight without being rigid, and your back should angle down slightly toward your front half.

, You should try to raise the thigh to about 45 degrees. Your knee should be bent, and your heel should face upward.


Keep your back straight as you lift you leg.
Hold yourself in this position for five seconds.

, Slowly lower your left leg to your starting position. Once lowered, lift the left leg again in the same manner.


This exercise should be repeated at least five times during a routine with one leg.

, When you have finished exercising your left leg, repeat the same steps using your right leg.


You should lift your right leg the same number of times you lifted your left leg.

, You should stand up straight, with your heels approximately 12 inches (30.5 cm) away from the wall.


Your feet should also be about shoulder-width apart.

, Ease your body backward and downward simultaneously until you hit the wall. Your posture should resemble the position you would be in while sitting in a chair.


In other words, your thighs should be perpendicular to the floor.

, Stay in this position for 30 to 120 seconds. When done, carefully stand back up to your starting position.


You may need to use your arms to help stabilize yourself against the wall as you return to a standing position.

, Laser therapy liquifies the fat, driving it into your lymph system, from where it can be eliminated.


Note that results can vary, but are generally minimal and only temporary.
Laser treatments can help reduce the amount of fat below the skin and cause the skin the look firmer afterward, but treatments will need to be repeated every few months to maintain the appearance.

, Liposuction is occasionally attempted for the elimination of cellulite, but this expensive surgical procedure can actually make the problem worse instead of better.


Liposuction tends to remove deep layers of fat. Fat linked to cellulite tends to lie directly below the skin, however. When these deep layers of fat are removed, your skin and the fat below it no longer have any ""padding"" to dampen the effect and appearance of cellulite. As such, the wrinkling can get worse., If you are still concerned about the cellulite on the back of your thighs, schedule an appointment with your doctor to talk about other healthy ways to get rid of it.


Your doctor may discuss plastic surgery with you, but he or she will likely focus on natural lifestyle changes or drugs that can assist you in your fight against cellulite. Talking to a doctor is a good choice to make if you are lost and needing further guidance on how to establish a diet, exercise, and lifestyle routine capable of reducing the harsh appearance of cellulite on the back of your thighs.

Taking Vitamin C pills. If you chose to do it this way, you should take 250 mg/day. Do not go beyond this amount.;
, Since your skin is basically composed of Retinol, which is Vitamin A, this will help keep your skin healthy and strong. If you feel your skin is weak or not tight enough, that usually suggests a lack of Vitamin A.


Foods that are high in Vitamin A include nonfat milk, oysters, and egg yolks. You can also get Vitamin A by eating foods that are high in beta carotene, which will help minimize the effects of sun damage to your skin. These include carrots, watermelon, papaya, tomatoes, or other dark colored produce.

, Apply sunscreen with a minimum of SPF 15 whenever you are outdoors. UVA/UVB rays are known to be harmful to your skin because they slow down your body's ability to repair damaged skin cells and clear dead ones. Pollution is also a major cause of acne and dull skin tone.

, Skin lightening products with hydroquinone or kojic acid reduce the amount of melanin in the skin when applied.These can be effective, but they come with certain risks:


Skin whitening products have been associated with toxic levels of mercury, and therefore, with mercury poisoning. The FDA regulates the use of hydroquinone in the U.S, and so it's relatively safe. 1 out of every 4 skin whitening agents from China, however, contains mercury, and so should be used with caution.Be careful about sun exposure when using skin whitening agents. Prolonged sun exposure can lead to skin cancer.Always use appropriate sunscreen and other sun protection when exposed to sunlight.
Bleaching agents can cause irritation and allergic reactions in some people. Bleaching agents with steroids, such as kojic acid, may put you at risk for health problems associated with steroid use.

Avoid exposure to sunlight. When using lemon and other skin-lightening products, always use sunscreen and avoid unnecessary time in the sun. Lemons and lemon juice can dry out skin, making it susceptible to sun damage.
Try using lemon or lemon juice only every other day. Lightening your skin with lemon juice will take a long time, so it's tempting to try to apply a mask or lemon juice every day. Try to stick to 3-4 applications every week. Lemon juice dries out the skin too much to apply every day.
Be aware of what products you put on your skin. Much of what you put on your skin gets absorbed into your body. If you are using other ingredients in addition to lemon juice as a peel, a wash, a lotion, or a mask, use good judgment about whether you'd want it in your bloodstream.

Apply light blush for a subtle glow.,
Apply medium blush to define your cheeks.,
Apply heavy blush for a bold effect.",How to Get Pink Cheeks1," Let's face it — sometimes, cheeks just refuse to be cooperative. If you can't get pinker cheeks with the tricks above, try using a little blush to give your cheeks a boost! Start light by adding just a little blush. Remember, you can easily add more, but it can be a pain to remove your blush and start over if you add too much.


There's no single ""right"" type of makeup to use — what looks good on one person may not look good on another. However, if you're a makeup beginner, it's generally a good idea to start with a mild pink blush, which can contain hints of gold or peach if you like. These shades are a good general choice because they complement nearly all skin tones.
See our blush article for tips on applying your makeup.;
, The more blush you add, the more noticeable your ""rosy cheek"" effect will be. If you'd like to bring out your cheeks a little more after applying your first light dusting,feel free to do so, but be wary of applying too much.


As a general rule, people with very light skin should be careful about the amount of blush they apply. Because a pale complexion makes makeup more noticeable, it can be easy to use too much blush (though there are plenty of exceptions to this rule.)

, Applying lots of blush will certainly give you rosy cheeks, but if you don't balance your blush with the rest of your makeup and your outfit, it can easily distract from your natural beauty. Overly-heavy applications of blush can give an artificial, doll-like appearance, especially to people with very light skin.

Wash your face twice daily.,
Find a moisturizer that works for you.,
Clean off any makeup before bed.,
Exfoliate your skin.",How to Have a Healthy Looking Glow1," Wash your face when you wake up and again before you go to bed. Do not wash your face more than twice a day because this can actually cause irritation and dryness.The natural oils produced by your skin are healthy and may help to create a natural glow. However, this may not be the case for all people. Use a gentle face soap and water to ensure that you remove all the dirt, dead skin cells, and grime from your face.Spend time testing out different cleansing products until you find one that works well for your skin.When washing your face, rinse your skin off with cold water. This should be done in order to close your pores and block unwanted bacteria from entering your skin and causing acne.;
, In order to find a moisturizer that works well for you, you need to understand your skin type. Typically there are three types of skin: dry, oily, and normal/combination. Moisturizers are very important for keeping your skin balanced. If your skin is too dry it can result in the overproduction of sebum, which is produced to prevent your skin and hair from drying out.Overly dry skin, just like oily skin, can result in the development of acne. Normal/combination skin is typically characterized by an oily t-zone (the area around your forehead, nose, and chin) and drier cheeks. This requires a light moisturizer applied to specific areas.Try a little moisturizer on tougher skin, such as around the elbow area, before using it everywhere. If you have a reaction to the moisturizer it will be confined to that small portion of skin and you can look for a more sensitive moisturizer.

, If you use makeup, always remove the makeup before going to sleep each night. Makeup can contain harsh chemicals that may damage your skin. It can also attract dirt and clog your pores, resulting in the development of acne and pimples. As a result it is important that you remove makeup from your skin, eyes, and lips using a mild soap and water solution. This will help keep your skin fresh and blemish free, resulting in a healthier glow. Test out these natural solutions for removing makeup:Honey and baking soda: put a drop of honey on a washcloth and sprinkle with a little baking soda in order to create a natural makeup remover.Olive Oil: can be used as a makeup remover and is highly recommended for people with dry skin because it will also help to moisturize your skin.Baby wipes: are very sensitive on the skin and do not contain as many chemicals as most commercial makeup removers. This is a simple and easy way to remove makeup., It is important that you periodically exfoliate in order to remove dead skin cells and keep your skin smooth, fresh, and glowing. Try using a natural exfoliant, such as oats, orange peels, or lentil powder to remove dead skin, dust, dirt, and blackheads from your face. You should begin by exfoliating your skin once or twice a week. Then watch to see how your skin reacts. If you skin becomes red and tender you should exfoliate less and if your skin looks rough and dull you can increase your frequency of exfoliating.You should exfoliate your entire body, not just your face. This can be done in the shower using a loofah.
Tougher areas such as heels can be rubbed more vigorously using a pumice stone. This will remove dead skin and buff up the new skin, giving you a healthy glow.

Avoid UV exposure.,
Wear sunscreen.,
Wear protective clothing.",How to Get Pale Skin1," People who live closer to the equator are exposed to more ultra-violet (UV) radiation, so their cells produce more melanin. This excess melanin leads to a darker skin pigmentation that helps the skin protect itself from UV damage. Keeping out of the sun will keep skin from producing extra melanin, which may help the pigment return to a paler state. If your skin is naturally dark, however, staying out of the sun won't do much.


Keep out of the sun as much as possible, especially in the late morning and afternoon.If you must be outside while the sun is brightest, try to stick to the shade.
Try carrying an umbrella to protect yourself the sun. A regular black umbrella that’s designed to keep you dry in the rain will also block out at least 90 percent of UV rays.Remember that sunlight and UV rays bounce off concrete, water, sand, snow, and other surfaces. Be aware of your environment!;
, Choose a broad-spectrum sunscreen that protects against UVA (rays that age your skin) and UVB (rays that burn your skin).Find a sunscreen with an SPF (sun-protection factor) between 30 and 50. Any SPF above 50 is not significantly more effective, so don’t worry about finding the highest number.You are still exposed to UV rays in winter, even though it's cooler. Wear sunscreen every day of the year, especially if you enjoy winter sports at high elevations.

, Most summer-weight clothing (e.g. cotton garments) does not provide a measurable amount of sun protection. Look for clothes with a UPF (ultraviolet protection) rating. Choose clothes with long sleeves, long hems, and high collars. Consider wearing sunglasses, gloves, and wide-brimmed hats.


The sun is necessary for vitamin D production, but most people don’t need more than 20 minutes of uncovered exposure."
"
Protect yourself from the sun.,
Exfoliate your skin a few times a week.,
Be realistic with your expectations.",How to Get Fair Skin Naturally1," Most of the normal darkening and discoloration of your skin is caused by exposure to the sun's ultraviolet (UV) rays. If you're extremely concerned about having fairer skin, staying indoors will keep your skin as light as possible. When that's not possible, protect your skin use SPF sunblock with a minimum SPF of 30.


Most dermatologists agree an SPF 15 is not sufficient anymore. Dangerous UVA and UVB rays are still reaching your skin. You want 98% or more of the sun's rays to be blocked.
Wear a hat to protect your face when you're outside. Especially in the summer. There are so many fashionable hats these days, you can also be a trend-setter while you are protecting your skin.;
, Doing manual exfoliation can really help to lighten the skin, since the process takes off dead skin cells. Keep in mind that exfoliation only helps if your current skin is darker than your normal skin tone, because it reveals fresh skin that is untouched by the sun.


You can exfoliate your skin manually by using a body scrub or face wash with exfoliating particles. To make your own, just add a teaspoon of ground almonds or oatmeal to your regular cleanser.
Using a scrub brush or a dry brush is a great way to exfoliate your entire body. For your face, use a special brush with softer bristles so you don't damage the fragile skin there.
There are also exfoliating machines, such as the Clarisonic, that dig a little deeper to thoroughly remove the top layer of skin.

, Skin that is already naturally dark is very hard to lighten more than a shade or two, especially using natural methods. Keeping your skin healthy by protecting it from the sun, exfoliating and using natural lightening methods is your best bet for keeping it on the lighter side in tone. Remember that consistency is the key, and do your facial treatments several times a week.

If you do purchase an over-the-counter product be sure that it does not contain mercury, and only has 2% hydroquinone for best results.


It is important that you follow the instructions provided with the cream very carefully to avoid causing damage to your skin.
Be aware that using a skin lightening cream comes with its own risks. In many skin lightening products, the active ingredient is mercury. If you use too much of the cream, or if you use it too often, you could be poisoned by the mercury.Skin lighteners may also contain steroids, which can cause long-term health problems if used in excess. Many skin lighteners also use hydroquinone, which can cause unwanted skin discoloration if used improperly., Unless your skin is very dry, you can wash your face in the morning and just before you go to bed at night with a gentle cleanser.This will help you get rid of any dirt and other bacteria that has accumulated on your skin, and which could clog your pores.


When washing your face, use lukewarm water to wet your face, apply a small amount of cleanser to your hands, and gently massage your skin using circular motions.Be sure to rinse your skin carefully, using lukewarm running water. When you are finished pat your skin dry with a clean towel. Don’t rub your skin dry as this can cause irritation.
Be sure to choose a cleanser that is fragrance-free (which might irritate your skin), free from parabens (which are toxic), and soap (which can be drying for the skin).

, Choose a daily moisturizer that has an SPF. In order to avoid potential irritation, look for gentle moisturizers that are fragrance-free and non-comedogenic. You should apply moisturizer just after you’ve washed your face.


Use a quarter-sized amount so that you don’t overdo it, and apply the moisturizer from the center of your face and gently sweep it outwards.If you want to, you can look for a night time moisturizer (that doesn’t have an SPF), and will usually be a bit thicker and more heavy duty than the date time moisturizer. Again, be sure to look for gentle moisturizers that are fragrance-free and non-comedogenic.

, Picking at your skin will result in redness, irritation, and even pimples. Do your best to keep your hands off of your face as much as possible throughout the day. When you touch your face, you are spreading the bacteria and germs that are on your hands to your face.If you find that you have a pimple, leave it alone. You can dab a bit of salicylic acid, benzoyl peroxide, or tea tree oil on the pimple, but don’t pop it. This could cause scarring and redness.

, If you want to, you can use makeup to make your skin look more luminous.

, You may not realize it, but your skin is an organ just like your heart and lungs. This means that it is made up of cells. These cells are made of water. This is why you need to drink plenty of water. If you aren’t getting enough water, your skin will feel tight and flaky.The water that you drink is usually sent to all of your other organs before it is sent to your skin, which is why you have to use moisturizers to keep your skin supple.
If you don’t enjoy drinking plain water, try making flavored water using things like lemons, oranges, cucumbers, or strawberries. This will make the water taste great without the sugar and calories of soda.

, Most drugstores sell exfoliating scrubs designed specifically for the skin on your body. You can also make your own salt scrub at home using just salt and an oil (e.g. coconut oil or olive oil).When you exfoliate your skin, it’s easiest to do it in the shower. Wet your skin first. Scoop out a handful of scrub, and rub your hands in circular motions all over your body.
You don’t need to exfoliate more than once per week. Over exfoliating can cause irritation and redness.

, Applying moisturizer all over your body will keep your skin glowing. Choose one moisturizer specifically for your face, and another for your body. If you have sensitive skin, it is a good idea to stick to moisturizers that are fragrance-free.Try out moisturizers to find one that you like.
Apply moisturizer just after you get out of the shower or bath when your pores are the most open. This will allow your skin to absorb maximum moisture."

Exfoliate.,
Give yourself a facial massage.,
Exercise!,
Stay warm.,
Rinse your face with warm water.",How to Get Pink Cheeks2," Many beauty magazines recommend a regular regimen of facial exfoliation to keep your cheeks pink. The reasoning behind this is that exfoliation helps remove dead skin cells that can give your face a ""dull,"" cold appearance.


If you have one, try using an exfoliating cream or rub (preferably one that contains a moisturizer) to clean your face every morning.
If you don't, no worries — you can make your own with olive oil and sugar.

, Another trick that beauticians will sometimes recommend for giving yourself pink cheeks is a facial massage. Massages improve circulation and increase blood flow to the area you massage, giving the impression of pinker cheeks.While this solution is a temporary one, it's one that's very quick and easy to do on your own.


To give yourself a facial massage, close your eyes, get into a comfortable position, and bring your hands up to your face. Use the tips of your fingers to press into the skin of your face, starting at the top of your forehead and gradually working your way down to your chin. Spend extra time on your cheeks, gently kneading and pressing them to increase blood flow.

, One sure-fire way to get your cheeks nice and red is to simply do a little exercise. It's no secret that activities like playing sports, jogging, lifting weights, and doing calisthenics can make you flushed — generally, the more intense the exercise, the brighter your cheeks will be.


Note however, that a regular exercise routine can actually make it harder for you to get rosy cheeks in the long run. If you're able to reduce your blood pressure with steady exercise (which, by the way, is a good thing!), the capillaries in your cheeks responsible for giving you pink cheeks won't fill with blood during exercise as easily.

, Keeping yourself warm and cozy in cold weather can sometime have the side effect of giving you pink cheeks. When your body temperature is hot, the body automatically redirects blood from the inside of your body to the blood vessels near the surface. This blood causes your cheeks (and likely other parts of your body) to get a reddish or pinkish tinge.


Don't go overboard here — wearing a warm coat in winter is a good idea, but deliberately subjecting yourself to uncomfortably high temperatures can be unsafe. Cool off right away if you start to sweat profusely or feel light-headed.

, A nice facial rinse doesn't just feel great — it can also give your cheeks a ""splash"" of pink! Heating up the skin of your face with warm water causes the body to direct more blood there. This extra blood can make your cheeks a little pinker with very little effort on your part.

Use beetroot.,
Add grape or pomegranate juice to your face rub for color.,
Apply vegetable oil to give your cheeks a healthy glow.,
Use a rose petal rub.",How to Get Pink Cheeks3," Don't want to shell out your hard-earned cash on expensive makeup? Try one of these home remedies. You may already have the ingredients in your kitchen (at worst, you may need to make a trip to the grocery store.) For example, beetroot, which is often sold at health food stores, contains a powerful red pigment — in fact, earlier in history, it was used as a dye. Carefully rubbing beetroot on your cheeks can give them a subtle pink hue, though it's important not to over-apply this strong dye.


Be gentle when using beetroot, as its natural dyes can easily stain fabrics.
Remove beetroot from your cheeks by rubbing with a slice of lemon., Mixing just a splash of a red-colored fruit juice (like grape or pomegranate) into your daily facial rub or lotion is one easy way to give your product mild ""rosy"" properties. Plus, it usually smells great. Add only a small dash of your juice — no more than a teaspoon or so. Using too much can leave you with a watery rub that leaves your cheeks feeling sticky once it dries.

, Mild, non-greasy vegetable oils have long been used to give the skin an attractive natural ""glow."" In fact, the ancient Romans used olive oil as a sort of skin lotion to make themselves look good after bathing.You can get the same effect today by rubbing a small dot of vegetable oil into each cheek — the natural sheen you get will bring out your cheeks' gorgeous natural complexion. Below are a few oils that are generally safe for this sort of use:Grapeseed oil
Olive oil
Sunflower oil
Apricot kernel oil

Note:If you get acne easily, you may want to be cautious with this method, as some greasier oils can clog pores and lead to outbreaks.

, If you're looking to pamper yourself, consider a rose petal rub. The natural pigments in the petals will help add color to your cheeks and, if you're using petals from a fragrant rose, they'll have a natural perfuming effect.


To make your rose petal rub, combine about half a cup of rose petals with 1 cup of sugar, 1/2 cup of virgin coconut oil (or one of the oils above), and about 20 drops of essential rose oil if you have it. Mix the ingredients, grinding the rose petals into the mixture as you go (a mortar and pestle or food processor can be helpful here.) Gently rub the mixture onto your cheeks after bathing, then rinse off and pat dry."

Try eating a fruit-and-vegetable rich diet.,
Try vinegar.,
Try a lemon-honey rub.,
Try drinking plenty of water.,
Try taking vitamins E and C. Though their effectiveness isn't certain, vitamin supplements appear in many, many lists of rosy cheek home remedies.",How to Get Pink Cheeks4," Some sources claim that a diet rich in plant products can encourage rosy cheeks. The logic behind this method is that the vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients in these foods help the body ""stay healthy"" and promote good blood flow.In particular, green vegetables like broccoli, spinach, kale, and so on are prized because of their iron content (iron has a natural red hue — it's what makes your blood red.)

, Vinegar is a substance that appears in many supposed home remedies. According to this method's supporters, vinegar cleans, rejuvenates, and ""detoxifies"" the skin. In addition, vinegar is claimed to promote good blood flow.Be sure to rinse your skin after using vinegar to eliminate the unpleasant smell.


Use white vinegar or apple cider vinegar, not balsamic or red wine vinegar. Though the latter two have natural reddish hues, they can leave your skin feeling sticky afterwards.

, According to some, lemon juice's natural acidic properties make it a great choice for getting your skin looking great.The logic behind these claims is usually that the acid acts as a cleaning, ""purifying"" agent, leaving the skin feeling (and looking) clear and refreshed.


To make a lemon-honey rub, mix a quarter cup of lemon juice with three-quarters cups of sugar and about a tablespoon of honey. Rub the mixture onto your cheeks, allow it to sit for about one minute, then remove it and rinse your face. This rub makes a great exfoliation product as well.

, According to some sites, simply staying well-hydrated can help keep your cheeks rosy.Drinking plenty of water does have several minor health benefits, including making the skin appear slightly more ""full"" and supple.By this logic, drinking plenty of water can give you an attractive set of cheeks by bringing out their natural shape, which may make them appear rosier.


While everyone's needs are different, most health authorities will recommend about eight 8-ounce glasses of water per day (about two liters total) for optimal health., These vitamins are claimed to increase the elasticity and suppleness of the skin, leading to a healthier overall appearance and a natural ""glow.""



Note: Vitamin E is a fat-soluble vitamin, which means that it takes a long time for your body to get rid of. Because of this, it's possible to poison yourself if you take lots of vitamin E supplements (the amount you get from your daily food shouldn't ever be dangerous.) As a very general rule, adults shouldn't take more than 400 IU (International Units) of vitamin E per day — using more than this can cause serious side effects.On the other hand, it's very difficult to take unhealthy amounts of vitamin C because it is water-soluble, which means it's easy for your body to get rid of.

Rub your skin with raw potato.,
Make a turmeric paste.,
Use pure aloe vera.,

Understand what skin tone means.,
Look at the color of the veins on the inside of your wrist.,
Consider how your skin normally reacts to the sun.,
Hold a white piece of paper up to your face.,
Use gold and silver foil or jewelry to find your skin tone.,
Ask a friend to look at the skin behind your ear.",How to Determine Skin Tone1," Your skin tone, or undertone, does not refer to the shade of your skin (light, medium, dark)--that is your complexion, or the surface color of your skin. Your skin tone is determined by the amount of melanin, or pigment, in your skin and does not change from sun exposure or skin conditions like rosacea or acne.So while a person's skin may become pale in the winter and a rich brown in the summer, their skin tone will remain the same.


Your skin tone will be one of the following: cool, warm, or neutral.Keep in mind your skin tone does not necessarily match what you see on the surface. So you may have pink or ruddy skin, but your skin tone may actually be yellow.Before attempting any of the following steps, make sure your skin is clean and free of any makeup, lotion, or toner. If you just washed your face, wait about 15 minutes before proceeding, as your skin may appear pink from scrubbing and make it difficult to see your true undertone.
Always use natural lighting when examining your skin. Different lightbulbs can affect your skin differently--they may give it a yellow or green cast, and interfere with the appearance of your skin tone.;
, This is a quick way to determine your undertones.Make sure you are examining your wrists in natural light, either standing near a window or outdoors, and that your wrist is clean and free of product.


If your veins appear blue or purple, you have a cool skin tone.If your veins appear green, you have a warm skin tone.If you can't tell if your veins are green or blue, you may have a neutral skin tone. If you have an olive complexion, you likely fall into this category., Do you tan easily? Do you burn or get freckles? The amount of melanin in your skin determines how it reacts to sun exposure and can help you determine your skin tone.If you tan easily and rarely burn, you have more melanin and you likely have a warm or neutral skin tone.If your skin burns and doesn't tan, you have less melanin and therefore a cooler skin tone.Some women with very dark, ebony skin may not burn easily but still have a cool skin tone. Try a few more tests to figure out your undertone., Looking in a mirror, try to see how your skin looks in contrast to the white paper. It may appear to have a yellow cast, a blue-red or rosy cast, or it may not appear to be either, but a gray color instead.


If your skin appears yellowish or sallow beside the white paper, you have a warm skin tone.
If your skin appears pink, rosy, or blueish-red, then you have a cool skin tone.
If your skin appears gray, your skin probably has an olive complexion with a neutral undertone. The green from your complexion and the yellowish undertone combines to create this effect.You can experiment with neutral and warm tones, since you fall somewhere in between.If you can't determine any cast of yellow, olive, or pink, you have a neutral skin tone. Neutral tones can look good in foundations and colors on both ends of the cool/warm spectrum., Hold a sheet of gold foil in front of your face so that it reflects light back on your skin. Note whether it makes your face look grayish or washed out, or if it enhances your skin. Then try with a sheet of silver foil.


If the gold foil looks best, you have a warm skin tone.
If the reflection from the silver foil makes your skin glow, you have a cool skin tone.
If you don't notice a difference (both silver and gold are flattering), then you likely have a neutral skin tone.If you don't have gold or silver foil, try laying gold and silver jewelry on your wrist, and notice which one is more flattering., If you have acne, rosacea, or another condition that might mask your skin tone, you can have a friend look at the the skin directly behind the shell of your ear, as this area is less likely to be affected.


Have them examine the skin right in the little crease behind your ear.
If your skin is yellowish, then your skin tone is warm.
If your skin is pink or rosy, then your skin tone is cool
If they have difficulty, they can try holding a white piece of paper near the skin. That should help them see if it appears yellow or pink.

Resurrect a trend from 18th and 19th century France.,
Take advantage of the contouring trend.,
Use highlighting cream.",How to Get Fair Skin in Two Weeks2," Very pale skin was in vogue in France during the 1700s and 1800s, so aristocratic women would lighten their skin using cosmetics. We can learn from their mistakes; they typically applied paint made from lead! Instead, try these safe alternatives:

Rather than matching your makeup to your face, select a shade of foundation one shade lighter than your actual skin color. Remember to also use concealer and setting powder one shade lighter than your skin. Blend the makeup into the skin at your jawbone and neck so that it fades gradually rather than leaving an obvious line that divides the pale skin on your face from the darker skin on your neck (or better yet, wear a turtleneck or scarf).
You can try out a version of this tactic without spending a ton of money on new cosmetics by simply purchasing a finishing powder in a lighter shade. Apply it over your normal foundation and concealer, and if you like the effect, consider buying lighter foundation and concealer as well.

, Most major cosmetics brands are jumping on the trend, which is also known as highlighting or strobing depending on the technique. You can adapt this trend to create the illusion of fairer skin temporarily. Contouring using makeup involves carefully placing lines of darker color on areas that are meant to recede, like under your cheekbones and along the sides of your nose, while placing lighter streaks of color along areas that are meant to stick out a bit and catch the light, like the cheekbones, bridge of the nose, or forehead. Then, the colors are carefully blended so that you can't tell that you've put color in either place, but it gives a very nice visual effect of well-defined facial features.

Learn about contouring techniques from this helpful wikiHow article, but when you go shopping for products, purchase products in shades slightly lighter than you would normally buy.
Apply the products using the contouring technique, but at each step, go one to two shades lighter than you would normally go. For instance, when you begin, apply foundation to your entire face in one or two shades lighter than your skin tone. Then, when you contour the darker areas, use a color that matches the natural color of your face (rather than a darker shade). The highlighted, lighter areas should be a shade or two even lighter than the color you began with to really stand out.
It's important to stay in the same color family as the rest of your skin. If you are cool-toned, choose products that are meant for cool-toned skin; and if you are warm-toned, choose products that are meant for warm-toned skin. Otherwise your contouring will seem like you've painted your face.

, For a more subtle effect, simply mix a highlighting cream into your regular foundation. It will only subtly lighten the actual color of your skin, but because of its very fine sparkle and luminosity, it will make your complexion appear fairer in the light.

Try Josie Maran Argan Enlightenment Illuminizer, NARS Illuminator, or a similar product from your favorite drugstore brand. The key is to choose a liquid highlighter that can be easily blended into liquid foundation, and in a shade that is slightly lighter than your skin tone but in the same color family.
The end result should be skin that seems to glow, like a freshly moisturized face; if it seems glittery or shiny then you've added too much illuminator to your foundation.

Premature aging
Increased risk of skin cancer. The reason for this is that skin treated with hydroquinone is more sensitive to sunlight.
Skin discoloration
Allergic reaction

, A chemical peel is a procedure in which chemicals are applied to the skin, usually the face, which cause the skin to exfoliate and peel away. Depending on how deeply into the skin they penetrate, chemical peels come in three varieties: superficial, medium, and deep.


Superficial peels use alpha-hydroxy acid and only penetrate the outer layer of the skin. Choose this method if the skin discoloration you are trying to address is minor. Recovery time is a day or so.
Medium peels use glycolic or trichloracetic acid and penetrate the outer and middle layers of the skin. They are suitable for moderate skin discoloration. Because medium peels penetrate deeper into the skin, it can take 14 days to heal after a treatment.
Deep peels are the most invasive and as such, are suitable for the most extreme cases of skin discoloration. Deep peels use trichloracetic acid or phenol, which deeply penetrate into middle layer of the skin. Because of this, they can only be performed once in a person's lifetime. Healing time is the most extensive: 14 to 21 days.
Regardless of the type of peel, there are risks. They include scarring and the reactivation of cold sores

, Laser skin resurfacing works by targeting and destroying the unwanted skin cells with high energy light. The body then generates new skin cells and increases its production of collagen, one of the building blocks for great skin. It does this without damaging the top layer of the skin, which means that there is no downtime. The recommended treatment schedule is six cycles over a two week period. You'll see noticeable results after every treatment, which continue to improve over time.


q-Switch refers to this laser's ability to operate at two wavelengths: 1064 nm, or infrared, and 532 nm.The Nd:YAG refers to the laser's crystal structure, which is neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet.
Minor side-effects such as some skin redness can occur, but this usually resolves within 30 minutes of the procedure.

Prevent acne before it starts.,
Do not pick or pop pimples.,
See a dermatologist.,
Consider a salicylic acid face wash.,
Use spot treatments.","How to Get Beautiful, Glowing Skin2"," Here are some small daily-life hacks you can use to prevent pimples before they happen:


Change out your pillowcase every four or five days. A fresh, bacteria-free pillowcase can stop your skin from erupting overnight.
Keep your hands off your face. If you tend to rest your chin in your palm, or you're constantly fussing with your face, stop. The oils on your hands can cause breakouts, even in small amounts.
Tie your hair back while you sleep. If you have long hair, keep it off your face while you rest. Braid it back, and use pins or a headband to keep bangs off your forehead.
Get your beauty rest. Stress can lead to breakouts, so make sure you're well-rested and calm.
Change your birth control (females). Some oral contraceptives containing estrogen can calm down regular breakouts. Ask your doctor if this is the right choice for you.

, Doing so can make the infection worse and lead to permanent scarring.

, If you can't get the problem under control by yourself, visit a doctor. He or she can prescribe serious treatments such as Accutane, Retin-A or red-blue light treatments.

, Some anti-acne face cleansers contain salicylic acid, which kills the bacteria that can cause acne.


To prevent drying out your face, start using a salicylic acid wash only in the mornings and see if that's sufficient. If you still need more help, use it at night as well.

, There are several products that you can dab onto active zits to reduce redness and kill bacteria. Two of the most popular are salicylic acid gel and benzoyl peroxide cream.


For extra help, try using both formulations.
Be aware that benzoyl peroxide can bleach hair and clothing.

"
"
Wash your face at night.. Over the course of the day, makeup, dirt, and oil build up on your face.,
Apply toner.,
Smooth on some moisturizer.,
Exfoliate once a week.,
Protect your skin from the sun.","How to Get Beautiful, Glowing Skin3"," Make cleansing your skin part of your bedtime routine.


Use makeup remover. Not only does this prevent it from clogging up your pores and causing breakouts while you sleep, it also stops you from smearing bacteria on your pillow — where it can get into your skin night after night.
Use a gentle soap. Remember that you want to clean your skin, not completely strip it of all oils — if it feels tight and dry after washing, you're using something too strong.
Avoid the eye area; the skin around the eye can be too delicate for most cleansers.
Rinse off by splashing water on your face. Using a washcloth or rag to roughly wipe your skin clean can irritate it more. Instead, bend your face over the sink, cup your hands together, and bring up small amounts of water to splash over your face. About 10 splashes should do it.
Pat dry. Don't roughly rub your skin dry with a towel. Instead, dry it with small, gentle pats or let it air dry.

, A toner removes excess oil and dirt from your skin that the soap missed, in addition to closing your pores. Not everyone needs to use a toner, but some people find it helpful.


Put a few drops onto a cotton ball or pad. Swipe it lightly over your skin.
Only use astringent if your skin is exceptionally oily. Astringent is a stronger type of toner that can be up to 60% alcohol. If your skin tends to be dry, using astringent could actually cause acne by driving your oil glands to overcompensate.
Witch hazel is a natural alternative to buying synthetic toner/astringent.
Consider applying toner to only the areas of your skin that tend to break out. For instance, you might only use it on your nose or forehead.

, Using lotion in the morning acts as a primer for your makeup, helping it ""stick"" to your face throughout the day. Moisturizing at night helps your skin repair itself and stave off wrinkles. Bottom line, it's one of the best things you can do for glowing skin over the long term.


Consider using a lighter moisturizer during the day. If you're prone to breakouts, save the heavy cream moisturizer for nighttime and use a light or gel moisturizer during the day.
Don't forget your neck and décolletage. These areas can get super dry and irritated if you never moisturize them.

, If your skin tends to be dry and flaky, a weekly exfoliation can clear out dead skin cells. Find an exfoliant that has a super fine grain, and don't rub it roughly into your skin — use light pressure and gentle motions.


A simple scrub of sugar mixed with honey makes a great exfoliator. Rinse it off with warm water.
You could also exfoliate with a dry brush made for the face. Brush your face using small, circular motions.

, Avoid leathery, tough skin by applying a light sunscreen every time you plan to be outside. The lack of sun damage will keep your skin dewy and supple for years to come. Remember, it only takes 15 minutes to get a sunburn, so be prepared.


Stick to SPF 30 — anything higher doesn't have much more benefit.
Search the makeup aisle for spray-on sunscreens that are light and dry.
Use a foundation or tinted moisturizer with sunscreen, so your face is already covered.

Examine your skin in neutral light to find your complexion.,
Use your skin tone to choose the right colors for your clothing.,
Consider your skin tone and complexion to find your new favorite lipstick.",How to Determine Skin Tone2," Your complexion refers to the surface shade of your skin, such as fair, medium, olive, tan, or dark and is not necessarily fixed. So your complexion may be lighter in the winter and darker during the summer. By looking at the skin near your jawline, you should be able to determine your coloring.Make sure your skin is clean and free of any product, such as foundation, powder, or lotion.
If your skin can be described as very white, pale or translucent, you are fair skinned. You may have freckles or a little redness to your complexion. Your skin is very sensitive to the sun and burns easily.You may have cool or warm undertones.
If you have pale skin that burns in the sun but then deepens into a tan, you have light skin. You may have a little red coloring and your skin may be mildly sensitive.May have cool or warm undertones.
If you tan very easily and rarely burn, you have a medium skin tone. You likely have warm or golden undertones. This is a very common complexion.If your skin is olive or tan year-round (even in the winter), your complexion is likely tan. You almost never get a sunburn and your undertone is probably neutral or warm.If you have warm, brown skin and back or dark brown hair, you have a warm complexion. Your skin darkens very quickly in the sun and you rarely burn. Your undertones are almost always warm. Women of Indian or African descent often fall into this category.If you have very dark, even ebony skin and have black or dark brown hair, you have a deep complexion. You may have a warm or cool skin tone and your skin hardly ever burns., Remember, these are not rules, only suggestions. Matching your skin tone with a flattering color can help you look your best, but feel free to branch out and experiment with whatever shades really grab you.


Warm undertones should try neutrals, like beige, cream, orangey-coral, mustard, off-white, yellow, orange, brown, warm red, and yellow-greens.Cool undertones should try blue-red, blue, purple, pink, green, plumb, navy, magenta, and blue-green.Neutral undertones can draw from both groups. Most shades will flatter your skin.

, Start out with these guidelines and recommendations, but don't be afraid to branch out.


If you have fair or light skin, try light pink or coral, nude, beige, or dusty red. If you have cool undertones, look for raspberry or mocha or nudes, especially. Warm undertones may want to try red with blue undertones (this will make your teeth look very white, too), coral, pale pink or peachy nudes.If you have tan or medium skin, go for cherry red, rose, mauve, or berry. Deep pinks or corals will look good, too. If you have warm undertones, focus on tangerine, orange-red, copper, or bronze.If you have cool undertones, look for wine colored shades or cranberry.
If you have a dark or deep complexion, look for browns, purples, caramel, plumb, or wine colored lipsticks. If you have warm undertones, try copper, bronze, or even a blue-based red.If you have cool undertones, look for metallic shades in ruby red or a deep wine shade."

You can find a color correcting palette that offers many different colors of concealer or you can buy them individually. In general, you should look for:Green concealer for redness
Peach or orange for dark spots
Purple for sallow skin
Salmon for undereye circles

Reduce razor bumps.,
Deal with hyper-pigmentation and acne scars.,
Match makeup to your skin tone.,
Pick the right makeup for your skin.,
Fight acne.",How to Get Beautiful African American Skin1," Razor bumps are more common in people of African American descent, due to the fact that the hair shaft is curved. In turn, after shaving the tip can grow back into the skin, making irritated ""razor bumps"" on your skin.The best way to work on this problem is to prevent them from happening in the first place. Use a safety razor, as it can help reduce the problem. Another way to reduce the problem is to make sure you're shaving in the direction the hair is growing.
On the other hand, you can employ a few treatments if you develop razor bumps. One option is topical treatments, such as antibiotics, steroids, and retinoids, which your doctor can prescribe. You can also ask your doctor about laser treatments. It can help some people, but it can also lead to discoloration of skin, as well as blistering or painful skin.;
, Hyper-pigmentation just means your skin is blotchy, and it is common among African Americans. Sometimes, pimples and acne can leave darker areas. One way to deal with this issue is to use an exfoliant, such as a chemical exfoliant that has alpha or beta hydroxy .Gently rub the exfoliate on your skin then rinse it off. Another option is a physical exfoliant like exfoliating gloves or even a basic washcloth. Just gently rub your wet skin in a circular motion up and down your body.Another option for dark spots is bleaching creams and hydroquinone creams, while chemical peels can lighten certain areas of skin., In years past, African Americans didn't get the attention they deserved with makeup lines. Fortunately, more and more makeup lines are providing great options for any skin tone.Check out makeup lines such as Iman, Black Opal, Fashion Fair, Mac, and Black Up to find great options.
When trying to match a product, try using the tester to put a little on the back of your hand. That way, you can see what it looks like against your skin without putting it on the sensitive skin on your face.
Also, if you're using a setting powder, make sure it also matches your skin tone. If you pick a light one, it can leave white residue across your face., Some African Americans have oily skin paired with larger pores, and if you fall in this category, you need to make sure to pick a makeup built for that. Matte finish makeups are a great option because they can soak up oil while you're wearing them.On the other hand, if you have drier skin, then you definitely want to skip the matte foundation and go for something that has more weight to it. Pick something that's creamy instead.

, If you have darker skin and are prone to acne, that means you may have more inflammation, too. In turn, that can lead to darkening of the skin where that mark is, so you want to make sure to treat your acne as soon as you see a breakout to help lessen the effect.Start with topical creams, such as ones that contain retinoids, antibiotics, or benzoyl peroxide, although benzoyl peroxide  can be irritating. Ask your doctor which treatment is best of you.

Do not exfoliate more than three times a week, as this can cause microtears, excessive shine, or break outs.Physical exfoliation uses a rough surface to gently roll off dead skin cells. Types of physical exfoliation include wash cloths, sugar or fruit scrubs, and konjac sponges. Wet your face, and scrub it with your chosen exfoliant before rinsing off. Be extremely gentle to prevent microtears.
Chemical exfoliation uses low doses of acid to remove excess skin cells. BHA and AHA are the primary acids used. If using a chemical exfoliant, start by only using once a week to build tolerance. Before use, apply a pH-adjusting toner to your face. Use a cotton swab to apply the acid, and wait twenty minutes before applying other products. After a few weeks, you can start using it two or three times a week. Do not overuse, or you may cause a chemical burn., Sunscreen is the best way to prevent future sun damage, dark spots, wrinkles, and other age-related hyperpigmentation. Use an SPF of at least 30 every day underneath your makeup. Even if you don’t plan on going outside much, daily use of sunscreen can protect your current dark spots from worsening and future ones from developing.You should use at least a nickel-sized dollop of sunscreen on your face and two tablespoons on the rest of your body., Hydrocolloid bandages heal acne by absorbing water from the wound or pimple. They are effective at reducing acne without the subsequent hyperpigmented scarring.Apply the bandage to the pimple, and remove when it is healed.


If you have lanced a pimple, the hydrocolloid dressing can prevent scarring. Sometimes you may only need to wear it overnight.
Hydrocolloid bandages are widely available. They are sometimes marketed as blister bandages or pimple stickers.If the bandage is too large for the pimple, cut it to size.

, Vitamin C, also known as ascorbic acid, can lighten dark spots and reduce hyperpigmentation. It is also sometimes used to treat acne and rosacea. Vitamin C can be found in serums, moisturizers, patches, and spot treatments.If using a Vitamin C serum, apply after you wash your face and before you apply your moisturizer.
If you are using a cream or serum that has niacinamide in it, it may react with the Vitamin C. This will render both ingredients useless, and it may cause your skin to flush red. Wait at least thirty minutes between applying each product., A dermatologist can help diagnose exactly what is causing your dark spots. They can also prescribe powerful topical remedies to reduce the dark spots on your face.


Hydroquinone and retinol are common prescriptions meant to reduce hyperpigmentation. Both may dry out your skin, so make sure that you pair them with a good moisturizer.If your dark spots are severe, ask your dermatologist about laser treatments or chemical peels. These are much stronger treatments that, while expensive and harsh, can have dramatic effects."

Pulsed dye lasers and the long pulsed NG:YAG laser are considered the most effective in treating keloid scars. However, these lasers are not as effective on dark skin. Laser treatment can be quite costly because a specialist is required and it will take several treatments before noticeable results are achieved.The side effects associated with laser treatment include redness and mild irritation.

, Silicone sheets work best if applied to the infected area before a scar has developed. They work by keeping the area hydrated and preventing the development of scar tissue. A silicone sheet is tightly wrapped around the scar tissue and is worn for days or even months following the injury.Silicone sheets are one of the only treatment options available for children.

, If you want to completely remove the keloid, rather than just reduce its appearance, you can try surgical removal. This is an invasive procedure, but will likely remove the entire keloid. The only issue is that surgeries often cause the development of new scars.Surgical treatment of scars can be expensive, but it may be the most effective way to significantly reduce their appearance.
You can immediately treat the post-surgery scar using topical retinoids and compression therapy to reduce the chances of another keloid developing.

, This type of treatment works by freezing the skin tissue at the site of the keloid. It is often used in combination with other treatments, most notable steroid injections, to reduce the visibility of the scar. Cryotherapy will often leave the skin slightly paler in colour."

Do this by applying pressure to the area, using a clean cloth or medical gauze. Do not remove the cloth until the bleeding has stopped completely.Facial injuries often bleed worse than other parts of the body, so the injury may look worse than it is.Crying makes bleeding worse, so try to remain calm and stop crying.;
, If the cut is very deep, particularly if it is a puncture wound, you may need to go to the hospital immediately. Large gaping wounds or deep wounds will likely need stitches and professional cleaning. More superficial wounds can be cared for at home.

, Before you touch the open wound in any way, be sure to clean your hands thoroughly with soap and hot water. Wash both hands, between all of your fingers, and your wrists thoroughly, rinse with hot water, and dry with a clean towel.Hand-washing is a very important method of avoiding the chance of any infection in the wound.

, Clean the wound very gently with water and soap. Be sure to rinse the soap out of the wound completely with water. Be sure to remove any visible debris or dirt from the wounded area.


Use cool or slightly warm water. Water that is too hot may cause the wound to start bleeding again. Be patient and slow with this step. If there is debris in the wound, try using a soft cloth to aid in removing it.
If necessary, sterilize tweezers with rubbing alcohol and use them to aid in removing pieces of debris from the wound. Avoid using hydrogen peroxide or iodine, which can irritate or damage tissue., An antibiotic ointment such as Neosporin or Polysporin is the best option, but if none is available, simple petroleum jelly such as Vaseline can help. Expensive creams or treatments that claim to reduce scarring are generally not as helpful as they claim to be., Place a sterile bandage over the wounded area. This may be a bit cumbersome on your face, but it is important to keep the area free from potential infections.Place a bandage over the cut and use medical tape above and below the bandage to keep it in place.
If the wound is still bleeding, try to secure the bandage tightly over the area. If it is not, a looser covering is adequate.

, A wide open cut needs to be pinched together to aid in healing and reduce scarring. Butterfly tape can help pull the skin together and enable it to heal. If this does not work, you will likely need stitches and you should go to the hospital.

, If the wound area is swollen (for example, if the cut is the result of a forceful blow), it is important to get the swelling in the area down as well. This can be done by putting ice on the area for 20 minutes at a time.

, If your wound is wide enough that the skin will not close together on its own, you may need to have stitches. Closing the wound tightly together soon after the injury is essential to reducing scarring and facilitating healing., If you have received a hard blow to the face, be sure that you do not have any breaks or fractures under the skin. This is especially important if a cut is due to a car accident or any very forceful hit., If the wound begins to swell, becomes filled with pus, feels hot to the touch, or becomes more painful or if you develop a fever, seek medical treatment.An infected wound will take longer to heal, and serious infections can occur., For extreme scarring, you may want to consult a plastic surgeon about the scar area. In some cases, a laser treatment or surgery can be done to reduce the effects of serious scarring.It is particularly important to seek help if a scar that had faded turns red, or if the tightness of the scarred area restricts normal facial movement.

, If you have not had a tetanus shot recently, you may need to go get one, depending on the depth of the wound, the object that caused the wound, or your environmental circumstances. , Try to keep your head above the rest of your body at all times. This may mean using additional pillows at night to prop up the top half of your body. Keeping your head elevated will reduce swelling and pain in the area., Excessive shaking or movement will disturb the wound and can delay healing, which may increase scarring. Try to maintain a neutral facial expression and avoid excessive motion., Keeping an ointment or petroleum jelly applied to the cut will aid in healing and will keep the cut from itching. It is important to refrain from scratching an itchy cut because picking at scabbed areas will intensify scarring.

, If you are using bandages to cover the cut, be sure to replace them once every day, or whenever they get dirty or wet.Be sure to use clean, sterile bandages.

, After the wound is no longer “open,” it is better to remove the bandage. Exposure to air will aid in quicker healing., Staying internally hydrated with water will help your body function well and will help keep your wound moist and healing from the inside. Avoid drinking alcohol, particularly when the wound first happens, as it causes expansion and can make bleeding and swelling worse., Certain foods are thought to help with the body’s healing. Getting an adequate amount of healing foods, as well as avoiding foods that are high in sugar and unhealthy fats, can help your body heal more quickly.Be sure to eat plenty of the following:Protein (lean meats, dairy, eggs, yogurt)
Healthy Fats (whole milk, yogurt, cheese, olive oil, coconut oil)
Vitamin A (red fruit, eggs, dark green vegetables, fish)
Healthy Carbohydrates (rice, whole-wheat pasta, whole-wheat bread)
Vitamin C (leafy green vegetables, citrus fruit)
Zinc (meat protein, fortified cereal)

, The best way to avoid a scar is to prevent infection. Proper care in the first two weeks of the wound is the best approach to reduce scarring., It can be very tempting to pick at scabs as they heal. They are often itchy and unsightly. However, it is much better to cover them with ointment and keep them moist. Picking at scabs will make scarring much worse., Direct sunlight on a sensitive healing area can cause the area to darken and may make scarring worse. If the wound is completely closed, you can apply sunscreen to the area. Before it has completely closed, you may need to avoid sunlight in other ways, like wearing a hat, covering the area, or staying inside., Silicone gel sheets are thin, clear sheets that you apply directly over the cut. These will help keep the wound moist and clean, and encourage quick and healthy healing. You can find them at most medical supply stores. "

Very few freckles (only about 1-3 on a large area) = 3 points
None = 4 points

, Think back to times you spent in the sun. Ask yourself, “Of all the times I spent in the sun, how often did I get a sunburn?” This will give you an idea of how your skin responds to the sun. Assign yourself points based on which statement best describes your skin:""I always burn, blister, and peel"" = 0 points
""I often burn, blister, and peel"" = 1 point
""I sometimes burn"" = 2 points
""I burn rarely, if at all"" = 3 points
""I never burn"" = 4 points

, Now think about whether you tan when you’re in the sun – whether spending time in the sun makes your skin get darker. It doesn’t matter if you get a little tan or very tan, just consider whether you tan at all. Give yourself points based on which statement best describes you:""I never tan, I always burn"" = 0 points
""I seldom get tan"" = 1 point
""I sometimes get tan"" = 2 points
""I often get tan"" = 3 points
""I always get tan"" = 4 points

, Now consider how deeply you tan – whether sun makes your skin a little darker or much darker. Determine which statement best describes you and give yourself the right number of points:""I tan very little or not at all"" = 0 points
""I tan lightly"" = 1 point
""I tan moderately"" = 2 points
""I tan deeply"" = 3 points
""My skin is naturally dark"" = 4 points

, Think about whether your face is sensitive to the sun. Ask yourself questions like, “Do I have to wear sunscreen on my face every day?” and “Does sunlight cause me to breakout or have skin changes?” Give yourself points for how sensitive your face is to the sun:Very sensitive = 0 points
Sensitive = 1 point
Normal = 2 points
Resistant = 3 points
Very resistant, never had a problem = 4 points

, Tally up all the points you scored from the above questions. Match your total number of points to the corresponding Fitzpatrick Skin Type:0-6 points = Type I
7-12 points = Type II
13-18 points = Type III
19-24 points: Type IV
25-30 points: Type V
31 points or higher: Type VI

Of course, there are places on your body that you can't hide with your clothing, but if you plan ahead, most areas are concealable with the right wardrobe choices. If you're worried about cuts on your thighs, simply avoid shorts in public. For cuts on your neck, try collared shirts. All this may seem obvious, but sometimes it's your best line of defense.;
, This is most relevant for cuts on your wrists, which you can often conceal fairly easily with bracelets or watches. If the cut is fresh, it's important to find accessories that won't aggravate it and disrupt the healing process, which can cause more scarring down the line. The best option is to protect a fresh cut with a flesh-colored bandaid, then conceal the bandaid with accessories.

, As we all know, cuts in certain areas are red flags. You can do your best to hide your cuts, but sometimes people will notice them. Depending on who's asking, you may not feel comfortable explaining where they came from. If your cuts result from self harm, it's strongly recommend that you talk to a friend, family member, or seek professional help. Having said that, if somebody notices your cuts, you might not feel compelled to tell them the whole truth. Think of a believable backstory for your cut, so you'll be prepared if somebody puts you on the spot.


If you're an athlete, consider attributing your cut to a sports incident.
Blame it on a cat. Cats scratch people all the time, and sometimes the resulting cuts are severe.
Attribute it to a cooking accident.
Attribute it to an arts and crafts accident.

, In general, it is not advisable to use makeup on a fresh cut. Not only is it often painful to apply makeup to an open wound, but it greatly increases your chance of infection, as makeup often carries bacteria, and its application will make the wound more difficult to clean. Oil-free makeups may be ok to apply once the wound is mostly healed. Your best bet at covering your cut with makeup is to cover the wound with a transparent bandage, and apply foundation on top of the bandage. This may adequately disguise the wound, but use the technique sparingly, because it will prevent your cut from breathing, and slow the healing process.

, If your cut is fresh, the first step is to stop the bleeding. Follow these steps:Apply pressure with a clean cloth or paper towel.
Raise the cut above your heart, if possible, to reduce blood flow.
If the bleeding stops, clean the cut with soap and water, and do your best to rinse out any foreign material, like dirt or glass.

, Before you treat the cut yourself, you need to make sure that it doesn't need stitches. Of course, in the short term, stitches are hard to hide, but they'll help prevent scarring over time, and if the cut is really bad, stitches could save your life. A cut needs stitches ifit won't stop bleeding, even after you've applied pressure and elevated the wound.
it's deep enough that you can see yellow, fatty tissue under the skin.
it's so wide that you can't pinch it shut.
it's in an area of your body that's frequently in motion, like your kneecap, which will prevent the cut from healing on its own.

, Infection is one of the main reasons a cut will leave a scar, so we want to do everything we can to prevent it.Treat with an antibacterial like Neosporin, as directed on the packaging.
If the cut requires a dressing, change it regularly to keep the cut clean.

, Once the cut has healed—that is, once it's no longer an open wound—wash your hands and massage it with a lotion that contains Aloe or Vitamin E. This helps prevent scar tissue from building up. Massage the cut twice a day for two weeks, then once a day for two weeks after that., Because the scar tissue that develops after a cut heals is different from your ordinary skin, it will tan a darker color if it's exposed to the sun. The best solution is to keep the cut out of the sun altogether, but if that's not possible, use an extra strong sunscreen—SPF 50+—before spending time in the sun., On any given day, sunscreen won't conceal your scar. But in the long term, consistently protecting your scar with a broad-spectrum sunscreen will prevent discoloration, and facilitate the scar's fading., Scars over two years old aren't very likely to fade, but younger scars can be improved with the right skin products. Look for skin creams with the following ingredients:Quercetin, which is an antioxidant.
Petrolatum, though some medical professionals discourage its use.Vitamin C

, Exfoliating before applying makeup to a scar is critical, because scars tend to have a particularly high concentration of dead cells. Use a gentle exfoliant, though, to avoid aggravating the wound., After exfoliating your scar, apply a gentle moisturizer with a self-tanning aspect. Not only will this soften the skin and make it more receptive to make up, it will help neutralize the difference in color between your scar and your regular skin, without exposing your scar to the harmful effects of the sun., Before applying foundation and concealer, choose a color corrector with the opposite tones as your scar. If your scar is green, apply a red corrector; if it's yellow, apply a purple corrector, and so on. Gently use your fingers to work the corrector into your skin.

, The next step is foundation and concealer. Ideally, use a silicon-based product, as it will even out the texture of your scar, which will make the next step easier.

, Blend your color corrector and concealer, and set with a lightweight powder. Use a soft brush to keep your color blend intact.

Ask yourself if you’re ready to expose your scar.Exposing your scars to the world is not a necessary step toward being comfortable with your scar.,
Don’t focus on people who stare.,
Realize that your physical body is only one part of you.Beauty has many aspects.,
Embrace your scar.Use the scar as a reminder of the pain you survived.",How to Feel Comfortable With a Scar1," Some people believe that concealing the scar is an indicator of shame or discomfort. However, you can become comfortable with your scar without feeling obligated to expose it. Wait until you are ready to expose your scar. Don’t expose your scars just because someone else -- a friend, family member, or mentor -- pressures you to do so.;
, If someone takes an interest in your scar, keep in mind that they are the exception, not the rule. In other words, every time you catch someone gazing at your scars, think about all the people who have passed you by or interacted with you and did not show visible curiosity or throw a look of judgment your way. While some people will gaze intently at your scar, most won’t care. Don’t focus on the people who look at you funny.

, While having flawless skin is widely considered an indicator of ideal beauty, inner beauty is more important. Inner beauty -- the quality of your personality -- defines who you are in a way that your physical form does not. By staying conscious of the fact that your external appearance is not as important as the real, inner you, you will become more comfortable with your scar.


Make a ""soul collage” -- a visual representation of who you are on the inside. Include images of your hopes, aspirations, talents, and dreams. For instance, if you long to travel the world, include images of far-away places in your collage. If you consider yourself a loving person, include images of tender scenes like a mother bear feeding her cubs.

, Look for a meaningful connection to the scar tissue.


If your scars are self-induced, you might use the scar to remind yourself that you have moved beyond the pain that drove you to cut yourself.
If your scars are from a surgery or a painful accident, remember that you made it through even though it was difficult. As the old saying goes, what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger.

Exfoliate your skin.,
Compare a few makeup products.,
Try out your cover up or concealer.",How to Cover Up Stretch Marks on Legs1," Use a body scrub the morning before you want to cover up your stretch marks. Try a body scrub made with caffeine. This may make your skin appear tighter and smoother.;
, Try a leg and body cover up cream. There are a number of cover ups on the market that will cover up stretch marks and other lines that detract from healthy-looking skin. No one has the exact same skin, so you may have to try a few products to see which is best for you.


Choose a color that will match your skin tone. Remember that it may be lighter or darker than your face makeup.
Choose a body cover up that includes sunscreen if you are regularly exposed to sunlight. Sunburns reduce the elasticity of your skin and make stretch marks more noticeable.
If you don’t have access to leg and body cover up, use a primer moisturizer or a waterproof concealer. Choose a concealer with green undertones to cover up red marks. , Dip a flat foundation brush into the cover up product. Dab it gently onto the areas with stretch marks. Aim to use a very light layer of makeup. Assess the coverage that you get with a single layer. Layer the makeup in thin coats until you achieve the desired effect. It will quickly be obvious to you if it is working.


If you are going to wear a swimsuit, put it on before you apply makeup.
Use a powder brush to apply setting powder. Leave the powder a few minutes before changing into a short skirt or shorts.
A spray-on makeup fixative will also work to set the cover up or concealer.

They may be better able to figure it out than you are.

, If your regular doctor isn’t certain how to determine your Fitzpatrick skin type, ask for a referral to a dermatologist. Dermatologists are doctors who specialize in the skin. They may be the best choice to advise you about skin care and diagnose and treat any problems.

, See your doctor right away if you notice any new growths on your skin or changes to your skin. Skin cancer can be deadly, and changes to a mole are often the first sign of melanoma. See your doctor if you have a mole that starts itching, bleeding, crusting, growing, or changing in other ways.Examine your skin monthly, and report it to your doctor if you notice any of these changes:Asymmetry: moles should be relatively symmetrical – the same all the way around, not irregularly shaped

Border: normal moles are usually round with a defined border; a blotchy, irregular border could be a sign of trouble

Color: uneven, blotchy color may be a sign of a problem

Diameter: measure your mole –see your doctor for anything larger than ¼ inch (6mm)

Evolving: any change in size, shape, elevation, or anything else should prompt a visit to the doctor

Take extensive precautions if you’re Skin Type I or II.,
Be moderately cautious if you’re Skin Type III or IV.,
Check non-sun exposed areas carefully if you’re Type V or VI.,
Be wary of skin procedures if you’re Type IV-VI.,
Keep healing wounds moist if you’re Type IV-VI.",How to Determine Fitzpatrick Skin Type3," Type I and II individuals rarely or never tan and almost always burn in the sun. This makes you very susceptible to skin cancer like carcinoma and melanoma. Follow these guidelines to best protect yourself:Use sunscreen that is SPF 30 or higher on exposed skin every day.
Wear clothing with a UPF rating of 30 or higher.
Stay in the shade whenever possible.
Check your skin every month for changes and growths.
See your healthcare provider yearly for a professional skin checkup.

, Type III individuals sometimes burn in the sun, and sometimes tan. Type IV people tan easily and are less likely to burn, but are still susceptible to skin cancers. Follow these precautions to stay safe in the sun:Wear sunscreen with SPF 15 or higher every day on exposed areas.
Seek the shade between 10am and 4pm when the sun is strongest.
Check your skin every month for changes or growths.
Have an annual skin checkup from your healthcare professional.

, Type V and VI individuals rarely burn, but can still get skin cancer. Follow precautions for Types III and IV – wear sunscreen of SPF 15+ and seek shade between 10am and 4pm. Additionally, you are more likely to get a dangerous type of skin cancer called lentiginous melanoma. This usually occurs on parts of the body that are not exposed to the sun. Follow these precautions to keep yourself safe:Check your skin every month for changes or growths, and get a professional screening yearly.
Pay special attention to suspicious changes on the palms of your hands, soles of your feet, and mucous membranes like your lips.

, Skin Types IV, V, and VI have a higher risk for hyperpigmentation (patches of skin getting darker) and hypopigmentation (patches of skin getting lighter). This can be caused by the sun or by inflammation from some illnesses or medical procedures. If you’re one of these skin types, consult a dermatologist about your risk for pigment changes before doing any of the following:Getting a chemical peel
Using tretinoin (retinoic acid); retinol may be a safer alternative
Using a lightening treatment with hydroquinone
Getting laser or IPL (intense pulsed light) treatment

, You also have an increased risk of scarring and developing keloids or raised scars if you’re Type IV, V, or VI.Keep any healing wound moist while it heals – drying out increases the risk of scarring. Use antibiotic ointment like neosporin or petroleum jelly over the area.


Type III individuals also have a slightly increased risk for pigment changes and scarring, though not as much as Types IV-VI.

Start slowly when revealing your scars.If you have a scar on your arm, for instance, you might wear long-sleeved shirts every day.,
Reveal your scars during exercise.When exercising, it might be difficult to conceal your scar.,
Prepare for questions about your scar.,
Prepare for people to not notice.,
Develop a backup plan.",How to Feel Comfortable With a Scar2," If necessary, close the door. Remove any makeup or jewelry that may be covering your scar. Try to spend more time at home with your scar(s) uncovered. This will make you more accepting of and comfortable with your scar.

, To begin feeling more comfortable with your scars, try wearing a short-sleeved shirt one day each week. If you have success wearing the short-sleeved shirt once a week, move forward and try wearing short sleeves twice the next week. Continue in this way until you have become more comfortable with showing your scar in public.


Perhaps you could show your scar to a friend before revealing it to the whole world. Your friend should offer you a supportive reaction. This will build your confidence and prepare you better for revealing your scar to the general public., Don’t make extreme attempts to conceal your scar when working out. For instance, it would be unusual to wear long sleeves to the gym, or when riding your bike on a hot day. Dressing in this way would draw more attention to you than riding about openly with your scar revealed.

, When you have a significant and noticeable scar, people who are curious about it might approach you with questions. For instance, you might be asked, “How did you get that scar?”, “Did it hurt?”, or “When did you get it?”, If you have decided to reveal your scar after covering it for a long time, you will probably consider doing so as an important personal milestone. You may have prepared for the hard questions people might confront you with about your scar. However, for every person who chooses to stare and ask you about your scar, chances are there are far more who will not notice or care that you have a scar.


While generally it’s good that people don’t pester you about your scar, you may feel upset or have mixed emotions about this experience. You might feel that your pain doesn’t matter to others, or feel disappointment that there was not more excitement surrounding your decision to unveil the scar.

, If you choose to expose your scars, but for whatever reason begin to feel uncomfortable while doing so, ensure you can cover them up again quickly if necessary.For instance, if you go out one day with your scar exposed and start to feel awkward due to people staring at you, put on a sweater to cover the scar. This way, you won’t continue to attract unwanted attention.


Don’t back out of exposing your scar too quickly. Even if it feels awkward or difficult a first, sticking it out is a good way to build confidence.

Consult a therapist.You might be uncomfortable with your scar because it causes you embarrassment or shame.",How to Feel Comfortable With a Scar3," Talking candidly about your scar can help you become more comfortable with it, but listen closely to the person’s tone and line of questioning to decide what you want to share with the person who is asking.


Perhaps the curious individual is engaging in self-harm themselves and asking you about it because they have nobody else to talk to about it.
Stay attuned to the tone of the conversation and delve deeper with the person if possible. You could, for example, say to them, “This scar is a reminder of a rough patch I went through. Do you know anyone who has engaged in self-harm?”
Use these conversations as opportunities to educate and inform others about the difficulties of self-harm and related scars.
Talking through your experience with others can often help you feel more comfortable with your scar and might inspire someone else to make a positive change.
Do not share information about your scar if you are not comfortable doing so.

, Good friends will support you and be understanding of the difficulty you have in opening up about your scar. You should also direct your friends about what to say if someone asks them about your scar.


People often feel uncomfortable asking about something obvious but private like a scar. Curious people who don’t know you well may, therefore, ask your friends what happened instead of asking you.
Provide your friends with directions about how you’d like them to answer these questions.
For instance, if you want to maintain control over the distribution of information regarding your scar, you should tell your friends to direct all questions to you. Your friends might answer a question about your scar by saying, “I don’t think my friend would appreciate me talking about it. You will have to ask him/her.” This is a good option when the scar is personal.
Role play with your friends to ensure they understand your wishes about what is acceptable to share about your scar. Pretend to be a stranger asking for information about your scar and ask probing questions.
Talking to your friends about your scar can show your friends that you trust them with sensitive information and help deepen your friendship.

, Politely but firmly deny their request for further information by saying, “I don’t want to talk about it,” or “Thank you for your concern, but that is a private matter.” Do not share information with people you don’t feel comfortable sharing with.

, The Scar Information Service offers a long list of scar-related groups on its website at http://www.smith-nephew.com/awm/scar-info/useful-contacts/scar-related-organisations/. Consult this list and search for a support group near you.


If you don't find a group near you, consider starting one, or joining a general group for individuals with body image issues.
You might also have success looking for groups related to your specific type of scar. For instance, you might be able to talk about breast cancer scars in a breast cancer support group.

Massaging the scar has been shown to reduce both pain and visibility of recovering scar tissue., Moisturizing creams improve the skin’s ability to recover from a wound and encourages a balanced production of collagen around the wound. There are many moisturizing creams available.


Take a small dab on your fingertips and massage it gently into your skin using a circular motion. Do this twice daily in five-minute sessions. Any moisturizing cream will work to help you treat your scar.

, Since scarred skin does not contain the normal pigments the rest of your skin does, it burns easily.

Ask your doctor or dermatologist for a recommended product if you have sensitive skin or you’re prone to skin allergies.


Choose a self-tanner that does not come in a spray bottle. You will need a lotion product that is labeled “streak free.”
You could also consider booking a tanning treatment at a salon. They can airbrush you for a safe, quick, and even sunless tan.
Be aware that regular tanning – whether in the sun or a tanning bed – isn’t effective at covering stretch marks. This is because stretch marks are scar tissue, which doesn’t tan. Actually, tanning might make them more visible., Exfoliate your legs with a body scrub the morning before you apply self-tanner. This will remove with your dead skin cells. Exfoliated skin will also stay tanner longer. Don't apply any other skin products the day you will apply the tanner.

, Squeeze some self-tanner onto a plate or in a bowl. The plate will be your makeup palette. Dab the self-tanner with a cotton swab. Wipe off excess on another portion of the plate. Apply along the line of the white stretch mark. Wipe off excess self-tanner with the clean end of the cotton swab.


Next apply the tanner all over your arms and legs for an even, natural-looking tan.

, Work your inner and outer thighs using walking, pilates, yoga, barre, running, lunges and squats. Seek the help of a personal trainer to develop a leg routine that will firm the muscles underneath your stretch marks. If you have gained weight, aerobic exercise may help you shed a few pounds and take the pressure off your skin.


Although firm muscles will not get rid of stretch marks, they can reduce the appearance of cellulite, which often appears in the same areas that stretch marks appear.
Minimal weight loss may cause some fresh stretch marks to heal and nearly disappear. Significant weight loss may lead to excess skin on some areas of the legs.

, Visit your dermatologist and ask about Retin-A cream. This is used to treat red stretch marks. The active ingredient is vitamin A, which has been proven effective in reducing scarring.Your dermatologist may also prescribe topical steroids to be used with Retin-A.

Drink plenty of water.,
Eat fruits and vegetables.,
Eat healthy fats.,
Avoid foods that lead to more cellulite.",How to Get Rid of Cellulite1," Hydrating your body keeps your skin cells looking fresh and renewed, which can reduce the appearance of cellulite. Drink at least 8 glasses of water a day to make sure your system is getting all the water it needs.

Eat plenty of raw vegetables. Raw salad greens, broccoli, carrots and other vegetables are packed with nutrients, antioxidants and water. If you make them the mainstay of your diet you'll see a difference in the amount of cellulite you have.

, Cellulite is caused by the fat just under the skin, but if your skin is toned and healthy, the cellulite won't be as noticeable. Foods like olives, nuts, avocados, fish and olive oil contain omega-3 fatty acids, which are essential for healthy skin.


Consume Omega-3 fatty acid. Since we eat fatty foods or at least foods filled with all kinds of fats all the time, therefore, consuming the proper fatty acids and neglecting the ones that are harmful to us are vital for a complete recovery from cellulite. Pasture-raised meats, dairy products enriched with Omega-3, Edamame, wild rice, canola oil, or walnuts are only a few of the many foods that are rich in this fatty acid and should be consumed in large quantities for a complete removal of cellulite.

, Foods that cause you to gain weight and retain water increase the amount of cellulite you have. Avoid the following foods to prevent more cellulite from appearing:


Fried foods like french fries, fried chicken, and onion rings.
Packaged snacks like corn chips, potato chips, cheese puffs, and pretzels.
Foods high in salt, like canned soup or dips and dressings, cause you to retain water.
Foods high in sugar, like candy, baked goods, and soda, cause you to gain weight.
Alcohol, especially when it's paired with a sugary mixer like soda or cranberry juice, can cause you to gain weight and retain water.

Perform some form of resistance training.,
Get in a few hours of cardio every week.,
Enjoy an active hobby.,
Overcome sedentary behavior.",How to Get Rid of Cellulite on Thighs1," Start lifting weights, doing yoga or getting in some form of weight-based training regularly. Resistance training firms and tones muscles, which can result in a smoother appearance around the hips and thighs as those muscles press against the skin. Muscle also burns more calories in a resting state than other types of tissue, helping decrease the overall amount of fat stored in the body.Make time for 3-4 hour long resistance training sessions every week.
Emphasize movements like squats, leg lifts and lunges that target the muscles in the thighs.;
, In addition to weight training, spend a few hours a week on the treadmill, stationary bike or elliptical. When kept up at a moderate intensity, steady-state cardio training burns a massive amount of calories, shrinking pockets of concentrated fat that cause that pocked, dimply cellulite look. Exercise is one of the best steps you can take to begin reduce cellulite right away.Start small and pace yourself as you increase the intensity of your workouts. Simply going for a long walk is enough to make a difference when you’re just getting started.
Try fasted cardio once or twice a week (performing cardiovascular exercise on an empty stomach or after only having a small snack). Without stored glycogen in your muscles, your body will go straight to burning fat for energy., Even if you lack the means or the motivation to make it to the gym, you can find healthy ways to be physical and rid troublesome areas of unwanted fat. As often as you can, get out and go for a jog, swim or bike ride. Take some yoga classes, go kayaking or toss a frisbee at the park. Taking part in a sport or pastime you actually have fun doing makes you more likely to get active, and stick with it.Finding a friend to join you in an activity can make it more enjoyable.
Since you’re trying to target cellulite in the thigh area, make sure your physical pursuits require you to use your legs extensively.

, Reverse the effects of sitting all day by spending more time on your feet, even if that just means standing up to work. Make use of frequent breaks to walk around, get your blood pumping and do a few repetitions of squats or lunges. Take the stairs instead of the elevator. At home, stretch out or do some challenging static poses rather than just posting up on the couch. Simply put, find ways to move your body more. Every little bit helps.Limit the amount of time you spend doing things like watching TV throughout the week.
Give yourself reasons to move when you otherwise wouldn’t. For instance, walk to the mailbox to collect the day’s mail instead of grabbing it as you drive by, or stand up more often when you’re at work or talking on the phone."
"
Incorporate weight training.,
Do high intensity exercises.",How to Get Rid of Cellulite2," Weight training, unlike cardio exercises, tones the muscles under your skin and causes it to look more taught. This can greatly reduce the appearance of cellulite.


Buy free weights and perform exercises meant to tone your thighs, buttocks, and abs. If you have cellulite on your arms, perform arm exercises as well.
Join a gym and work with a trainer to increase the amount of weight you lift over time. Contrary to common belief, lifting heavier weights fewer times, rather than doing a lot of reps with lighter weights, is better for building muscle.

, Pairing weight training with exercises that get your heart pumping leads to the production of lean muscle mass, which will cause your thighs and buttocks to look smoother over time.Try the following exercises after doing a light warmup:


Do outdoor sprints. Measure out a distance of 1⁄4 mile (0.4 km) on your street or at a nearby park. Sprint that distance, take a 20-second break, sprint it again, and repeat for a total of 4 sprints. As you improve, add more sprints to your workout.
Sprint on your treadmill. If you work out indoors, use a faster setting on your treadmill to sprint for about 3 minutes. Increase the speed as you improve over time.
Do bike sprints. Using either your bicycle or a stationary bike, ride as fast as you can uphill for for a few minutes.

Moisturize your skin with a product that contains caffeine. Buy a cream or lotion that contains at least 5 percent caffeine, which is said to improve skin tone and decrease the appearance of cellulite.

"
Eat more fiber.,
Get plenty of protein.,
Cut out junk food.,
Stay hydrated.",How to Get Rid of Cellulite on Thighs2," Consume foods that are rich in dietary fiber, such as leafy vegetables, oats and bread products made with whole grains. As part of the digestive process, fiber is used to sweep fats, toxins and other waste products out of the body. More fiber means more efficient digestion, which can help you metabolize more calories and cut down on fat storage in the future.Broccoli, brussel sprouts, carrots, bananas and raspberries, along with things like oatmeal and whole wheat bread in moderation, all make great sources of dietary fiber.Avoid sugary processed food items like sweetened breakfast cereals and snack crackers, even if they claim to be made with whole grains.

, High protein offerings should comprise a substantial part of your normal food intake. Choose lean meats like skinless grilled chicken, steak and fish, along with protein sources that also contain healthy fats, like eggs, nuts and legumes. When you supply your body with protein, it enables it to build and maintain lean muscle mass, which burns calories, makes you feel stronger and more energetic and improves your overall appearance.The average adult needs somewhere from 50-70g of protein per day. Most of this should be received from natural food sources.Take a protein supplement, like a shake or bar, along with your regular meals if you’re having meeting your protein requirements., Calorie dense foods that offer no real nutritional value are largely to blame for making cellulite worse. Say no to fast food meals, processed sugar products (candy, soda, sports drinks, etc.) and excessive carbohydrates like bread, pasta and potatoes. Stick to whole natural foods in balanced portions, namely lean meats, fruits, vegetables and whole grains. In just a short time of clean eating, you’ll notice those annoying cellulite dimples becoming less pronounced.Preparing and refrigerating your meals in advance can spare you the headache of always having to find something to eat.When you buy food, read the labels carefully. Even foods marketed as “natural” or “organic” can contain shocking amounts of added sugar, salt and trans fats.

, Proper hydration is critically underrated when it comes to health and wellness. Not only is water a vital part of every cell in your body, it also improves bodily functions and keeps you feeling capable and alert. Water flushes out toxins, repairs damaged tissues and even uses up a small amount of calories to process. Try to drink at least 8-10 cups of water a day, or more if you’re engaged in strenuous physical activity.One good way to tell if you’re getting enough water is to check the color of your urine throughout the day. If it’s relatively clear, it means you’re keeping fresh water cycling through your system. If it’s cloudy or yellow, you may need to up your fluid intake.If you’re tired of only drinking water all the time, switch it up with unsweetened green tea or coffee. Just make sure you’re getting enough liquids. Caffeinated drinks are diuretics, meaning they'll cause you to urinate more frequently.

Try cellulite-fighting lotions and creams.,
Get a lymphatic massage.,
Make sure your hormone levels are normal.,
Relax.",How to Get Rid of Cellulite on Thighs3," Many women have had success using cellulite creams and other topical treatments. These products nourish and tighten skin to diminish the visible effects of cellulite, restoring firmness. Cellulite-fighting products won’t serve as a magic bullet, and they aren’t a permanent fix, but they can be useful for supplementing a positive routine consisting of a healthy diet and frequent exercise.Get in the habit of applying a cellulite serum as part of your daily routine.
Two specific products that are recommended by dermatologists are Nerium Firming Body Contour Cream and Biotherma Celluli Eraser. Both are on the pricier, side, but have been shown to effectively counteract cellulite in problem areas like the thighs., Look for health centers in your area that offer deep tissue or lymphatic massage. The penetrating pressure of a massage at crucial lymphatic sites can smooth out clumps of connective tissue under the skin and promote circulation, leaving your skin feeling more smooth. It can also help you relax, which can go a long way towards combating the causes of cellulite naturally.If you’re unable to have a massage done professionally, you can still reap the benefits with a manual massaging tool.

, Talk to your doctor about testing your hormone levels. The concentrations of hormones in your body often change as you age, especially following puberty and around menopause. If something is out of whack, one particularly undesirable side effect could be insulin sensitivity and increased body fat storage. Your physician may be able to prescribe certain medications that can put high or low hormones back in order.Women who have reached menopause should be especially careful about regulating their hormone levels. Many women begin a regimen of hormone supplements between the ages of 40-50.Other factors that are within your control, like diet, exercise and how well you manage stress, can play a part in hormonal imbalance.

, When you’re afflicted by chronic stress, your hormones go crazy, and the consequences can include weight gain, advanced aging and a host of related physiological issues. If you’re the high-strung type or suffer from anxiety, try to find ways to bring some peace into your life. Calm yourself with deep breathing, take a long, hot bath or spend some time playing with your pets. As you work on controlling your natural responses to stress, you’ll start to look and feel better.Stress is one of the most detrimental behaviors there is. It has been linked to obesity, depression and even stroke and heart disease.To ward off stress in the moment, try this simple breathing exercise: close your eyes and inhale to the count of five. Hold your breath to the count of then, then exhale again to the count of five. Repeat this breathing pattern, clearing your mind of worries, judgments and negative thoughts.

Evaluate the scar.,
Choose a cover-up.,
Test your concealer before purchasing it.,
Clean the affected area.,
Apply a moisturizer and/or sunscreen.,
Use a sponge, concealer brush, or your fingers to apply the concealer.,
Apply a powder to set the concealer.",How to Camouflage a Scar1," Scars vary in size and severity depending on the original cause. Determining the quality of the scar can help camouflage it.Keloid scars are scars that raise above the skin and do not go away over time. They often occur after surgeries, but acne and minor irritations can also cause keloid scars.Flat scars and hyperpigmentation commonly form after skin irritation including pimples, cuts, or burns. Note that scars vary in color depending on your skin. Some are pink or reddish while others are a bit darker than your natural skin tone.;
, Most scars can be covered with a concealer. Your cover up should generally match the color of your skin. The type of scar, however, can determine the hue or quality of makeup you choose.For flat scars, choose a color that neutralizes the scar. This means you’ll choose a color with a hue that reflects the opposite color of the scar. For example, if the scar is red, choose a concealer with green undertones to cancel out the redness.
Keloid scars can be covered with a concealer that matches the skin around it. Lighter or darker concealers will only draw attention to the scar.

, Not all drug stores or makeup stores will allow you to test a product, but it is best to do so. It can be difficult to tell if a color is right for you unless it goes on the skin. Remember to test the color on the area that you will use it. Skin tone may vary around different parts of the body.

, Your face or body should be completely clean before applying any type of makeup or concealer., Using an SPF of 30 or higher is key, as it will prevent the scar from worsening. A moisturizer provides a soft base for concealer application., Put a small amount of concealer on your finger (or tool of your choice) and dab it on and around the scar. Continue dabbing until it blends in.If you are concealing a scar that is not on your face, put your clothes on before you apply concealer. Protect your clothes with napkins or paper towels if necessary.

, Use a translucent powder or one that matches your skin tone. Apply the powder with a large brush or buff. The powder will seal in the concealer and prevent it from running or rubbing off."

Consider body brushing.,
Take a long, hard look at your diet.,
Exercise, exercise, exercise.,
Try so-called cellulite busting creams?",How to Do Away With Cellulite," Body brushing is a useful but overlooked part of your beauty regime. This step alone has been backed by so many studies performed by experts; it’s hard to understand why so many women do not brush their bodies more. Not only are you stimulating your lymph systems to both remove toxins from your body, (one of the things that causes cellulite) but also improves circulation to the skin meaning that it looks plumper, feels smoother and helps combat that pesky cellulite! Try using a body brush when you get out of the shower and just work in the problem areas for a few minutes, using a circular motion every day. You will soon notice results and wonder why you did not try this sooner!;
, Did you know that this alone can cause cellulite? IF you want cellulite, eat junk food or fatty foods. If you do not want cellulite, eat a diet packed with vegetables and fruit, fresh of course, and drink plenty of water. This helps your skin get the nutrients that it needs as well as the water removing more of those dreaded toxins and overall, you will feel better as well as looking better. What more could you ask for?

, A word that has the ability to have people sweating as they stand but unfortunately, you have to do this to do away with cellulite. The fat that causes the orange peel effect is burnt away with exercise meaning that you have no place for it to look terrible and again, blood flow is improved and skin looks and feels better. All it takes is thirty minutes of physical activity per day and there are even cellulite busting regimes that you can do for quicker results.

, It is hard to disregard these “miracle” potions before you have tried them but if studies are to go by, some of them do actually work. There are both expensive creams and cheap creams and obviously, the costlier ones seem to have the best results but they have got to be worth a try right? THIS ONE by Chrislie Formulations has been proven to be especially effective and comes with a massaging applicator tip.

You will also know if you have dry skin if your skin becomes very dry and even flakey during the winter months. This skin type is also prone to cracking, peeling, irritation, redness/dry patches, and itchiness., Oily skin is often characterized as skin that has enlarged pores, looks shiny from excess oil, and, when blotted with a tissue, significant oil residue is visible., Combination skin is a little more complicated because, as the name suggests, you tend to have both oily and dry or normal skin.

Avoid products that contain alcohol (SD 40, denatured, ethanol, and isopropyl), sodium or ammonium lauryl sulfate, mineral oil, and pertrolatum., If you have an oily skin type, choose toners that are refreshing and gentle for the skin. Do not punish your oily skin by buying toners saturated with alcohol. These toners will dry out your skin causing your skin to produce even more oil.

Avoid products that contain alcohol (SD 40, denatured, ethanol, and isopropyl), sodium or ammonium lauryl sulfate, mineral oil, and pertrolatum., If you have a combination skin type, you will need to purchase two different kinds of toners: one for the summer months and one for the winter months. For the summer months, use a refreshing toner with oil-free ingredients. For the winter months, use a hydrating toner with ingredients that will moisturize your skin, like rose hips or jojoba oil., If you have a sensitive skin type, pick mild toners that are completely free of alcohol and acids, like salicylic acid or paraben.

Choose a bronzing lotion.,
Remove coarse or thick hair from places you wish to tan.,
Exfoliate your skin.,
Give yourself plenty of time.,
Wear gloves.,
Apply the bronzing lotion to your body.,
Apply sparingly to your neck and face.,
Wait at least 6 to 8 hours before showering.,
Take a shower.,
Touch up blotches and spots.,
Use moisturizer.",How to Apply Bronzing Lotion," There are many different bronzing lotions to choose from. Choosing a bronzing lotion based on your skin type, color, and you desired tan will help you achieve the results you are looking for. Some bronzing lotions allow you get instant results while others take up to a week. Some are longer lasting while other are more temporary. Consult online blogs and websites devoted to bronzing lotion and self-tanners to decide which product is best for you.If your skin is very light or pale, consider using a gradual bronzing lotion. Gradual bronzing lotions contain amino-acids that produce brown pigments in your skin. The color of gradual bronzing lotions usually peaks around 5 to 7 days after application.Some bronzing lotions are white and opaque in color, which often means they are more difficult to apply. If you don’t have much experience applying bronzing lotion, choose a bronzing lotion that is tinted so that you can apply it evenly.;
, Thick and coarse hair can get in the way of bronzing lotion and cause a patchy and uneven application. Wax or shave all areas you plan to apply bronzing lotion to.


You will most likely not need to shave if you have very fine hair.

, Bronzing lotions cling to dry and dead skin which can often result in an inconsistent and patchy application. Be sure to exfoliate thoroughly before applying your bronzing lotion for an even and smooth application.Use oil-free exfoliants. Most oils, even natural ones, will prevent the bronzing lotion from being absorbed.

, Applying bronzing lotion in large quantities will take a long time, especially if you have limited experience. Give yourself a few hours in the evening to prepare and apply your bronzing lotion.

, Wearing gloves will keep your palms from getting tinted and absorbing the color that is meant for your body. Try using a cheap pair of latex gloves while you are applying your bronzing lotion.If you are allergic to latex seek out a non-fibrous alternative online or at a beauty supply shop.

, Squeeze out a small portion of bronzing lotion into your palm and start with one body part at a time. Use broad, circular strokes to apply the bronzing lotion evenly. Be careful to avoid naturally lighter spots on your body, like under your arms. Don’t panic if you get some bronzing lotion on these spots, instead, simply wipe it off with a moist cloth.Have a friend help you apply bronzing lotion to your back, or use a strap or band for accuracy.
Follow the instructions on the bronzing lotion bottle to find out how long you should rub in and apply your bronzing lotion.
Try to dilute the bronzing lotion with moisturizer when applying to drier areas, like knees and elbows, as drier areas will absorb more of the lotion and appear darker than the rest of your body., Start with a small pea sized amount of bronzing lotion and apply it to your face in a broad, circular motion. Apply the bronzing lotion up to your hairline. If you have not achieved your desired color keep applying the bronzing lotion to your face in small quantities each day until you achieve your results.Be careful if you have light, blonde, or color treated hair and bronzing lotion can leave traces in your hair color.
If you have darker spots on your face from previous applications apply a small amount of clear, wax-based lip liner to the darker spots to deter absorption before applying bronzing lotion., If you applied your bronzing lotion in the evening, go to bed and take a shower first thing in the morning. Your body temperature heats while you sleep, which increases your skin’s absorbency. Avoid contact with water and try to avoid any activity that might make you sweat.


Apply powder to your body to avoid sticking to your clothes or bed sheets.

, Most bronzing lotions and water don’t mix. Apply a light body oil a few minutes before showering to reduce the amount of bronzing lotion lost when you need to clean. Try using a body cleanser that says it is pH balanced and avoid harsh soaps that remove moisture and color from your skin.


Try not to use scrubs or rough brushes as they remove some dead and dry skin as well as your new tan.

, If you notice that you missed a few spots, put a fresh pair of gloves on and apply a small amount of lotion in your palm. Apply the lotion in the same way as before. Be sure to apply the bronzing lotion lightly the second time and blend it around the edges so that appears even.Wipe off any excess bronzing lotion with a moist cloth.

, Dead skin will begin to peel and flake naturally as your skin begins to dry. The quicker your skin dries and flakes the quicker your tan will fade. Regularly apply a skin moisturizer in order to prolong your new sunless tan."

Try a laser and radiofrequency treatment system.",How to Combat Cellulite1," Retinol is a vitamin A compound proven to help improve a number of skin-related conditions like acne and wrinkles.Studies have shown that regular retinol use can also improve the appearance of cellulite.Retinol products are available over-the-counter and by prescription.Use a 0.3 percent strength retinol cream.
Apply the cream twice each day to the affected area(s). Studies have shown results after approximately six months of use.
Talk to your doctor or dermatologist about putting together an effective skin treatment plan that includes retinol.
Ask your doctor about whether it's safe to use retinol during pregnancy, as some studies suggest retinol use may lead to complications.;
, Shockwave therapy is a relatively recent treatment option that has been shown to reduce the appearance of cellulite. Experts believe that shock wave therapy works by restructuring the connective tissues in the skin, though further research is needed on the actual mechanisms that make shock wave therapy effective.There are no side effects to shock wave therapy.
This treatment option is non-invasive and is only administered in relatively short sessions.
Studies have shown improved skin after twice-weekly sessions over the course of six weeks. Read reviews online before choosing a provider so you know that you'll receive quality care from a reliable clinician.
Shock wave therapy can be expensive. Though prices vary depending on your provider and the extent of your treatment, the services can typically run between $130 and $250 per session., One of the treatment options that appears to be the most promising combines laser and radiofrequency technology.The results of these treatments last approximately six months. Search for reviews online to ensure that you visit a clinician who will provide you with good care, and be prepared for a high cost: sessions typically cost several hundred dollars each, depending on where you go. There are several different types of treatment systems but some of the most common components of these systems are:


tissue massage
diode laser exposure
radiofrequency at varying tissue levels

Gently rub wipes in a circular motion.,
Dab wipes around the eyes.,
Rinse your face with water after using facial wipes.,
Apply moisturizer after using face wipes.",How to Choose and Use Facial Wipes2," When using face wipes, rub them gently in a circular motion all over your face. You may need to use multiple wipes in order to remove all of the makeup, oil, and grime from your face. Look at each wipe after it has been applied to your face. If the wipe appears clean then you have likely removed all of the makeup and grime from your face.

, Although many facial wipes are marketed specifically as eye makeup remover, you may want to avoid using them on sensitive areas. It often requires a lot of rubbing to remove dark eye makeup and this can be damaging to the skin around your eyes. If you need to use wipes to remove your eye makeup, try to gently dab the skin instead of wiping., Typically when individuals use facial wipes, they do not rinse their skin with water afterwards. In fact most of the time facial wipes are used in lieu of washing. As a result, the harsh chemicals and fragrances that are often found in facial wipes remain on the skin and can cause damage. If possible, you should always rinse your face with water and a cleanser after using facial wipes. Rinsing your face will also help to:Remove oil and grime: Facial wipes often just spread oil and dirt around your face without actually removing it from the skin.
Wash off makeup: Similarly, facial wipes can smear makeup across your face instead of removing it.

, Many facial wipes contain harsh chemicals, such as alcohol, that cause your skin to dry out. As a result, it is important to always moisturize your face after using facial wipes. Moisturizers will help to rehydrate your skin, which can combat the drying effects of facial wipes. Choose a moisturizer that:


Is free of alcohol and fragrance, which can be drying and irritating to the skin.
Contains peptides.

Do not use face wipes daily.,
Only use them when you are unable to wash with water and cleanser.,
Use wipes to remove your makeup.",How to Choose and Use Facial Wipes3," Although facial wipes are convenient, they shouldn't replace your regular cleansing routine. Washing your face with water and a cleanser is the most effective way to clean your skin and remove makeup. Facial wipes can be hard on your skin, and they fail to adequately remove grime, oil, and makeup from the skin. They can also cause your skin to dry out as a result of the chemicals contained within them.Continue your regular skincare routine and only supplement with face wipes on occasion.
Try to avoid using face wipes for more than three days in a row., Facial wipes can be a great substitute for a full face wash when you are unable to properly wash your face with water and cleanser. For example, if you are camping or hiking, face wipes allow you to remove some dirt and grime from your face when running water is not available. You may also find that using a facial wipe after the gym, when you don’t have your regular facial cleanser on hand, is a great way to remove sweat.If you are unable to wash your face with water, then it is always best to use a wipe instead of neglecting your skin completely.

, You should always remove makeup from your skin before going to bed because it can clog your pores and cause acne. If you are too tired to perform your regular nightly cleansing routine, then you can use a face wipe to remove your makeup before falling asleep. This should not become a regular habit, but it is best to remove your makeup using a face wipe, rather than doing nothing at all."

Switch to a low-calorie diet.,
Increase your exercise regimen.,
Quit smoking.,
Be realistic.",How to Combat Cellulite2," One of the most effective ways to manage cellulite is by reducing your body fat. Experts agree that a low-calorie diet is an effective way to lower body fat levels and effectively reduce the appearance of cellulite.In addition to promoting weight loss, a consistently healthy diet has also been shown to reduce fluid retention in the skin, which may improve the appearance of cellulite.Choose foods that are low in calories but high in volume, as these are more filling. For example, 1/4 cup (two ounces) of raisins have the same number of calories as a whole cup (eight ounces) of grapes, and the grapes will leave you feeling fuller.Opt for fresh fruits and vegetables over processed foods. Avoid foods that are high in fat and sugar content as much as possible.Talk to your doctor about putting together a low-calorie diet that's right for you.

, In addition to a low-calorie diet, vigorous exercise can help reduce body fat. Resistance training can also help build muscle, which has been shown to help even out the surface of the skin by pushing subcutaneous fat cells back down.Focus on building muscle in your legs, thighs, buttocks, abdomen, or anywhere else you're prone to cellulite.Resistance exercises like side leg lifts, low cable pulley work, squats, lunges, and stair stepping can all help tone your muscles and improve your skin's appearance.Start out at a relatively low number of repetitions and sets, then build up your sessions as your strength increases.
Try to combine aerobic exercise and resistance exercise. Aim to engage in aerobic exercise for 30 to 40 minutes three to five times each week and work in sets of resistance training two to three times each week.

, You may not think of smoking as being a factor in skin fat, but studies have shown that cigarette smoke can make cellulite worse. That's because smoking weakens your body's ability to form collagen, making it easier for fat cells to protrude into the overlying skin tissue.Talk to your doctor about putting together an effective plan to quit nicotine.
You can try using a quitting system like nicotine gum or patches, which are designed to gradually decrease your oral or subdermal dose of nicotine.
Ask a friend or relative to keep an eye on you and make sure you don't slip up and start smoking again.
Consider joining a support group if you're worried about staying committed. You can find information about support groups by searching online.

, While lifestyle changes have been proven to help improve the appearance of cellulite, there are no miracle cures for this condition. There's no way to ""spot target"" cellulite, though general muscle toning should help. Be patient and don't expect diet, exercise, or other lifestyle changes to remove all of your cellulite; instead, go into it knowing that these lifestyle shifts will improve your condition while making you healthier and increasing your self-esteem."

Use over-the-counter treatments.,
Scrub your skin with coffee grounds.,
Consider trying herbal treatments.,
Try skin wrap treatments.,
Avoid treatments that make cellulite worse.",How to Combat Cellulite3," Many over-the-counter treatments use antioxidants like dimethylaminoethanol (DMAE) that are thought to reduce or eliminate the appearance of cellulite.However, these products are generally not considered effective, and some may even be unsafe if their ingredients are not regulated by the FDA.Over-the-counter treatments typically come in the form of creams, lotions, and gels. They are generally available at pharmacies and cosmetic retailers.

, There are many alternative treatment options, many of which have been debunked as being unhelpful in treating cellulite. However, one treatment option that may improve cellulite is scrubbing the affected area or areas with a coffee ground paste.It's worth noting, though, that this method is not medically-approved, and results will vary from person to person


Measure out enough coffee grounds to effectively cover and scrub your affected area(s).
In a hot shower, mix the coffee grounds with just a little bit of water and scrub the affected area(s) for approximately 10 minutes, then rinse the area and continue bathing.
Scrub your skin twice each week. Discontinue use if your skin becomes painful or irritated.

, Herbal treatments are one of the most common alternative options used for managing cellulite. However, herbal treatments are not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and therefore may not be effective or even chemically pure.Some studies suggest that herbal treatments may enhance circulation and promote the breakdown of fat cells in deep tissue layers.
Not all experts agree on the effectiveness of herbal treatments.
The research that does support herbal treatments also suggests that the skin returns to normal once the treatment regimen is discontinued.
Herbal treatments may be taken orally (when safe to do so), as is the case with ginkgo biloba and green tea.They may also be applied topically in the form of pastes, balms, and salves.

, Some salons offer body wraps that typically involve a blend of herbal treatments. These treatments can improve the overall appearance of your skin, but they don't do much to actually treat cellulite.Some body wraps reduce fluid retention in the skin, which can make your skin appear healthier. However, these effects are not long-lasting.
Using body wraps will not ""detoxify"" your body. They also will not improve the actual cellulite condition.

, Most ""alternative"" treatment methods not backed by science simply won't work. However, a few treatment options may actually make your cellulite worse, with some causing serious side effects as well. Talk to your doctor about the safety and efficacy of any treatment plan you're considering before you begin that plan.


Liposuction can make the appearance of cellulite even worse.Heat therapy may cause the skin condition to worsen.Mesotherapy can make your skin appear bumpier and may also cause a rash or infection.Endermologie , a suction massage treatment, was thought to improve the skin. However, the research on this treatment is minimal, and reviews of the published research have generally discredited any effects that had previously been claimed.Subcision, which involves manipulation of connective tissues with a needle, has not been shown to improve cellulite. It has many negative side effects, including pain, bruising, and changes in skin pigment.

Observe your skin conditions.,
Look for a moisturizer that contains the right ingredients.,
Moisturize regularly.",How to Choose a Skin Moisturizer1," Dry skin is often rough, with red patches in certain areas. Pores are small and the skin may feel tight. People with dry skin also tend to have flakiness on the face and body.Dry skin may become more irritated from cold weather, harsh soaps, prolonged time on your feet, and after water activities like swimming.;
, You will need a thicker moisturizer that hydrates and attracts moisture to the skin.To hydrate the skin look for ingredients like hyaluronic acid and dimethicone.
Ingredients such as glycerin, proteins, propylene glycol, and urea help attract water to your skin.
Ingredients like Mineral oil, petrolatum, and lanolin help seal in moisture.
Consider treating dry areas with natural ingredients that don’t clog the pores.These may include extra-virgin olive oil, avocado oil, or coconut oil.
Avoid fragrances and dyes, especially if you have sensitive skin. An SPF of 30 or higher is recommended for all skin types.

, Dry skin will need to be moisturized at least twice per day. Depending on how dry your skin is, you may need to hydrate your skin several times per day.It is best to moisturize after a shower or any time spent in the water. Pat your skin dry, but allow it to remain a bit damp. Apply your moisturizer immediately afterward to lock in the moisture from the water.
Do not over moisturize. Your skin can become dependent on moisturizer, so only add lotion when needed.
For very dry skin you may also try a hydrating facial mist and apply it throughout the day. You can make your own face mist at home.
Focus on moisturizing from within as well. Drink at least two liters of water and consume foods with healthy fats and protein, such as salmon, avocados, eggs.

Buy the basics, then add on.",How to Choose a Skin Care Line," Knowing your skin type is essential to finding the right products to care for it. The basic types are normal, oily, dry, and combination. Your type is determined by the size of your pores, the degree of oil and moisture in your skin, and its sensitivity to environmental irritants.You have normal skin if you have few imperfections, no significant sensitivities, and small pores that are barely visible.
Oily skin generally comes from large pores. It leads to dull or shiny skin that is prone to blackheads, acne, and other blemishes that arise from clogged pores.
You have dry skin if your skin is rough, scaly, or dull. It also may be spotted with red or itchy patches. Your pores will be so small as to be practically invisible.
Combination skin that combines areas of oily, normal, and/or dry skin is common. For instance, many people have larger pores that produce more oil on their foreheads, noses, and chins.;
, Besides knowing your skin type, you should also note if you have any significant sensitivities to environmental irritants. If your skin sometimes itches, stings, burns, and/or breaks out in a rash when you use beauty or hygienic products, then you have sensitive skin.If you do, you should go for beauty products that are for sensitive skin, hypoallergenic, and free from dyes and fragrances.

, Besides catering to a particular skin type, many skin care lines are aimed at improving specific, treatable conditions that affect your skin. Ask yourself what problems you are trying to correct or prevent so that you can pick products to address them.For instance, do you want to get rid of acne, acne scars, rosacea, dark spots or pigmentation? Are there wrinkles or other signs of aging that you’d like to address? Would you like to minimize large pores or treat blackheads? Is the skin under your eyes puffy or discolored?

, Is your skin fair, light, medium, or dark? While this won’t make a difference for many products, it’s useful to keep in mind when you’re buying products that are tinted to match your skin (such as tinted moisturizers). It’s also helpful to think about when considering the degree of sun protection that you’d like your skin care products to provide.If you have fair skin, it’s likely that you burn easily and should go for a skin care line that offers a high SPF of 30+. If you’re light or medium in complexion, pick products that offer some protection in the 15-30 SPF range. If you have darker skin and only rarely burn, you can choose a line with minimal to no sun protection.

, Make sure that you keep notes about your skin assessments for your reference. Many skin care products are made to address specific skin care needs and issues. You want to have your skin type, condition, and tone on hand as you select beauty products to help you make the best choices.


For example, your skin may be dry but also sensitive, so you need products designed for both dry and sensitive skin, as opposed to something heavy that may be hydrating but also irritating. Perhaps your skin is combination and patchy in its coloring. You may want products that balance the skin's moisture and tone.

, Besides knowing your skin needs, it’s important to know your budget when it comes to skin care. Prices for skin care products can vary greatly, ranging anywhere from a few dollars to a few hundred or more. Figuring out your minimum and maximum expenditure is very useful for limiting your skin care options.For example, facial moisturizers alone can run you anywhere from less than $10 (like Purpose Dual Treatment Moisture Lotion) to around $50 (like Lancome Bienfait Multi-Vital Sunscreen Cream) to more than $100 (such as Tracie Martyn Re-sculpting Cream).As a general rule, product lines carried at salons, boutiques, high-end department stores, and spas tend to cost more than those on the shelves of your local pharmacy or discount retailer.

, Organic products must use all-natural materials that have not been genetically modified, synthetically produced, or grown with pesticides or chemical fertilizers. While there is no evidence that they are more effective than other types of skin care products, some people prefer organic lines because of their lack of potentially toxic chemical ingredients and ethical, environmentally sound production standards.The use of the word “organic” on product labels is highly regulated by the USDA, so you can be confident that the product that advertises itself as such meets a strict code. However, words like “natural,” “non-toxic,” or “hypoallergenic” are not regulated. Since they have no set legal definition, it’s important to treat them as marketing terms rather than specific factual claims.

, When you’re looking for a skin care line, you should pick those products that have active ingredients that have been clinically proven to be effective. Be sure to check the labels to ensure that the lines you are considering have at least 5-15% concentrations of safe and effective active ingredients.The most important active ingredients are Vitamins A, B, C, and E, but they will most likely take on different names on product labels.
For Vitamin A, which helps with moisturizing, acne, rosacea, and dermatitis, look for retinoic acid, retinol, or retinyl-propionate.
For Vitamins B & B5, which moisturize while addressing acne, itchiness, eczema, and sunburn, look for niacin, nicotinamide, pantothenic acid, or panthenol.
For Vitamin C, which enhances skin texture while decreasing wrinkles and sun damage, look for L-ascorbic acid.
For Vitamin E, which moisturizes and helps prevent wrinkles, look for DI-alpha-tocopherol. Do not use products that include tocopherol acetate, since this form of Vitamin E is especially susceptible to degradation from sunlight and can therefore actually cause damage to your skin.

, The most basic “line” will pair a cleanser with a moisturizer. If you’re looking for a more complete regime that can address more specific issues, you can consider adding on toners, exfoliators, serums, and/or specific treatments (for instance, for nights, wrinkles, under-eye puffing and discoloration, or acne).The amount of product you get should correspond with both your skin care needs and lifestyle. More comprehensive lines will be more costly to purchase and time-consuming to administer.

, Now that you’ve done your homework, it’s time to start finding the right products to match your needs and preferences. The best way to do so is to take all of your requirements with you to a pharmacy, beauty shop, department store, salons, or skin care center where you can consult with an esthetician. Tell them your needs and preferences, and ask for their advice about which skin care lines would offer the best fit for you.For instance, when you approach an esthetician for advice, you could say something like: “Hi, I’m looking for an inexpensive line of skin care products. I’ve got dry, sensitive skin that’s very fair. I’m looking for products that can address wrinkles and other signs of aging while providing sun protection. Do you have any recommendations and samples I could try?” Or, “Hello, can you help me? I’ve got dark, combination skin that’s prone to acne. Could you suggest some appropriate skin care products that are under $100?”
Avoid salespeople who represent a particular line. You want advice from someone who is unbiased and knowledgeable about multiple brands. Ask for multiple options with a range of price points that fit in your budget.
Keep your budget in mind when picking where to go for recommendations. Over-the-counter lines at pharmacies and beauty shops will be less expensive than those offered exclusively by salons or skin care centers. However, the latter will be more likely to have qualified experts to guide you.
Many skin care centers will offer free consultations if you make an appointment in advance.

, One of the nice things about consulting with an esthetician in person is that they will likely be able to give you samples of the skin care options that they recommend to you. While you won’t be able to judge the long-term effects of particular products, there’s nothing like being able to test first-hand if you like the general look and feel of a product as well as if the skin care routine associated with the line works for you.If you’re sampling more than one line, keep notes about your impressions of each as you test them. List any pros and/or cons about how the products make your skin look and feel to help you make your final decision.
For example, when you’re evaluating a cleanser, you may write something like: “Pros: nice fragrance, good lather, rinses off cleanly. Cons: dries out skin.” If you’re taking notes on a moisturizer, you might write: “Pros: pleasant feel and texture, all-day hydration, sun protection. Cons: makes skin shiny around T-zone.”

, Samples will give you a preliminary first-hand impression, but if you want to hear more about customers’ long-term satisfaction with the line, seek out reviews.Most online stores that sell multiple skin care lines, such as Amazon or Sephora, will enable customer reviews to lend credibility to the products on offer. Search for a particular product to see how it rates, and read the written reviews to see the volume of reviewers and hear why they gave the ratings they did.
There are also some product reviews available from skin care experts. Do an online search for your product’s name + “review” to see if it has been evaluated by an unbiased expert. Only consider those reviews that include the author’s skin care credentials and indicate that they have no financial ties to the brand being reviewed.

, See if the product packaging lists any potential side-effects that you should be aware of. Besides looking at customer reviews, research the safety of your line through databases that conduct independent testing of skin care products.Some skin care products may alleviate a specific problem quickly but may not be best for long-term use. See if this is the case for your line before you commit to it.
Try ConsumerLab.com, an independent review site that tests health and nutritional products, for reports on your skin care line. Search for a particular product and/or active ingredient in it to ensure that your line is safe for consumer use.

, Once you’ve found a skin care line that checks out in terms of the samples and reviews, go ahead a purchase its core products. Be sure that you’re satisfied with the basic components of a line before investing in the whole shebang. If the cleanser, toner, and moisturizer are working well for your skin, start adding on the extras to address your specific needs, such as exfoliants, masks, serums, and treatments.

Leave it to settle for 5 minutes, then apply to skin and leave for at least 1 hour. Wash with cold water. You can keep a towel on your clothes, because this is a messy process.

, But, make sure you only use one kind of mask in one go. For example, don't use the honey mask in the morning, then the lemon mask at night, etc.

, Do this everyday. Also, applying Sudocrem to the spots every night makes a huge difference.

,, Aim for SPF 50 and higher, with brands such as Olay, Garnier and Loreal. Ensure that you're not just putting on sunscreen in summer. It's important that you wear sunscreen every time you go outside and that if you are staying outside for long periods of time, you apply it frequently.


Check to see if the sunscreen is water resistant. Usually, if you're in water, the sunscreen will lose its affect sooner so remember to keep track of time.

, If your metal hot comb is larger or smaller, you can adjust the size of each section, making sure the hair easily fits through the comb. Keep each section together with a hair clip.

,


If you bought a hot iron comb product, use the electric heater or cord that came with it. To heat a hot comb on a stove top, hold it over a medium flame until it is hot to the touch.
Test the metal hot comb before you use it by setting it on a paper towel. If the towel turns brown, your hot comb straightener is too hot and will damage your hair. Let it cool and test it again before using it in your hair

,


Remove a clip at the back of your head. Give that hair section a quick comb-through with a normal plastic-tooth comb before using the hot metal comb. This prevents getting the hot comb stuck in your hair.
Hold the section of hair at the nape of your neck with one hand.
Use the other to gently pull the comb all the way from the root through the ends of the hair in one quick motion. Start as close to the roots as you can without burning your scalp. Avoid keeping the hot iron comb in one spot for too long, or you could scald your hair.
Continue hot combing, working your way from the back of your head to the front.

, Place it back on the burner, but remember that it is already slightly hot so it won't take as long to warm back up.


Remember to test the comb on a white paper towel each time you heat it up to make sure it isn't too hot for your hair.

Focus on the shoes.,
Stick with neutrals.,
Wear black.,
Wear the uniform.,
Pay attention to fit.,
Keep covered.,
Buy more expensive clothing but less of it.,
Pay attention to the details.,
Don't wear a beret.,
Dress like a Parisian male.",How to Have Parisian Style1," Pay attention to the feet! Shoes help complete the overall look in Paris. You’re not going to see a lot of Parisians slumming it around the city in tennis shoes. Cheap or scuffed shoes will give you away as a tourist.


Instead of throwing on tennis shoes, invest in a nice pair of leather shoes or, especially, ballerina flats. Black ballerina flats go with everything, and they are comfortable.Leave the UGG boots and flip flops at home, too. You don’t need to wear heels that are too high. In Paris, it’s considered tacky to wear super high platform heels. When dressing down, you will likely see Parisians wearing the ballet flats, short boots or tall boots. When dressing up for a more formal event, women will wear lower high heels, but not wedge or spiked heels.
Get your shoes shined, and take good care of them. One pair of expensive shoes that lasts forever is a good bet in Paris. Parisians wear nice shoes even when they are in casual settings because they believe that the shoes elevate the overall look.;
, In Paris, you won’t see a lot of women wearing unnatural colors (think lime green) or anything too gaudy. The same is true with fabrics.


Avoid anything synthetic. Avoid distracting patterns, too. Instead, stick with classic neutral colors, such as navy, white, black, or tan colors.One benefit of sticking with neutral colors is that you can easily mix and match them with other pieces of clothing. They’re versatile. Parisians choose neutral colors for both formal or informal settings.
Mariner stripes are an exception to the no busy pattern rule. They are very Parisian, and they are worn in casual wear most frequently, paired with jeans or casual trousers.

, Parisian style is sometimes compared to New York style, and one thing they have in common is choice of color. The major color in any Parisian’s wardrobe is black.


You will see black worn in dresses, jackets, and trousers. Throw a white T-shirt or buttoned-down dress shirt under a black blazer and wear skinny black jeans, and you're set!
Black is a slimming color, and it’s instantly sophisticated. When in doubt, wear black! One benefit of black is that it can work for more casual or formal settings. A black evening dress works well for a formal night out in Paris.
The runner-up color most commonly seen in Parisian outfits is gray. Overall, the color palette in Paris is very understated and elegant., There is a basic style that you will see over and over again In Paris. If you want to master Parisian style, start with it. Consider it the typical Parisian's ""uniform.""


The basic uniform is a blazer (very tailored), with skinny jeans, a T-shirt, and, if you’re a woman, ballet flats or heels.
Again, think about wearing this uniform in the right colors – black or grey. Keep the accessories to a minimum to pull off the look.
Go for a layered look, such as a shirt under a sweater and coat. Mix classy with casual. You want to look like you threw the outfit together. A great tailored blazer is a must.

, One of the most important things to Parisians is to make sure clothes fit well. Think tailored, not shapeless.


Ill-fitting dresses, pants that are too tight or too big, and dowdy, boxy jackets are all not going to cut it in Paris.
French women dress for their body type, no matter what it is, and they enjoy slim-fitting clothing that accentuates curves. They don't try to hide their curves in too-baggy clothing.
Clothing won't fit as well if you just get it off the rack. Parisians visit tailors. Some boutiques even tailor clothes on the spot. The seams will be stronger and better. The clothes will likely last longer.

, Parisians are known for their sex appeal, but they achieve this without showing too much skin. They dress for comfort, and they don't throw their sexuality in your face.


The rule is to not show too much of your legs, cleavage, or butt at one time. If you’re going to show a little leg, for example, don’t wear a low cut dress at the same time.
If you’re trying too obviously to look sexy, that’s usually going to be less sexy, ironically. Too much cleavage is not common in Paris.
Cramming yourself into a too-tight, too-revealing, too-short dress? That speaks more to Las Vegas than Paris. Learn to be sexy through understatement and confidence.

, In Paris, people tend to have a few staple items that are quite expensive. They actually save money in the long run because their clothes last longer.


However, they have fewer clothes overall and tend to wear the expensive staples over and over again for a better look. They mix and match and are not fans of wearing something once and then discarding it.
Think of it this way. They have higher quality clothing but own less of it overall. They might purchase a $1,000 trench coat, but they’ll wear it for years. They will likely own a nice fitted dress shirt, a blazer, a great coat, and a pair of trousers.
Think smart when you’re spending your money. You don’t need a lot of things; you just need a few good things. Shop at high-end stores that take pride in fine fabrics.

, Parisians will focus on the tiny aspects of an outfit or look to create an overall sophisticated and polished look.


Don’t go out with chipped nail polish, in a shirt that’s wrinkled, or in a shirt that’s ripped. Parisians will notice and think you're not respecting yourself.
Women often choose formal dresses with subtle but intricate bead work or even a large white flower, bow, or brooch.
Wear a scarf. Parisian women are very fond of scarves. It’s a signature accessory. Wear the scarf looped several times around your neck with a blazer and a T-shirt., It's one of the best known cliches about Parisians: That supposedly they wear berets. The problem is, it's not really true.


If you wear a beret in Paris, most people will probably recognize that you're a tourist. It's more the tourist's idea of Paris than the actual Parisian's.
Instead of a beret, try wearing a fedora hat. Sophisticated hats are sometimes worn in Paris to elevate an outfit's look.Another hat to avoid if you don't want to look like a tourist is a baseball cap. Put the baseball cap in the same category as tennis shoes: You won't look Parisian with them on.

, Men in Paris share a lot of dressing commonalities with their female counterparts: They dress somewhat formal even in casual settings, and they pay attention to fit and shoes.


Parisian men wear leather pointed shoes in neutral black or brown that lace up, for informal wear or formal nights out. Men tailor their clothes so that their trousers are cut more narrowly. They won’t have a sagging cuff, crotch or armpits.
Scarves are not only for women in Paris. You will often see them on men, worn over a T-shirt or with a blazer. Parisian men prefer cotton, linens, cashmere, wool, denim and leather.Parisian men wear clothing that highlights the silhouette.For men, jeans, a bomber jacket and T shirt can work well. Suits are important, as are linen shirts. French men also choose a fitted, slim style in their suits as well as their jeans.

, Keep in mind that the peroxide in hair dye is very damaging. If you want to dye it with little damage, there are some natural options like henna or honey and chamomile. Henna makes the hair reddish-brown, while honey and chamomile will make your hair lighter. Chamomile and honey work best when exposed to sunlight. You can also use lemon juice to make some highlights, but the acid can be damaging when done frequently.

"
Dress up.,
Keep your individuality.,
Get healthy.,
Use scent appropriately.,
Accessorize simply.,
Stop flashing logos.",How to Have Parisian Style2," French people take pride in how they look, and they take pride in how they dress. You won’t see them dressing down for comfort outside the home.


For example, don’t wear yoga pants or hoodies to go to the coffee shop or grocery store. Pay attention to your dress at all times when outside the house.
Take pride in what you’re wearing even for mundane activities and on typical days. It’s about an attitude. Even in casual wear, a Parisian is more likely to toss on a blazer (over a T-shirt) than wear a hooded sweatshirt.
Carry yourself with confidence, and walk with your head held high and your posture straight, knowing that you’re dressed well and will command respect as a result.

, Parisians are not afraid to keep and show small physical imperfections, even though their clothing is impeccable. They are all about natural beauty.


Don’t worry if your nose is a bit big or your teeth crooked. For example, Vanessa Paradis is considered one of the world’s great French beauties, and she has never fixed the prominent gaps in her teeth.
Along those same lines, don’t pluck your eyebrows too much or augment your lips with fillers. Try not to have more than two colors in your hair.
The key to the entire style is to augment your natural beauty subtly and to do so in a way that doesn’t look like you are trying too hard.

, For French women, it’s about working with what they naturally have, not changing who they are or their overall look. French women eat what they want, but they exercise portion control and are known for their slim physiques.


They take great care of their hair and skin. French women grow bored by indoor workouts. They are not into the American workout regimen. You won’t see many of them in the gym.
Instead, drink a lot of water. A key to beautiful skin is to drink water all day long. Mineral water spray can also spruce up the skin. The hair, skin, and body are the base for the overall Parisian style. Take care of your skin using cleanser, gel cream, and cleansing milk suitable for your skin type, oily, combination, normal, dry etc..Eat organic food with little sugar. This will keep weight in check, but it also is good for your skin. What you put into your body will dictate whether your hair shines and your skin glows, not what you slather on or into it.

, French women know that to make a statement, you need a signature scent. They are well aware of the power of smell and use it to create sex appeal.


They will leave the house with a touch of perfume that they apply lightly, and they usually stick to a scent once they discover it.
Dab perfume on the hair, behind the ear, on the back of your neck. Try to choose a scent that is not too overpowering and that you wear consistently.
Chanel No. 5 is, of course, one of the most famous French perfumes. French women like perfume that is vanilla based or has a floral smell. They use it as a signature, and it helps form an identity.

, In Paris, less is more. French women aren’t going to leave the house with too much bling. French men won’t be seen with gaudy gold necklaces.


Before you leave home, try to remove one accessory. Don’t overload the look with too many pieces of jewelry, statement handbags, etc. Do try to have one accessory per outfit (belt, bracelet, etc.)
French women keep their nails clean and sometimes wear polish. The French manicure is not really worn in Paris. Pedicures are important, though. French women will wear polish in neutral colors or even use clear gloss and won't be seen in neon.
Instead, think of accessories from the standpoint of one great piece. Dramatic red lipstick might be your only needed accessory! It was fashion icon Coco Chanel who said you should remove one accessory before leaving the house.

, Great style in Paris is about how you put together the look and the quality of the clothes and fit. It’s not about the name brand.


Avoid the American temptation to flaunt labels on everything from handbags to blue jeans. That's considered tacky in Paris.That doesn’t mean the French don’t have some iconic brands. They do. Think Louis Vuitton. It’s just that flaunting logos is not the key to Parisian style.
Parisian style is about high quality clothing with great seams, classic lines and colors. It’s about achieving a vibe and look.

Go for the natural hair look.,
Try red lips.,
Showcase great skin.,
Try a smoky eye.",How to Have Parisian Style3," French women like to shampoo and then air dry their hair and then wait a day. They think their hair looks better on day two, and they’re not fans of blowouts.


If they do choose to dye their hair, they will likely keep it very close to the original color or to hide any gray.The look is natural and a little tousled. They get their hair cut frequently, and prefer short crops or hair that just hits the shoulder. They also don’t wash their hair every day. You will sometimes see French women pull their hair into a messy bun.
Parisians think healthy hair and a good haircut are key and don’t load their hair with styling products or use a lot of heat on it. Keep the accessories out of your hair. No bows, headbands or clips! They also don’t leave the house with wet hair.
Parisian women don’t worry that their hair is not immaculately kept in place. One natural hair mask they use is to mix together rum, honey, two egg yolks and lemon juice. Apply it to the hair for 30 minutes, and then rinse with cold water. French women rarely use hair dryers. Instead, they air dry their air and towel dry it as much as they can.

, French women aren’t big into eyeliner. They’re more into using the lips as the dominant feature when it comes to makeup.Classic red lipstick is used as a fashion accessory.


French women don’t think they need a lot of other makeup if they’re wearing red lipstick. It makes the only statement they need!Don’t wear lip liner though. Keep your teeth white and clean by brushing them with baking soda once a week. White teeth with red lipstick is a better combination than coffee or cigarette-stained teeth would be.
Play up your lips or eyes, but never both at the same time. If you play up both, the makeup will seem too obvious.

, To Parisians, great skin is a fashion statement, and they take care of their skin from an early age. Skin care is more important than makeup to Parisians. Skin should look natural.


It’s about accenting what you have naturally. Don’t contour your face. Dark shading ruins natural beauty and glow. French women might add highlights to the face, but they aren’t fans of contouring.

If you notice your scalp gets very oily or itchy after shampooing for only two to three times a week, you may want to increase the amount of times you shampoo every week. To properly shampoo your hair, only rub it into your scalp, massaging your scalp as you do this, and then let the shampoo run down the strands of your hair as you wash out the shampoo.
Unlike shampoo, it’s important that you always condition your hair when you get it wet in the shower. Conditioner can help to replace the lipids and proteins in your hair shafts and allow your hair to grow longer and healthier.

, Rinsing your hair with cool water at the end of a hot shower can help to seal the cuticle and give your hair more durability when you style it.You should consider turning down the water temperature of your shower water when you are washing your hair with shampoo and conditioner as well so you do not overheat your hair with very hot and steamy water.

, Though you may be in the habit of wrapping and twisting your hair in a towel once you get out of the shower, doing this can cause breakage and put stress on the strands of your hair. Wet hair is particularly fragile so substitute the post shower towel wrap with a gentle pat down using a dry towel.If you like to wrap your hair in a towel, you can try using thin towels and soft microfiber towels. These towels are made of material that is gentle on your hair and dries it well without breakage.

Try to cut back on your use of them or cut them out of your hair care routine completely. Go for more natural looking locks so you do not get in the way of healthy hair growth.If you do use hot styling tools, you should use them on a low heat setting and use a heat protectant gel or cream to avoid damaging your hair.

, While it may seem counterintuitive to get your hair trimmed in order to encourage rapid hair growth, getting your hair stylist to trim your hair can actually help you hair to grow faster and healthier. Trimming your hair regularly will prevent split ends from working their way up the strands of your hair, which will reduce the need to get your hair cut. Split ends can cause your hair to break off high up on the strand, leading to shorter hair and more trips to your stylist.Your hairdresser should trim ⅛ of an inch off your hair every 10 to 12 weeks to prevent the development of damaging split ends.

, Increasing your protein intake will promote healthy hair growth and ensure you do not start to shed or lose your hair. Make sure your diet is a balance of meat, fish, beans, nuts, and whole grains.

Avoid processed meats or full fat dairy products, as these can lead to other health issues. Make sure you are also getting enough healthy carbs in your diet that are high in fiber and full of nutrients, such as whole grains, fruits, and vegetables., The “inversion” method is when you invert your head so it is below your heart, encouraging blood flow that can then encourage hair growth. Some individuals who have used the inversion method saw clear results, about one quarter to one half inch of growth after one week. Though there is no scientific proof that this method works, it is a harmless method you can try to encourage hair growth./images/thumb/6/6d/Grow-Your-Hair-in-a-Week-Step-13-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Grow-Your-Hair-in-a-Week-Step-13-Version-2.jpg

You can massage your scalp with coconut oil before you invert for four minutes a day to encourage hair growth. You may also want to measure the length of your hair at the beginning of the week so you can chart your progress.
Do the inversion method by laying on your bed and allowing your head to dangle off the edge of the bed so your neck is supported on the edge of your bed. You should try to remain in this position for four to five minutes a day. You can also do yoga poses like downward dog, shoulder stand, or head stand. The idea is that your head is above your heart, leading to blood flow to your head.
Come out of the inversion slowly so you do not feel faint or dizzy. At the end of the week, measure your hair again and note how long your hair has grown in just one week.

Eat a healthy, balanced diet rich in essential vitamins and nutrients.,
Drink plenty of water.,
Make sure you’re getting enough protein.,
Take a daily multivitamin.,
Add Biotin to your daily routine.,

Avoid using heat on your hair.,
Skip the shampoo, but not the conditioner.,
Treat your hair to masks or oils regularly.,
Invest in a silk pillowcase.,
Get regular trims.",How to Grow Your Hair 2 Inches in a Month," The nutrients that are most essential for hair growth are iron, vitamin D, B-complex vitamins, and zinc. Each of these plays an important role in the overall health of your hair, and thus the rate of your hair growth.Get plenty of iron by eating foods like spinach, eggs (with the yolk!), chickpeas, beans, and red meat.
You can get your vitamin D from the sunshine, but eating a diet rich in vitamin D is especially important for people who live in less sunny climates. Eat things like salmon, tuna, mushrooms, egg yolks, and foods fortified with vitamin D.There are plenty of vitamins that fall under the umbrella of B-complex vitamins. Whole grains, eggs, and avocados are some of the best foods to eat in order to make sure you’re getting enough.Good news – you can get some of your zinc requirements through dark chocolate! Other sources include oysters, pumpkin seeds, and garlic.;
, You've probably heard the advice to drink eight glasses of water a day, and it is an important tip for growing your hair. Make sure that you drink water with every meal, and sip on it throughout the day. Replace your soda, juice, and coffee with water to make sure you’re getting enough. When your body is hydrated, your hair will reap the benefits by growing and looking shiny.Think of drinking water like watering a plant. The water you drink will nourish your hair from the scalp, just like plants are nourished from their roots.

, Meat is a great source of protein, but vegetarians can get it through foods like beans, nuts, whole grains, spinach, and peanut butter. When you’re not getting enough protein in your diet, you’re more likely to experience shedding and breakage, which is not great for those trying to grow long, healthy hair., While it’s always best to get your vitamins and nutrients through your food, you can help prevent any deficiencies by taking a multivitamin every day. While most daily multivitamins will do the trick, double check to make sure yours has biotin, vitamin C, and your B-complex vitamins.If you have any allergies, make sure you talk to your doctor before starting a multivitamin. Sometimes, inactive ingredients in the vitamins can cause allergic reactions.Multivitamins can interfere with certain medications. It's extremely important that your doctor knows your medical history, your current prescriptions and medicines, and has given you the all-clear to start taking multivitamins., When someone is deficient in Biotin, a B-complex vitamin, they will experience dry, brittle hair and nails. Therefore, it is often recommended to take a Biotin supplement in order to prevent becoming deficient. Biotin supports hair growth by making the hair more elastic, and thus less likely to break off.People taking Biotin for hair growth should take about 500-700 micrograms a day.
Keep in mind that you will need to take Biotin for months (ideally 3-6 months) before seeing big results, although it can certainly start benefitting your hair within a month.
Biotin is generally safe, but any woman pregnant or breastfeeding should double-check with their doctor before beginning this supplement., Fish oil has numerous benefits for your body, and healthy hair is one of them. The fatty acids that you get from fish oil helps to strengthen hair. Strong hair is more likely to grow and resist breakage. A second perk? Fish oil can make your hair shiny as well!Low doses (less than 3 grams) of fish oil is typically safe. In high doses, fish oil can prevent blood from clotting, thus increasing chances of bleeding. It can also suppress the immune system, which can be particularly worrisome for the elderly, and anyone on medication that already lowers the immune system., Blow dryers, curling irons, and straighteners can all cause damage to the hair, which you want to avoid more than ever while you’re trying to grow it longer. If you can take a break from styling it with heat, do it. This will help prevent breakage and keep your hair growing beautifully.If you can’t avoid using heat on your hair, make sure you spray it thoroughly with heat protectant sprays before styling.

Oils can also moisturize your hair. Moisturized hair is less brittle and less likely to break prematurely.


Oils worth considering include coconut oil, olive oil, lavender oil, castor oil, jojoba oil, almond oil, rosemary oil, fish oil, emu oil, tea tree oil, grape seed oil, mustard oil, and avocado oil.
Use the oil at room temperature or warmer. To warm the oil, you can place a small sealed bottle of your chosen oil in a dish of hot (but not simmering) water for a minute or two.
Massage the oil into your scalp and allow it to coat your hair.
Keep the oil in place for 15 to 30 minutes before rinsing with warm water.;
, The protein in eggs can strengthen your hair and add volume, as well as length.


Break an egg into a dish and lightly beat the yolk and white together until mixed.
Consider adding 1 tsp (1 ml) honey or olive oil for a moisturizing effect. Mix well.
Apply the egg mixture to your hair after you shampoo it.
Allow the egg-based moisturizer to sit on your hair for 10 to 20 minutes. If desired, apply a moisturizing conditioner while the product is still in your hair. If not, rinse it from the hair directly using warm water.

, An apple cider vinegar rinse should be done once a week to help strip away any build-up or residue left behind by various hair care products and oils.


Pour up to 1/4 cup (60 ml) apple cider vinegar through your hair. Focus on the roots, but allow the vinegar to make its way through the entire length of your hair.
When done, wash your hair as normal.

, Coconut milk contains a number of proteins, fatty acids, and iron. All of these, when combined, can strengthen your hair and drastically reduce the risk of premature hair breakage.Massage organic coconut milk directly into the hair roots using firm circular motions. Allow it to sit for 15 to 20 minutes before rinsing with warm water and washing with a mild shampoo.
You could also mix 1 Tbsp (15 ml) honey or glycerin into the coconut milk before applying it. The honey enhances its moisturizing effect, transforming coconut milk from a conditioner to a deep conditioner.

, Aloe vera contains fatty acids, zinc, iron, vitamin A, vitamin C, and vitamin E. All of these vitamins and minerals play key parts in promoting hair health and growth. Overall, aloe vera gel blocks sebum from getting onto the hair, which is significant since sebum can attract dirt and bacteria responsible for hair loss.


Mix 2 tsp (10 ml) aloe vera gel with 2 tsp (10 ml) olive oil, 1 tsp (5 ml) honey, and 1 oz (30 ml) warm water. Apply this solution directly to the scalp.
Let the aloe vera solution sit on your scalp for 30 minutes. When ready, rinse with warm water and wash with a mild shampoo.

, While it may seem counter-intuitive, you should get split ends trimmed off the bottom of your hair every four to six weeks.


Technically, trimming your hair does not cause your hair to grow. It does, however, get rid of any dry or damaged ends. If you do not take care of these splits and breakages, they can travel up the length of your locks, causing your hair to become more brittle as it grows out. If you want long hair that is healthy and strong, as well as long, then you need to get rid of these ends regularly.

, A scalp massage can increase the circulation of blood in the skin of your scalp. As a result, the follicles are also stimulated, and hair ends up growing faster.


A scalp massage done with one of the natural oils mentioned in this article is an even better option than a dry massage.

, Stress can make your hair brittle and also slows down the rate at which it grows. Manage your stress by taking part in activities that relax you.


Gentle exercise can be a great way to reduce stress. Take up yoga or go for a 30 minute walk in the park.
Sleep is also an important aspect of reducing stress. Get seven to eight hours of sleep per night whenever possible.

, Heat can draw the moisture out of your hair faster than usual. Dry hair is more likely to burn and break prematurely. Air drying your hair can minimize the risk of heat damage.If you do dry your hair with a hair dryer, use the lowest setting on your dryer and consider first applying a natural oil, like coconut oil, to protect your hair from the heat. The excess oil can burn off instead the water and the hair tissue.
You should also avoid heated styling products, like hair straighteners and curling irons.
In addition to using less heat, you should avoid hot water, as well. Hot water can make your hair brittle, as well, and lukewarm to cool water is a better option if you want to promote better length.

, Shampoo strips the oil from your hair. That oil protects your hair, however, and allows it to grow out without suffering damage from dehydration. To retain enough oil, wash your hair every other day or no more than three times a week.


Note that washing your hair is still important, though, since too much oil can block your hair follicles and ultimately make it more difficult for your hair to grow out.

, Brushing your hair distributes the natural oils on your scalp throughout the length of your hair. These oils can coat each entire strand, keeping them all hydrated and healthy.


Use a natural bristle brush and brush from scalp to ends.
Brushing your hair also stimulates circulation in your scalp.

, Tight ponytails, pigtails, buns, and similar updos can cause your hair to break. When you tie a hair rubber band around your hair, the strands become stressed and may even break. The more often you do this, the weaker your hair will become.Tight hair styles also tend to pull hair from the roots and can cause permanent damage as a result.
If you need to pull your hair back, try to keep the ponytail as loose as possible to avoid damage.

, Pillowcases made from either satin or silk are a luxury your hair will really thank you for. The smooth fabric can prevent your hair from tangling and drying out.


Similarly, you could wrap a satin or silk scarf around your hair before you sleep at night. This can accomplish the same result as a satin pillow.

, Keep your hair protected from any harsh outdoor conditions. It can be as sensitive as your skin, so proper protection is vital.


Wear a hat or similar covering to protect your hair from the sun, especially if you plan on being out in the sun for a prolonged period of time.
When the weather gets colder and drier, you need to protect it from harsh winds by wearing a hat, and you also need to increase any moisturizing routines you follow.

, A large number of commercial hair coloring contains ammonia. This is a bleaching agent that can severely dry out your hair, and dry hair is more likely to break prematurely.


If you want to dye your hair, have it done by a professional stylist and get color treatments as infrequently as possible.
You could also try natural hair dyes, like coffee and cinnamon, which are far more gentle.

, Capsaicin is the chemical responsible for making peppers hot. This chemical also promote hair growth by imitating natural human growth factors, so consuming more of it can result in greater hair growth., Biotin can be consumed through your diet or in supplement form. If you want to get more biotin naturally, eat more tomatoes, carrots, romaine lettuce, or chard.


Biotin increases the production of red blood cells and boosts the level of insulin in your body. As a result, more glucose can be delivered to the hair follicles in your head.
This vitamin also stimulates the keratinocyte cells directly responsible for strengthening your hair.

, If you have a balanced diet, you can likely get all the vitamins your hair needs without taking any special supplements. If you want to focus on increasing your vitamin intake, however, there are a handful of vitamins you should pay special attention to if your primary interest is making your hair stronger and longer.


Vitamin A keeps the hair and scalp hydrated. It also regulates a natural acid utilized by your hair follicles.
Vitamin B3 improves blood circulation, thereby improving circulation to the hair follicles and stimulating additional growth.
Vitamin B12 helps the body produce red blood cells. More red blood cells means that the hair follicles can receive more oxygen.
Vitamin C strengthens your hair, so you are less likely to encounter split ends. It also helps your body produce new tissue and new hair.
Vitamin E is another vitamin responsible for stimulating circulation. It can also boost the immune system, so your hair can remain healthier as a result.
You also need plenty of iron and zinc, which both improve circulation.

, Your body uses protein for many areas of growth, and new hair growth is one such area. You can get more protein from meat, fish, eggs, beans, and nuts, or you can look for dietary supplements that provide protein.


Drink soy milk. In addition to being high in protein, soy milk and other soy products contain isoflavones that are believed to increase and promote hair growth.

, Hydration is vital if you want your hair to grow. Drink an average of eight 8-oz (250-ml) glasses of water daily to dramatically improve the health and length of your hair.

This will help with hair follicle growth.If you have a hard time incorporating foods with a lot of iron into your diet, such as red meat, consult your doctor to see if a dietary supplement might be appropriate for you.

, Getting stressed out doesn't help any of your body systems, and even you hair can be affected. In extreme cases, stress can cause you to lose hair, in less extreme cases, it can simply lesson the productivity of body systems, such as hair growth.There are a wide variety of ways to destress or to avoid stress in the first place but each method is highly individualized.


Take time in your day to destress. It doesn't matter how you do it, whether yoga, stretching, meditation, or a nice long walk, but what matters is that you take the time to calm your mind and body from the stress of the day.

Grow your roots at least 1 inch.,
Match your natural color.,
Use highlights or lowlights.,
Use funky colors.",How to Grow Out Your Natural Hair Color2," If you are going to try to match your hair color with a suitable dye, you need a sample of what your natural hair color looks like. Grow your roots out at least 1 inch before attempting to find a matching shade., Using your roots as a guide, select a color of hair dye that is as close as possible to your natural color. If you can afford it, visit a professional colorist; they can match your color more precisely than home products. If you are on a tight budget, visit your local beauty supply store and ask a worker to help you select the right shade. Then head back home and dye your hair.If applying the color yourself, first read all packaging for specific directions.
Mix the developer with the color. If you are using a box dye, these will be measured out for you. If you have purchased separate developer and color, read the instructions and follow them.
Part your hair into 4-8 sections and apply the product to your roots.
Spread the product through the rest of your hair, making sure to saturate all of it.
Set a timer and wait.
Rinse your hair.

, If your dyed color is quite a bit different from your natural color, it may not be possible (or advisable) to dye your hair back to your natural color right away. Instead, you can use highlights (if your natural color is lighter) or lowlights (if your natural color is darker). You can add additional highlights or lowlights every 3-4 weeks until you have sufficiently disguised your roots. Then simply allow your hair to continue growing out.


Both highlights and lowlights are best done by a professional colorist.
Explain to your colorist that you want to move toward your natural color and they can help you.

, If your hair has been bleached and you want to grow it out, a fun option is to use bright funky colors to cover your roots as they grow. When you first apply bright colors (such as purple, hot pink, or teal), they will cover your roots and your hair. As the colors fade with each shampoo, your roots will become more prominent. But when you are going for a fun funky look like this, you can get away with showing some dark roots.


Try Manic Panic brand hair dye.
Apply a mix of 2-3 different colors for a more dynamic look that will better disguise your roots.
With Manic Panic (and most semi-permanent dyes) you do not use developer. Simply apply to paste directly to dry hair and wait 20-30 minutes. Then rinse.

These products are formulated to be more gentle on color-treated hair, so that the dye lasts longer before fading.
Baby shampoo is very inexpensive and excellent for all hair types including permed. Since it is gentle enough to use on a baby's hair, it will also be gentle enough to use on yours.
You may skip the conditioner if your hair is oily. Conditioner also makes an instant hair detangler when mixed with water in a spray bottle

, The shampoo in your shower can contribute to dry, damaged hair. Contrary to popular belief, it is not good or even necessary to wash your hair everyday, especially if your hair is chemically treated. Too much washing dries out the scalp, and keeps your hair from growing properly. Wash your hair only every other day (or every third day) to grow out your natural hair color.Try to go without washing for at least four days. If your hair feels a little greasy before then, try using a dry shampoo.
If you don't have one then mix some cornstarch with baking soda, sprinkle it on your roots and top part of your hair, and then brush it thoroughly.

, Exercising has many benefits for the human body such as maintaining body weight and improving overall health. But did you know that it can also help make hair grow faster? Exercising causes the heart to pump faster, circulating blood flow throughout the whole body including the scalp, resulting in faster hair growth. After a few weeks or months of sticking with an exercise routine, you should start to notice a change in hair growth.


Put your sneakers on and go for a jog or a long walk in the park.
Learn a new dance, try yoga, or jump on your trampoline.
You can also pick up strength training.

Wash your feet before soaking them in the vinegar mixture.,
Soak your infected foot.,
Let your foot rest in the solution for 10 to 30 minutes.,
Apply vinegar directly to a very small infection.,
Use a moisturizer after treating your feet to minimize damage.",How to Use Apple Cider Vinegar for Athlete's Foot1," The cloudy, brown film you see in some bottles of apple cider vinegar is called “the mother”, and it’s a good thing. It means the vinegar is of high quality, and contains extra healing nutrients that will make it even more effective., You will want enough so that you can stick both your feet in. If more volume is needed, consider adding warm water, being sure to not dilute the vinegar beyond one part vinegar to one part water.If you do not have apple cider vinegar, you can also use white vinegar.

, Rinse your feet with soap and water. Once your feet are scrubbed clean, dry them off with a towel or let them air-dry. If you choose to use a towel, make sure to wash it immediately after you use it so that it can’t spread the fungus to other parts of your body., Place your foot in the large bowl of vinegar mix. The acid of the vinegar will kill the fungus, as well as soften and break down the calluses it causes. If you want, you can use a washcloth to gently scrub the infected spot while your foot soaks in the mixture.


5% vinegar should not be too harsh for your skin. However, if you feel burning or a rash occurs, stop soaking your foot and add water to dilute the mixture.

, You should do this two to three times a day for seven days. Once those seven days are up, continue to soak your foot for one to two times a day for three more days. After the 10 to 30 minutes have passed, take your foot out of the bowl and dry it.

Apply Vaseline or talcum powder to your feet.",How to Treat Trench Foot," Trench foot is caused by having wet feet for long periods of time, due to things like having wet shoes and socks or standing in water or mud for a long period of time. If you start to notice symptoms of trench foot, then you should seek medical attention as soon as possible. Symptoms of trench foot may include the following:


tingly or itchy feet
pain in your feet
swelling feet
cold blotchy skin
numbness, heaviness, or a prickly feeling in your feet
redness and warmth
dry skin
blisters followed by tissue death (late stage);
, Although trench foot was termed over a hundred years ago and seems to be something of the past, it can still occur in people who spend many hours in cold, wet conditions. One of the best ways to treat trench foot is to keep your feet dry and clean.If you find yourself standing in water for a few hours or more, clean and dry them as often as you can. Change into dry socks as needed.


Trench foot develops because the blood vessels of the feet constrict in an attempt to keep the rest of the body warm, which reduces the amount of oxygen and nutrients the tissue gets.
Without adequate oxygen and nutrients, the tissues of the feet swell and eventually die. Bacteria in the water can also trigger infections if there's cuts or abrasions on the feet.
If you do have cuts on your feet, apply some antibacterial cream or alcohol-based sanitizer after you dry your feet, but before you put your shoes / boots back on.

, If you've been standing in cold water for hours at a time, it's important to not only dry your feet, but you need to warm them up gradually.The heat will open up (dilate) blood vessels and increase the circulation to your feet, which will stop the progression of trench foot. Apply warm packs or soak your feet in warm water for approximately 5-10 minutes. Resist the urge to use hot water because you may scold your feet and make the condition worse.


If you take a warm foot bath, add some potassium permanganate solution (from your local pharmacy) to the water — it can help draw fluid out of the swollen tissue. affected area.
Trench foot is similar to frostbite, although it doesn’t require freezing water temperatures. It can develop in water temperatures up to 60 °F (15.6 °C) and even occur while indoors.Trench foot can take less than a day of water exposure (as few as 12 hours) to develop.

, Once you've warmed your feet up, it's important to keep your socks off initially while you rest and sleep in your bed.This may seem counter-intuitive for cold feet, but wearing tight socks can reduce blood circulation and make trench foot worse. After a few days of recovery, you can wear loose socks made of breathable material, such as cotton.


Instead of socks, keep your feet warm while resting by covering them with a wool blanket.
Don't elevate your feet while sitting on the couch because you want to encourage blood flow to your lower legs and feet.
While lying in bed at night, add another blanket to the bottom of your bed to keep your feet warm. Try not to cross your ankles because that can slow circulation to your feet.

, Trench foot is characterized by tissue swelling and pain that can become quite severe. It can affect the toes, heel or the entire foot depending on which parts of your feet are wet and for how long.As such, take medications that can combat the pain and swelling, such as anti-inflammatories. Ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) and or naproxen (Aleve) are common over-the-counter types that work well.


Anti-inflammatories work best and are safest if taken for short periods of time -- less than a few weeks.
Once trench foot sets in, it can take between a few weeks to several months to fully heal, depending on the severity and the overall health of the person.

, The main signs of trench foot (pain, swelling, blistering, color changes) typically aren't due to infection, although standing in water contaminated with bacteria from feces certainly increases the risk of infection, especially if you have any cuts, nicks or abrasions on your feet.Other signs of infection to look out for include bloody pus discharge, red and/or white streaks on your feet, foul odor and mild fever.


If blisters form with trench foot, the likelihood of infection developing is significantly increased.
If you are at risk for trench foot, apply an antibiotic cream or sanitizing lotion to any cuts or abrasions on your feet as soon as you can.
Your doctor may give you antibiotics to prevent infection or even a tetanus booster if your vaccination record isn't current.

, A greenish black discoloration of the skin on the feet indicates that tissue is dying from not getting enough oxygen and nutrients for too prolonged a period of time.Tissue death (also called necrosis) can quickly lead to gangrene, which is a medical emergency needing antibiotics and likely surgical intervention.


In addition to dark discoloration, other signs of gangrene include: further swelling, severe pain then a loss of sensation, peeling away of skin, foul-smelling discharge and disfigurement of toes.
In severe cases of trench foot where gangrene has set in, foot and lower leg amputation is usually required.

, The majority of people don't want to stand in cold water for very long, although some jobs and pastimes (fly fishing or seeing outdoor concerts) significantly increase the risk of developing trench foot.Keep an eye on the clock and remember that trench foot can develop in as little as 12 hours or so under some circumstances. Retreat to dry ground within that time frame if possible.


Take breaks from your job every few hours if it requires you stand in water — this is particularly important for rescue and emergency workers, as well as members of the military.
Standing in warm, unsanitary water for many hours is also problematic and causes another type of immersion foot, so keeping your feet dry is important regardless of the temperature.

, If your job or situation requires spending substantial amounts of time standing in wet or damp conditions, it's important to check or monitor your socks regularly to see if they're damp or wet also. If they are damp or wet, change into clean, dry socks in order to prevent or lower the likelihood of developing trench foot.If you're on the job or need to walk / stand in wet conditions, pack a few extra pair of socks with you just in case.


For wet conditions, use polypropylene sock liners, which are specially designed to draw moisture away from your feet.
Socks made out of natural fibers, such as cotton and wool, tend to be better for preventing trench foot than artificial materials.

, In addition to your socks, make an effort to wear appropriate footwear if you anticipate being in damp or wet conditions. Ideally, you should wear waterproof boots that fit above your ankle, but regardless of type, make sure they fit well — not too loose or too tight.Stick to shoes / boots made out of treated leather and avoid ones made of synthetic materials, such as rubber or vinyl. Leather is more expensive, but repels moisture while being able to breathe (ventilate).


Depending on your situation, it may be best to change your footwear a few times daily and let the wet pair dry out overnight.
Rubber boots and gators are great for spending a few hours standing in the water (for fly fishing, for example), but can help trigger trench foot after many hours, especially if the rubber doesn't have an insulating inner lining.

, An old trick used back in the World War 1 era to prevent trench foot was to apply lots of whale oil to the feet in order to repel the moisture and help insulate the feet from the cold.In modern times, it's more practical to rub some Vaseline over your feet instead, although the effect and helpful benefits remain the same.


Another method of keeping feet dry is to sprinkle some talcum powder on them, which helps absorb the moisture instead of repelling it.
Talcum powder is especially recommended for people who tend to sweat more. Excessive perspiration can also be controlled by applying drying agents, such as aluminium chloride.

Wash it off and dry thoroughly.

, Like apple cider vinegar, hydrogen peroxide is an effective antifungal.Indeed, it is even stronger than vinegar, which is why it is best not to use it as a daily soak. Instead, alternate one day with apple cider vinegar and the next with 2% hydrogen peroxide.Purchase 3% hydrogen peroxide.
Dilute the hydrogen peroxide by adding water in a ratio of 2 parts hydrogen peroxide to 1 part water.
If you experience burning or a rash, dilute the hydrogen peroxide further by adding more water.
WARNING: Do not mix vinegar and hydrogen peroxide together, or treat your foot with one after the other. Mixing the two can form peracetic acid, a caustic chemical that can both burn your foot and damage your lungs through its fumes., Colloidal silver (tiny particles of silver suspended in liquid) at a strength of 100 ppm (parts per million) is an effective antifungal and antibacterial agent. After you have soaked your feet in apple cider vinegar and dried them, apply colloidal silver solution to the affected areas and let it air dry.


WARNING: Never ingest colloidal silver. It has no benefits and can build up in your skin causing permanent, bluish-gray discoloration."

Wash your footwear.,
Get shoes that fit properly.,
Alternate the shoes you wear every day.,
Disinfect your shower and bath.",How to Use Apple Cider Vinegar for Athlete's Foot3," In between soaking your foot in the vinegar mix, make sure that the area stays clean and dry. The fungus that causes athlete’s foot loves moist areas, so having damp feet can mean that the infection will get worse or will come back.


A great way to keep your feet dry is to wear socks made of natural fabrics or fabrics that wick moisture away from your feet. Change your socks if they get wet.
Consider wearing sandals or flip-flops in hot weather.
Wear shower shoes, flip-flops or sandals around pools, gyms, hotel rooms, and shower or locker areas.

, Fungus is a pesky organism that won’t go away without a fight. It stays in your shoes and on your towels after your infected foot has touched them. Because of this, it is important to disinfect anything that your foot has touched while it has been infected. Rinse your shoes (yes, even the inside) with water and let them air dry in the sun. After they have dried, sprinkle anti-fungal powder into them to make sure that the fungus doesn’t come back.

, Athlete's foot occurs most often due to a combination of sweaty feet and tight-fitting, confining shoes.Don’t buy shoes that feel too tight and hope they will stretch out. To prevent athlete’s foot, you want shoes that are both long and wide enough.

, This will ensure that your shoes are dry when you put them on.

, As mentioned above, this kind of fungus loves moisture. When you have athlete’s foot and take a shower, some of the fungus will stay in the shower, which means it can infect your foot again as soon as you take another shower. Because of this, you should disinfect your tub or shower. Put on some gloves and use bleach or apple cider vinegar to scrub the floor in your shower. Once you are done, throw the gloves and sponge you used to clean into the trash."

Without a solid connection there is a chance the corn cap strip will slip out of place and lose effectiveness, or potentially come in contact with healthy skin.;
, Just like a Band-aid, the adhesive section is pressed against a rubber backing that ensures nothing sticks to it before being applied. Discard the backing once it has been fully separated from the adhesive portion., Press it down firmly, adhesive side facing the skin.The circle is medicated, most likely with salicylic acid, and erodes the corn’s accumulation of skin. The gel of the corn cap needs to penetrate the skin directly on the corn, and if possible, the edges as well, as there may be portions of the corn that have grown laterally along the skin.


Use separate adhesive strips on the edges to keep the corn cap in place.
If using the corn cap on a toe, wrap the adhesive portion all the way around the toe. The spongy ring should alleviate some of the pain related to the corn touching or rubbing against shoes and other items., In general, the corn caps should be reapplied every two days.It is possible, however, for some corn plasters to be reapplied daily until the corn is removed, or for a maximum of two weeks, whichever comes first.Apply the corn cap precisely as the instructions direct. Unnecessarily high absorption through the skin may occur if overused or improperly used., Allergic reactions may include, but are not limited to skin redness, itchiness, or a rash. Soreness and discomfort, both mild and severe, are common.If the irritation persists or becomes severe, you may be experiencing some form of salicylic acid toxicity.Severe reactions are rare, but anaphylaxis has been reported with use of salicylic acid., You should consult with a general physician, podiatrist, or dermatologist if your corn is painful, recurrent and not responding to corn paint. They might order an X-ray of your feet to rule out underlying bony abnormality and refer to an orthopedics if needed."

Avoid abrasive fabrics.,
Be careful about applying tension.,
Braid nape hair horizontally.,
Cover your hair to protect it.,
Brush your nape hair gently.,
Keep nape hair trimmed.,
Keep it moisturized.,
Cleanse your nape hair regularly.,
Condition your nape hair often.,
Massage it with oils.,
Use heat protectant products before styling with heat.,
Relax your nape hair at the end.",How to Grow Nape Hair," If you wear heavy, coarse materials close to your nape hair, this can cause it to become damaged and break. Try to keep your hair up and away from anything that could potentially harm your nape hair. Direct contact with abrasive fabrics can cause damage over time, so it’s important to keep this in mind all year long.This is especially important during the colder months of the year when you are more likely to wear heavy fabrics near your nape hair – like heavy coats, sweaters, and scarves.
This also includes tight caps or hats, headbands, and turbans.;
, Remember that pulling your hair tight or manipulating it in certain ways can cause damage and breakage. Regardless of what style you choose, you should be mindful of the amount of pressure you are applying to your nape hair if you want to keep it healthy and strong.Pay particularly close attention to this factor if you have a weave, tight braids, or regularly wear a wig, as these kinds of styles can add the most tension to your nape hair.

, Consider braiding your nape hair horizontally across the back of your nape, even if the rest of your hair is braided in a different way. This could help reduce tension by allowing you to loose-braid the sensitive nape hair.Don’t pull the braid tight or finish it off too tightly with a hair tie or rubber band. These things could add more tension and cause breakage.

, In order to avoid breakage, you should consider covering it at night to protect it. You can use a satin or silk pillowcase to sleep on, or cover your hair with a bonnet/headscarf. Remember to make sure your nape hair is covered as well.This will help protect all of your hair from potential breakage as you sleep, but especially the edges and the nape hair.

, Brushing your nape hair will help keep these hairs from forming into pesky knots. Just be sure to do it gently so that you don’t contribute to the breakage.Brushing your nape hairs regularly means that they will need to be detangled less frequently.

, In order to avoid breakage, you should keep your nape hair trimmed regularly. Even if you are trying to grow out your nape hair, trimming it fairly frequently will help remove any possibly damaged ends and promote the growth of new, healthy hair.Just remember that you don’t want to cut it too short each time, as this will make it take longer to grow out.

, Hydration is very important for this delicate portion of your hair. Keeping your nape hair moisturized will help it maintain its natural elasticity and prevent excessive dryness that can lead to breakage.Consider using a steamer on your nape hair for additional moisture.

, It is quite easy to overlook the nape hair when you are washing your hair. Make sure that you are thoroughly cleaning your nape hair each time you wash it so that all of the products and dirt are rinsed out every time. Dirty or grimy hair is much more prone to breakage.Remember to massage your nape hair gently while cleaning to help avoid tangles, knots, and tension.
Consider using herbal shampoos that are less damaging for your hair.

, Make sure to include your nape hair in your normal conditioning routine. Forgetting to condition this region can lead to dryness that makes it susceptible to breakage.Consider applying the conditioner to your nape area first so that it gets the most conditioning time possible.

, Massaging your nape hair will help stimulate blood to the area and encourage new hair growth. Simply warm up a few tablespoons of your favorite oil and dip your fingers into it. Use your fingertips to gently massage the oil into your nape hair in a circular motion for 2-5 minutes. You should try to use this massage technique once every week.Try using tea tree oil, coconut oil, avocado oil, or peppermint oil.

, Using heat styling products (like straighteners and curlers) are a great way to get certain kinds of styles, but they can also be very damaging to your hair. This is especially true for more fragile hair, like nape hair. Be sure to apply a heat protectant product to your nape hair before using any kind of heated styling tool.Some good heat protectant products include GHD Heat Protect Spray, Lee Stafford Original Heat Protection Shine Mist, or Bumble and Bumble Invisible Oil Primer.

, Since the nape hair is one of the most sensitive and fragile sections of your hair, you should apply relaxer to it as the last step. If you leave it on for too long, it can become over-processed and damaged.Over-processed hair often becomes quite dry, which leads to more frequent breakage.

Place a pair of socks over the booties.,
Soak your feet in the booties for an hour.,
Remove the booties.,
Rinse your feet with warm water.,
Wait several days for the skin to start peeling.",How to Use an Exfoliating Foot Peel," To ensure that there isn’t any dirt, oil, or other residue that might prevent the peel’s ingredients from penetrating your skin, you should wash your feet. Use warm water and your usual body wash or soap to get your feet clean.It may be convenient to apply the exfoliating peel after a shower or bath because it’s easier to wash your feet that way.;
, After your feet are clean, fill a small basin, foot bath, or bathtub with enough warm water to cover your feet. Allow them to soak in the water for 10 to 15 minutes to soften the skin so it will absorb the peel’s ingredients more easily.If the skin on your feet is particularly dry and hard, you may want to soak your feet for up to a half hour to soften it sufficiently.

, When you apply the peel, you don’t want any excess moisture on your feet that might dilute the ingredients. After you’ve finished soaking your feet, pat them dry with a clean towel so they’re ready for the peel., Virtually all exfoliating foot peels feature plastic booties that contain all of the ingredients inside so you can easily keep them on your feet for the duration. To use the peel, remove the booties from the box and use a pair of scissors to cut them open where indicated.The peel booties are always sealed when you purchase them so the ingredients don’t leak out before you use them.
It’s best to cut the booties open one at time and place the opened bootie on your foot before opening the next bootie. That way, none of the peel liquid will seep out while you’re trying to secure the booties.

, After you’ve cut open the booties, slip them over your feet as you would with regular socks. The booties contain adhesive tabs that help secure them closed over your feet, so pull off the tabs and fasten them around your feet.The adhesive tabs usually aren’t that strong, so you may prefer securing them to your skin rather than the plastic material. Your skin has more texture than the plastic, which can make it easier for the adhesive to stick.

, It is extremely difficult to walk around with the plastic booties on your feet because you can slip easily. To make them more comfortable to wear and easier to move around in the booties, add a pair of regular socks over them on your feet.It’s best to use a tighter pair of socks because they can help keep the acids in the peel in contact with your skin more effectively than the plastic booties will alone.

, When the booties are fully secured on your feet, leave them on for an hour or as directed by the peel’s instructions. It’s best to stay off your feet while wearing the booties to avoid slips and falls, so you may want to use the hour to relax.If your feet are extremely dry, you may want to leave the booties on for longer than an hour. Wearing the peel for up to two hours may lead to more effective exfoliation.

, When the hour is up, take off your regular socks. Next, carefully slip off the peel booties and discard in the trash. Rub the residue on your feet into the skin.While your feet will have absorbed some of the peel ingredients, there will still be residue on your skin, which can be very slippery. Take off the booties are close to the location where you plan to wash your feet as possible to avoid falling.

, After you’ve taken off the booties, remove the remaining residue from your skin by rinsing your feet in warm water. You can take a shower or bath, or use a damp cloth to wipe them off., You won’t see the results from the peel right away. It typically takes between two and three days for your feet to start peeling, though it may take as many as six. The skin will slough off itself, but you can rub your feet with a loofah or washcloth if you prefer to help exfoliate.If your feet aren’t peeling by the third or fourth day after the peel, soak them in warm water for 15 to 20 minutes to help jump start the process.
While you’re waiting for your feel to peel and even after they start peeling, don’t moisturize them with foot cream or body lotion. That may stop the peeling.

Keep out of reach of children.,
Store at temperatures below 30˚C/86˚F.,
Refrain from using the product after the expiration date.",How to Use Corn Caps2," While the product is fairly benign when used properly, the salicylic can be dangerous in the hands of a child. Application to facial skin could result in a chemical burn, and ingestion could cause nausea, vomiting, and even problems with the ear., Storage above these temperatures will likely cause the product to lose some effectiveness. The adhesive on the ring will probably slip, and the salicylic acid will not be concentrated directly over the corn.Also ensure the product is stored away from direct sunlight or severe humidity., Similar to heat-based degradation, age-based degradation will limit product efficacy. Aside from the adhesive inadequacy, the foam ring often included for comfort may lose its soft, spongy texture that protects against rubbing and helps alleviate some of the pain associated with corns."

Soak your feet.,
Dry your feet.,
Feel for rough spots.,
Use the foot scraper.,

Check your feet.,

Massage your feet.",How to Use a Foot Scraper," There are many types of foot scrapers available that you may want to check out. While the most common is made with a plastic or wood handle and features a double-sided scraper, they also come in clay, glass, metal or electric forms. Decide which type will make it easiest for you to pamper those beautiful feet.


Most foot scrapers have one side that is rougher than the other to help remove corns or thicker calluses. You can also use the rougher side first and follow up with the finer grained side for buffering your skin.
Electric foot scrapers or callus removers are similar to over-the-counter microderm-abrasion tools. You can often get professional results with these durable tools. While the electric foot scraper can give you soft feet quickly, easily and efficiently, know that many of them have parts that must be replaced regularly—such as round emery-board discs. Be sure to stock up on these parts.
You can also get an easy-to-clean and sterilize glass foot scraper or file for scraping thick skin off your feet. These tools can be boiled or soaked in disinfectant to keep the non-porous surface clean. Be sure to get a glass scraper that is thicker so it won't break as easily.
A clay foot scraper is safe for your skin and not as harsh as some other scrapers can be. It is a tool traditionally used in Asian countries.;
, You may want to use a tool to soften your feet that won't be as rough as some foot scrapers are. On the other hand, you may want something stronger to get rid of very thick callouses.


Use a foot scrub. This is the safest option for your feet because there is no risk of friction-related injuries. There are many specialized exfoliating scrubs available at most stores. All you do is rub the foot scrub over your feet to be rid of dead, dry skin.
Another way to safely soften your feet and get rid of cracked or dead skin is to use ceramic stones made for exfoliating. These stones, like a foot scraper, usually have both rough and finer sides. However, these ceramic stones can be safer to use than foot scrapers, especially for diabetics.
Consider using a foot shaver. Shavers are often made of stainless steel and are intended for severely thick or dried calluses. They actually shave off layers of skin to get to the softer, newer skin underneath. Know that you can damage your skin if you make a mistake while using the foot shaver, perhaps even leading to infection. You can usually get a foot shaver/razor at any drug store for around $10-$20.

, Many people prefer to include a pumice rub after foot scraping for extra soft feet. If you choose to finish with pumice, you will want to find a stone attached to a plastic or wood handle so it is easier to maneuver. You can also use pumice in its natural state, of course, if you prefer that.

, Any container will do as long as your feet can be submerged into it. A foot spa basin is not a requirement, though it can be nice. You will want the water in the basin to be as hot as you can stand without burning your skin.

, Your foot soak can be customized to best suit you. You may want to add shampoo or hand soap to the water in your basin in order to make suds or you may prefer a specific scent to match your mood. Some people use pedicure soaks specifically made for your feet or that contain vitamin A, E or D.


Consider adding mineral or Epsom salt to the water. Epsom salt, especially, can help treat cracked skin and aching feet.
You may decide that you want to add some oils to the water to better moisturize your skin. Olive oil, aromatic or essential oils, such as chamomile or lavender, are good choices. Add a teaspoon of these oils to the water and prepare for super soft feet.
Also consider adding mineral-rich seaweed, marine algae or menthol to the foot soak.

, You now have a warm water bath to soak your feet in. Put your feet in and enjoy. Soak for at least 5 minutes but, ideally, for 15 minutes to get your skin extra soft. You want your feet to be as soft as possible—even wrinkly—before you use a foot scraper to keep your skin from bleeding. .

, Lay a towel next to the basin of water. When you are done soaking your feet, take them out and put your feet on the towel. Dry them gently. You want them to be dry enough to use the foot scraper effectively but moist enough to stay soft.

, Now that your feet are softer after the soak, check the skin for areas that are callused. Run your hands over your foot, paying close attention to parts of the foot often affected by thick skin, such as the ball of the foot, heel, top of your toes and foot sides. Once you have determined which areas to work on, you can start using the foot scraper.

, Pick up one foot and place it on the opposite knee to get it into a good position for using the foot scraper. Flex your foot, stretching, so the ball of your foot sticks out more. Hold the scraper against the foot and use a downward motion to scrape off any thickened skin. Continue scraping the skin until all areas of the foot are smooth.


Use the foot scraper where you determined you have rough skin. Avoid tender or very soft areas.
Sometimes only a little bit of skin will come off when you use the scraper. This could be because there is not much thickened skin in that area. If you can tell there is still hard skin, however, try the other side of the scraper or use a foot shaver/razor.
Use the foot scraper on the other foot by placing the new foot onto the opposite knee.

, Pumice is a lightweight, volcanic rock that is very porous and useful as an exfoliator. After you use the foot scraper, a pumice stone can be particularly effective at sloughing off any remaining dead skin cells. Apply lotion or oil to foot or the pumice stone to help it slide across your skin easier. Scrub the whole foot, using circular motions.


Pumice stones are rough and can be harsh on sensitive skin. If so, don’t press so hard on the skin. Do it lightly.
Repeat on the other foot.

, Run your hands over your feet and make sure your skin is smooth. Check the areas you noticed needed work before you started using the foot scraper. If you still feel some rough patches, go back and reuse the foot scraper and pumice. You should definitely notice a difference.


Do not overdo it. You can scrape too much, causing redness and irritation or cuts.

, After scraping the calluses, you will want to use a foot moisturizer to keep your feet hydrated. Pay special attention to those areas you treated with the foot scraper. You can use a scented lotion, cream or oil—but make sure it locks moisture into the skin well.

, Massaging is very good for your feet as well as the newly exposed skin. It increases blood circulation, relaxes muscles and relieve pain. Do one foot at a time and keep massaging for at least one minute each. Grasp the foot in both hands. Use both hands to squeeze the foot near the toes. Gradually move up toward the ankle.
Use both hands to twist the foot lightly in opposite directions. Start at the toes and work up toward the ankle.
Rub your fingers of both hands along the foot in circular motions. Feel for crevices between bones and joints. Press in and rub those areas.
You can also use your knuckles along the bottom of the foot. Kneading the skin with your knuckles offers greater pressure and feels great.

Rub your hands with coconut oil.,
Try lanolin.,
Get a tub of petroleum jelly.,
Avoid cheaper drugstore lotions.,
Wear gloves to bed for soft, moisturized hands.",How to Treat Dry Hands1," This rich natural oil provides a thick layer of protection and will leave your hands feeling moist and soft. Coconut oil absorbs into the skin fairly quickly, it smells wonderful, and best of all, it doesn't contain ingredients that can dry out your skin and make the problem worse. Carry a little pot of coconut oil around with you and apply as necessary throughout the day.Look for unrefined coconut oil, rather than refined. Refined coconut oil is heated to a high temperature that removes properties that are beneficial for skin.
Other oils can also be effective. Try jojoba oil or almond oil if you prefer a different texture or scent.;
, Lanolin is the substance naturally produced by sheep to make their wool waterproof. In concentrated amounts, it also makes a wonderful emollient for skin, and is especially beneficial for dry, flaky hands. It creates a seal that keeps moisture in and protects your skin from the elements.


Look for a lotion or cream that lists lanolin as one of the main ingredients.
You can also buy pure lanolin, but it's easier to use when you mix it with a looser oil, since in its pure form it can be difficult to spread.

, This age-old, cheap product is great to have around when you have chronically dry hands. You can pick it up from any drugstore. Petroleum oil creates a good seal from the elements. The only drawback is that it doesn't absorb into the skin as well, and it tends to leave grease marks on items you touch. Use it when your hands are extremely dry or chapped.

, Many commercially-produced lotions contain alcohol, artificial fragrance, and other chemicals that actually dry out your skin instead of helping it heal. They provide temporary moisture, but in the long run they don't alleviate dry skin. Check the ingredients list on any bottle of lotion you pick up, even if it's labeled as being for very dry skin. If it has ingredients you have trouble pronouncing, you're better off choosing something else.


Look for lotions with all-natural ingredients like cocoa butter, shea butter, oils, essential oils, aloe, and beeswax.
You can make your own lotion to create the perfect blend for your skin type.

, If your hands are in need of some intensive therapy, slather them with your favorite oil or cream and put on a pair of cotton gloves. Do this before you go to bed, so the ingredients have time to condition you hands during the night. In the morning, when you take off the gloves, your hands will be soft and moisturized.


Doing this about once a week will keep your hands in good shape. For severely dry hands, you can do it every other night.
You may prefer to wear gloves during the day. During the winter months, if you're going to be out and about for awhile, try putting on cream before donning your winter gloves. Just make sure you wash them frequently, since they'll have residue from the oil inside.

Drink plenty of water.,
Wash your hands gently.,
Wear gloves when you handle harsh chemicals.,
Wear sunscreen in the summer.,
Protect your hands in the winter.,
Get a humidifier.",How to Treat Dry Hands2," When you get dehydrated, it can cause your skin to become flaky and dry and your hair to get brittle. If you don't tend to drink much water, try drinking several glasses every day. Within a couple of weeks, your skin should be less dry. Keep it up all year round for noticeably less dry skin.If you're not sure whether dehydration is a problem, look at your urine. If it's clear or light yellow, you're well hydrated. If it's medium to dark yellow or even darker, you need to drink more water.
You may not think to drink water in the winter, but it's just as important to stay hydrated when it's cold outside as it is when it's hot. In cold weather your skin will be a lot more prone to getting dry, so keep yourself hydrated from the inside out.

, Do you tend to scrub your hands when you wash them, and use hot water and strong soap? This routine is really hard on your hands. The skin on your hands can get dried out and cracked when you wash away all its natural protective oils. When you wash your hands, use warm water and a gentle soap, like castile soap. Pat them dry with a towel instead of rubbing them vigorously. Treat the skin on your hands as you would the skin on your face.


Look for a gentle soap that doesn't have sulfates, which are abrasive and drying. An oil-based, moisturizing soup is good for dry hands.
Only wash your hands when you really need to, like before meals and after using the bathroom. If you wash your hands too frequently, your skin will never get the chance to produce those protective oils.
If you work at a job that requires frequent hand washing, like in the medical field, try to use a moisturizing soap and put lotion on your hands immediately after washing them.

, Whether you're washing the dishes, cleaning the bathroom with a bleach-based detergent or handling paint and other chemical-laden substances, you should wear protective rubber gloves. Exposing your hands to harsh cleansers and other chemicals wreaks havoc on your sensitive skin, not to mention the damage done when you have to scrub the chemicals off with hot water. Avoid the whole problem by wearing protective gloves whenever necessary.

, Sun can cause skin to dry out in addition to causing UV damage. Many people apply sunscreen to their faces religiously, but forget to use it on their hands. Be sure to use an SPF of 30 or higher on your hands whenever you go out in the sun.

, Winter temperatures and wind are tough on hands, so wear gloves when you go outside. Be sure to get insulated gloves that will prevent your knuckles and fingers from getting chapped. As an extra protective measure, you might want to apply cream or oil before you put on your gloves and go outside.

, If you live in a dry climate or a place with long, dry winters, you might want to get a humidifier for your home. A humidifier adds moisture to the air, creating a better environment for your skin. Having one can be especially helpful during the winter, when heating appliances dry up the moisture in the air. Depending on where you live, you might want to use a humidifier all year long."

Treat deep, bleeding cracks with first aid.,
Trim the sides of deep cracks.,
See a dermatologist to find out if there's an underlying problem.",How to Treat Dry Hands3," If you have cracks that have started to bleed, you'll need to treat them the same way you would any other cut so you can prevent them from getting infected. Wash the cracks with soapy water, dry them with a clean towel, and apply bandages to protect the cracks and give them time to heal. Change the bandages every so often until the cracks heal.You might want to use an antibacterial salve to help the cracks heal more quickly and keep them moist.
If the bleeding won't stop, or if the cracks seem to be infected, see a doctor for further treatment.

, If you have very deep cracks that aren't bleeding, you can help them heal by trimming away the dead skin on the sides of the cracks. When you wash your hands, soapy water could be getting into the cracks and preventing the skin from healing over properly. Use a clean pair of cuticle trimmers to trim away the dead skin on either side of the cracks to create a more even surface, so water stops getting trapped in there.


After trimming the cracks, apply cream and bandage them to help them heal.
Be very careful not to trim too much. Don't cut deep enough to cause pain or bleeding.

, If you have very persistent or severe cracked skin, you could have an underlying condition that won't go away on its own, like eczema, psoriasis, or a fungal infection. A dermatologist might prescribe medication or give you advice on how to remedy the condition.

Use warm water because hot water can strip skin of its protective oils. Be gentle when you wash your hands and pat your hands dry instead of rubbing them with a towel.If you have a job that requires frequent hand-washing (12 or more times a day) or your hands are severely dry, then you may want to consider hand-sanitizer or wipes some of the time. Though they can also be drying, they tend to be gentler than washing that frequently with soap and water.;
, Get moisturizing or hypoallergenic soap. Don’t use antibacterial, alcohol-based toners, products with alpha-hydroxy acids or heavily-scented soap. Additives and chemicals in these kinds of soap can irritate the skin and strip the oil that helps keep your skin moisturized.

, You can purchase a body exfoliant or one meant for your hands—a sea salt exfoliant is highly recommended. Use the exfoliant once a week to scrub off dead skin and keep the skin from thickening. Remember to be gentle on your hands, especially if they easily become dry and cracked.


You can also make a scrub for your hands. One way is to grind about 1 cup of uncooked oats into a fine powder and rub the skin of your hands with the powder.
Make a sugar-lime paste by combining sugar and lime juice until you get the consistency of an exfoliant or paste. Massage the mixture into your skin. Leave it on for about a minute and rinse. The sugar exfoliates the skin on your hands while the lime juice evens skin tone.

, Get a bowl of warm water and place your hands in the water. Soak them for 5 minutes but not much longer or you may dry them out more. Pat them dry.


You can add soda bicarbonate (baking soda) in your bowl of warm water and soak your hands for up to 10 minutes.
You may also choose to add oils to your water, such as olive, argon or essential oils to help soften thick skin.
Always rinse your hands after soaking to help remove dead skin cells.

, While bathing or soaking your hands, use a nail file, emery board, wash cloth or pumice stone to scrub the thick areas on your hands. This can help get rid of the thicker skin and callouses. Make sure your hands are moist when you rub them and to avoid infection, don’t be too rough or use any sharp objects.


If you are diabetic, always consult with your doctor before doing anything that could cause damage to your skin because people with diabetes have a higher risk of developing infections. Don't use a pumice stone either.If you need further treatment on your thick skin, ask your doctor. He or she can use a scalpel or trim thick skin at an office visit. The doctor can also prescribe a medication or callus-removing patch with a chemical, such as salicylic acid, that you apply to your skin.

, You can use a pad to cover the thickened area and protect it from friction. Some of them may also contain salicylic acid to help get rid of calluses. Be cautious when using these because they can cause skin irritation.

, Moisturizing your skin is essential for treating cracked and callused hands. You will want oil-based, alcohol-free emollients and humectants that will lock in moisture like ointments and creams. Avoid water-based moisturizers which aren’t very effective, such as lotions.


Emollients are basically skin lubricants that feel slippery, soften skin and help make it smooth and pliable. Emollients might contain lanolin, mineral oil, jojoba oil, isopropyl palmitate, propylene glycol linoleate, squalene or glycerol stearate as an effective ingredient.
Humectants use the moisture in the air around you to increase your skin’s water content. Effective humectants include glycerin, hyaluronic acid, sorbitol, propylene glycerol, dimethicone, urea or lactic acid.

, Every time you wash your hands, use a moisturizer, preferably while your hands are still moist. As soon as you notice that your hands are starting to feel dry, it’s time to reach for your moisturizer. Don’t forget to slather your hands with moisturizer before bed as well.


Also use moisturizer on your cuticles and nails because they can also get very dry and crack.
Carry a small tube of hand cream with you. Keep some where you spend a lot of time, such as your desk at work, so you may use it frequently and make it a habit.
Using moisturizer once a day probably isn’t enough, especially during the dry winter months. Apply moisturizer five to six times daily for protection all day long., Petroleum can help seal in moisture, protect from friction and soften your skin. Thoroughly apply petroleum jelly over your hands and massage it in. Use it after hand-washing if needed or throughout the day.

, Massage the skin of your hands with olive oil, vitamin E oil, pure jojoba oil, coconut oil, beeswax or cocoa butter. These natural moisturizers retain lost moisture, prevent bacteria that forms between cracked skin, provide nutrients for the skin and make your hands super soft.

After your paraffin treatment, ask your manicurist how soon you may return for another one, before your hands become really dry again.

, Gloves will protect your hands when being exposed to drying detergents and chemicals, such as while washing dishes or cleaning bathrooms. Even just dipping your hands in plain water repeatedly can be irritating to your skin, so wear gloves when you do that as well. You can purchase gloves from your local grocery or general store.


If you wear vinyl gloves, they can also protect your hands from coarser materials that could damage skin.
Some people are allergic to latex. To be safe, you may want to avoid latex gloves.
Don't forget to also wear cotton-lined gloves outside to protect your hands from the drying cold winter weather.

, Drinking water keeps your body hydrated. When you don’t get enough water, your skin is often the first to suffer. Drink at least 8 glasses of water a day and more if you engage in activities that cause you to sweat or spend time in the heat.

, Calluses are formed by repetitive actions that produce friction. If you can, avoid doing the things that contribute to thickened skin. If you can’t because you use your hands regularly for your job--such as construction work or you are a musician--then you may need to accept the calluses, take breaks periodically from the activity or find a way to protect the area.


Try a cotton pad or bandaid over the areas that are bothering you to prevent them from growing larger calluses.

Apply a retinol treatment to dark spots.",How to Take Care of Your Hands," It’s important to keep your hands clean, but using an antibacterial hand soap can dry out your skin. Instead, wash your hands with a moisturizing soap that contains hydrating ingredients, such as shea butter, olive oil, or aloe vera, to avoid stripping the natural oils from your skin.When you wash your hands, avoid using hot water, which can also dry out your skin. Wash with lukewarm water instead.
Don't worry about washing your hands too much -- it's important to wash regularly to keep your hands as free of germs as possible. At the very least, you should wash your hand before you eat and after you use the bathroom. You should also wash after changing a diaper, interacting with animals, or any time that your hands appear dirty.;
, Even if you wash your hands regularly, there may be dirt and grime under your fingernails that doesn’t rinse away. While you’re washing your hands, use a good quality nail brush to gently scrub beneath your nails and remove any dirt that may be stuck there.When you use the brush, hold it in a downward direction so it’s perpendicular to your nails. Move it along the entire nail, scrubbing back and forth to remove the dirt and debris.
After scrubbing your nails, rinse away the soap, water, and dirt as you normally would.

, You'll have an easier time keeping your nails clean if you groom them properly. Use nail clippers to keep them at a length that you like, and file them with a crystal nail file or gentle emery board into a neat shape, such as a square or oval. It's also a good idea to use a cuticle remover and cuticle pusher to keep your cuticles neat. The cuticle is the thin hand of skin around your nail. The remover softens the skin, so you can easily push it back with a metal cuticle pusher or a wooden orange stick. Never cut your cuticles -- the skin may get infected.

, Use a hand scrub once a week to buff away the dry, rough skin and keep your hands soft and healthy. Wet your hands with lukewarm water, and massage a small amount of the scrub over both of your hands, working in circular motions. Rinse it off with warm water, and apply a hand cream.Wash your hands with the moisturizing soap before exfoliating.
You can purchase hand scrubs at the drugstore, beauty supply store, and other stores that sell bath products.
If you prefer, you can mix up your own all-natural hand scrub with ingredients from your kitchen. Combine equal parts of sugar and olive oil, and use it to scrub the dead skin from your hands.

, To ensure that your hands stay soft, you should use a hand cream several times a day. Look for a formula that contains emollient ingredients, such as glycerin, shea butter, and natural oils. Massage the cream in after you wash your hands in the morning and before you go to bed at night. If your hands start to feel dry at any point during the day, reapply then as well.If you’re worried about your hands being greasy, look for a hand cream that’s designed to be fast-absorbing. It will sink into your skin quickly without leaving any residue behind that might may your hands feel slippery.
The skin on men’s hands tends to be thicker, oilier, and hairier, so you may want to purchase a cream designed specifically for male skin. It usually has a richer texture, and doesn’t contain any fragrance.

, While you should rub your hand cream over your nails to keep them moisturized, it’s also important to target them directly with more intensive treatments. To keep your cuticles healthy, apply a vitamin E oil to the skin around your nails each night before you go to bed. That will help prevent the skin from becoming cracked and painful.You can also purchase a cream specifically for the cuticles that can help moisturize and protect the area.
Both men and women should take the time to moisturize their nails and cuticles. Whether or not you get regular manicures, neglecting your cuticles can lead to painful hangnails.

, When your hands become extremely dry, the skin may actually crack and split. To treat this painful type of dry skin, you need more intensive moisture than a regular hand cream can provide. Reach for a rich ointment instead -- it will deliver moisture and create a barrier over your skin that helps protect and heal.If you don’t have a specific ointment for your hands, petroleum jelly works just as well.

, Even if you moisturize your hands daily, they may not get all the moisture that they need. Use a hand mask once a week to deliver a super dose of hydration that keeps the skin on your hands soft and healthy. Apply it to clean, dry hands, and allow it to sit for the specified time on the packaging. Wash it off with warm water, and follow up with a hand cream to lock in the moisture.You can purchase hand masks at drugstores, beauty supply stores, and other stores that specialize in skincare products.
You can also make a moisturizing hand mask at home with leftover avocado. Mix ½ an avocado with 1 egg white, and apply it to your hands. Allow it to sit on your skin for 20 minutes before rinsing it off.

, Just like the rest of your skin, your hands are vulnerable to damage from the sun, including dark spots that can make them look older. To protect your hands from the sun, apply a broad-spectrum sunscreen with a SPF of 30 or higher everyday.Be sure to reapply your sunscreen throughout the day, particularly after you’ve washed your hands.
If you want to streamline your skin care routine, use a hand cream that has SPF of 30 or higher built into it.

, Plenty of the tasks that you have to do around the house can do damage to your hands. Whether you’re washing dishes, doing yard work, or working with tools, always put on a pair of protective gloves first. That will keep your hands from getting dry, cracked, and callused.For chores that require submerging your hands in water, plastic or rubber gloves are the best option.
For light yard work and gardening, cloth gloves are usually effective in protecting your hands from dirty and grime.
For difficult manual labor, such as working with heavy tools, suede or leather work gloves usually offer the most protection for your hands.
You should also wear gloves to protect your hands from cold weather, which can dry out your hands too. Knit and leather gloves can both work well, but look for a pair with an insulated lining in material such as fleece to provide the most warmth.

, If your hands have developed dark spots or other discolorations, the best treatment is some type of retinol cream. Retinol helps stimulate the production of new skin cells, so it works well to fade dark spots. Apply a retinol-based cream to your hands before bed to keep your hands clear and smooth.Retinol products make your skin more vulnerable to irritation from the sun, so be sure to use a sunscreen in conjunction with your retinol cream and apply the cream only at night.

Use antirheumatic medications to curb arthritis.,
Take steroids to beat back inflammation.,
Look into splints and surgery.,
Exercise your hand to ease hand pain.",How to Treat Severe Hand Pain1," Non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are helpful in easing the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis.


NSAID's reduce the pain and inflammation process, thereby reducing the swelling in the joint.
Some examples of appropriate NSAIDs for rheumatoid arthritis treatment are Voltaren (Declofenac salts) and ibuprofen, which are available in many dosage forms in most pharmacies.
However, if you have a gastrointestinal disorder or ulcers or are taking blood thinners such as Warfarin, you should be careful while using NSAIDs due to increased risk of bleeding.
Always ask your doctor before using these medications.;
, Antirheumatic medications, such as Methotrexate, can reduce the symptoms of arthritis and relieve pain.


These are prescription medications, but are much more effective at treating arthritis than NSAIDs alone.
Antirheumatics also go beyond addressing symptoms, they can thwart joint deterioration and enhance joint function.
Methotrexate is usually the first line treatment and can be combined with NSAIDs for enhanced pain relief.

, Steroids can also be used to minimize the effects of inflammation and restore joint movement.


Steroids can be used systemically, especially if other organs are affected.
In less severe cases, steroids can be injected into the affected joint to ease the symptoms and irritation.
An example of a commonly used steroid is Prednisolone.

, If medication doesn't have the desired effect, you can look into treatments beyond pharmaceuticals.


Your doctor can apply a wrist splint to support your joint and ease the pain while you are involved in your normal daily activities.
In severe cases, surgery to cure the damaged joint can be an option.
This usually involves sucking the inflamed synovial fluid out of the joint, or as a last choice, joint replacement.

, Doing certain exercises can help restore mobility to your hand and reduce pain. Try some of the following exercises:


Left your hand up straight, open your hand while your fingers are straight, and gently make a fist; without excess squeezing of your fingers or putting your thumb out, open your fist and close it again slowly.

Repeat this ten times for each hand.


With your hand facing up, bend your thumb gently toward your hand palm, count to five then release; do this again with the rest of your fingers, then repeat with the other hand.
With your hand straight up, try to bend the thumb toward your hand palm, reaching the bottom of the pinky finger or as far as you can. Count to five, then release.

Repeat ten times, then do the same exercise for the other hand.


Put your pinky finger side of your hand on a table, holding your fingers straight while your thumb faces up. Slowly close your fingers, making a fist while keeping the thumb in a “L” shape. Count to five, then release your fingers to the starting position.

Repeat ten times, and do it with your other hand.


Put your hand palm on a table, then with the other hand raise each finger up for about three seconds starting from the thumb. For all five fingers, do the same with the other hand.
Raise your arm a little in front of you with your palm facing the floor and your fingers straight. With your other hand, hold the fingers and slowly push them up till you feel a stress at your wrist, count to five, then release.
Repeat ten times, then do it with your other hand.

Notice warmth, swelling, and redness of the skin.,
Take note of varied types and intervals of pain.,
Be aware of limited motion.",How to Treat Severe Hand Pain3," Although doctors mainly depend on family and medical history to diagnosis hand pain, they also use physical examination to identify contributing factors.


The doctor can analyze the degree of damage and motion loss, and use other tests to create a diagnosis.
These diagnostic tools may include an X-Ray, magnetic resonance imaging “MRI”, or other blood tests that measure the Rheumatoid Factor “RF”, as well as other antibodies found in the circulation as a result of autoimmune disease.

, Inflammation of the joint and the soft tissues during arthritis causes irritation and soreness of the soft tissues that are indicators of arthritis.


This is accompanied by fluid that escapes the joints and causes localized edema and swelling.

, Pain in the joint due to the inflammation process and accumulated fluids puts pressure on the nerves in the soft tissues, and indicates arthritis.


This causes intervals of pain that can be sharp, especially when moving the joint.
It can also cause dull pain, especially when you are resting.

, Motion limitation can result from stiffness, due to cracking of the joint cartilage during arthritis.

Moisturize your feet constantly.,
Make a homemade scrub.,
Soak your feet.",How to Soften and Smooth Your Feet1," You can apply Vaseline to your feet to soften them. You should apply some type of moisturizing lotion or product to your feet on a daily basis.


During the night, put Petroleum jelly all over your feet and either wear socks or put a towel underneath so the jelly doesn’t get all over your bed sheets. Do this right before going to bed. You could also take 2 plastic bags the size for your feet, apply Vitamin E oil to your feet, secure the bags, put socks over the bags, and then fall asleep. By morning your feet should be a lot smoother.
Buy heel cream. Especially during the summer, feet often get rough and hard, due to calluses from walking with flip-flops or no shoes. The heels need special attention. At nice departments stores, you can find cream specially developed to soften heels, which often are the roughest part of the feet.
Coconut oil or olive oil are also great natural ways to soften the feet.;
, You can make homemade scrubs to apply to your feet out of common household ingredients. These scrubs, if regularly applied, will result in smoother and softer feet. Concoct a sugar scrub using brown sugar (1/2 cup), honey (a spoonful), olive oil (or any oil of your choice, also ½ cup), and lemon juice (squirt). Brown sugar is less harsh than regular sugar. It will help your skin retain moisture after the scrub. Honey will also help soften and moisturize the feet. Lemon juice brightens and evens out the skin on the feet.
However, many people warn strongly against using sugar or lemon on your skin, as they can cause lacerations and chemical burns respectively. If you use this scrub commonly, you may cause accelerated aging of the skin, along with other issues. If you have concerns about this, follow the recipe, but replace brown sugar with salt and don't add lemon. Salt is very good for the skin, and won't cause lacerations like sugar, while still exfoliating. The lemon does very little (besides burn you) in the first place, so replacing it isn't really necessary.
Sit on the edge of a bathtub. Soak your feet in very warm water for about 10-15 minutes to soften the skin on your feet and prepare the skin for the scrub. Then, taking small amounts of the scrub, start gently massaging your feet, focusing on specific areas like the heel and the ball of the foot (especially if you have callouses).
Massage the scrub into your feet for as long as you feel necessary. Leave the scrub on your feet for a minute or so, and then rinse off the scrub with warm water. After rinsing the feet, apply a generous amount of moisturizer to the feet, followed by a fair of fitted socks to ensure the moisturizer will remain on the feet, and penetrate the skin deeply.

, Soak your feet in warm water for 10 minutes before you go to bed. You need to do this several days a week. If you don’t regularly take care of your feet, calluses and toughness will start to build up, especially on your heels. Add a few drops of liquid soap and some baking soda (1 tablespoon for 5 liters of water) into the water (or try Epsom salts or bath salts).
Baking soda helps to soften the dead skin and will ease its removal. You could also soak your feet in a foot spa. You can buy these spas at many stores. They often plug in, generating spa-like movement in the water, which is relaxing.

Soak your feet in lemon juice.,
Make your own cracked-heel cream.,
Oil your feet before bed.,
Create your own overnight foot mask.,
Try paraffin wax to moisturize your feet.",How to Shave Dead Skin off Feet1," A foot soak in lemon juice for about 10 minutes is a great way to remove excess dead and dry skin from your feet. The acid in the lemon juice helps make the dead and dry skin easier to remove. After your feet have soaked for the 10 minutes, use a pumice stone or foot file to remove the dead and dry skin.Foot razors/shavers are available for purchase at many drug and department stores, but are not recommended by doctors. They have also become illegal to use in a spa setting in many states. The reason is that they can cause nicks and cuts on your feet which can very easily become infected - especially in a spa environment.;
, Put a spoonful of olive oil in a small bottle with a lid. Add a few drops of lemon or lavender oil to the bottle. Place the lid tightly on the bottle and shake until the liquid inside the bottle turns thick and milky. Apply to your feet, especially your heels, to help moisturize your skin. You can store the bottle for future use, just remember to shake it each time., Start by having a bath or shower where you wash your feet, or wash your feet on their own. Dry your feet off with a towel, including between your toes. Apply a layer of vegetable oil all over your feet and then put on a thick pair of socks. Go to bed and leave the socks on. You may find your dry feet feeling a lot better in only a few days.The oil may stain fabric, like your socks, so choose a pair of socks you don’t mind if they get stained by the oil. The socks will also help prevent your sheets from being stained by the oil.

, Combine 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) of Vaseline (or a similar product) and the juice from 1 lemon into a bowl, then mix the two ingredients together. Either have a bath or shower where you wash your feet, or just wash your feet on their own. Dry your feet completely with a towel. Apply ALL the mixture to both your feet, then put on a pair of thick wool socks. Go to bed. In the morning, take off the socks and scrub the excess dead skin off your feet.Wool socks are used in this case as they won’t allow the mixture to soak through and stain your bedsheets. Choose socks that you don’t mind if they get this oily mixture on them.

, First, melt the wax in a large bowl in the microwave (or a double boiler if you have one). Add an equal amount of mustard oil to the melted wax. Check to make sure that the wax is safely warm to the touch before dipping one foot into the bowl and covering your foot with the wax mixture. Take your foot out of the bowl and allow the wax to dry, then dip the same foot again. Wrap your foot in plastic wrap, or put it inside a plastic bag. Repeat the same procedure on your other foot.

Use a feet scraper or file.,
Use a pumice block or stone.",How to Soften and Smooth Your Feet2," Foot files or scrapers are metal products that look sort of like cheese graters. Sometimes, they are also made of clay. You can use them to grate the dry, tough skin off the bottoms of your feet. With regular use, the feet will become smooth. A more aggressive way to remove very thick calluses are callus shaves, which are sharp, horizontal blades that look similar to a very small cheese slicer. Don’t remove a callus entirely. If the removal becomes painful, stop. You can also buy foot files in the shape of plastic eggs.
Using the scraper or the stone, remove all the dead skin. Apply a moisturizing cream while massaging the skin when you are done.

, Pumice stones can be found in most beauty stores, and they are an alternative to a scraper, which is often made of metal. They work really well at buffing the feet and removing dead skin cells.The pumice stone will scrape the top layer of dead skin cells off your feet, dramatically improving their smoothness. Remove skin when it is dry to avoid injury. Rub the pumice block directly onto calluses and rough patches to rub off dead and useless skin.
Don’t rub too hard or long as you can easily irritate or injure your feet. Use soft back and forth motions and apply little pressure.
You could also regularly use an exfoliating soap that you buy at the supermarket. You won’t have as much work to do with the pumice stone then!

Get a regular pedicure.,
Wear shoes.,
Try foot exercises.",How to Soften and Smooth Your Feet3," Most nail salons offer pedicure packages that include procedures that will soften the feet. For example, they will ask you to soak your feet in warm water before painting your toenails. They will then use a scraper to get the dead skin off your feet, including your heels, before proceeding. To minimize risk of infection, you should ask for a morning appointment.
Ask the salon about the different packages because sometimes deluxe packages offer more scrubs and procedures that will soften your feet (and your legs too). These pedicures can be fairly expensive, though, and need to be done at least once a month.

, Your feet are going to get pretty rough if you’re walking around barefoot a lot – especially outside. So wear shoes, and you’ll have less work to do in order to soften them.


Harsh sunlight and dust also damages the feet (and the hands too). Wear socks with your tennis shoes, too.
They might look nice, but let’s face it – high heels are absolutely brutal on your feet. So wear them sparingly – just for special occasions, perhaps.

, Doing regular foot exercises can help keep your feet softer and healthier. They stimulate blood circulation, and this can make feet less dry. Use your hands to rotate your feet clockwise and then counter-clockwise. Do this 10 times on each side.
Exercise your toes by stretching them outwards and then backwards. You should also do this exercise 10 times each.
Drink a lot of water in addition to regularly exercising the feet. Hydrating the body makes the skin healthier and softer all the way around.

Soak your feet.,
Remove dead skin and calluses.,
Take care of your cuticles and nails.,
Moisturize your feet and ankles.,
Polish your nails.",How to Shave Dead Skin off Feet2," First, you need to find or buy a large enough tub in which both of your feet can rest comfortably, and deep enough that your feet can be covered in water. Put a few drops of mild soap into the tub and fill half way with warm water. You can also try adding a few drops of your favourite essential oil to the water to add some aromatherapy while you relax. Sit on a comfortable chair and soak your feet in the water for 10 minutes.Use a 1/2 cup of epsom salts instead of the soap. Epsom salts are actually a mineral made with magnesium and sulphate. Both magnesium and sulphates have excellent health benefits, and both are absorbed quickly through the skin. This makes an epsom salt soak a great way to get magnesium and sulphate into your body. Both minerals have benefits such as: increased serotonin production, increased energy, reduced inflammation, foot odour elimination, and improved blood circulation.Use 1/4 cup of white vinegar instead of the soap. Vinegar has a lot more benefits than many realize, and many of those benefits are not in the kitchen. Soaking your feet in a vinegar mixture can help eliminate foot odour, and reduce your chances of getting a foot fungus like athlete’s foot. Vinegar is also acidic, which helps soften the skin, making it easier to remove dead and dry skin after you’re finished soaking., Use a pumice stone or foot file to scrub the dead skin and calluses off the bottoms of your feet.You may need to bend your feet behind you in order to reach all the way around your heals. Don’t forget to check your toes for calluses and dead skin as well.


Remember to wet the pumice stone before using it.Pumice stones, foot files, emery boards, etc., are all great options to remove dead or dry skin from your feet after you’ve soaked them. And while foot razors/shavers are available for purchase at many drug and department stores, they are not recommended by doctors. Unfortunately it is too easy to cut or nick your feet with a foot razor, which can lead to infections., Use wooden manicure stick to push back the cuticles on each of your toenails. Then, using either large-sized nail clippers, or specialty nail clippers, trim each of your toenails. If you decide to leave your toenails a little longer, make sure they do not go beyond the edge of your toe. In addition, cut your nails evenly along the whole width of the nail. Do not cut the nail such that the edges curve in or down. This can cause ingrown nails which can be painful.File the edges of your nail with a nail file or emery board after you’ve trimmed them., Massage a good quality moisturizer into each of your feet, including your toes and nails. Consider using a rolling pin or foot massager before or after you’ve applied the moisturizer to massage your feet even further.Feel free to use a decent amount of moisturizer on your feet during this step - but be careful about walking around afterwards if the cream hasn’t fully soaked into your skin.

, If you want to apply nail polish to your toenails, start by using a small amount of nail polish remover to remove any excess moisturizer that may be on your nails. Then apply a clear base coat to each nail and allow it to set before applying anymore layers. Apply 1-2 layers of a coloured nail polish, allowing each layer to set before moving onto the next layer. Finally, apply a clear top coat to each nail.Once all layers are applied, allow the polish to dry for as long as possible before slipping your feet into socks or shoes. Walking around in bare feet or open-toe sandals might be best until you’re sure the polish has dried.


Nail polish remover comes in acetone and non-acetone versions. The acetone version works better at removing nail polish, but it is also harsher on your skin and nails. If you’re prone to dry and brittle nails, and/or you remove nail polish a lot, you may want to use the non-acetone version. The non-acetone version is gentler on your skin and nails, but may take a little more 'elbow grease’ to remove the nail polish."

Select the proper shoes.,
Keep your feet dry.,
Moisturize your feet every day.,
Work to avoid and remove corns.,
Put your feet up.",How to Shave Dead Skin off Feet3," One of the best things you can do for your feet is to buy and wear the proper shoes. Shoes that are ill fitting create friction and pressure, which cause calluses, corns, and dryness to form.There are several things you can do to make sure you find the proper shoe.Get BOTH of your feet measured. You probably have one foot that is larger than the other. You need to find shoes that will fit the larger of your two feet.
Go shoe shopping at the end of the day, as that is when your feet are at their largest. Sizing your shoes later in the day makes sure your shoes don’t get tighter throughout the day as your feet swell.
Don’t depend on the manufacturer’s size. Base your judgement on how the shoe actually feels.
Look for shoes that have the same shape as your feet. Oddly shaped shoes will most likely cause you problems.
Don’t assume shoes will stretch after you’ve worn them awhile.
Make sure the balls of your feet are comfortable in the widest part of the shoe. And that the shoe is deep enough to fit your toes comfortably.
Check that there is 3/8” to 1/2” of space between the end of your big toe and the shoes. You can estimate this as the width of your finger, while you’re standing.

, Try to wear only soft cotton socks inside your shoes, especially when doing a physical activity. Allow your shoes to completely dry out after physical activities that cause your feet to sweat excessively. Don’t wear the same socks two days in a row. Change your socks throughout the day if they get wet or sweaty. Wash your feet everyday, including in between your toes, to prevent conditions like athlete’s foot. And completely dry your feet before putting socks on.Taking these precautions will help you avoid bad foot odor as well as development of rashes and eczema.


It is also a good idea to wear flip-flops or another type of sandal when in public areas like a swimming pool or public shower., The best way to prevent your feet from getting dry and cracked is to make sure you apply a good quality foot moisturizer to them every day.Moisturizing your feet is especially important in the winter when the air is cold and dry.Be careful that you don’t apply moisturizer and then attempt to walk around in your bare feet on a tile or wood floor. You may find that applying moisturizer just before bed is the easiest, and possibly safest, habit to get into.


Use your moisturizing time to give yourself a foot massage. Massaging your feet not only feels good, but it can help with blood circulation.
Avoid showering or bathing in really hot water, which can dry out your skin faster.Use moisturizer designed specifically for feet as other types of moisturizers may contain alcohol, which can dry out your skin more quickly.

, Interestingly, the majority of foot problems are not caused by the fact that you’re walking, but rather because of your shoes. Corns (which are calluses that form on your toes) are caused when your toes rub against the inside of your shoes, mainly because your shoes (or socks) are not the proper size. High heels can also cause corns because their shape forces extra pressure onto your toes and forefoot, which in turn causes your toes to push up against the inside of your shoes more often. You can help prevent and treat corns at home, but if they become severe, you will need to see a doctor.Soak your feet in warm water regularly, and use a pumice stone or foot file to remove dead skin and calluses from your toes and feet.
Wear ‘corn pads’ on your toes to help cushion them within your shoes. Medicated ‘corn pads’ are not recommended.
Switch to shoes that fit your feet properly and have plenty of room in the toes. Reduce your use of high heels if possible.

, It is actually doctor recommended, so go ahead and put your feet up when you can! Having said that, if you do find yourself sitting for a long time, take a moment to get up and walk around. And if you have a habit of crossing your legs while you’re sitting, change which way you cross them every so often. All of these tips are a great way to help increase the circulation in your legs and feet."

Ask someone for help.,
Wear a shirt that fits well.,
Stand with your shoulders relaxed.,
Locate the shoulder points.,
Measure the space between your shoulder points.,
Write it down.",How to Measure Shoulder Width1," Since standard shoulder width measurements are taken along the upper portion of your back, another person will actually need to take this measurement for you.


If you cannot find anyone to help you take this measurement, use the “Measure Shoulder Width with a Shirt” method, instead. That method can be performed by yourself and usually produces an accurate result.;
, While not strictly necessary, a tailored dress shirt is ideal since you can use the seams of the shirt to help guide the tape measure.


If you do not have a tailored dress shirt, any shirt that fits correctly in the shoulder area will work. You do not need to measure the shirt when using this method, but a good shirt can provide helpful guide points.

, Your back should be straight, but your shoulders need to hang naturally in a relaxed position.

, These points are actually marked by your acromion bones, which can be found at the upper tips of your shoulders.


These two points should also be the points at which the shoulder meets the arm, or the points at which the shoulder begins curving down into the arm.
If you are wearing a dress shirt that fits your upper body correctly, you can use it as a guide. The shoulder seams on the back of your shirt will usually match up with your actual shoulder points.If your shirt does not fit perfectly, use your knowledge of how loose or snug the shoulder fit is and adjust your two end points accordingly to make improvements.

, Have your helper position the end of the tape measure flat against your back at the first shoulder point. Your helper should then measure up and over the curve of your shoulders, across your back, then back down to the outside edge of the other shoulder point.


Keep in mind that you should be measuring across the broadest part of your shoulders. This usually lands out roughly 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) below the neckline.
The tape measure will not be horizontally straight during this measurement. It must bend at a gentle curve along with your shoulders.

, This measurement is your shoulder width. Mark it down and save it for your records.


Standard shoulder width can be used for both men's and women's attire, but it is most often used for men's tailor-fit dress shirts and blazers.
Shoulder width essentially measures the width of the yoke of your ideal shirt size.
You will also need this measurement when determining the best possible sleeve length for a shirt or blazer."

Make sure the pants are the correct length.",How to Measure for a Tux," For tailoring and rental purposes, or even if you're planning on buying your own suit, it's important to provide basic height and weight measurements before taking more specific measurements. Take off your shoes and stand with your back against the wall, and measure yourself with a tape measure to get an accurate number for your height. Place the tape measure at the bottom of your feet and measure to the highest point on your head.;
, While not the most important number for having a suit made or measured, your weight can help a tailor better match pants to jacket, determining your ""drop"" number. If you're sending numbers off to a store to have a tuxedo rented for you, your weight can make the process a whole lot easier.


No cheating. It'll be more slimming to have a suit that fits than a suit that fits like you wish it would.

, If shoes are to be provided, provide your size to match you with a pair of nice-fittin shoes. Other than your shoe size, it’s also good at most places if you have some sense of the narrowness of your foot and how to tell them what kind of shoe you’d like. Many places will use the following terminology to match width:


B: Narrow
D: Regular, or medium-width
E: Extra wide
EEE: Extra-extra wide

, Because tuxedo pants fit higher up around your waist than jeans or dress pants, which sit around your hips, you need to take different measurements instead of providing your pant size as you normally might. Using a tape measure, measure around the top of your hip bones and across your navel to determine an accurate waist size for a tuxedo.

, To make sure that the pants fit comfortably, take care to do this step properly. This can be done over your pants. Place the tape measure around your hips, where the hip bone juts out at its biggest point. Then, continue wrapping down around the biggest part of your backside. This will help to make sure that your trousers are roomy and comfortable.

, The outseam refers to the seam the runs along the outside edge of your leg. This measurement needs to be taken while you're wearing shoes. Measure from the outside arch of your shoe, pulling the tape measure up your leg, past your hip bone and to the height of your navel. This measurement helps determine the length of pants you will need.


Make sure the shoes are similar to what you'll be wearing with the tuxedo, in terms of height. You wouldn’t want to do this barefoot, or wearing bit-soled cowboy boots.

, The is usually most easily measured on a pair of pants that you already own, rather than while you've got them on. Fold a pair of pants that fits you well flat on its side, so the seams are even. Fold one leg up and out of the way, then measure a straight line from the crotch seam to the bottom cuff of the pants.Depending on the tailor or the rental place, some shops will ask you for both in and out-seam measurements, while others will only ask for one or the other. Make sure you find out what they're looking for, so you don't provide the wrong measurements.

, Raise your arms out to the side and run the tape measure around your shoulder blades, under each arm and around the fullest part of your chest. Lower your arms and assess the measurement. Make the measurement snug, but not tight.

, Put both arms at your side and place the tape measure around your chest and both shoulders, just below where your collar bone ends. Feel with your finger to find the nub of your collarbone and make the measurement just below that point.

, Circle the tape measure around your neck and record the measurement. You want the tape measure down as close as possible near your collar line, just above your clavicle, not up around your throat. This will ensure that you receive an accurate shirt size.

, Allow one of your arms to hang straight at your side. Place the tape measure near the bottom of the back of your neck. Run the tape measure over the top of your shoulder and then down your straight arm to a point approximately one inch before you get to your wrist.


You also may need to provide your coat in-sleeve measurement. Put the tape measure on the inside of your arm, slightly below your wrist. Pull the tape up into your underarm for the complete measurement.

, Learning the terminology used at the tux rental place will help to better fit the right kind of suit to your body type. It’ll also make the whole process less confusing. The “drop” refers to the difference between your coat and pants size, and there are different ranges of that difference, and you’ll probably fit a range of sizes within your “drop.”


Regular drop is a 6 in. difference
Athletic drop is an 8+ in. difference
Portly drop is a 2 in. difference

, Coat length is based on height, so you should be able to know what size coat you’ll need if you know size of the dress shirts you get and your height.


A short is typically used on people under 5’7, with sleeves up to 32 in.
A regular is for people between 5’8 and 5’11, with sleeves of 32-33 in.
A long is for people between 6’0 and 6’2, with sleeves of 34-36 in.
An extra-long is for people taller than 6’2 with sleeves longer than 36 in.

, When you try a jacket on, you need to make sure the armholes are loose enough to allow you full range of motion and that you won't risk ripping the interior lining of the jacket if you move incorrectly. If you feel a pinch in your arm-pit, the jacket needs to be altered, or you'll need a different one.

, Coats shouldn't look bunchy or ranched at any point across your shoulders and down your back. A jacket cut properly should work in clean lines and lay perfectly flat down your back. If not, it might be too small, or poorly stitched., Let your arms hang loosely at your sides. On a coat that fits properly, the hem of the sleeve should reach down to your knuckles when your arms are hanging in this way.


You'll also want to do this with your shirt on to check that the sleeves of your dress shirt underneath are long enough. The coat sleeves should reveal about a 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) of the shirt cuff.

, Put on your shoes and check the length of the trousers. They should be hemmed evenly with the heel of your shoe in the back, resting just gently on the top of your shoes in the front. They shouldn't drape too much and hang over the shoes, but just come into line with the bottom and top.

Identify and avoid irritants.",How to Stop Itchy Feet1," Dry skin can be very itchy, especially for older adults whose skin may be thinner. If your itchy feet have dry, ashy skin, use a daily moisturizing cream, lotion, or ointment on your feet every day. Rub it into your heel, sole, sides and tops of your feet, and between your toes. Look for a product with a petrolatum base, which can soften and moisturize even dry, cracked skin., Soak your feet in cool water, or place a cool wet cloth against the itchy areas of your feet. Cool water can be soothing to irritated, itchy skin.You can do this daily, or even several times daily - but if soaking often, be sure to moisturize your skin afterwards., Oatmeal baths have traditionally been used to soothe itchy skin. Add two cups of ground oatmeal and one cup of baking soda to your bath, and soak your feet for a natural itch remedy.This safe and gentle remedy can be used daily.

, Soak your feet in salt water to relieve aching and potentially help with itching and irritation. Dissolve 2 teaspoons of salt for each pint of warm water you use. Use a shallow pan or a few inches of water in the bathtub - enough to cover the tops of your feet. Soak for 5-10 minutes.You can do this hourly until your itching improves. Salt can dry out your skin, so rinse your feet in cool water and moisturize your feet after your salt soak.

, Itchiness can be caused by even a mild allergic reaction to something you’re wearing or a product you’re using. Try making one small change at a time to identify your trigger – switch laundry detergent, change your soap, and wear only natural cotton socks. If you can identify what is causing your itching, avoid your trigger in the future.OTC antihistamines may relieve itching that’s caused by allergic reactions."

Ask for help.,
Wear the right sort of shirt.,
Stand with your shoulders relaxed.,
Locate the correct shoulder points.,
Measure across the front of your body.,
Write down the measurement.",How to Measure Shoulder Width2," Even though this measurement is taken across the front of your body, making it easier for you to handle the tape measure yourself, your shoulders and arms should still hang as naturally as possible during this process. As a result, asking someone else to take the measurement for you is advised.


Note that if you are only asked for ""shoulder width"" and not specifically for ""front shoulder width,"" you should use your measurement for ""back shoulder width."" Back shoulder width is the standard measurement, while front shoulder width is much less common.
Your front shoulder width will usually be close to or the same as your back shoulder width, but there can be slight differences based on age and weight. Certain conditions, like scoliosis and osteoporosis, can yield more dramatic differences.

, For a front shoulder width measurement, look for a tailored shirt that has a wide neckline or consider wearing a shirt with straps.


This measurement deals with the supporting points of your shoulders rather than their truth width. As such, a shirt that illustrates how far these supporting points are is better than a snug shirt with a standard or high neckline.

, Your back should be straight and your chest should be out. Keep your shoulders loose and relaxed, with your arms hanging comfortably at your sides.

, Use your fingers to gently press into the flesh along the top of your shoulder and look for the mass where your shoulder bones come together. This is your front shoulder point. Repeat the same process on your other shoulder.Ideally, each shoulder point should land in roughly the same area as a back shoulder point, just to the inside of where your arm starts dropping off. Your weight and age can alter this position, though, so these points do not always match up.
Your front shoulder point will actually end up being at the outermost solid portion of your shoulder where your shoulder is capable of supporting a neckline or strap.
You might be able to use your shirt as a guide. If the straps or neckline of your shirt are about as wide as they can be without slipping off your shoulders, they are approximately aligned to your front shoulder width. The inner point of each strap or each side of the neckline will match up with your front shoulder points.

, Ask your helper to lay the end of a tape measure flat against one shoulder point. Your helper should then extend the tape measure across the front of your body, following the natural curve of your shoulders, until it reaches the opposite shoulder point.


The tape measure will not be horizontal or parallel to the floor. Instead, it must bend subtly along with the natural bend of your shoulders.

, This is your front shoulder width measurement. Write it down and save it for future reference.


Front shoulder width can technically be used for both men's and women's attire, but it is most commonly used when designing or tailoring women's attire.
This measurement is typically used when designing or tailoring necklines. Your front shoulder width is the maximum width a neckline can be without falling off your shoulder. This measurement also makes it easier to space straps on bodices in a way that will prevent them from slipping off your shoulders.

Find a shirt that fits well.,
Lay the shirt flat.,
Locate the shoulder seams.,
Measure from seam to seam.,
Write down your results.",How to Measure Shoulder Width3," A tailored dress shirt is your best option, but any shirt that fits your shoulders correctly will work as long as that shirt has sleeves.


The accuracy of this measurement depends entirely on the shirt you choose to measure, so make sure you pick a good one. For the sake of accuracy, use a shirt that fits in the shoulder area as correctly as possible. If you want a looser fit, you can always add 1 inch (2.5 cm) or so to the measurement after you take it.
This measurement can be substituted for your back or standard shoulder width measurement. Do not use it to substitute for your front shoulder width measurement, though.
Since this measurement is not quite as accurate as one measured across your actual shoulders, you should only use this option if you are unable to use the traditional method of measurement.

, Place the shirt on a table or other flat working surface. Smooth it out so that the material lies as flat as possible.


For the sake of consistency, you may want to keep the back facing up as you measure. This does not matter much, though, since the location of the shoulder seams will almost always be the same on both the front and back of you shirt.

, The shoulder seams are the points at which the sleeves meet the torso portion of the shirt.

, Place the end of the tape measure at the top of one shoulder seam. Bring the tape measure straight across the top of the shirt until it meets the top of the second shoulder seam.The tape measure should lie flat and horizontal across the shirt. It should also be aligned parallel to the bottom of the shirt.

, This measurement is your shoulder width. Consider marking it down and saving it in your records.


While not quite as accurate as a shoulder width measurement taken from your actual shoulders, this measurement will almost always provide a close enough approximation to your true shoulder width.
This measurement is most commonly used for tailored men's pieces, but it can be used for both men's and women's tops.

Recognize athlete’s foot.,
Get an over-the-counter (OTC) antifungal medication.,
Get prescription medication for stubborn athlete’s foot.,
Keep your feet dry to prevent athlete’s foot.",How to Stop Itchy Feet2," One of the most common causes of itchy feet, athlete’s foot usually causes a red, scaly rash on and in between your toes. Your feet may be itchiest right after removing your socks and shoes. You might get athlete’s foot on just one foot or on both.You might also get blisters on your feet, or ulcers – areas where your skin rubs off.
One type of athlete’s foot starts on the sole of your foot and causes dryness and scaling that travels over the side of your foot.

, Mild athlete’s foot can often be treated with OTC powders, sprays, or ointments that fight fungal infections. You can ask your doctor for recommendations, or speak with the pharmacist at your local drug store. Common brands are Tinactin, Micatin, Lamisil, and Lotrimin-AF.Rinse your feet and dry them really well, especially in between your toes. Then apply the medication to the tops, bottoms, and sides of both feet, and in between all your toes.
Use the medicine two times every day until the rash goes away. This may take several weeks (sometimes 4-6 weeks).

, If OTC medications don’t clear up your athlete’s foot in 4-6 weeks, you may need prescription-strength medication.Visit your doctor to discuss this option. Stronger medication may be available to put on your feet, or you might need to take an antifungal medicine as a pill.


Oral antifungal medications can affect your liver, so let your doctor know if you have or have ever had liver problems.

, Athlete’s foot, caused by a fungus, thrives in damp environments. Keep your feet dry, and change your socks and shoes as soon as possible if they get wet. Dry your feet thoroughly before putting your socks on.Athlete’s foot is also highly contagious, so if you share a swimming pool or locker room with others, protect yourself. Wear shower shoes in the locker room and shower, and don’t share towels or linens with someone who has an infection.

This is a great way to pick up metal (gold, silver, etc.) that can be worn daily. These items aren't seasonal but designers rotate jewelry with seasons just as they do clothes.

, People often think these match everything. You must actually be careful with combining too many patterns, patterns that don't match or a multi-colored bag with an outfit without any complimenting colors. You're better off finding solid colored bags or bags with trims. Add a scarf to add color. If you do get a multi-colored bag, pick a color from it and make it seem like it is a part of your outfit and not like you were too busy to change bags.

Buy shoes that fit.,
Think about the needs of your feet when purchasing shoes.,
Wear the right shoes for the activity you are doing.,
Elevate your feet often.,
Allow your feet to rest.,
Take some painkillers.,
Trim your toenails.,
Ice your feet after a long day.",How to Soothe Sore Feet1," Too often, people buy shoes that don't fit their feet. They opt for fashion rather than fit or comfort. A good-fitting pair of shoes will improve virtually any foot problem. Look for shoes that:


Have plenty of room in the toe area (toe box).
Don't slip. The foot should not slide around in the shoe.
Are wide enough. Your foot shouldn't bulge over the edges of the shoe.
Fit in the store. Don't buy too-small shoes believing you'll ""stretch them out"" in time.
Also remember to do your shoe-shopping in the afternoon or evening, when your feet tend to be slightly larger.;
, Different types of feet require different kinds of shoes.


For instance, if you have high arches, your feet tend to be rigid. Shoes with lots of cushioning will help absorb shock. Flat-bottomed feet are less rigid, but less stable, too, so they require shoes that control excess motion.
To find out what kind of foot you have, wet your bare feet and stand on a concrete floor or piece of paper. If you have high arches, the outline of your foot will appear very narrow and curved like a half-moon. If the outline looks like a slab, you're probably flat-footed.

, Wear the right shoes for the activity. Wearing the wrong type of shoes can cause a long list of problems, including knee tendinitis, chronic foot pain, heel spurs, and stress fractures. Choosing the right shoes is especially important when it comes to fitness footwear.


Different sports and exercises have unique repetitive movements that require special support and cushioning. You wouldn't play basketball in a pair of heels. Likewise, don't rely on that old pair of sneakers if you're going climbing or hiking.
Spend the extra money on buying shoes that are specific for the activity you're doing. The investment could save you and your feet a lot of pain.

, If you have to stand a great deal, take frequent breaks to take the weight off your feet.


Whenever you can, elevate your feet at a 45 degree angle to your body, and relax for 10 to 15 minutes.
Elevating your feet will move blood away from the feet and help reduce swelling.
Taking off your shoes and socks will soothe your feet even further because they will be getting air.

, Rest will allow the tissues to heal by preventing any further stress to the affected area.


Crutches should be used if you have difficulty putting weight on the foot.
Appropriate use of commercially available ankle and foot supports may provide rest, comfort, and support to the affected area.

, Take over-the-counter medication to reduce pain, such as ibuprofen 200mg every 6 hours. Painkillers will help to alleviate the pain that you are experiencing.

, Ingrown toenails may be inherited, but improper nail trimming can make the problem worse. Trim the nails straight across and only to the end of the toe, then file the corners to remove sharp edges that might cut the skin.

, A cool way to refresh your feet after a long, hard day is to ice them down with a washcloth filled with ice. It'll make them feel wonderful and decrease swelling and inflammation. Apply ice for 15 minutes 3 times daily.

Also measure your wrist for bracelet size. Here is the list of what you will need:
A wig. Don't go to curly or you end up looking like you have a 'Fro. Don't go too long as these wigs are synthetic and beyond shoulder length get pretty tangled and hard to manage. Buy a wig brush too. Try websites like Beauty Trends (Google it) and expect to pay about $50 with discounts. Color? Try a mix... one color with another on the tips or frosting or highlights. Size: they have larger head sizes available and instructions on how to measure yourself for wig size - petite, regular or large. A wig under $30 will probably be cheap nylon and not usable, like Halloween wigs.
Shoes. Add a size to your mens' size and you have your women's sandal size. Add a size and a half and you have your size in boots and pumps. You may need wide or even extra wide if you are a big girl. Try Payless if you want on the cheap. Large sizes are available at Coward Shoes, onestopplus, silhouettes, and other plus sites. About heels. 4 1⁄2 inch (11.4 cm) heels are great for the photos, but unless you weigh under 120 lbs, they aren't practical. If you are going out and plan to spend some time on your feet, start with 2 to 3 inch (5.1 to 7.6 cm) heels. Black or Black patent are great colors to start with.
Bra. Buy one. Go with your chest measurement (not bust) and maybe an inch and a half larger. Black is always useful. Cup size? Well - if you are under 160 lbs go with a B or C cup, under 190 pounds a C or D cup. If you are a bigger girl, it is about projection you can probably carry off a D or DD. Breast forms... try PALS on eBay and pay less than $100, or go to a fabric store and buy some weighted forms for under $40 or just use panties until you decide what size you like. Smaller girls can by these everywhere, big girl, try Lane Bryant for larger sizes that don't swallow you up.
Hose. Hose is makeup for the legs. It forgives nicks from shaving, scrapes from working and other blemishes. Try ""sheer to the waist"" so you can see your panties. Read the size chart on the back. IT IS BETTER TO GO UP A SIZE. You are probably long in the leg and taller than a lot of girls. You do not want the crotch of the panty hose heading towards your knees. If you try them on and you are baggy all over, ok, go down a size. Put a spare pare in the trunk or your car the first time you go out. Garter belt hose. OK, sounds fun, but reserve it for below the knee skirts/dresses, or rock and roll clubs and hot dates ;> )
Waist cincher. Unless your are trim and even then... it makes a curve. Rago model 21 is the best. Buy one or two waist sizes smaller than marked.
Ok, now lets get you decent. Tops and skirts or dresses. Want a young look? Try Alloy website. They even have young fashion for big girls. Skinny and want fetish clothing?, try Lipservice or Hot Topic. Want something more MILT? JC Penneys or Macy's. Upstairs if you are big, try surplice, v neck or wrap around tops. Smaller girls wear higher necklines, boat neck, square neck, draped. Down below, try for a skirt/dress with some flair or something tight. Your hips are small compared to most girls and flared skirts will give you more curve, especially if you define your waist with a contrasting belt or waist tied scarf. Or go the other way if you are thin and wear tight skirts that give you lots of leg. Black is slimming but don't overdo it. A little black dress is great for a starter wardrobe, but add some color with accessories or jewelry.
Accessories. You need at least one bracelet, one ring and a necklace. Try Emitations for larger sizes - they have clip on earrings too. A purse. Basically, your purse matches your shoes in color, but not necessarily. Black is very practical. For beginners, shoulder strap type will get you over the feeling that you have lost your wallet. Size: small is cute but what are you gonna put in it? Money, lipstick, powder compact, pen, paper all fit in a tiny back, but add a cell phone, camera, cigarettes and you might need more. One inside zipper compartment will keep your ID, credit card, and larger bills from spilling out when you are rummaging around. And remember what you mother told you, ""it's not a purse unless you have a tampon in it."" The girl in the stall next to you may become BFF's forever.
Makeup. Too much to say here. Best investment is to go to a MAC store en femme and buy $50 minimum worth (a very small bag) and get a free makeover. They will try to sell you but settle for the foundation, eyeliner pencil, a mascara and one lipstick. Pay attention and ask questions. If a MAC store sounds too scary, try a beauty salon that has a makeup counter or advertises makeup services, call and explain you would like to come at some quiet time. You money will go a bit farther and you may get better attention and training.;
, Try to get someone to go with you. If you have a gay bar around, try that as your first outing. They will be friendly and will not bother you as they like men or women without pee pees. And if you run into your boss or Reverend Tom, well what are they doing in a gay bar?

Rub oil on your feet.,
Apply gentle pressure to your feet with your thumbs.,
Concentrate on applying pressure to the “plantar fascia”.,
Consider using a foot roller.",How to Soothe Sore Feet2," Apply a couple of drops of olive oil (or your preferred oil) all over your feet and ankles. You may heat the oil slightly, so that it is lukewarm but not hot, as the warmth will help ease muscle stress.

, Using your thumbs, apply gentle pressure to your foot in slow, circular motions, from the toes to the heel.

, The plantar fascia is essentially the arch of the foot. You can feel it more prominently when you stretch your toes upwards.

, Foot rollers are available commercially and are very simple to use.


As the name implies, you simply roll it over the soles of your feet after you have performed the massage. This will help to dilate the blood vessels in the foot, ensuring good blood supply to the foot.
This means that the oxygen and nutrients present in the blood will reach the feet faster, ultimately aiding a quicker recovery.

Understand the benefits of doing foot exercises.,
Try the golf-ball roll.,
Give the ""spill the beans"" exercise a try.,
Practice the circle and stretch exercise.",How to Soothe Sore Feet3," Your doctor or physical therapist may give you exercises to increase the strength and stability of the affected foot and to correct muscles that may not be balanced.


Exercises to increase flexibility will maintain or improve the length of a muscle. Flexibility helps to make a stronger muscle and less likely to be injured.
Walking in shoes that provide good support and cushioning is excellent exercise for the feet. Feet also benefit from specific foot exercises. Try some of the exercises outlined in the steps below

, Sit down with your shoes off, place one foot on top of a golf ball, and roll (don't stand) on the ball using only the weight of the foot; repeat with the other foot.

, Scatter beans or marbles on the floor, and then try to pick them up with your toes.

, Sit in a chair with one foot raised in front of you, and make four or five small circles in the air in both directions with your foot.


Next, point your toes as much as you can; then stretch them up towards you. Repeat six times with each foot.

Try a hot and cold soak.,
Try a vinegar soak.,
Soak in an Epsom salt foot bath.",How to Soothe Sore Feet4," Hot-and cold-water therapy can be effective in treating foot pain. The hot treatment will promote blood flow, while the cold treatment will reduce inflammation.


Fill one bucket with cold water and another with bearably hot water. Sit in a comfortable chair, dip your feet in the hot water for three minutes and then do the same with cold water for at least 10 seconds or up to a minute. Repeat the whole process two or three times and end with cold foot bath.
Another option is to apply a heat pad and an ice pack alternately for 10 minutes to reduce pain.

, Vinegar is used in various treatments and can help with foot pain due to sprains or strains as it reduces inflammation.


Fill a tub with hot water, then add two tablespoons of vinegar. Soak your feet in the tub for about 20 minutes.

, Epsom salt can help soothe your feet, giving you instant relief from foot pain. Combining heat and Epsom salts, which is primarily magnesium, works well to relax the feet and ease pain.


Put two to three tablespoons of Epsom salt in a tub of warm water.
Soak your feet in the tub for 10 to 15 minutes.
The salt can make your feet dry, so apply some moisturizer after soaking them.

Understand that obesity can lead to sore feet.,
Be aware that pregnancy can make your feet sore.,
Look for any abnormalities of the foot.,
Understand that the wrong footwear can make your feet hurt.,
Know that using your feet too much can wear them out.",How to Soothe Sore Feet5," Obesity has become a major issue in today’s world. Not only does it lead to an increased risk of heart disease and diabetes, but the excessive weight that an obese person has will ultimately take its toll on the feet and knee joints. This will lead to your feet getting sore easily.

, As mentioned above, excessive weight during pregnancy will add stress to your feet and make them sore. Hence, getting plenty of rest and putting your feet up as much as possible is important for pregnant women.

, Sometimes, by birth, people may develop abnormalities in the shape or form of the feet, such as flat feet, excessively high arched feet, and arthritis.


Normally, our feet have an arch which helps maintain and spread out stress and pressure across the toes and feet in a well-distributed manner. However, in some patients, there might be no arch (flat foot) or an arch that is too high.
Due to a disturbance in this balance, more stress is placed on the feet, causing them to become sore.

, If your footwear does not have proper padding, or if they disturb the ordinary balance of your feet (like in the case of high heels), this can make your feet become very sore quite easily.


Additionally, shoes that are too tight or too big for you will lead to soreness too as yet again, there is a high chance of pressure against the foot (in case of tight shoes) or a disturbance in balance

, Prolonged periods of standing, or any activity such as running, jogging, cycling etc. will lead to fatigue of the muscles within your feet, causing soreness.

Choose a button or zipper fly.,
Decide if you’d like pleated or plain-front dress trousers.,
Decide what type of pockets you want.,
Choose your fit.,
Choose between lined or unlined pants.,
Decide what material you want.,
Pick your color.,
Select your break.,
Decide if you wish to cuff your dress trousers.",How to Choose Dress Trousers for Men1," The choice between a button or zipper fly is a purely aesthetic choice. If you prefer the look and feel of a button fly, choose dress trousers that have a button fly. If, on the other hand, you prefer a zipper, choose dress trousers that have a zipper fly., Pleated dress trousers have pressed lines running down the center of each leg and are more flexible than plain-front pants. Plain-front pants have a smooth uniformity to the fabric across and around the legs.Pleats will make you appear heavier., There are two types of pockets: slash pockets and slit pockets. Slit pockets are vertically-oriented openings that close with buttons. Rear pockets are always slit pockets, though they may or may not have buttons to close them. Front pockets might be slit pockets, but are typically slash pockets – angled openings that descend from the waistline toward the outer leg.Both front and rear pockets are crucial elements of well-chosen dress trousers for men. Ample pocket space will enable you to easily carry your wallet, keys, and other knick-knacks with you.The pockets should not bulge when burdened with a reasonable volume of a few small items.
If you’re getting your dress trousers tailored, wear them with the necessities you usually keep in your pockets. Instruct your tailor to adjust the pockets if they bulge or are uncomfortable when packed with your typical necessities.

, Dress trousers for men are available in three primary fits. First, there’s the slim fit. These dress trousers have legs that hug the shape of the leg and taper toward the ankle. Next, there’s the wide-leg fit. This type of dress trouser fits loosely in the waist and thigh area. Finally, there’s the straight leg fit. This fit, as its name implies, allows the trouser leg to fall straight down from the waist to the foot.If you are a slim person, you’d be better off wearing slim-fit pants to prevent excess fabric from hanging off your legs.
If you are a larger person, you’d do well to wear wide-leg dress trousers to ensure visual balance between your trunk and lower body., Some dress trousers – typically those made from wool – are lined with silk. But if you prefer the feel of wool (or whatever the material the trousers are made of), choose unlined dress trousers., Dress trousers are available in a variety of fabrics. Choosing the right material for you means taking into consideration how much you’re willing to spend and your personal aesthetic preferences.Wool dress trousers are more durable than other types of dress trousers but will require more care. They should always be dry cleaned, and should be stored in cedar chips or moth balls.
Dress trousers of rayon feel like cotton. Like wool dress trousers, rayon dress trousers will require dry cleaning.
Polyester blends make dress trousers more affordable and easier to care for. You can wash dress trousers made with polyester blends in a regular washing machine.
Flannel is a type of woven wool that has been brushed to maximize softness. Flannel trousers are comfortable no matter the season., Dress trousers for men are available in many colors. Gray, navy, and black are the most common colors. Typically, you’ll match the trousers you choose to a suit, shirt, and tie combo. For instance, you might choose navy or gray dress trousers for a navy suit and light blue dress shirt., The break is a measure of how your dress trouser cuff ends. Trousers with a full break will crease quite noticeably at the ankle. Trousers with a half (or medium) break will crease somewhat, but less than those with a full break. Dress trousers with a quarter (or slight) break crease only slightly.Some dress trousers have no break, and the ankle cuffs end at an elevation that prevents creasing or bunching upon contact with the shoes. This style looks best with a tapered, slim-fitting pant leg.There is no right or wrong way to select a break. Choose the type of break that makes you feel good.

, Dress trousers often have a cuff at the ankle. This means that the ankles are rolled up slightly and sewn into a thin strip of fabric. Cuffs can shorten the visual impression of the legs. If you are shorter, therefore, you might wish to avoid wearing cuffed dress trousers.The cuffs of dress trousers should come to a creased “beak” at the front of the pant leg, and should lightly touch the top of each shoe’s heel.
Cuffed trousers might wear a bit better than uncuffed trousers.
You could always cuff the uncuffed trousers later, though you’ll lose a bit of length.
Plain-front dress trousers tend to be uncuffed. Pleated dress trousers tend to be cuffed.

Try the trousers on.,
Look for ballooning.,
Decide if you want to wear suspenders or a belt.,
Choose trousers that are widest at the waist.,
Avoid trousers that bunch at the thigh.",How to Choose Dress Trousers for Men2," When you try the dress trousers on, wear them at an appropriate height. The “fall” of the trousers – the distance between the crotch and waist – is longer than on jeans and other casual pants. Therefore, hike the dress trousers up to their proper height above the hips when trying them on.The trousers should stay on comfortably without the aid of either suspenders or a belt.
When trying trousers on, wear shoes and a shirt you’d actually wear with the dress trousers.

, Ballooning fabric – that is, the outward motion of excess trouser fabric from the crotch, buttocks, or other areas of the trousers – is a sign they do not fit properly. In some cases, you might be able to get this ballooning taken care of by a tailor, but it’s usually easier to just find a pair of dress trousers that fit you better., Some trousers fit better with a belt. Others fit better with suspenders, which makes the trousers fit more loosely. If you know that you will always be wearing trousers with a belt, with suspenders, or with both, ask your tailor to adjust the dress trousers accordingly before (or after) obtaining them.Some dress trousers for men do not even have belt loops, so look carefully at the trousers you wish to obtain before making a decision.

, If your trousers are widest at the ankles, they will not fit properly. You might trip and look silly. Therefore, choose dress trousers that taper toward the ankles., If your trousers are stretched tightly across the thigh, they will not be comfortable and will impede your movement. Excessively tight trousers are more likely to come apart at the seam.Bunching might also occur in the lower legs, but the thigh is the area most traditionally associated with bunching.

Know your waist measurement.,
Know your inseam measurement.,
Specify your rise measurement.,
Determine your budget.",How to Choose Dress Trousers for Men3," There are two key metrics your should know before choosing dress trousers for yourself. The first is the waist measurement. To determine your waist measurement, pull a measuring tape around your trunk in a horizontal line that crosses your navel.Always round up to the nearest whole number when taking your waist measurement. This will allow you a bit more room in your dress trousers.
A tailor will be best equipped to measure your waist.

, The second important measurement is the inseam. To measure the inseam, determine the distance from the inside of the crotch to the bottom of the ankle when wearing the sort of shoes you’d typically wear with dress trousers. Add a half centimeter (quarter inch) to the measurement to allow for shrinkage that occurs when the dress trousers are laundered.A carefully measured inseam will ensure the trousers are of the proper length. If your dress trousers have been sized properly, they will not reveal your socks.
A tailor will be best equipped to measure your inseam.

, The rise is the distance between the crotch seam and the top edge of the dress trousers. When choosing dress trousers off the rack, there is no way to customize or adjust your rise. On bespoke trousers, however, your tailor will ask for or take your rise measurement.The rise of dress trousers is generally about 10 inches (25 centimeters).
If you are taller than six feet (1.83 meters), you will be more comfortable with a rise of about 12 inches (30 centimeters).
Dress trousers with a lower rise will make you appear shorter.Dress trousers with a high rise and long, straight legs will make you appear taller.

, Dress trousers are available at a wide range of price points. Some cost $50, some cost $400 or more. Before you start shopping for dress trousers for men, decide how much you’re willing to spend. This will help you limit your attention to only the realistic choices."

Know the correct size of your baby.,
Follow fashion trends when picking clothes for baby girls.,
Select clothes with comfort and safety in mind.,
Search for clothing that is easy to put on, take off and care for.,
Purchase durable outfits.,
Make and stay within your budget.",How to Choose Clothes for Baby Girls," Baby girls’ clothes are available in all sizes. You will be able to choose clothes if you know the right size.


Remember, little girls can grow within no time. So, even if you buy a size too big, your little girl will be able to fit into it a few months down the line. However, if the size is too small, it will be restrictive and uncomfortable.
The right size is one that is comfortable and allows your baby girl to move freely.;
,


Keep in mind that the baby needs to wear the right clothing for the occasion. The last thing you want is your baby wearing a lacy princess dress when playing in the sand pit or learning to make mud pies down by the creek!
Follow fashion trends, but do not follow them blindly.

, These two factors should be paramount when choosing baby girls’ clothing.


Make sure there are no sharp zippers and no loose buttons that your baby could swallow. If you are buying nightwear, ensure it adheres to safety standards.
When your little one wears an outfit, she should be comfortable and protected. There shouldn’t be choking hazards or embellishments that can injure her soft and delicate skin.
Watch out for stiff labels that might be an irritant,

,


Keep in mind that your girl will be in diapers and you should be able to change diapers easily and quickly, without inconveniencing your child or yourself.
Pick clothes that can be washed in a washing machine. Otherwise, you will be hand washing them for hours every day. Even little girls get their clothes messy and dirty, especially little girls.
Choose materials that do not require ironing.

, Just like little boys, baby girls are active, be it while crawling, or in the playpen. They will make a mess and get their clothes dirty, so you want outfits that are durable and can take regular washing without showing signs of fading and tearing.

,


When you are shopping for clothes for your baby girl, always have a budget in mind. This way, you will not get carried away and buy beyond your means.
Having a budget will allow you to use your money wisely and buy clothes that are really necessary for your little one.
On the other hand, if budget is not a constraint, you can splurge on branded outfits.

Research sellers before you buy.,
Check the tag for the origin of the fur.,
Check the tag for the manufacturing location.,
Check the inside of a coat before purchasing it.,
Look for an un-dyed fur.,
Look for designer labels.",How to Choose a Quality Fur Coat1," You should communicate with at least five separate fur salons prior to purchasing a coat.


Visit each store and compare what you can get for the same amount of money at each.
Visit stores other than department stores. Many department store fur salons are run by the same company and have very similar selections and prices as a result. Check out a few independently owned stores, as well.;
, A quality coat should list where the fur originated from, and the highest quality coats will have fur that originates from certain countries.


Look for a mink coat with pelt origins in the USA, Denmark, or Finland. Mink coats from Norway, Sweden, China, Canada, and Russia come next.
Search for sable that originated in Russia and lynx pelts that originate from North America.
Purchase a fox fur from Finland.
Look for a Canadian origin for beaver furs.

, The highest quality coats often come from Europe and North America. Most furs come from China, however, and you may still find a quality coat manufactured there.

, Most quality furs have an open hem at the bottom of the lining for this purpose.


Note how clean the stitches are, and whether or not any fur got caught between the stitches.
Check how much leather was used in the let-out process. Lower quality furs have an underside striped with leather, while the highest quality furs have no leather at all. Ask how much leather is included in the coat to create the most accurate assessment.
Note the color of any leather used on the underside. If you select an un-dyed coat, the color of the leather should also be natural. Mink, for instance, should naturally have a creamy off-white leather.

, Dye does not harm fur in any major way, but it does impact the texture of the fur. The highest quality furs are typically un-dyed.

, Not all quality furs come from known designers, but a designer label does suggest that you have a high quality fur in your hands.

Choose capped sleeves.,
Try short sleeves.,
Pick elbow length sleeves.,
Choose long sleeves.",How to Choose a Wedding Dress with Sleeves1," Capped sleeves only cover the top of your shoulder. Out of all sleeves, they provide the least coverage. Choose this sleeve if you are having a summer wedding.If your wedding ceremony will be taking place at an informal venue like the beach or at a hotel ballroom, choose capped sleeves.;
, Short sleeves land about midway between your shoulder and elbow. They provide a little more coverage than capped sleeves. You should choose this sleeve if you are having a spring or summer wedding., Elbow length sleeves end at your elbow or slightly past it. If you want your sleeves to land past your elbow, choose three-quarter sleeves. Elbow length or three-quarter sleeves are a good compromise between short and long sleeves.These sleeves are a great choice for spring and autumn weddings.
If you want the illusion of sleeves, choose lace or mesh elbow or three-quarter length sleeves.

, This type of sleeve extends to your wrist or slightly past it. Of all sleeves, they provide the most coverage. They are a great choice if your wedding ceremony will take place at a more formal venue like a religious institution.Long sleeves are also a great choice for late autumn or winter weddings.
Some more formal, long sleeves feature a point that covers the back of your hand.

Determine your budget.",How to Choose a Quality Fur Coat2,"


Look for a trendy cut or colored fur if you want to make a fashion statement.
Buy a more traditional fur coat if you want it as a long-lasting investment piece.

,


Go with rabbit, fox, sable, or chinchilla if selecting a trendy design.
Consider warm wolf or coyote if interested in wearing your coat for outdoor activities in cold weather.
Choose mink for a blend of both style and weather-resistance.

, Each type of fur comes in a variety of colors. Decide on a color before you go shopping so you can narrow your search.


Pick between natural shades of brown or tan for a natural rabbit fur coat.
Choose from red, silver, white and black, or blue—which is actually white with minor black highlights—if selecting a fox fur.
Look for slate blue or silver if going for chinchilla fur.
Decide from a vast array of colors if going with mink fur. Natural mink fur is available in a shade of black known as ""ranch mink,"" as well as various shades of brown, white, and gray.
Alternatively, pick nearly any color you can think of if interested in buying dyed rabbit or mink fur.

, This will also narrow your search.


Go with a full-length coat if you want to wear it for formal occasions.
Consider a three-quarter length coat for a trendy coat capable of being worn both casually and formally.
Opt for a shorter, snugger coat for outdoor activities.

, Know how much you can afford to spend, and buy the highest quality coat you can afford based on that amount. Quality mink coats tend to be expensive, but you can find other high-quality furs, such as sheared beaver, at a lower price.

Compliment your upper arm size.,
Draw attention to your bust.,
Accentuate your waist.,
Emphasize your hips.,
Draw attention to your face.",How to Choose a Wedding Dress with Sleeves2," Because capped sleeves draw attention to the thickest part of the arm, this is a great choice for women who have thin upper arms. If you have thick upper arms, choose short sleeves with a wide portrait neckline.A wide portrait neckline will draw attention to your collarbone and shoulders instead of your upper arms.

, Short sleeves draw attention to your bust or upper body proportions. If you are small chested or want to accentuate your bust, choose short sleeves.Short sleeves will also balance out a full-skirted dress.

, Elbow length sleeves will accentuate your waist. This is a great choice for women who have a slender or waist, or who want to draw attention to their waist.Elbow length sleeves work well with dresses that accentuate the waist like corset, mermaid, and A line-style dresses.

, Three-quarter sleeves will draw attention to your hips and lower body. Balance out a big upper body by choosing a dress with three-quarter sleeves., Because long sleeves tend to blend in with the dress, they draw more attention to your face than your body shape. Therefore, if you want to draw attention to your facial features and hair, choose this style of sleeve.Go for long sleeves if your dress features a face framing design like a portrait neckline.

Choose light, fluttery sleeves.,
Go for a vintage look.,
Try a bohemian look.,
Add sleeves to your wedding dress.",How to Choose a Wedding Dress with Sleeves3," Flutter sleeves fall loosely about your arms. They can be either long or short. They are usually made up of a light material, like chiffon, so they can move easily.Choose this sleeve for maximum flexibility.

, Long puffed sleeves, also known as leg o’ mutton sleeves, were often worn in the late 1800s. They will give your dress a vintage Victorian look. You can also choose short or elbow length puffed sleeves, an altered version of the long puffed sleeve. These will give your dress a vintage 1980’s look.Long or elbow length cuffed sleeves will give your wedding dress a vintage 1940’s to 1950’s look.

, Dagged sleeves, also known as angel sleeves, open dramatically at or below the shoulder. The sleeve is usually shorter in the front and longer in the back. This is a graceful, medieval design that will give your wedding dress a modern, bohemian look.If you want a more fitted look, opt for bell sleeves. They can be either elbow length or long. They are usually fitted at the shoulder and around the upper arm, but open dramatically at the elbow or wrist.

, If you find a wedding dress you like, but it does not have sleeves, do not fret. Take your dress to an alterations service that specializes in wedding dresses. They will be able to sew sleeves onto your wedding dress.Before you purchase your dress, however, keep in mind the cost of the alterations. You may save more money by finding a dress with sleeves.

Choose shoes with rubber soles.,
Check for flexibility by bending the shoes.,
Look for a comfortable lining.,
Opt for velcro straps.",How to Buy Toddler Shoes1," These materials are breathable and flexible, and are perfect for conforming to your toddler’s feet.


Make sure that the shoes are made of quality, lightweight materials that your child will feel comfortable wearing.;
, This provides needed traction or friction on the floor or cement when your toddler is walking or crawling..


Rubber-soled shoes with ridges are good because they are flexible and will prevent your toddler from slipping.

, If you are able to bend them in half, then they are flexible enough to let your toddler’s foot muscles develop properly.


Leather shoes that are stiff, and those made up of synthetic materials, should be avoided because they are restrictive and uncomfortable.

, Make sure the inside lining of the shoe won't irritate your toddler’s feet.


The lining should be soft and made of cloth, so that it won’t be too hot to wear.

, Velcro straps are easy for your toddler to use, allowing him or her to begin dressing themselves in their own shoes.

If you are particularly well-heeled, you might choose to obtain a deluxe suit for $3,500 or more. Whatever your financial situation, ensure that you are realistic in deciding how much you can spend., A two-piece suit consists of suit pants and a suit jacket. A three-piece suit consists of the aforementioned items plus a matching vest. There is no functional advantage to wearing one or the other., Suits are available in every color imaginable. Most business suits will be either black, gray, or navy. But suits in bold red, blue, brown, and white might be suitable for less formal occasions.Men with lighter skin generally look better in dark suits.
Men with darker skin generally look better in light suits.
Black suits are best for very formal occasions like parties and funerals., There are three main styles of suits. The first is the English style, a suit with soft, unpadded shoulders and an hourglass body. The Italian (Continental) style is lightweight with high, squared shoulders. The American suit has a straight, roomy design and a back vent.Most off-the-rack suits will blend the three styles to some degree. If you wish to wear a pure English, Italian, or American suit, you’ll probably have to have it tailor-made.

, There are three main types of suit fits. The first is the slim fit. This close-fitting suit is shorter than most suits and hugs the contours of the body. Suits with a modern fit will not hug your body as closely as those with a slim fit, but they will give you a flattering silhouette. Finally, there’s the classic fit. These suits have wide shoulders and extra room in the chest and back. They reach well below the waist and cover your butt.The slim fitted suit works best on thinner men with lanky frames.
Suits with a modern fit have tapered armholes and sleeves.
The classic fit is best for men with an average or full build.
Bespoke suits will fit better than off-the-rack suits. However, you can always get an off-the-rack suit tailored to fit better."

Choose a shoe store with service personnel to help you buy your children's shoes.,
Have the salesperson measure your child's feet.,
Check to make sure there is about 0.5-to-0.65 inches (1.5 cm-to-2 cm) of space between the longest toe and the end of the shoe.,
Push down on the ""vamp"" (front of the shoe).,
Put your finger between the back of the shoe and your child's foot, along the heel.,
Flex your child's foot at the ankle from side to side.,
Press the outer side of your child's shoe to feel for your child's little toe.,
Look at the inside arch of the shoe.",How to Buy Shoes for Children," A store specializing in children's footwear should have experienced and knowledgeable staff.;
, When measuring, your child must stand up straight with his or her socks snug around the feet. This will help ensure a comfortable fit.

, This space allows the toes to spread out for better comfort and stability.

, It should not be tight over the top of the foot and allow some space for movement.

, Your finger should fit snugly between your child's heel and the back of the shoe.


Friction between the shoe's back and your child's heel will cause blisters over time. If the shoe back fits too loosely, it's likely to come off during normal wear and can cause gait problems as the child will overcompensate.
The back of the shoe against the ankle and heel should be firm and preferably made of plastic. Softer materials will break down and won't help keep your child's foot locked into the shoe. This can lead to loose, floppy shoes or an awkward gait while walking.

, Shoes that rub against the ankle can cause blisters, calluses or contribute to foot injury. Friction may be caused by shoes that are too large or bulky for your child's foot and leg.

, You should be able to feel the toe, not pressed firmly against the shoe wall, but able to flex within. The fit is too small if the toe presses against the shoe wall.

, There should be an ""arch support""--a contoured piece to fit your child's foot. The slope of the arch should start at the base of your child's big toe.

Research local secondhand shops.,
Peruse the selection of local secondhand shops.,
Inquire with staff about special sales.,
Wait for the right season for better deals.,
Have your children try on clothing, if possible.,
Buy clothing from other venues, alternatively.,
Purchase your items and wash them before wearing.",How to Buy Used Kids Clothing1," This can be done relatively easily with an online keyword search for “secondhand stores/shops near me.” The garment selection can be radically different from shop to shop, so note a few conveniently located shops. This way, if one doesn’t have what your children need, you can head to another.


Some common secondhand shops include Goodwill, Salvation Army, St. Vincent de Paul, Oxfam, Anglicare Shops, and so on.
Secondhand shops located in upscale or higher income neighborhoods usually have higher prices. Stores located in small towns and less upscale neighborhoods tend to have the best prices.;
, Some stores may have a better supply of one kind of item (like winter gear, footwear, and so on) than others. Noticing these patterns will help you find what you’re looking for.It’s best to visit these stores early in the day. As the day wears on, stock will dwindle, with desirable items being snatched up by other thrift shoppers.
If you’re looking for a specific item, you may want to visit local thrift stores first thing daily or every few days. This way you have a better chance of finding that item., Many thrift stores try to encourage quick turnover with stock by offering daily sales. For example, graphic tees might be half off on Tuesdays, dress clothes on Thursdays, and so on. Many stores use a sticker system, where all items with a certain colored sticker are discounted.


Once you find out which day a desirable special is, try to make it to the shop first thing in the morning. Other shoppers will likely also be trying to save money by buying items on that sale day.

, In many cases, right after the passing of a season you can find great deals on items for that passed season. For example, in early spring, you’ll likely find winter gear, like boots, gloves, jackets, and so on, significantly discounted.Younger kids can grow quite a bit in a year. It'll be impossible to predict their size perfectly, but you can always estimate it off of older siblings, or you can look up the average sizes for that age range online.
Seasonal sales are often planned well in advance. You may want to ask a store employee if their shop has any seasonal sales so you can make time in your schedule for them.
Many people try to clear out the clutter in their home during spring cleaning or after gift giving holidays. These can be great thrifting opportunities., Some secondhand stores may not have changing rooms or they may have policies against children trying on clothes. Most, however, will have facilities for trying on clothes.


Sizes can be considerably different between brands. For this reason, it’s important to try on clothes before purchasing them.
If the store you’re at doesn’t allow clothes to be tried on, hold up the garment to your child or have them try it on over what they're wearing. While not a perfect sizing technique, this will often give you a rough idea of the fit.

, Yard sales and flea markets are excellent places to find inexpensive clothing. Where yard sales are concerned, keep your eyes out in the warm months, especially in spring, for road signs indicating local community yard sales.You can often find advertisements for flea market hours and larger yard/rummage sales (like those that are hosted by non-profit organizations, like churches) in the classified section of your local paper, or even advertised online.

, After you’ve selected your items, gather them together and pay for them at the register. When you arrive home, be sure to wash your child's clothes before wearing them. After all, you never know who tried on the clothing before your child.


Check for care instructions on the garment before purchasing it. If an article of clothing does not have this, you may wash it incorrectly and cause damage to it or ruin it.
If you’ve bought an item without care instructions, hand wash it in a clean bucket or sink using cold water and a little detergent.In most cases, you can also wash it separately on the cold setting in washing machine.

Plan at least 1 hour to try on jeans.,
Measure your waist and inseam before you go out.,
Know your cuts.,
Choose mid-rise over low-rise, unless you are sure of having a short torso.,
Pick dark denim with few details.,
Try on a pair of jeans that is 1 size smaller, if you are choosing a tighter style.,
Accentuate curves with details.",How to Buy Jeans1," Start in a shopping mall or at a large department store so that you can compare different styles. , Take into account the “waist” of the jean, at low (hip), medium (above hip) or high (near the belly button) rise levels. The waist is more important than the inseam, because the jeans can be shortened.


If you are very tall, look for a 36-inch (91-cm) inseam. Brands like Habitual and Rock n’Republic specialize in tall sizes. Petites can try Kasil, Banana Republic and Caslon brands.

, The following are common styles of jeans:


Flares. This type goes in and out of fashion quickly. They open wide between the knee and ankle. A flare can accentuate curves.
Bootcut. This is the most versatile jean style for women of different body types. It flares very slightly at the bottom, with just enough to fit over heels or boots.
Wide-legs are similar to flares. They are a trouser style that looks good with heels and boots. They are easy to dress up and fit both curvy or straight body types.
Straight-leg jeans follow the leg and don’t flare. They can make your legs look slim, but make sure they aren’t tight in the calves.
Skinny jeans. This denim is perfect to wear underneath tall boots. They should be close fitting from buttocks to ankles, but not uncomfortable. They can be the hardest styles to fit to your body, especially for women with curves.
Relaxed or boyfriend-fit. Just as the name suggests, these jeans are baggy throughout the leg. They are stylish when rolled up to the ankle, and they should not be baggy in the butt. They generally look better on tall figures, rather than petites. , Low-rise jeans have about 8 to 10 fewer inches (20 to 25 cm) in the hips and waist than low-rise. If you carry extra weight in your hips, buttocks or stomach, low-rise is likely to give you an unflattering “muffin top,” or fat that puffs out above the waistband.

, Avoid contrast stitching, pocket embellishments or whiskering. They can detract from a good fit, and they are more indicative of “fashion” jeans, not everyday styles.


Whiskering is the intentional distressing of jeans around the hips and buttocks. They usually look like horizontal lines around your hip joints.
Dark washes are more slimming than lighter blues or sanded washes. , A pair of jeans will stretch about 1/4 inch (0.6 cm) all around. However, if you can’t fit a finger between the area where your hipbone and waistband meet, they are too tight.


Always take 2 to 3 sizes of a pair of jeans into the room. All brands vary, so you could be a size larger or smaller than you assume.

, If you want your butt to appear larger, choose button pockets. If you want your hips to look curvier, you can try washes that accentuate hip seams.

Buy sneakers for everyday and outdoor wear.,
Pick boots for colder days.,
Only choose sandals for indoors.,
Always avoid shoes with heels.",How to Buy Toddler Shoes2," Sneakers conform to your toddler’s feet because they are made of canvas and flexible leather.


They are soft on the feet and can also be used for casual wear.
Most importantly, they allow for proper muscle development while protecting your feet.

, During winter, ankle boots are perfect because they also allow natural flexing of the foot joints.


Wellies are also good during the rainy weather because they are made of waterproof materials.
However, boots should not be worn every day because your toddler’s feet are still growing and boots can be too restrictive., Sandals don’t offer any protection at all and your toddler might hurt their toes or part of their foot when they are playing outside.


Additionally, opt for closed-toed sandals because they provide better protection compared to open-toed ones.

, Flat shoes that let your child’s feet bear down normally on the ground are better at this stage for proper support and stability.


Heels are best left to children who are older and have more developed, stronger feet.

Measure your toddler’s feet correctly.,
Put socks on your toddler’s feet when fitting shoes.,
Use your little finger to measure the space between your toddler’s Achilles’ tendon and heels and the back of the shoe.,
Make sure your toddler’s toes have enough space.,
Check that the shoe isn’t too wide or too narrow.,
Ask your child how the shoe feels on their feet.",How to Buy Toddler Shoes3," You can buy your own measuring device, like Clarks Foot Measuring Gauge, or you can print off sizing charts from the internet.


Place your child’s foot (one chart per foot) along the curved line drawn at the bottom of the chart.
Ask your child to stand still so their toes are relaxed.
Measure the length from your child’s longest toe; for example, if your child’s longest toe touches the number 4, then her size is 18.
Alternatively, go to a store that specializes in children’s shoes, because they will employ a professional who can measure your toddler’s feet accurately.

, Your child won’t normally wear shoes without socks on, so you need to buy shoes that will accommodate their feet in socks too.


This will stop you from purchasing shoes that are slightly too small.

, Depending on how much space is available, you will be able to determine if your child's shoes are too small or too large.


If the space is too wide, the shoes are too big and your child's feet might slip out of the shoes, causing them to trip.
If the back of the shoes presses too close to your child’s heel, then the shoes are too tight and might cause strain or painful blisters.

, Gently press the part of the shoes that cover your toddler’s toes.


Sometimes, toddlers curl their toes inside the shoes so you have to make sure they’re well splayed inside.
You want just about a centimeter to about half an inch of space in this area between the shoes and the toes (with socks).

, To best determine if the shoes are tight or loose, check the tongue of the shoes and the laces or Velcro when tied, and they should be parallel to each other.


If there is too much room or space between them, then the shoes are tight.
If they overlap too much, then the shoes are too loose or big.

, If your toddler can walk, ask them to stand and walk while wearing the shoes, or help your child walk with the shoes on.


Try to get your toddler to tell you how he or she feels about the shoes.

Try the suit jacket on.,
Select your lapel style.,
Decide how many vents you want.,
Decide whether you prefer single or double-breasted suits.",How to Choose a Men's Suit2," Always try before you buy. Pay attention to both the look and the comfort of the suit. Shoulder seams should not extend beyond your shoulders.Your jacket sleeves should end about one centimeter (half an inch) above your shirt cuffs.There is no such thing as a perfect suit, unless you choose to have one custom-made.
Even if a suit off the rack doesn’t fit perfectly, you can always get it adjusted later.

, There are three main types of lapels. Notched lapels taper out and down at the top edge. Peaked lapels have a sharp V-shape to their top edges. And shawl lapels have a smooth curvature that blends directly into the collar of the jacket.Notched and peaked lapels are the most common types.
Peaked lapels on a single-breasted jacket will make them seem more formal.

, There are three types of suit venting – ventless, center, and double. The Italian style suit is typically ventless, meaning the suit’s bottom edge wraps all the way around your back in an uninterrupted line. The American suit is typically a single vent, meaning that a narrow slit runs up the middle of the suit’s back. And English style suit jackets are typically double vented, meaning they have two slits in their back – one on the left and one on the right.Athletic individuals are best equipped for the ventless suit. Large men should avoid it.
Single and double vented suits allow more freedom of movement and greater flexibility.

, Single-breasted suits are those with buttons that meet along a central axis in the center of your trunk. These suits can have up to four buttons running down the center. Double-breasted suits are those in which one side – the left side, typically – of the suit overlaps significantly with the opposite side. These suits have four, six, or eight buttons.Most off-the-rack suits are single-breasted.
Thin and/or tall men might benefit from wearing double-breasted suits, since they project the impression of a fuller figure more than single-breasted suits do.
Double-breasted suits are more formal because they are always buttoned. Single-breasted suits, on the other hand, can be unbuttoned to project a more relaxed personality or mood.

Try the suit pants on.,
Select pleated or plain-front pants.,
Choose cuffed or uncuffed pants.,
Decide what sort of break you want.,
Choose your pocket type.",How to Choose a Men's Suit3," The waist of the pants should sit approximately at your navel. The pants should not fall or sag when worn without a belt or suspenders. Neither should they be pinching or too tight.Wear the sort of shirt and shoes you would when wearing a suit when shopping for a suit.
If you know that you’ll be wearing a belt, a pair of suspenders, or both with your suit, try them on along with the suit. Be aware, too, that some suit pants are incompatible with belts.

, Pleated pants are those with a creased central line running down the front of each leg. Plain-front pants have a smooth uniformity across the entire surface of the legs.Pleats make the pants a bit more flexible. They are best for larger men.
Thin men tend to look best in plain-front pants.You can use pleated pants to determine if you’re wearing the right size. If the pleats disappear when standing upright, your suit pants are too tight.

, Cuffed pants are those that have a narrow margin of fabric just above the ankle of the suit pants. Uncuffed pants end without any sort of differentiation.Typically, pleated pants have cuffs and plain-front pants are cuffless.

, The break is a measure of how much your pant cuffs bunch at the ankle. No break pants just barely touch the top of your shoe and do not crease or bunch at all. Slight or medium break pants have a slight crease in the ankle or lower shin. Full break pants evince significant bunching at the ankle and lower shin., There are two types of suit pants pockets. Slanted pockets are those which extend from the waist in a downward angle toward the outer edge of the leg. Straight pockets are those which resemble a simple vertical slit in the side of the pants.Slanted pockets are slightly less formal than straight pockets.
Rear pockets always consist of a simple horizontally-oriented slit. You might have one or two rear pockets. They will typically have a button to fasten one or both.

"

Decide the fabric you want your suit made of.,
Choose the button material.,
Select your sleeve button placement.",How to Choose a Men's Suit4," Most suits are made of wool. Tweed suits are also common, especially in less formal or outdoors settings. Suits of silk, cotton, gabardine, mohair, cashmere, and linen are most comfortable in the summer. Try on suits made from a variety of fabrics to identify which you find more comfortable.The fabric of the suit can affect your comfort when wearing it. While this is typically not an issue with the suit jacket, it can be with the pants, which come in contact with a greater area of your skin than does the fabric of the suit jacket.

, Most suits have buttons that match the color of the suit. However, you could customize the suit by swapping out generic buttons for mother of pearl or wooden buttons. Ask the salesperson about what sort of button options are available., There are three types of sleeve button placements. Spaced buttons have a bit of space between them. Kissing buttons are touching one another. Stacked buttons are overlapping.Suit jackets usually have four buttons, though three buttons are also common.
Sleeve buttons should be located about one centimeter (half an inch) above the jacket’s wrist cuff.

Research online stores.,
Verify the range of quality for secondhand items.,
Check manufacture sizing info before purchasing.,
Use peer-to-peer services instead of stores, alternatively.,
Pay for and wash items when they arrive at your home.",How to Buy Used Kids Clothing2," Some stores may be more expensive than others, or may specialize in certain kinds of garments, like gently used items or designer brands. You’ll have to be selective with the kind of online store you shop at to find the items you’re looking for efficiently.


Check the shipping policy for each site. Some sites may include free shipping, some may only ship to certain regions, and others may ship for a fee.
Sites that sort their stock according to season can really cut down the time it takes for you to find season specific wardrobe items., Most frequently you'll see stores advertise secondhand clothing that is like new or gently used. These shops are often very picky about the items they stock. These items can be a little more pricey, but will generally have the appearance of a garment fresh off the rack.


Stores may use a sliding scale for clothing quality. Generally, moving from high to low quality, you can expect ratings like: new with tags, new without tags, like new, very good, good, and acceptable., Clothing sizes aren’t always standard. Certain manufacturers use different measurements for the same size. For example, a small for one brand might be a medium for another.


Double check size information before purchasing to prevent receiving items that don’t fit your children.

, There are sites now that can put you in touch with other parents directly. Once you do, you can organize a clothing swap or pay money for clothing. Some common sites like this include Facebook, SwapStyle, threadUP, and Rehash Clothes.When you cut out the middle man, like a secondhand store or consignment shop, you'll likely save more money than you would otherwise.

, Paying for your items should be as simple as adding them to your online shopping cart, hitting the pay button, inputting your credit or debit card information, and then confirming the sale. After that, the items will be shipped to your home. Be sure to wash items before letting your child wear them.


A downside to buying clothing online is you won’t be able to inspect garments before purchasing them. Due to this fact, you may purchase an item that doesn’t have a tag. Hand wash these items separately in a bucket, clean tub or sink, and so on. Use cold water and a little detergent.In many cases, items without a tag can be cleaned by washing them separately in your washing machine in cold water.

Make a shopping list.,
Look into current trends.,
Dress in light, easy to manage clothing.,
Evaluate clothing carefully.,
Shop for one individual at a time to prevent arguments.",How to Buy Used Kids Clothing3," A list will help you stay on track while you shop, which can prevent you from overspending. This can also save you from forgetting a necessary item. It may take a while before the items you are looking for show up in stock, so even when shopping online, a list can be helpful.You may want to divide your list into two parts: necessary items and things that would be nice. This will help you separate your needs from your wants.

, Peruse clothing magazines or the selections at brick and mortar stores to learn the current trends in kids’ clothing. If you don’t know what your children will think is stylish, this technique can give you direction.Bring your kids along with you while window shopping so they can point out styles they like. Afterwards, you can shop together at brick and mortar secondhand stores or online ones to hunt for that style.

, Waiting for a dressing room to open up and the process of changing into and out of clothing can add a great deal of time to your thrift shopping. Dress your children in an outfit that you can easily slip potential items over so they can try on clothes quickly and efficiently.


It will be cinch to try potential garments on over a light top (like a tank top or t-shirt), easily removable shoes (like flip-flops, sandals, flats, crocs, and so on), and pants that fit well., Even if a garment looks like it's in perfect condition, this may not always be the case. Check hems, seams, and difficult to see parts of the garment (like the armpits of shirts, the inside of pockets, and so on).


Loose threading at the seams or hems of an article of clothing is generally a sign that the garment is coming undone.
In some cases, you may be able to get an even better discount by pointing out damage. Show loose threading, holes, discoloration, and so on to clerks, and ask if you can get a better deal.

, If you have two children that are roughly the same size, or if your child has a friend of the same size who wants to come shopping, this can create friction. If both children want the same item, it can create an unnecessary hassle.Beyond the practical reason of diffusing potential arguments over who gets what, one-on-one time with your kid will be valuable for relationship building. Take this time to ask about school, friends, and so on.

Ask a sales associate to take your measurements.,
Pick jeans that are sized both by inseam and waist size.,
Judge the fit based on the rear.,
Judge the groin next.,
Try on jeans with a pair of shoes that you wear regularly.,
Choose denim that has a darker, indigo color.,
Don’t choose distressed jeans.,
Ask the store if they have a tailor.",How to Buy Jeans2," If it’s been a long time since you have sized up your jeans, you should get an accurate waist and inseam measurement. If the store doesn’t do it, find an old pair of pants that fits well, then buy a fabric measuring tape and measure the 2 areas yourself.


The waist measurement is the circumference of the waistband. On your body, it is generally the circumference at the widest point above your hipbones.
The inseam is the measure from the top of the groin along the inside of the leg to the ankle hem.

, Avoid a general size so that you can get exactly the fit you need. Some men’s jeans are sized by waist measurements only. In this case the inseam is often around 30 or 32 inches (76 or 81 cm).

, If it fits snugly on your butt without drooping, you have a fairly good fit. , Sit down and see if it pinches. If it does, get a size with a larger inseam.

, However, remember, you can always get the length tailored, as long as the fit in the waist, inseam and butt is right.

, A true blue jean is usually a sign of sturdier fabric and more durable dye. It is also flattering to most body types.

, They can make a good pair of jeans look unusual, creating the look of a bad fit, even if you have found the right one. Focus on distressing a pair of jeans yourself with repeated wear.

, If they don’t, find a tailor in your local phone book. Ensure you get fitted for tailoring with the shoes you normally wear.

Start at a department store.,
Try jeans from across several different price ranges.,
Visit specialized stores, if you fit into the plus sizes (size 14 and over for women).,
Buy several pairs of jeans when you find the right fit.",How to Buy Jeans3," You are more likely to find designer jeans, but the sales associate may know what styles will look best on your body. You could save yourself 30 minutes or more looking through the racks.


Some department stores include tailoring services with the purchase of designer denim.

, A $30, $70 and $150 pair of jeans will feel different because more expensive pairs generally have a tighter weave. This tight weave means they will be more durable and retain their shape after washing. If you want a pair of jeans for business casual settings, you may want to consider a designer pair.

, Svoboda, Levi, Lane Bryant, Chicos or Newport News carry a number of styles ranging from size 14 to size 30. , Jeans clothing styles are frequently discontinued. Style experts suggest that women buy 2 pairs and tailor 1 for flat shoes and 1 for heels. "

Before you actually buy clothes, think about if you want to have a style.,
Decide if you have a match.,
Dress for...patterns!,
Before you cut the tag on anything you might wear go through this checklist in your head.,
If the answer is ""No"" or ""Not very often"" to any of those questions, reconsider getting or wearing the article of clothing.,
Access the accessories.,
Get some shoes to match..",How to Buy the Right Outfit for You," Do some research on the style, and then buy some comfortable clothes to fit the style. Make sure you buy some clothes in that style for formal and casual events.

Also, think about whom you might see, what you might do, and where you might be. Don't buy something formal for a meeting at work, and don't buy everyday casual clothes for a wedding reception.



 

;
, When you're at the store buying clothes, either buy a whole, matching outfit, or think about and make sure you have matching clothes at home. If you get home and find out you don't have anything to match it, it might mean another trip to the store to either return the clothing article, buy more clothes to match it, or have an unmatched outfit. If you're wondering about what matches, see the list for a couple of basic matches.

White and everything






Denim and everything






Black and everything (but navy blue)






Pink and black






Yellow and green






Blue and green






Purple and blue






Pink and purple






Orange and yellow






Red and orange






Brown and green







, Instead of just basic pants and shirts with one color, look for patterns like plaid, striped, polka dotted, Tye-dye, or just something other than basic colors. When you buy patterns, not only does it reduce the chances of someone having the same outfit as you, but it also gives your look a new ""bang""! The catch about patterns, though, is that they're harder to match. While white matches with everything, it gets boring after a while.

,


Does it fit me correctly?
How often will I get a chance to wear this?
Do I like it?
Do I have anything to go with it?
Is it comfortable?

, If it doesn't fit you correctly, it could could take you months to grow in or out of it - and weeks for the fashions to change. If you won't get to wear it very often, you don't want to spend a lot on something you'll only wear once or twice a year. If you don't like it, don't get it!

There's a great substitute out there for the article of clothing you bought but hate. If you don't have anything to wear with it, either take the article or clothing back, or buy some more clothes to go with it. If it's not comfortable, check how long you'd have to wear it. If it's a short amount of time, you may be able to wear it, but if it's a whole day, return it. After all, your clothes are going to be right against your skin for the whole day.

, Clothes are great, but so are accessories! Wearing a bracelet, necklace, and a pair of earrings complete an outfit! Silver is a great color for bracelets, necklaces and earrings if you have very different colored outfits, as silver matches almost everything. But if you can, try to buy the same color of necklace, bracelet, and earrings as the color of your outfit. You can also get a coordinating color, such as an orange bracelet for a yellow outfit as it might match some of your other outfits.

, When buying shoes, make sure they're the right type for your outfit. Don't buy high-heels for an everyday outfit. Tennis shoes or flats are better for that. You can also buy season-themed shoes, such as flip-flops for summer or boots for winter.

After you've gotten your main type of shoe down, think of the color of your outfit. Try to get the same color of shoe as your outfit, or at least a coordinating color. Make sure the shoes are your size, though.

Sport coats need not match the fabric of the pants, as you'd find with a suit jacket. The biggest difference between a sport coat and a blazer is that sport coats are patterned, while blazers are made of solid fabric with a contrasting color of button. Stylistically, sport coats are sometimes a slightly looser fit than other kinds of dress coats, allowing for outdoorsy use and ""sporting."" They're somewhat slightly less formal than a suit jacket or a blazer.
The variety of fabrics is somewhat larger with sport coats as well. Wool, linen, cotton, and other kinds of materials are all common to sport coats. The one thing a sport coat must have, though, is a pattern.;
, Since a sport coat isn't as formal as a blazer or suit jacket, it can have some give and should appear (and feel) a little looser.For jackets, the length of the coat is usually standard. To learn the cut appropriate for you, find your range below:


A short is typically used on people under 5’7, with sleeves up to 32 in.
A regular is for people between 5’8 and 5’11, with sleeves of 32-33 in.
A long is for people between 6’0 and 6’2, with sleeves of 34-36 in.
An extra-long is for people taller than 6’2 with sleeves longer than 36 in.

, Sport coats come in summer and winter weights, and are common for any season in which a bit of formality needs to be mixed with a bit of fun. Getting sport coats that can be used for different seasons will help you stay comfortable.


Wear cotton sport coats for the summer time. When it's hot out, you don't want to be caught in a wool jacket. Cotton breathes well and will help you to stay cool, despite wearing a relatively heavy article of clothing.
Wool jackets should be worn in winter. These are heat-saving and will often be able to be worn without the need for an overcoat.

, The vent is the open seam in either the back of the jacket or the sides, used to allow the jacket to hang loosely and make the trouser pockets available to the wearer of the jacket. While unvented jackets are form-fitting and stylish, they're somewhat less comfortable in sport coats, which are slightly less formal.Side-vented jackets are popular in Europe, and have a cool and sleek modern vibe. Back-vents are more traditional and comfortable.

, The sport coat can vary considerably in style, which is why it is so versatile. You'll find different pockets, buttons and even leather patches on the elbows. The pattern, however, will be the biggest and the most eye-catching element of the sport-coat, making it important that you pick one that you'll be able to wear in a variety of different ways.


Err on the side of subtle. Plaid purple and orange might look sweet on the mannequin, but how often will you be able to wear it? Think of good colors to match what's already in your wardrobe.
What do you intend to do when wearing the sport coat? If you're moving a lot, look for a coat with plenty of movement and even expandable panels or pleats to give you more ability to swing the golf club or toss out the fishing rod.

, While not all people like to pair a sport coat with jeans, it is perfectly permissible to do so.The trick is to wear jeans that are in excellent condition and wear a neat belt too. Also, ensure that the coat and jeans fit well.


Alternatively, wear trousers. Most casual and smart casual trousers will match well with a sport coat.
If the coat is patterned, choose neutrally colored pants in beige, grey, fawn, cream, etc. The pants should not compete with the coat.
For a light-colored sport coat, match with dark colored pants. For a dark colored sport coat, match with light colored pants., Classic is always in style. Match patterned sport coats with solid-colored shirts for a casual but stylish look. If you want to be sophisticated and put-together, putting on a patterned sport coat with a solid shirt and a neat tie will have people turning heads. Match busy jackets with solid shirts and ties, and vice versa. It'd be hard to get away with three patterns.


In cold weather, try out a sport coat over a sweater and collared shirt combination. This can be an excellent way of staying warm without the need for an overcoat. It looks stylishly bookish, like you're a grad student at Oxford studying avant garde poetry.
Get creative with your tie choices. Patterns are probably out, but think about wool ties, string ties, and other types of ties that will complement your jacket pattern nicely. Alternatively, unbutton a few top buttons and wear just the shirt and coat together. This can be a great powerful look.
Your collared shirt should always be tucked in, and the collar should be inside the jacket, if you're going to wear it with a sport coat. It’s not 1974! Don't let the collar hang outside.

, If you want to look like you're hosting the MTV Movie Awards, or you're heading to work at your tech start-up, this is a great look, less formal but still fantastic. Just make sure that either shirt is of very good quality and in excellent condition. It should not be see-through or wrinkled.


Wearing a printed t-shirt with a sport coat communicates a slightly subversive stance, artistic and corporate at the same time. Think of artists at gallery openings, hoping to sell a bunch of work. Nice-looking sport jacket, designer jeans, and a Rolling Stones tee? Always cool.

, If you're integrating a sport coat into your look, the shoes can make or break it. It'll depend on the outfit, but you want to go for a complementary look, in general.


If you're wearing jeans, it can be tempting to want to throw in casual shoes as well, but very casual sneakers or Converse can make you look like a teenager dressed up in dad's clothes. For a more elegant casual look, wear loafers, Oxfords or casual brogues with jeans.
If you're wearing dressier pants, it might work well to go for more casual shoes. For the ultimate touch, consider some kind of walking boot, or even stylish cowboy boots for an added accent of awesome.

, Conservative thinking might suggest that brightly pattern sport coats should be matched with solids and toned down as much as possible. That's certainly a fine way to match your coat to your other clothes. But feel free to experiment. Maybe your purple plaid jacket would look great with a gray pullover, with the collar of your pink dress shirt poking through the time. Look for complementary colors and styles. Break rules and see what works.


Consider adding a pocket square. Increasingly, pocket squares are coming back, offering a little complementary accent of color that can make your jacket pop. Match the coloring of your pocket square to your shirt.

, Sport coats come in two and three button varieties. The more buttons, the longer the line created by buttoning all of them. In general, it's recommended that you button your jacket while standing and you unbutton your coat while sitting. For some people, it's also common to unbutton the coat for walking.


How you choose to wear your coat is completely up to you. You don’t have to button it or unbutton it any time, but it usually looks better and helps to slim your silhouette to have it buttoned when you're standing. Button the top button only, if there are multiple buttons on the jacket.

, In very cold weather, an overcoat might be necessary, even if you're wearing a sport coat. Don't forget to consider the weather and avoid getting caught out underdressed. Woolen overcoats, pea-coats, and trench coats are all appropriately paired with a sport coat. Usually, you'll want these to be muted solid colors: black, gray, dark green, or beige.

, Sport coats are versatile for every day wear, but also good enough for formal occasions. Depending on your place of work, it may be acceptable to wear the sport coat to work and to the sports bar afterward. If you’re ever somewhere in which jackets are required, a sport coat should be fine.


The sport coat is at home in the restaurant, at the bar, down the pub and when calling on friends for dinner. Good colors for social events include beige, brown, cream, khaki, tan and white. The lighter colors are always less formal.
For formal events, a sport coast, especially a brightly patterned one, might be less suitable. Opt for a suit jacket or a blazer instead.

, Never wear a dirty or wrinkly sport coat, or you might as well wear a popped collar polo. Sport coats need to be kept in good condition, and dry cleaned regularly to keep them looking nice. In general, you shouldn’t need to have a jacket dry cleaned more than once every six months.


Budget tip: In Thornton Wilder’s Theophilus North, the main character has only one suit that he has to keep pressed every night between his bedspring and mattress, to keep it unwrinkled and clean looking. While you might not need to go that far, ironing your sport coat regularly should help to keep it in good standing.

Keep the basic items in neutral colors.,
Recycle basic dresses and skirts by layering underneath them.,
Invest in staple outerwear pieces.",How to Transition Your Wardrobe from Fall to Winter1," Shop for pieces that you can easily add on top of your current fall outfits.

These flexible garments can be removed when you’re indoors and wrapped around your waist or tucked discreetly away in your bag.To get the most mileage out of your cardigans and jackets, opt for classic styles and solid colors. These can be mixed and matched with countless outfit combinations.;
, Most people don’t associate t-shirts and tank tops with winter, but these pieces are essential for layering. As you go through your fall wardrobe, don’t pack all of the basic pieces away. Keep the items that are classically cut and in solid, neutral colors. For example, black tank tops, short-sleeved black and white t-shirts, black pants, black leggings and tights, regular jeans and skinny jeans are always in season.Retire garments with colorful patterns and stick with wintery neutrals like black, cream, gray, brown, maroon and navy blue.
Pack away bright-colored t-shirts and anything pastel.

, The weather is getting colder, but that doesn’t mean you have to pack away all of your dresses and skirts. Basic shift dresses and pinafores can be made winter-ready by layering pieces underneath them. Long-sleeved shirts and simple turtlenecks can be worn underneath dresses to keep you warm. Tights in dark colors, especially black and navy blue, can also help you keep some dresses in your winter wardrobe.


If you live in a particularly cold climate, basic tights might not be enough. Opt for leggings in thicker materials to keep your legs warm under a dress.
In general, short, brightly colored skirts and dresses with spaghetti straps should be retired for the winter season.

, Denim jackets, leather jackets, peacoats, sharply tailored blazers, puffer jackets, down vests and trench coats are very versatile and can help you make almost any outfit winter-ready.

Transition your color palette to dark, neutral colors.,
Tone down or get rid of floral prints.,
Introduce thicker fabrics and heavier knits.,
Transition with structured silhouettes.",How to Transition Your Wardrobe from Fall to Winter2," In general, most pastels should be removed from your winter wardrobe, especially the light pinks, yellows and blues. However, bright whites are neutral enough and many associate white with winter clothing.Traditionally, stark neutrals like black, dark grey, dark brown and deep navy blue are preferred in the coldest months. Don’t abolish all of your fall neutrals – keep colors like deep maroon, olive green and even pumpkin in your wardrobe during the transition.


Repurpose a few of your favorite light-colored items, especially shirts, if they can be easily paired with dark neutrals.
For example, you could make a pink shirt work in winter if you pair it with black slacks or skinny jeans. A black cashmere cardigan, black shoes and dark accessories will complete the look.

, Not everyone wears floral prints, but those that do may want to consider retiring most of them until spring. If you do want to keep a few of your floral prints, stick to the ones that feature more austere colors like wine red, royal purple and navy blue. Floral prints on darker backgrounds can also work in winter. Wear only one floral piece at a time and pair it with other garments of dark colors.


For instance, a toned down floral shirt paired with a black skirt or dark-wash jeans would be suitable winter attire.
The same general rules apply to other kinds of prints and patterns – for example, simple plaids in dark colors are very winter-appropriate. Stripes also work well., Suede, leather, cashmere, velvet, corduroy, wool and shearling are all popular winter clothing materials that can keep you warm as the temperatures go down. Start adding heavy knit sweaters to your wardrobe and use them as layering pieces. Knit sweater dresses also transition well. Introduce thicker fabrics for pants and trousers, such as wool and corduroy.Opt for flannel button-down shirts or cashmere hoodies to create a casual look.


Consider warmer jackets and shoes made of suede or leather. There are plenty of vegan options out there, as well, especially for shoes.
Don’t forget smaller items – you could incorporate wool socks into your wardrobe, for instance., Summer and fall silhouettes tend to be softer and more casual than winter cuts. Opt for structured silhouettes, tailored pieces and sharper lines. Snappy blazers, pencil skirts, tailored trousers, fitted coats and dresses made of thicker, stiffer fabric all work well. During the transition you can easily pair structured items like these with warm-weather garments like t-shirts.Retire softer silhouettes like baby doll dresses and caftans.

Add a chunky scarf or heavy knit beanie to your outfit.,
Opt for boots.,
Consider buying a statement coat.",How to Transition Your Wardrobe from Fall to Winter3," Accessories made with thick materials can help you ease into winter and keep yourself warm. One of your staple fall outfits can be easily updated with a thick-knit scarf in a neutral scarf or beanie. You can also continue wearing bright colors in your wardrobe through the winter by limiting them to your accessories.For example, a basic black sweater and dark-wash jeans can be spruced up with a brightly colored beanie.
Update a neutral black dress with a chunky scarf in a fun pattern.
Accent a dark business suit with a tie featuring an interesting pattern., Keep your ankle boots and other lightweight boots through the transition, but add heavier, more industrial styles into the mix. Stick to dark colors like black and rich brown. Knee-high and over-the-knee boots are very popular with women. Dress boots, rugged casual boots, leather booties, snow boots, wingtips and any other styles you enjoy can help you seamlessly transition into winter.Pairing boots with lighter clothing can also help extend the life of warm-weather garments.
If you have any sandals or peep-toed shoes hanging around in your fall wardrobe, pack those away for the winter months., Since you’ll be sticking to mostly dark and neutral colored clothing in the winter, you can easily get away with accessorizing with a bold coat in an eye-catching color, print or cut. A statement coat probably won’t match all of your outfits, so consider this an accessory item only. Have other heavy coats in more neutral colors in your wardrobe to fall back on."

These fabrics will not constrain your body or cause you to sweat in the heat. They are also great for staying cool and put together, even on a hot weather day.You may look for dresses, tops, and skirts made of cotton or linen. Or you may opt for a jersey dress in a simple cut that you can wear on a hot day.
Shorts made of cotton or linen are also good options for staying cool on a hot day. T-shirts and collared shirts made of linen or jersey are also ideal.;
, Fabrics like polyester, nylon, and silk may look nice on but they are not breathable materials. They will cause you to sweat and will retain body odors, making your hot weather day that much more uncomfortable.You should also avoid clothing made of rayon or wool, as they are not breathable and will cause you to sweat more than you already are in hot weather.
Silk is also a fabric that repels water, which will create a rippling effect on the fabric when you wear it on a hot, sweaty day. However, if you need to dress up for an event, you may opt for silk over more constricting fabrics like polyester or nylon.

, When you are choosing clothing for a hot day, you should go for fabrics that are light in color. Pastels and colors on the lighter end of the spectrum, such as white, beige, and gray, are all good options as they will absorb less sun than darker colors.Avoid clothing in dark colors or jewel tones, like emerald, purple, or blue. You should also avoid black clothing, as it will trap light and make you feel more hot in hot weather.

, If you work outside often or are walking around outside on a daily basis in hot weather, you may opt for the comfort and breathability of work out clothing. A lot of work out clothing is made of materials that absorb sweat and keep you cool as you sweat. Often, work out clothing is also made to be comfortable and easy to move in as you go about your day.If you work in an office setting or another professional setting, work out clothing may not be appropriate. But if you are running errands throughout the day or having a casual day out, you may be able to get away with wearing your work out clothing. Work out gear has become more fashionable with the rise of “athleisure” clothing, where you wear stylish work out clothing as part of an outfit., Avoid skin tight clothing and clothing that will constrain your body as you move around on a hot day. In general rule, looser is cooler in hot weather. This will help to create a layer of air between your skin and your clothing.Look for dresses that are A-line cut, with a loose fit on your arms, chest and waist. Choose tops that are cropped so they do not hug your stomach or torso. Go for skirts and shorts that have a loose fit around your waist and legs.

, Go for bottoms that will not cover up your legs with material, especially if you want to feel cool on a hot day. Look for shorts or skirts in breathable fabrics and cuts that do not constrain your legs.You should avoid wearing pants, unless you have to wear them due to a professional dress code or a formal dress code. If you do have to wear pants, opt for pants made out of cotton or linen in a loose cut. You may also wear pants that you can roll at the hem so they do not squeeze or constrain your legs.

, You should also look for tops that have short sleeves or that are sleeveless. If you tend to have sweat lines, you may opt for sleeveless tops so your sweat lines do not show. Make sure the tops are made of breathable material like linen or cotton so you can stay cool and show off your killer arms.Men may not have the option of going sleeveless in the office. Instead, you can opt to wear long sleeve button up shirts in a breathable material like chambray, a lightweight alternative to denim.

, If you are trying to dress modestly but still stay cool in the heat, you may be tempted to layer your clothing and shed each layer when you get hot. However, layering will only create more clothing for you to deal with as you go about your day and likely will not keep you cool. Instead, you should choose clothing items that do not require you to layer. This way, you do not have to worry about shedding clothing throughout the day.A good hot weather item is a maxi dress, which allows you to cover up your legs without having to worry about shedding a layer. Maxi dresses are also good for formal events when paired with heels or dress sandals, as they keep your legs covered but still feel summery and appropriate for hot weather.
You could also wear a long sleeve shirt with shorts to remain modest and still cool in the heat. Or, pair a cotton cardigan with a long cotton dress.

, Hot weather accessories can also be a great way to look fashionable while you beat the heat. Go for sunglasses that have UV protection and glare protection. Look for sunglasses in brightly colored frames, such as peach, bright blue, or pink. This can add another level of summer to your look., Brimmed hats are great for staying cool in hot weather, as they protect your face from the sun and keep your body cool in the heat. Look for hats made of cotton or woven materials. Hats with a wide brim all the way around, sun hat style, or baseball hats are ideal for staying cool in hot weather., Many people suffer from swollen, sweaty feet in hot weather. You can counteract this by wearing shoes that are comfortable and not constraining. Look for shoes with comfortable soles made of breathable materials like canvas or cotton. Avoid shoes that are made of non-breathable material like leather, rubber, or other man-made materials.You should also make sure your shoes fit your feet properly so they do not get irritated by your shoes. Feet often swell in heat so you may opt for open toe styles like sandals to ensure your feel have room to breath.
If you are wearing closed toe shoes, you should wear socks so there is no rubbing or chaffing of your feet in your shoes.

, Perhaps one of the most important accessories in hot weather is sunscreen. You should apply sunscreen to any bare skin that will be exposed to the sun before you go outside. This will protect you from harmful UV rays and ensure you are not at risk of skin cancer or other skin related issues.


For a very sweaty, hot day, you may opt for sunscreen that is waterproof and long lasting so it will stay on your skin. You may also need to reapply sunscreen periodically so your skin is always protected when you step outside.

Layer your clothing.,
Wear loose sweaters.,
Buy warm gloves, scarves, and caps.,
Wear shawls, blankets, or throws.",How to Dress for Winter1," Try wearing a long-sleeved top inside of woolen and knitted sweaters. Wear Long Johns or other warm leggings inside jeans, dress pants, or any other pant worn otherwise.


Choose a thick coat that falls below the waist, preferably reaching the knees. Layering your clothing helps to trap body heat within the layers, consequently insulating you.

Too many layers, however, have the capacity to cause sweating, which can become cold and defeat the purpose of layering. Try a few layers of good, warm materials such as wool, polyester, and thick synthetics. Avoid cotton directly on the skin, as it does not provide any warmth.

, A pair of linen cargo pants can be both practical and stylish. These sorts of pants typically work best in casual settings, but you may be able to find a few that can be used for dressier occasions, as well.

, Jeans are a style staple for any season. Light and medium washes freshen things up for spring, but you can pull out your favorite dark wash jeans, too.

, Toward the end of the season, the weather may get too hot even for capri pants. A good pair of shorts is essential for days like this. Consider tailored style dress shorts, like Bermudas, that stop just short of the knee.

Stock up on flats.,
Pull out your dressy sandals.,
Don a pair of walking sandals.,
Keep a pair of casual white sneakers.,
Try an open-toe heel.,
Consider a pair of galoshes or other rain boots.",How to Dress for Spring5," Flats can be decorative or simple, and work well with both casual and semi-dressy outfits. They also expose the top of your foot, keeping your foot cool without exposing your toes.

, For nice occasions, consider throwing on that pair of kitten heel sandals you put away for the winter. The warming temperatures bring sandals back into fashion.

, For casual days, a sturdy pair of leather walking sandals looks appropriate and keeps your foot feeling cool.

, Choose a simple slip-on or lace style shoe. These are good to have for everyday use and running errands. White, as opposed to black, navy, or darker colors, works especially well for spring.

, While not quite as freeing as the heeled sandal, an open-toe heel also pays homage to the warming weather by exposing a part of your foot you would likely keep hidden during winter.

, You can wear nearly any footwear for light drizzles, but you might want something more water-resistant for downpours.

The Fashion Institute of Technology and Parsons The New School for Design (both in New York City) are leaders in this industry, but they don’t come cheap. Tuition is often thousands of dollars per year.


Many colleges also offer majors in Fashion Merchandising, which includes courses in design, marketing, and business practices. If you want to own your own label, this could be a good option for you.If you’re very confident in your business and design skills, you could try to train through apprenticeships with other fashion labels, or even go it on your own.;
, Many people dream of becoming fashion designers, envisioning the life as a world full of glamor and beautiful models and gorgeous silks and leathers. While these things can be part of it, some experts suggest that less than 10% of your time as a label owner will be spent actually designing your clothes: the rest of it is eaten up with small-business-owner responsibilities such as managing line production, packaging and sending off clothes to magazines and customers, and dealing with the public., For some people, being your own boss and being solely responsible for the success of your company is an exhilarating sense of independence; for others, it’s the stuff of sweat-drenched nightmares. Are you the type of person who thrives on challenge, tight deadlines, and stiff competition? Can you persist through hardships because your dream of a label is everything to you?


You can still work in fashion even if you don’t start your own line. Some fashion designers go to work for large fashion houses and never start their own labels, because they don’t want all the extra responsibilities that come along with that.

, In fashion, much of your success will be determined not only by what you know, but by who you know.


Finding a business partner with experience in running a small business could be a really good idea. In addition to bringing expertise and a different set of skills to your label, they can also take care of the business side if you’re less confident with it, while you can focus on designing.If the words “wholesale margins,” “overhead,” or “production management” mean nothing to you, consider taking some business classes, or at the very least reading up on the nitty-gritty details of running a business. You can have all the passion and determination in the world, but you’ve got to also turn a profit to keep your dream going.

, To start a new “ready-to-wear” clothing brand (the type that is sold in department stores) requires between $2 million and $3 million dollars.Even starting small requires between $500 and $10,000.Be sure you know what your expenses will be and how you will pay for them.


Small business loans can be hard to procure, especially if you haven’t written a business plan before. Consider crowdfunding options such as Kickstarter or gofundme to help you reach your funding goals. Even credit cards can be an option, although this is not ideal as interest rates tend to be very high.

, One of the big issues for beginning fashion designers is whether to stay the proprietor of a business or to take the legal steps necessary to incorporate an LLC, or “limited liability corporation.” Paying consulting fees may not seem like a good use of your limited money, but it’s best to have expert advice on how to keep your label profitable -- and from taking everything else you own with it should it fail., It may help to have a few labels in mind that inspire you. If you want to sell boho glam women’s clothing, check out what designers like Rachel Zoe do. Where do they sell their labels? How do they promote themselves online? How do they sell the idea of their label to the public?Do research on hard numbers, too. How much money is in men’s jeans or bridal or whatever you want to do? What type of sales volume will you need to make a profit? How many other designers and labels are out there in your niche, and who are your biggest competitors?The website How to Start a Clothing Company is recommended by a variety of fashion designers and experts as a good source of information on everything ranging from startup costs to design copyright to marketing., Having a strong sense of who your ideal target customer is will help your label find success.Businesses that try to market “something for everyone” may ultimately end up without a strong, focused identity and lose customers to confusion over what their brand represents. Similarly, labels that design for “glamorous women” or “young business professionals” without a sense of who that really means may end up out of business.


Think about the fashion labels that are incredibly successful and how well they define their customer base: for example, Kate Spade New York markets to young professional women who rock a fun vintage vibe, while Versace targets glamorous, over-the-top trendsetters. Both of these labels were among the most popular in 2013, even though they’re at opposite ends of the fashion spectrum.Consider registering your label name and logo with the patent and trademark office. Once this is done, others can’t rip off your ideas (and if they do, you have legal recourse)., They should aim to create an emotional connection between your label and your customers by using characters or scenes that people care about and vivid descriptive language. Most importantly, they should say something about your brand: what does your label stand for?You’ll also want to define a “brand equity statement” that describes exactly what customers can expect from your label, as in this example from the Business of Fashion website: “Brand X is a contemporary American work wear collection featuring traditional fits and luxury fabrics for professional women ages 40-50. Brand X is unique because it offers exceptional quality at accessible prices.”,


Think about how successful labels have created such items: for example, the wrap dress is practically synonymous with Diane von Furstenberg, and Burberry’s signature plaid sells everything from coats to bags because it’s instantly recognizable.

, You should start planning even before you sketch this season’s designs. Do you have a theme in mind that will run throughout the collection? A source of artistic inspiration? Try to imagine your collection as a cohesive group of designs, rather than separate designs that just happen to be sold at the same time.


All collections should start with the signature item you created in the previous step. This will be the “base” of your collection, and probably won’t change too much from year to year.
The “middle” portion of your collection should include some tried-and-true products that you’re very comfortable with. You can adapt these with new colors or stylings from season to season, but they will stay fairly similar because you know they’ll sell.
The “top” portion of your collection is where you do the most experimentation. This section should be a couple of pieces that change according to season and are the “edgy” or trendy parts of your label. These can be the most difficult to predict sales for: you could have an instant hit on your hands, or a dud that nobody buys. Keep this portion small but stylish.

, If you need some inspiration, try doing research in the art section of the library or visiting museums which have clothing and costumes on display. Sketch what you’re confident you can create impeccably.


When sketching, keep the cost of fabrics and construction in mind. A dress with elements such as intricate beading or a lot of piecing and seaming is going to be labor-intensive to construct, which will result in a more expensive final product.
A good rule of thumb is to consider that retail markup is around 6 times the cost of production. That means that every dollar you spend on fabric or construction cost translates to roughly $6 in the final sale price. Don’t out price your customer base by over designing.

, You may be able to find discounts on fabrics at stores that are targeted toward fashion designers. Online warehouses can also be good choices, but always order a swatch or sample before you purchase large quantities of fabric!

, It’s important that these be perfect (or as close as you can get it). Often, the fit and finishing of a piece will determine its success.If you don’t know how to sew, you can outsource the production to others, but always ask for a sample of their work first. There’s nothing worse than hiring someone to construct your label and then discovering that they’ve destroyed your $40-a-yard fabric with ragged edges and uneven seaming., The biggest upfront cost for brick-and-mortar stores is filling the racks, and that kind of volume costs serious money to produce. Selling online, you can afford to start smaller. Venues such as Etsy and ASOS marketplace are established sites that can often net you customers very quickly., Take advantage of the Internet Age and use every platform you can think of to promote a solid, coherent brand identity. Get on Instagram, which many PR reps in fashion think of as the most important platform for designers. Use Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest, Vimeo, YouTube, Flickr, Tumblr, and your own website (a must!) to create a constantly updated, exciting web presence.


Update your social media presences frequently! Emma Hart, a fashion PR rep who owns her own firm, compares social media platforms to your “shop window”: it has to be constantly updated, refreshed, and invigorated, or people will think you’re not serious about your label., You can do this online, even in places like Instagram. In addition to promoting your own brand, share designs by others that you love and find inspiring. Leave encouraging comments and compliments on other designers’ pages. You’ll find that being generous may inspire others to return the favor.

, Ask your customers for their feedback! Listen to what they love and they don’t. If you notice something isn’t selling, ask your customer base for their opinions. There is no substitute for time spent listening to your customers and thinking about their opinions.


It can be hard to hear criticism, especially if it’s directed toward a passion project. Try to remember that you are there to serve your customers, and that criticism of a product isn’t necessarily criticism of you. Do what you can to constantly improve your label and your merchandise.
Don’t make drastic changes to your label based on a few customer opinions, though.Too many sudden, dramatic changes could cause your customers to question your brand image., Customers won’t want to buy your label if they can’t connect emotionally with it. This also goes for the designer: customers want to see that you are passionate about this business and that you pour that passion into the products you create."

Design a collection or seek local designers to make garments for the show.,

Make a floor plan of how you want your runway, where the guests will be seated, where the bar (if any) will be located, will you have a buffet of food or will there be people serving canapes.,

, This is important to do before anything as you need enough time to reserve the location. Without a venue there is no show. You can have a fashion show anywhere! Just make sure the venue is large enough to hold guests, workers and the equipment needed for the night. Also ensure there are rest rooms available and visible fire exits in cases of emergencies.

, Having this mapped out will organize and maximize your space. Also consider if you'll have a runway at all. Some designers have held exhibitions like art galleries where models stood in statue-like poses. Rick Owens took fashion show to new heights in Paris 2013 for his s/s 2014. You can watch his show on YouTube.

, Attention to detail is imperative. Will you have flowers? If so, what kind of flowers? Will there be fabric hung from the walls? What is the color scheme? What mood are you trying to invoke on your guests when they enter? These are questions that will determine how much detail you've placed into the show. Make sure not to overdo it either- sometimes less is more. To make it easier on yourself, you should make a mood board- this should contain colors to consider, fabrics or materials, lighting, food that will be served, etc. Consider everything.

, Decide on a date (make sure to give yourself enough time, especially if you're doing the show on your own). Make an invite on photo shop or illustrator- or have a friend do it! Once that has been finalized, make a list of people who you would like to attend your show. Are you doing it for publicity? If so, you need press and lots of it if you're a new designer. You should send them to magazines that feature new talent, bloggers, photographers, models, etc.

, Many companies will give you samples, bags or raffle gifts if you ask. You can search for PR companies online. Send emails and ask if they are willing to offer anything. Another good way of this is by going to the store yourself and asking a manager if this is possible. If the manager is not available ask when he/she is next in. Do not believe an associate will pass on the message. Be professional and persistent!

, This is great fun and can be done in several ways. You can place an ad anywhere with time and location for an open casting. Make sure that if you decide on this route that you have a time slot and are available for that time. Nothing is worse than going to an open casting and no one is there- you've wasted their time and may have lost a potential model. If you are seeking professional models then be prepared to pay them per day. If you are seeking new models- fresh faces- you can place a free ad on Starnow.com where you can browse through categories of models, actors, singers, photographers, etc. ModelMayhem is also a good site to check out. You should a sheet for them to fill out with contact information, measurements, a photo (you will take on the day of) and shoe size. You can find a pre- made sheet on Google by typing in model sheet or Model Casting.

, You can see if a near by salon will be willing to do it free of charge in exchange for their logo to be printed on the tickets. If you can get stylist and make up artist from a school, that would be better as they are always willing to do it for the experience. You can also find many on Starnow. Make sure to ask for their portfolio. Show them the ideas or styles you have in mind, they can give you expert advice in what would work best. ** Make sure not to allow them to alter your designs or ideas. Take their advice but at the end of the day it is YOUR show** Please also be aware of the type of hair style or make up you are after. If your garments are extravagant, then keep everything else to a minimum. Consider closings and if it is pulled over the head how it would affect the hair. You should have at least 2 photographers for the day of the event. Take backstage images and images during the event. If you want to record it you need to consider 2 cameramen, lighting and an editor.

Learn the difference between real turquoise and imitation turquoise.,
Understand that the gemstones used in almost all turquoise jewelry must be stabilized because natural turquoise is usually too soft to be worn as jewelry.,
Get familiar with the enhancements that are applied to turquoise stones.,
Learn to identify turquoise by where it was mined.,
Buy from a reputable jeweler.",How to Buy Turquoise Jewelry," Natural turquoise, an aggregate of copper aluminum phosphate hydrate, formed under heat and pressure, is often soft or porous when mined. The various colors found in turquoise result from the presence of either copper or iron--vivid blue is from copper and the softer green tones from iron. Turquoise stones can also have patterns of brown, yellow ochre and black matrix, produced from copper compounds. True turquoise has an opaque, waxy luster that may or may not include matrix, depending on the type of turquoise.;
, The stabilization process of a turquoise stone involves submerging it into a stabilizing compound. This results in the natural action of the stones’ capillaries drawing the stabilizing compound into the gemstone.

, The American Gem Trade Association (AGTA) outline the different enhancements that are applied to turquoise stones. These various treatments should be clearly identified by the seller.

, Turquoise mines are located all over the world, and each mine produces stones that have distinctive colors and markings.


Sleeping Beauty turquoise is mined in Arizona. It is a solid stone (no matrix) and it ranges in color from royal blue to a light sky blue.
Chalk turquoise is mined in China. It is white and porous, so it must be stabilized and dyed. Chalk turquoise is dyed in various hues of blue and green because the mines don’t contain copper, which is the element that naturally gives turquoise its distinctive hue. Chalk turquoise almost always has a matrix pattern, which resembles faint cracks.
Persian turquoise is mined in Iran. This stone is known for its extremely vibrant, robin’s egg blue color. Persian Turquoise"" does not have a matrix, and some people refer to any turquoise stone does not have the black or brown veining commonly found in turquoise mined in the United States as “Persian Turquoise.” The main thing to look for, other than a lack of a matrix, is the distinct, bright blue color.
Bisbee turquoise is mined in Bisbee, Arizona. The Bisbee mine produces turquoise stones in many different shades of blue and the stones have a reddish-brown matrix. This pattern is only found on the stones taken from the Bisbee mine.

, Turquoise has a wide range of values, depending on which mine it came from. The price can also depend on demand and scarcity (some mines are nearly depleted.) Be sure to buy your turquoise from a jeweler that is a member of AGTA. If you want to be sure you are buying authentic Native American turquoise, make sure the dealer is a member of the Indian Arts and Crafts Association (IACA).

Measure your neck.It’s important to measure your neck before investing in a choker, since they are meant to fit relatively tightly.,
Assess the length and width of your neck.Chokers look best on those who have long, slender necks.,
Consider your face shape.Chokers, like all necklaces, accentuate your strongest facial features by framing your face.,
Try it on before you buy it whenever possible.",How to Choose a Choker Necklace1," Take a soft measuring tape and loop it around your neck once. Be sure to hold the tape close to your neck – chokers should fit tightly, but they should be loose enough for you to breathe easily.A good rule of thumb is to add 2 inches (50.8 mm) onto whatever your neck measurement is. This will be a comfortable choker length for you.


The standard choker measurement is usually 14 to 16 inches (356 mm to 406 mm) in length.
Chokers can vary greatly in width from 3 inches (76.2 mm) down to just a small wire about 1/16 of an inch (4 mm).;
, If you have a very short neck, a choker won’t look very flattering unless it's very thin and simple. If you have a wide neck, a choker is still an okay option as long as you choose a slim one; otherwise, you run the risk of making your neck appear even wider. The longer and more slender your neck, the wider the choker you can wear while still looking appealing.


A longer, more slender neck can wear chokers with more detail and gems.
If you have a wider neck, it is best to go for something a bit simpler.
If you have a short neck, it's best to avoid wearing most chokers at all, unless it's a very thin one., If you have a round face, steer clear of chokers, since they will emphasize the roundness. If you have an oval shaped face, you can wear necklaces of all shapes, lengths and styles. If your face is on the long and thin side, a choker will make your face appear wider and softer.


Chokers look very flattering on people with heart shaped faces because they make the face look fuller while balancing out the narrow chin.
Those with round faces should avoid chokers completely because they will emphasize the fullness of your face.

, Before you begin shopping for a choker, make sure you’ve recorded your neck measurements. When you try one on, keep in mind that the best positioning for a choker is on, or just above, the collarbone. Always look for a style that comes in your size. If you are unable to try it on before purchasing, there are many choker options that come with adjustable chains.


These chains usually offer about 2 inches (50.8 mm) of adjustability.
Most sellers will list the length/size of their chokers – if not, ask a shop assistant for help.
If the choker makes your neck look shorter or disappear completely when you try it on, avoid this type of necklace.

Studded leather chokers are popular in punk and goth fashion.
Try a cameo for a gothic-tinged Victorian or Edwardian look., Metal chokers come in a variety of styles and are made with many different types of metals.

Consider the neckline.The more bare skin is exposed around your choker, the more it will stand out, so definitely consider the necklines of your tops and dresses.,
Match the choker style to your clothing style.,
Choose based on whether you’re wearing casual or formal attire.",How to Choose a Choker Necklace3," Chokers are the most flattering with sweetheart, scoop, v-neck, strapless, off-the-shoulder and square necklines. For an alternative look, wear chokers with a top that leaves your chest and shoulders bare, like a corset.When possible, try selecting a choker design that coordinates with the neckline.


For example, you could pair a gothic choker with a point in the middle with a v-neck top.
Another example would be wearing a round-shaped choker with a scoop neck top.
Avoid wearing chokers when you're wearing clothes with high necklines, since they might snag your clothing and cause your neckline to look bulky.

, If you are into goth, alternative or punk fashions, choose chokers that reflect those styles. Velvet, lace and leather chokers all fall under that umbrella. Chokers also look fantastic with corsets and dramatic evening attire. Pair gowns with elegant pieces.


Burlesque dancers love to wear chokers with their stage outfits, since they’re so flattering with that style.Bohemian fashions work best with crochet and tribal chokers.

, Elegant evening wear works best with glamorous pieces that feature pearls, diamonds and ivory beads. Bridal wear is also similarly suited to those kinds of pieces. Fabric and crocheted chokers work best with casual Bohemian styles.


Chokers that are simple strands, featuring beadwork or other embellishments, can look great with both casual and formal wear.A strapless formal gown can be made even more elegant with a delicate choker featuring translucent glass beads, crystals and gems.

Give it a rest.,
Empty your pockets.,
Fold and pack your suit properly.,
Brush your suit after each wear.,
Spot clean stains.,
Avoid the iron and use a steamer.,
Use a wide-shouldered wooden hanger.,
Store your suit in a cloth garment bag.,
Dry clean your suit before storing it for the season.While great for chilly holiday party weather, wool suits aren’t particularly suited for summer events.",How to Care for a Suit," Unlike your trusty pair of jeans, a suit can’t be worn daily for months on end. A suit’s fibers need recovery time after each wear, otherwise you’re taking years out of its life.Additionally, not wearing your suit daily keeps it clean longer, allowing for more time between visits to the dry-cleaner. If your job requires wearing suits daily, consider the following options:


Investing in an additional suit. Not only will this extend each suit’s lifetime, but it will provide you with additional style options.
Should the above not fit within your budget, you can get away with buying a second pair of pants. They usually wear out faster, and having a pair of pants in a different color can give a suit jacket more versatility and style.;
, Filling your pockets to the brim will counter your suit’s flattering cut. Bulges and lumps change its overall shape and can stretch out the fabric, leaving it shapeless and deformed.Make it a point to empty your pockets before heading out in your suit, keeping only the essentials with you.

, Travelling with a suit takes some pre-planning, which is particularly important if you’re travelling for a meeting or conference. The last thing you want is to show up in a wrinkled suit. Ideally, you should carry your suit in its garment bag rather than stuffing it in a bag or suitcase. However, it is possible to fold a suit for storage in a carry-on:


Hold the suit jacket upright, pop in one shoulder and pull it inside-out.
Tuck the other shoulder into the inside-out shoulder, folding the jacket until the lapels line up.
Finally, fold the jacket in half until the top of the shoulders lines up with the bottom of the jacket., This is typically sufficient to keep it clean between trips to the dry cleaner. Brushes aren’t typically much more expensive than $20, and will rid your suit of hairs, dandruff and dirt that it might collect over the course of a day. Just remember to always brush downwards, following the fiber (never across)., It’s entirely possible for your suit to become noticeably stained, though you shouldn’t necessarily rush to the dry cleaner when this happens. Many of these stains can be spot cleaned using non-scented baby wipes.Alternatively, a towel and a bit of water can be used for cleaning tougher stains.

, Unfortunately, your suit will get wrinkled after wearing it, and unlike the rest of your wardrobe, ironing will do more harm than good. A hot iron can damage a suit’s fibers, shortening its lifespan and causing it to lose its shape. Instead of ironing, consider the following options:


You can use a steamer to straighten wrinkles and rid your suit of unpleasant odours between trips to the dry cleaner. Good steamers typically cost around $150 but significantly extend your suit’s lifetime.A neat trick to replicate this without a steamer (eg. while travelling), is to hang your suit in the bathroom and run a hot shower for about half an hour. This will create a similar effect as the steam fills the room. , Cheap, flimsy wire hangers might be enough for the rest of your wardrobe, but a wooden hanger is ideal for hanging your suit. This will ensure it retains its shape, whereas wire hangers tend to cause wrinkles and will even deform the jacket’s shoulders. Additionally, hangers made of cedar naturally repel one of your suit’s worst enemies: moths., Suits are usually sold in plastic garment bags, to ensure they don’t suffer any damage on their way to your closet. However, this is far from a long-term solution: suits shouldn’t be kept in an airtight environment. Plastic garment bags don’t allow the suit to breathe and can tear easily. This can lead to nasty odours and easy access for moths. You can find cloth garment bags rather easily; stores usually sell them if they sell suits. Important things to consider before buying are:


Compare the length of the bag to that of your suit. You don’t want the suit to get bunched up while it’s stored.
You can and should be storing dress pants with their respective jackets.
Extra features that aren’t needed but can be handy include cedar linings and extra zipper flaps to ward off insects.

, Beyond being sloppy and possibly permanently dirtying your suit, lingering stains and odours make your suit particularly attractive to moths and other insects. Remember not to dry clean your suit more than a few times a year. More than this and you risk damaging it."

Wear your boots.,
Build up normal polish on the boot by brush polishing the boot for a few days, building up layers.,
Once a few layers of polish is applied, buy your self a good quality duster.,

Get ready to polish.,

If you don't have time to wear them in, put them on and submerge them in hot water for 20 minutes or so. Then walk around; this will help speed up the process. Note they will take time to dry.

, Again wear them whilst doing this but try not to scruff the toe or chip the boot; this will affect the end out come, so don't take them on the assault course.

, Selvyt cloths are a good choice. Wash it a few times, and brush it with a nail brush and washing up liquid will make it softer and less likely to scratch your boot. Note that this can be done whilst doing first steps.

, Each time, use less and less new black polish.

, Do as you have done for the black layers; again stop when you think it's drying and removing any left over polish with water. Brown polish seems to be softer than black, so it fills the tiny holes you want to get rid off to make the best shine.

, Repeat daily until you get the results you want. This normally takes a week of around an hour a night to see good long lasting results.

Relax.",How to Be Stylish," The first thing to do to look effortlessly stylish is to make sure that you’re wearing clothes that you feel are good for your body type. Since effortless style is supposed to be subtle, you’ll need well fitting clothes in order to get the elegant, expensive, stylish look from your clothing. You may want garments that make you look thinner and the perfect height, with everything in proportion.;
, Effortless style is mainly based around classic looks. Dressing for current trends just shows that you put way too much thought into that outfit and that you’ve been following fashion news like a broker watching stocks. Choose classic styles in classic cuts for a more effortless look that looks good for years.


This means women should beware of floor length casual dresses in favor of knee-length, for example, while men should shy away from skinny-legged suit trousers in favor of something more loose-fitting.

, What colors are popular and what colors are considered absolutely hideous is very dependent on time and place. Just look at your mom’s clothes from the 1970s, for example. In order to look effortlessly stylish, you’re going to want a more timeless look, which means sticking to more muted and neutral colors. This can, however, be broken up with bold accent colors, especially on accessories.


Muted colors include tan, black, white, denim/navy blue, and gray.
Good accent colors include most shades of red, many shades of blue, plum/eggplant purple, golden yellow (like rubber ducks or tulips), and emerald green.
Be careful of certain colors. Be wary of other greens and yellows, and generally avoid oranges, as these colors are very prone to going in and out of fashion, but, if you think they are stylish, go for it.

, Busy prints and textures (like fuzzy/fluffy/feathered fabric) can quickly make an outfit look dated and unstylish, as these tend to be in fashion only for a season or a year at most. Next year it will be another pattern, so why bother? Look effortlessly stylish by keeping your clothes in style across decades, not months.

, To look really stylish, you want your clothes to look expensive. You can make cheap clothes look expensive but investing in some actually expensive items might be a good idea. A few choice pieces of hard-to-fake luxury items, such as a nice sweater or wool coat, can really take your wardrobe up a notch. Having a limited number of nicer items is preferable to having a large number of very cheap-looking items.

, If you really want to put the effortless into effortless style, you’ll want a wardrobe where nearly all of the pieces match with each other. This will let you get dressed based on comfort, style preference, or weather conditions, instead of being limited by color or style combinations.


Use a single clothing style (vintage, modern, etc.) and the use a single color palette (this should be helped if you followed our advice to use muted colors with limited bold accents).

, Looking stylish means your clothes are going to have to look well maintained. No stains, no holes, no loose threads, no wrinkles. If you want your clothes to look maintained, then the best way to do that is to maintain them! Keep your clothes clean, fold and store them correctly, and do other basic maintenance as the needs arise (e.g. sewing minor holes).

, What you probably don’t realize about models and famous people is that part of the reason they look so stylish is because their clothes fit their body perfectly. And how do you get clothes to fit perfectly? Get a tailor of course! Find a reliable tailor in your area to alter your clothes perfectly for your body. Even some department stores will do this for you.


It’s not as expensive as it sounds. Tailoring a shirt often costs as little as $10-20, pants around $30.
It may seem like a silly added expense, but tailor a nice clothes once and keep them maintained and you’ll look amazing for the next ten years. It’s an investment.

, Effortless style is all about looking like you put in no effort, so keep your outfits simple. Use a limited number of clothing and accessory pieces. This is especially important when it comes to accessories.


For example, don’t wear a scarf and bangles and big earrings and a hat. Try to limit yourself to two noticeable/accent accessories.

, You’ll want to be wearing clothes that look stylish but are not too much for the occasion. Over-dressing is a sure sign that you put way too much thought and effort into how you’re dressed. Don’t wear a fancy dress for grocery shopping, and don’t wear a long gown when a cocktail dress will do, for example.

, Since your clothes themselves should generally be in muted, neutral colors, you’ll want to make your accessories your accent pieces. These should draw the attention and look extra cool. It is easier to have accessories that conform to the latest fashions and trends, so don’t worry about that as much (in this area, it’s usually okay).


For example, you could pair a floppy hat and patterned fashion scarf with a brown jacket, blue tee, white skinny jeans, and brown boots.
Another example would be to wear a black dress and pair it with red earrings and a bracelet.
Just make sure you keep your color palette across the whole outfit. Accent accessories colors should generally be the same or compliment each other.

, You’ll want your hair to be stylish too. Keep it in a simple style or carefully created “tousled” look, but make sure that you are in fact creating the look. Your hair should look nice, even if it doesn’t look like you spent an hour getting it just right.


Avoid products to achieve a more natural look associated with effortless style. This means no gel or hairspray!

, Women should avoid using very noticeable makeup. Keep the colors natural, ladies, and get as close as you can to looking like you don’t have makeup on at all. You want to, of course, emphasize your best features and hide certain flaws but don’t go overboard.


Lips are an area of exception, as these can be a great way to add a little extra bang to an outfit by introducing bright colors, like a classic red.

, Mixing patterns well is incredibly difficult and will make you look more chaotic and less elegant. It’s okay to have one item in your outfit have a pattern or texture, but keep it limited to one.

, Keep layers to a minimum and avoid chunky items or other items that add a lot of bulk. These will make you appear chubbier and less streamlined and stylish. Oversized sweaters have a time and place, but tend to go in and out of fashion to a certain extent, so be careful.

, While it may not be visually apparent, scent can go a long way towards developing how people perceive you. Smell nice by keeping yourself and your clothes clean, but also consider adding a perfume or cologne to your fashion line-up. Avoid young scents like fruity smells in favor of something more mature for a really classy touch.

, Keep your clothes in a theme in order give yourself a signature style. This is a look that people will associate with you and will make you seem more stylish, even if they don’t necessarily like your clothes.

, The style you create for yourself should generally match who you are as a person. For example, a really sweet woman taking on a catty look will seem weird and out of place, the same as a serious businessman dressing in gangsta style. Tailor your clothes to fit your personality and people will be much more inclined to see it as your style.

, Do you ever feel like some models could wear a brown paper sack and still walk down a runway looking like the height of fashion? Do you know a guy who wears a tracksuit and still somehow manages to look totally fashionable? What the fashion industry doesn’t want you to know is that a lot of looking stylish really comes down to projecting confidence. You don’t have to actually be confident, of course, but if you walk down the street in clothes that you clearly think you look great in, people will usually be inclined to agree that (at a minimum) those clothes are perfect for you.

, The effortless part of the stylish look should of course be presented by giving off an air that you don’t care, or that you just threw on the first outfit you could find. Be humble or indifferent when people compliment your clothes.

, In order to look stylish, you’re also going to want to look elegant and coordinated. This means not falling down if you’re wearing heels. Being graceful should be easier for guys, but is still important so don’t neglect it.

, Even if you’re wearing 4” stilettos, you need to look like it’s all perfectly natural and you’re perfectly comfortable. Don’t complain and constantly readjust your clothes. If that style isn’t working out for you, if you can’t seem casual in it, then try something that’s actually more comfortable. You can be comfortable and stylish.

, Again, effortless style is all about looking awesome while also looking like you didn’t try at all. Effortless, right? So relax. Take a generally chill attitude to everything in life. Always stay calm and happy, and you’ll look much better, no matter what you’re wearing.

Also, even if it is not a job requirement, try investing in a blazer jacket. Sooner or later you will need one. A two buttoned, single pocket jacket will be nice. Recommended colours are black, grey, and very dark navy. Even if you are a student, dressing up with one will present you better during lecture presentations.

If your acne (or other face impurities you wish to remove) is not subsiding, try Proactiv or medical treatment. To keep it soft, try things like facial masks, eating properly, and drinking water. By the way, don't think that water clears up acne-it hydrates your skin, and keeps it from looking dry and ashy... there's nothing in plain water that clears acne.

For Eyes: In pictures, it often looks as if she has hazel or blue eyes. But in several books, especially in Killer, we learn Spencer actually has green eyes. Either way, eye color doesn't matter. Also, get enough sleep every night and don't rub your eyes a lot to avoid creating pre-mature wrinkles. If you have under eye circles (which Spencer has, from studying so often) you can use concealer or many ways to cover them. Wear good quality mascara from a brand like Estee Lauder or Benefit to get ash-black lashes like her.

For Teeth:: Remember when we mentioned that Spencer has a mega watt smile? Well, maybe you should get one too! If you're young, you can get braces to straighten your teeth. If you're worried about how it'll look, they have braces that go behind your teeth, so no one can see them! If you already have braces or don't need them, brush your teeth 2 times a day with a good toothpaste, floss once or twice a day and mouthwash once. Brushing your teeth prevents plaque and tartar. Use mouth wash and breath mints after brushing. Don't forget that floss!

For Lips : Spencer is described to have peachy pink lips, well you can use a lipstick that is described as peachy pink to obtain this.;
, As you can tell, Spencer is a perfectionist. From pictures, you can tell that she is what we call 'preppy'. She does not dress in Hollister, Aeropostale, or Target. She dresses in classic, preppy stores like Kate Spade, Ralph Lauren, J. Crew, Lacoste, and Lilly Pulitzer, and wears other high-class brands that go either unspecified or nondescript. Try to take time to dress and to look effortless and put together. For a bag, she would probably carry a Longchamp tote. She wears trendy clothes but with a classic twist - try a cute gray mini, rose ballet flats with gray knee highs, a white blouse, and a pink cardigan. Dress everyday like you're going to a country club or even meeting the Headmaster at a prestigious private school. If a lot of girls don't wear high fashion things (or you cannot afford it or you don't like the style) you can shop at Abercrombie, HCO, and American Eagle, but try getting understated pieces like plain, brightly colored, fitting sweaters with tanks to go underneath. Definitely no hoodies or t-shirts with brand names plastered on the front - Spencer is much classier than that. Try to dress in a more mature manner. If you can't afford some of the higher class stores, shop around and buy preppy sweaters, flats, accessories, etc. from more obscure stores. Check your mom's closet too, even ""borrow"" her pearls. Just look as preppy and neat as possible.



Accessories! Try to get some cute bags and keep them clean and organized; her favorites are from Kate Spade. For bags, try a cute tote that looks high fashion and classy but never goes out of style. As for jewelry, get classic pieces like a simple pearl necklace and matching earrings or diamond studs and a tennis bracelet.

, Because of her undying wit, academic intelligence, and seemingly perfect persona, it's almost a surprise that this Pretty Little Liar is sneaky, greedy, and hell bent on beating everyone else out. She uses her smarts, common sense, and wit to do her best, and that's why she always seems so perfect. Be cordial to everyone, but use your good reputation and skills to maneuver your way to what you want. DON'T double cross anyone, or unnecessarily involve anyone, or it will backfire on you.

, Straight A's don't come naturally to anyone. You're going to have to work hard - hand in all your homework on time, do any possible extra credit, and study very hard for tests. Volunteer and do internships - they both look good on college applications.

, Become an A student. Spencer's done many bad things but it never ruins her good girl reputation. If you're going to spread rumors, please, think of consequences, and how this will change people's perception of you, even if it is a small rumor. Also, what you do in after school stays after school. If you just hooked up with some guy, don't let it spread around school; keep it to yourself. Things like this can get twisted up and people can pass it on from a simple kiss to the full Monty, and ultimately, you'll get a negative stigma and that does not go hand-in-hand with being perfect.



Friendly Competition...Or Not Spencer is in a cut-throat competition with her elder sister, Melissa, to see who's the better Hasting, especially in school. Try to outdo siblings and friends, but don't be cocky or smug about it. There is such a thing as friendly competition and it gives you drive to do your best. However, when you start hoping other people will fail or you go too far sabotaging or plagiarizing them, you need to tone it down a little.

, Spencer is very organized and she plans her day out in her Sidekick. For one, get a smartphone, or a cell phone and a planner, and try to plan your day out in as much detail as possible. Write neatly and legibly. Also, have a clean room. Spencer takes neat to a whole new level. Being neat also applies to your clothes, hair, schoolwork, locker, etc.

, Try a bunch of different extracurricular activities. Spencer plays field hockey and tennis to keep in shape and also because she's good at it! If your school doesn't have field hockey or tennis team, try lacrosse, horseback riding, or running. Spencer also goes for a run a few times a week to keep fit and it helps her think things over.

, Spencer is part of the most popular clique in school. Her clique is made up of different girls but each have their own unique friendships with one another. I'm not here to say you have to be popular, because it's unnecessary, but it does add to the 'Spencer' persona. Also, Spencer attracts a lot of hot guys and is flirty, but she sometimes does things that may haunt her later. Do not become ""easy"", and mess up your reputation.

, But at home...Things are messy. If you want to be like Spencer you do not have to make your home messy. Try to get amazing grades, join a lot of clubs.

Don’t let a man determine your value.",How to Be a Femme Fatale," If you want to be a true femme fatale, then you should wear dark, sexy, and retro clothes. Pick clothes that are well-cut and draw subtle attention to you in a tasteful way. Opt for darker colors such as black, maroon, or emerald green. Clothes that are flattering are important, too; if you don’t look great in a black cocktail dress, try another design instead. Pair your look with high heels, but make sure you know how to walk in them to pull it off. Here are some clothes that you can try:


Silk cocktail dresses
A bold red dress
Leather pants
Dark-wash, high waisted jeans
Fishnet tights
A fur coat;
, Femme Fatales typically have a signature scent, so you need to find the one that suits you the best. It shouldn’t be anything too fruity or girly, and should give off a sexy and seductive scent instead. Try something like sandalwood or lavender that will make men remember you everywhere you go. There’s no need to overdo it; just a tiny bit of the scent on your neck will make you even more appealing.


If you don’t like perfume, you can opt for a bit of scented lotion instead.

, There are a number of hairstyles that can help you get the femme fatale look you’re going for. You can wear your hair in an extreme side part with Veronica Lake-esque waves. Wearing it in a dramatically short style is also a good choice. Stick to true, bold hair colors, like platinum blonde, dark brown, black, or auburn, and you’ll be on your way to seducing any men who cross your path.


Try not to reveal your entire face. Letting your curls or waves fall over the side of your face can help you keep some of your features shrouded and mysterious.
An A-line cut can also give you a severe and mysterious look.

, To be a true femme fatale, you have to know how to wear red lipstick. Just apply the best lipstick that fits your skin tone, consider using some lip liner to emphasize your look, and check those lips every few hours to see if you need to reapply it. This is a signature part of the femme fatale’s look, so you should commit to it, even if you don’t want to wear too much other makeup.


Only reapply your lipstick in the bathroom; don’t let people see you doing it, or some of your mystery will be gone.

, To get the makeup of a femme fatale, wear pale foundation, give yourself a bit of blush for color, and work on getting that smoky-eyed look. Just put some dark eyeshadow, such as a brown or a gray, on your eyelids, use eyeliner to trace the top of your eyelids, and wear a black or dark mascara on your top lashes to emphasize those long lashes. If you want to make cat eyes for an added effect, that can make you look even more seductive.Avoid wearing glittery or shimmery makeup if you want to be a femme fatale. That may look too young and playful for the mysterious look you’re going for.
You can also play around with fake lashes for an added touch.

, The right accessories can go a long way if you want to be a femme fatale. You don’t have to overdo it, but you should find one or two signature items that you’re known for so you can rock the most seductive, mysterious look out there. Here are some accessories that you can try to complete your femme fatale look:


1940s sunglasses
A hat with a veil
Black gloves
Fedoras
Fur collars
A vintage compact for applying lipstick
Classic diamond or pearl earrings

, Don't let everybody know what you are feeling or what's going on. The very mystery proves to be the allure of the femme fatale. If you have to leave to go to your aunt’s birthday party, don’t say so; just say you have an urgent matter to attend to and lead people to wonder. If you get a text from your mom, don’t tell people who you’re talking to; the more you keep to yourself, the more you’ll leave to the imagination.


Make people work to learn things about you, such as whether or not you have siblings or what you’re studying. If you reveal too much, you won’t be mysterious.
Even if you’re having a bad day, don’t put all of your complaints out there. Learn to have an inner strength and a strong will, not letting people think that it’s easy to get under your skin. Keep things mysterious instead of detailing every little thing that went wrong for you today.

, Being well-educated is something that will set you apart from the flock. Being beautiful with brains adds sex appeal. Don’t ever be afraid to show off your brains or to let men see that they’re dealing with an interesting, intelligent woman who isn’t afraid to say what’s on her mind. Be proud of how hard you work, how much you read, and how well you do in school. Your intelligence will be yet another trait that makes men flock to you.


Don’t be afraid to challenge people. State your ideas and back them up with evidence. You’re smart enough to do it.
Don’t think that acting like a clueless girly girl will get you very far. Instead, make a point of showing everyone that you know what’s what.

, Femme fatales are famous for how sexy and seductive they are, but that doesn’t mean they have to put it all out there, either. In the words of the great Bette Davis, “I often think that a slightly exposed shoulder emerging from a long satin nightgown packs more sex than two naked bodies in bed.” You can show off a bit of your legs, wear low-cut tops, or show off your gorgeous back, but you should also make sure to leave something to the imagination.


Femme fatales don’t need to wear extra revealing clothes because their personalities and the way they carry themselves do that work for them. Acting in a way that is sexy, mysterious, and seductive will be what draws the men in.
Leaving something to the imagination is part of the mystery that will make men so attracted to you.
If you’re wearing a more revealing top, then wear a more conservative skirt with it, and vice versa.

, In the words of Katherine Hepburn, “If you always do what interests you, at least one person will be pleased.” If you want to be a true femme fatale, then you can’t let anyone else determine your self-worth or happiness. Work on doing the things you love and pursuing what makes you happy. Don’t give in to needy friends, overbearing men, or rude bosses. Make it clear that you’re looking out for #1 first and that everyone else can take a number.


Remind yourself that your self-value is what will draw the men to you. Don’t think that worshipping them will do the trick.
Though it’s good to care for other people, too, don’t ever stop taking care of yourself because you think someone else is more important.

, Femme fatales are more than just pretty faces. They have charming personalities that are endlessly fascinating. If you want to be a femme fatale, then you have to do your homework. You have to read the papers, be up to date on politics and pop culture, master another language, or just do whatever you can to make yourself an interesting person to talk to. The men will like more about you than just your mystery and your allure, and they’ll be drawn to how fascinating you are, too.


This doesn’t mean you have to talk too much or spout off all the facts you know. It does mean that you can be sharp, quick-witted, and make yourself stand out during a conversation as someone who knows the score.
Being fascinating isn’t just about having knowledge; it’s about knowing how to keep a person’s interest, and how to find something exciting to talk about. Every person is different, and you should be aware of what makes a person tick before you start talking.

, You don’t need to be dark and serious all the time if you want to be a femme fatale. You can learn to laugh at yourself and to have a quick wit and the ability to make clever banter to keep a conversation going. Some of the greatest femme fatales are known for their funny and incisive comments, such as Ingrid Bergman’s words, ““Happiness is good health and a bad memory.” Work on looking at the world through a clever lens, and don’t think that you have to be stone serious to be a femme fatale.


In fact, your sense of humor should be one of the things that makes you fascinating as a femme fatale. Make the most of it.
If a man says something funny to you, don’t just laugh and say, “That’s funny.” Instead, fire back with an equally funny comment.

, To be a true femme fatale, you have to depend on yourself and yourself only. Don’t spend your time pining away for men who you don’t really care about, or waiting for your friends to call you up so you can have a good time. You have to make your own fun in this world, and you have to be happy being on your own if you want to be a femme fatale. Work to have your own interests, whether it’s singing or belly dancing, and make sure you have plenty of time for personal growth and self-improvement. True femme fatales don’t need anyone else to be happy.


You can form meaningful relationships with people, but you should always make time for yourself. Even if you’re dating the man of your dreams, you can’t let yourself get too co-dependent.
You have to have your own goals and dreams, and not let anyone get in the way of them. Don’t let a man change your ideas about your career or what you’re capable of.

, Make your voice sound low and attractive, but not creepy. Work on speaking in a softer, lower, more seductive way. Don’t mumble, and make sure you articulate your words without sounding too formal. Avoid saying “um” or “uh” a lot and talk with conviction. A femme fatale doesn’t like to repeat herself. Work on sounding like you know what you’re talking about and letting those words out in the sexiest way possible.


Listen to Scarlett Johansson or Joan Crawford for an example of this kind of voice.

, You don’t need to go anywhere that doesn’t make you feel safe, but you should spend time in more interesting, less expected places. This is the best way to meet more interesting people, after all. Try an obscure, artsy coffee shop, a clandestine nightclub or speakeasy, or even a unique antique shop. Don’t make it obvious when you enter or exit a new place, and work on slinking in and out of rooms.


Pick places with darker lighting to help maintain your dark, mysterious image. It’s hard to be a femme fatale under fluorescent lights.
Don’t do the expected. You can find a place you like, but you don’t need to be a regular anywhere, or you’ll become a bit too predictable.

, Femme fatales made a name for themselves in the 1940s, so watching some films featuring these seductive ladies can help you get an idea of how to look and act. Mildred Pierce is a great starter. The film noir classics of the 40s can help you get inspiration, such as movies like Double Indemnity (1944), Naked City (1948) and Kiss of Death (1947).Watch as many as you can and learn.


You can also check out more modern femme fatales, such as Fiona Apple in the “Criminal” music video or Curve in “Chinese Burn.” But don’t let these images define you—each femme fatale puts her own spin on her image.

, Femme Fatales are known for having a signature drink that they order whenever they’re out. It doesn’t matter what it is, but it should be consistent and it should make people impressed by your decisiveness. It can be a glass of merlot, a Dark and Stormy, a whisky on the rocks, or even just a glass of iced tea with a sprig of mint in it. You have to order it with decisiveness and you shouldn’t waste time looking over a drink menu, either.


You can avoid overly girly or fruity drinks like a Cosmo, Sex on the Beach, or a Piña Colada, if you want to be taken seriously.
You may also want to avoid drinks that are known for getting people drunk as fast as possible, such as Margaritas.

, To be a true femme fatale, you should be a real lady to boot. Treat yourself and the people around you with respect, have dignified manners, and make sure you look pretty self-possessed and put together. A true lady doesn’t get too drunk in public, she doesn’t curse up a blue streak, and she doesn’t reveal too much personal information to someone she’s just met. Just carry yourself with dignity and poise and the rest will follow.


To be a true lady, you have to be proper within reason. You don’t have to be all buttoned up and demure, but you shouldn’t push people around, leave your trash everywhere, or burp without excusing yourself, either.
Stand tall with good posture. Ladies don’t tend to slouch or sit in an undignified way. Having good posture shows that you have confidence and poise.

, Femme fatales are known for their shrouds of mystery. You can open up to a man little by little, but you should make him work to get to know you. Don’t tell him every little thing there is to know about your childhood, your five favorite foods, or tell him every little detail of your school experience. Instead, reveal the information about yourself little by little, making a man feel like it’s a privilege to get to know you.


Take your time. When the opportunity presents itself, you can talk about growing up in Seattle or your love for archery. But don’t put it all out there all at once, or your element of mystery will fade away.
Make sure the man is telling you about himself, too. You don’t want to be the only one who is opening up.

, A femme fatale doesn’t sit at home crying because her man won’t call her back. She doesn’t get down on herself if a careless man makes a condescending comment to her. She doesn’t let anyone tell her who she is. You can have fun dating men, toying with them, seducing them, or even falling in love with them, but you can’t let them determine your self-worth. True femme fatales know that no one can get rid of the power they posses.


True femme fatales have a healthy dose of confidence. Work on loving the person who you are and accepting the things you can’t change about yourself. If you’re uncertain about who you are, then it’ll be easier for a man to get you down.
If a guy hurt your feelings, take some time to let your emotions out, talk about it to a friend, and then work on moving on. Don’t be in denial about how you feel and let it keep you from fully recovering. Once you deal with your feelings, you can kick those feelings of pain and inadequacy to the curb.

Opt for a bold and bright coloured coat.,
Consider the lining.",How to Choose a Stylish Raincoat2," Raincoats come in a variety of different and stylish colours. For instance, you may want to choose a neutral tone such as khaki, beige, or black. These colours are timeless and will look nice with a variety of different outfits.

Consider a detachable hood, so that you can change the style and look of your raincoat depending on the severity of the weather., You can add style to your raincoat by selecting jackets with additional buttons and belts. For example, a traditional trench coat style rain jacket is double breasted and features ten buttons on the front.

Then, pick up cheaper eyeshadow, lip gloss/lipstick, blush, etc. on your next drugstore run.

, Make sure to invest in quality hair care products. While paying $20 for shampoo may seem outlandish, if you have difficult hair it will make all the difference. Quality shampoo and conditioner can help compensate for hard water or previous poor treatment of hair. (If you haven't cut your hair in the past two months, it's time to visit the salon!) Depending on your facial structure, you will require a different hairstyle.

Spend your money wisely.",How to Dress Well," If clothes fit poorly, no matter how attractive or fashionable you will not look well-dressed. Tight clothes look cheap and make you look heavy. Clothes that are too large will make you look sloppy.


Just because you can get into the clothing does not mean it necessarily fits properly.
How an item is supposed to fit depends also on styling. For instance, urban style clothing for men in the United States are often very loose fitting compared to a pair of conservative khakis.
Dresses can be difficult to fit properly because most women wear different sizes in tops and bottoms. Dress fit well if the neckline lies flat whether you are sitting or standing, All seams should lay flat and straight (unless perhaps the styling is purposefully not in that way). The material shouldn't pull or pucker around the chest or hips. The garment should fit snug but not tight.If you’ve gained or lost weight recently, evaluate your wardrobe. Discard or alter clothes that no longer fit correctly.;
,


Apple-shaped women carry weight around their middles. These women look best in A-line dresses and clothing that emphasize the bust and legs while de-emphasizing the waist.
Pear-shaped women are smaller on top and larger in the hips and thighs. They look best in A-line dresses, layered tops, and simple, darker-colored bottoms.
Banana-shaped women are slim all over. These women look good in most clothing. They can highlight their shape by wearing clothes that create curves: Flared pants, cinched waistlines, and tapered jackets accomplish this feat.
Hourglass-shaped women have slim waists and full hips and breasts. They look great in tailored pieces and wrap dresses.

, Look at the veins inside your wrist. Do they look green or more blue?If they look green, you have a skin tone with a yellow base. Warm colors will look better on you. Try off-white, red, yellow, orange, and brown, as well as yellow-tinted greens and blues. Avoid pastels.
If they look blue, you have a skin tone with a pink base. Cooler colors will look better on you. Try white, pastels, and jewel tones.
When in doubt, stick to mostly neutral colors. Black, gray, and brown look fabulous on nearly everyone. Add pops of brighter color here and there – a bright blue necklace or a deep red belt, for example – to make outfits look interesting.

, Many women have areas that they do not really like to show off--even fashion models have this issue! Also, if you are following a modest dress code or prefer to do so, buy items that do not bring focus to areas that you would rather not. For example, if you are uncomfortable showing your legs, avoid buying mini-skirts.

, Dress your body in attractive, flattering clothes that work for your figure. Sometimes today's trends will do this, and sometimes it is wiser to not do so. Forcing yourself into certain colors, cuts, and styles because the fashion magazines are featuring them will not make you well dressed. Wear what suits you best.


But be willing to experiment! You may be surprised by how a new style may flatter your appearance.
Be careful about taking fashion magazines at face value. Very often, they are trying to ""sell"" you on certain styles, brands, and so on more than they are actually reporting on what is fashion.
Fashion can also be very regional. What is in style in Taiwan may or may not be what is cool in Brazil.

, Your efforts to look good will be undermined by uncomfortable shoes that make you teeter around in pain or constrictive clothes that you’re constantly shifting and adjusting. Wear clothes that make you look and feel sublime.

, Always read labels and follow the instructions for laundering clothes properly – this will make your clothes look good for a long time.


Iron your clothes if necessary. No one looks well-dressed in wrinkled clothes.

, Indulge your own special, personal style.If you’re a girly girl, feel free to wear dresses every day. If you are more of a tomboy, choose jeans. If you are preppy, dress that way. If you like bohemian, dress that way. Authenticity is attractive.

, When you have a sense of what looks best on you, you can enhance your look with fun choices that express your individuality.


If you like bright colors, wear them! Wear your charcoal skirt and cream-colored top that looks fabulous and work-appropriate, and add red kitten heels or a multi-colored bracelet.
If you like bold jewelry, wear something amazing every day! Big hoop earrings can add interest to jeans and a t-shirt. A statement necklace can quickly make a basic work outfit fabulous.

, The point isn’t to pick an image and emulate it. It’s to compare the tremendous variety that is available, and to discover inspiring looks. If you consistently like certain styles or colors, then you’ll know what to look for – you just need to adapt whatever you like to suit your figure and coloring.

, Having a repertoire of outfits that fit well and suit your style will serve you well. Develop a rotation of looks for work, for the weekend, for dressy events, and for anything else that you need regularly. Then you’ll be able to approach all these situations with confidence.

, Women who dress too old or too young look inappropriate. Whatever you age, embrace it! Instead of aiming to look older or younger, aim to look like the most fabulous you.

, Don't mix all kinds of crazy patterns and colors into a single outfit. But remember, it’s fine to try something new and different. The key to dressing well is to wear your clothes with confidence.


Try, for example, combining neutral colors with one animal-print item -- something like a bright leopard-print blouse under a black cardigan.
Alternatively, you can try wearing a risky-seeming, fashion-forward item, but keeping the rest of your look comparatively understated. If you're in love with the enormous shoulder pads you saw featured at fashion week, try them! Just pair them with something slim and neutral on the bottom, and stay away from bold accessories., Toss anything that doesn’t fit, clothing you haven’t worn in two years, and anything else that’s in poor condition. Doing so will free up space for new, more functional pieces.


Don’t toss those clothes into a dumpster. Donate them to charity or give them to friends or relatives. If they are in decent condition, consider trying to sell them.

, After you’ve gotten rid of the junk, evaluate your wardrobe clearly and identify what’s missing. Your needs will depend on your individual lifestyle, but in general, you want to make sure you have:


blouses and casual shirts
button-down shirts
pull-over sweaters
pants – at least one pair of jeans and at least one pair of trousers
casual dresses
casual skirts
a jacket for cool weather (and one for even colder weather, if you live where it gets cold)
at least one or two semi-formal or formal dresses
shoes – at least one pair for workouts and one or two each for casual, business, and dressy outfits

, Once you know what you need, it’s time to shop! But don’t just rush to the mall. You'll save time if you research some popular online stores first. If you don’t see what you like, move on – save time by shopping at stores that fit your lifestyle.

, It’s tempting to simply order clothes online, but you’ll have better luck if you head out to the stores that seem promising and try clothes on. Sizes vary considerably from retailer to retailer, and it’s hard to know what will flatter you without seeing a garment on your body.

, If your budget is smaller, start browsing at lower-priced retailers. There’s no reason to spend too much – as long as a garment is well made and fits properly, you will look fantastic. That said, you don’t necessarily want the cheapest clothing available. If it wears out after two weeks or falls apart in the washing machine, it’s no bargain.Do some additional research online and try to hit stores when they are having sales. This can allow you to pick up higher-end items for bargain-basement prices.
Invest in a few key pieces that you will get a lot of mileage from – like a sublime pencil skirt for work or a classic black dress. Spend less on trendier items that you won’t wear for long.
Don’t be afraid to comparison shop. Before you buy something, see if an online retailer has the same item for a lower price.

Choose the right sort of suspenders.,
Fasten the suspenders to the back of your trousers.Attach the back of your suspenders to the fabric of your trousers, centering the straps around the center of your trousers.,
Put your trousers on.,
Skip the belt.,
Cross the suspenders over your back.,
Bring the suspenders straight down over your chest.Regardless of the style, your suspenders should fall directly over your chest in two straight, vertical lines.,
Attach the suspenders to the front of your trousers.,
Keep them under your jacket to keep things classy.When wearing your suspenders for work or a special occasion, it is best to keep them neatly tucked away beneath a suit jacket or suit vest.,
Wear seersucker suspenders over a collared shirt.,
Give your look a punk twist with skinny suspenders.Skinny, colored suspenders worn with jeans and sneakers has appeal in the punk and hipster crowds.,
Go for old-fashioned charm.,
Wear suspenders with dress pants.Even for women, the most obvious way to wear suspenders is to wear them with dress trousers and a button-down shirt.,
Mix things up with jeans.,
Try your suspenders with shorts.,
Opt for a skirt.,
Remember to wear girly accessories.",How to Put on Suspenders," The general consensus is that suspenders with button fasteners are best for professional settings and style, but you can either opt for y-back or x-back styles.Y-back suspenders form a ""y"" on your back and x-back suspenders form an ""x."" Typically, x-back suspenders provide better support because they can be spaced wider apart, but both styles can be adjusted so that the straps hold your trousers up and do not slip off the shoulders.
You can also get suspenders with metal clips or metal clamps. These are generally considered less professional and less classy. Moreover, they can also damage the fabric of your trousers over time. If your trousers do not have button holes for suspenders, however, you may want to resort to one of these styles.;
,


The junction of y-back suspenders should be above the back center of your trousers. Similarly, the intersection of x-back suspenders should also be above the back center of your trousers.
For y-back suspenders, the fasteners should be attached to your trousers directly above the first two inner belt loops.
For x-back suspenders, the fasteners can either be placed above the two innermost belt loops or further apart so that they span about 1/3 of the distance across the back of your trousers. Anchoring the suspenders further apart will provide better support.
Attaching your suspenders to your trousers before you put your trousers on will make it easier to put the suspenders on.

, Pull your pants up so that they come as high as possible.


Note that high-waisted trousers are typically considered best for suspenders. Low-waisted pants are designed to work with a belt and offer less support for your stomach. High-waisted trousers are often designed for use with suspenders.

, Suspenders make a belt unnecessary, so wearing one will be overkill.


Additionally, wearing a belt with suspenders is also considered a fashion faux pas.

, X-back suspenders will criss-cross over your back while y-back suspenders will come straight up the middle before splitting off and coming over your shoulders.


The intersection of your x-back suspenders should be at the middle of your back or just below it. Adjust your straps if this is not the case.
The junction of your y-back suspenders should fall just above the middle of your back. Having it too low will cause the suspenders to slip off your shoulders. Adjust the straps if necessary.

,


The front ends of your suspenders will likely be spaced further apart than the ends attached to the back.

, Button or clasp your suspenders to the front of your trousers. Make sure that the straps are spaced evenly apart from the center of your trousers.


Make any final adjustments as needed. The suspenders should feel secure yet comfortable.

,


Suspenders used to be thought of as underwear, and the rule was that only you and your significant other should ever see them. While that limit has been lifted in contemporary times, you still need to keep them hidden for business meetings and formal events.
A suit, complete with a suit jacket, suit pants, and button-down shirt, is standard for this look. A suit vest is optional, however. Wearing a vest adds more class to your look for special occasions, but vests might be too formal for a simple trip to the office. Standard dress loafers are also recommended.

, For a look that is more relaxed yet still structured, wear patterned or colored suspenders without a suit jacket.


Seersucker suspenders are a type of printed suspender. Striped patterns are the most common, but solid colors and other small prints can also be used.
You can wear this look with linen suit pants or khaki trousers. Both can be used to create a semi-professional appearance.
A collared button-down shirt is still preferable for this style, but for a modern and casual twist, you can slip a fitted sweater over the shirt and beneath your suspenders. Go for a neutral color, like brown or black, or a deep color like burgundy or navy blue.
Stick with dress loafers. Since this look is still meant to appear somewhat business-like, brown or black dress loafers are the way to go.

,


This style is actually a reference to the skinhead subculture that surfaced among working class youths in London during the 1960s.
Rugged, durable pants like jeans or corduroy trousers are better for this look since it is inspired by the working class rather than the business class.
Be somewhat slack with your shirt. A tucked-in, button-down shirt is still the classic way to go, but consider leaving the top few buttons undone or rolling up the sleeves. You can also experiment with flannel print and solid colors alike.
Keep your shoes fairly durable. Opt for sneakers or boots over loafers.

, Wear rugged suspenders with leather tipping alongside tweed trousers, a button-down shirt, and old-world accessories.You can either go with leather-tipped suspenders or suspenders made completely from leather.
Tweed trousers have the most old-fashioned appearance, but you could update the look slightly by wearing the suspenders with dark jeans.
Complete the look with a driving cap, bow tie, and trench coat. Stick with leather loafers or leather dress boots.

,


This is a somewhat playful professional look since suspenders are not part of standard business attire for women.
A suit jacket is not necessary, but closed-toe dress heels or loafers are recommended.
Your button-down shirt can be simple with clean-cut lines, or it can be a little feminine with details like ruffles or patterns. If you wear a patterned shirt, however, make sure that you do not have patterned suspenders that could clash.

, Attach your suspenders to a pair of rugged jeans and slip a t-shirt or tank top on underneath.


This is definitely a casual look rather than a professional look.
You can wear sneakers, loafers, or flats with this style, but heels and sandals may look out of place. The idea is to go for a somewhat tough, rugged look, and your footwear will help create the right ambiance.

, Attach suspenders to high-waisted or nautical shorts. Slip on a comfortable t-shirt or tank top beneath the suspenders.


If you have nautical shorts, consider wearing something like a red striped tank with them. Any casual, somewhat fitted tank top or t-shirt will usually work, though.
Have fun with your footwear. While this look is still meant to be casual, it is slightly more girly than the suspenders-and-jeans ensemble. As a result, you can look for something like a wedge heel, a fun sandal, or an embellished flat.

, The most feminine way to wear suspenders is with a skirt. Wear a nice t-shirt beneath and keep the outfit looking fairly simple.


Consider matching the suspender color to the skirt color to mimic the jumper look. This style adds girlish, innocent charm to your ensemble.
Avoid letting your outfit look too busy. At most, go for a single pattern and two solid colors.
Wear simple yet cute footwear. Flat sandals or kitten-heel sandals work well, as do decorative flats.

, Since suspenders are traditionally considered menswear, accessorize any outfit with feminine details.


Think along the lines of dangling earrings, delicate necklaces, cocktail rings, and bangle bracelets.
The use of feminine jewelry with masculine suspenders creates appealing, fashion-forward contrast.

Decide what you mean by ""conservative.""",How to Be a Conservative Girl1," Conservative is defined as ""Favoring traditional views and values; tending to oppose change; traditional or restrained in style; moderate, cautious.""


""Conservative"" can apply to a girl's looks, lifestyle choices or political views.
You can be a conservative girl in any of those ways alone, or all together. It's your choice.

Have a good understanding of what leather is.,
Use a microfiber towel to apply a leather conditioner o your leather jacket.,
Rub in the leather conditioner deep into the jacket with firm strokes of the towel for the best results.,
Once the entire jacket has been coated with the conditioner, crumple up the jacket with your hands.,
Once you have done this, repeat the process with another layer of conditioner.

,
Take a blow dyer and put it on medium heat.,
Once this is complete, use another microfiber towel devoid of any conditioner and give the leather jacket a good rub down again.",How to Make Your Leather Jacket Softer," Leather is skin from an animal, and has many of the same properties as human skin. When you have dry skin, you add lotion to it and it softens your skin; the same is true on a leather jacket.;
, The conditioners are easily available in the market. While making the leather jacket pliable and soft they also help to protect and moisturize it!

, The more moisturized the jacket, the better the outcome!

, Crush the leather all the way from the shoulders to the cuffs. This ensures that the conditioner is well settled into even the tiniest nooks and crevices of the jacket thus yielding the best results.

,, Don’t choose blow dryers that do not let you adjust the heat as it may lead to negative results due to over or under heating. We only need to warm the jacket as this will help to both soak up and seal in the conditioner into the jacket. While blow drying the jacket, make sure that you keep the blow dryer at least 6 inches (15.2 cm) away from the jacket and keep moving the dryer around without focusing on one spot for too long!

, This will help give it a nice shine.

Get the right clothes.,
Choose appropriate accessories.,
Pick a classic hairstyle.,
Keep your makeup simple and understated.",How to Be a Conservative Girl2," Choose well-tailored clothes that flatter your figure, and are not too revealing or flashy.


Begin building your wardrobe around neutral colors (black, white, grey, brown, navy), and add color as an accent.
Basic pieces like button-up shirts, shirtdresses, nice slacks, blazers and sweaters are good pieces to start with.
You can still be fashionable, but steer clear of items that are too tight, short or low-cut.
Little things make a difference, like buttoning just one more button on your shirt, or layering a cami under a sweater that is a little too clingy.
Don't wear tops with low necklines as to show cleavage, it is important not to show too much skin. Or if you are wearing a collared shirt, consider doing up all of the buttons. This has an effect on the rest of your outfit as well, making you appear more prim, proper, sensible and conservative (the desired effect!).;
, Keep jewelry and other accessories modest, tasteful and classic.


Pearl strands, diamond or CZ studs, and tennis bracelets are all examples of classic jewelry.
A pretty print scarf, a glittery brooch or a single statement necklace are easy ways to add a bit of color and style while remaining tasteful.

, Conservative girls keep their hair well maintained but basic.


Basic hairstyles are best. A bob or a cut with soft layers are both solid choices. A neat bun or ponytail are also good options.
It's fine to color your hair, but stick to natural hair colors. You won't find too many conservative girls with green streaks in their hair.
Whatever style you choose, keeping your hair neat is key.

, Stick with neutral, natural looking colors.


Apply makeup with a light hand. Too much makeup can look fake and cheap.
If you like to use bright makeup, choose one part of your face to highlight and keep the rest understated. A really red lipstick would call for more subtle eye makeup; if you love a bright eyeshadow, choose a neutral lip color or just opt for a colorless gloss.
A tasteful tattoo is OK, but you might want to get it in an area you can easily cover up with clothing.

Embrace the lifestyle.,
Respect yourself and your body.,
Respect others.,
Have fun dating, but be prudent.,
Listen to more mature, clean cut, music.,
Take a smart, prudent approach to money and finances.",How to Be a Conservative Girl3," A girl who chooses a conservative lifestyle is reserved, prudent, careful and polite. She might seem a bit old-fashioned, but above all, she respects herself and others.

, Conservative girls respect themselves, their bodies and their health. They take good care of themselves.


Make sure you get enough sleep, eat healthy foods and get some regular exercise.
Visit your doctor and dentist regularly for checkups.
Don't use alcohol or other substances to excess; better yet, don't use them at all.

, Conservative girls use good manners, practice good etiquette, and are always very polite.


Don't interrupt when others are speaking. Wait your turn to talk.
Say ""please,"" ""thank you,"" and ""excuse me.""
Refer to people as ""Mr."" or ""Ms."" unless they tell you to use their first name.
Be helpful whenever you can. Hold doors open for others (yes, females can do this just as well as males), or give your seat on the bus to an older person who is standing.

, Conservative girls can have a great dating and love life, while still maintaining some reserve.


Let guys approach you. Avoid being overly flirtatious or throwing yourself at a potential date.
You don't necessarily have to wait until marriage to have sex, but try to wait as long as possible to have sex with someone you're dating. (This is another way to respect yourself!)
Don't brag about your conquests. A conservative girl doesn't kiss and tell.
Focus more on the personality, interests, and values when looking for a date; not just on physical or sexual attraction.

, Although you can enjoy any type of music, conservative tends to stick to country music, Christian and Gospel music, adult contemporary (think like Mariah Carey and Michael Buble), oldies/classic rock, and the current Top 40 hits. Rap, alternative, and some forms of rock music (unless it is Kid Rock or something similar) is out of the picture. Classical and jazz music could be enjoyed by conservative girls, especially if it is worship/religious music., A girl who is conservative will generally be very careful with her money. She recognizes that it's important to be financially prepared for the future.


Make a budget and stick to it. Always include some money for savings in your budget.
Avoid getting into debt. If you are in debt, make a plan for paying it off.
Make prudent investments. You don't want to lose the money you've saved up. Thoroughly investigate any investment opportunity before signing on.

Know what it means to be politically conservative.,
Know the difference between political and social conservatism.,
Educate yourself on political parties.",How to Be a Conservative Girl4," If you want to identify with a conservative political stance, you have to know what it means. Political conservatives commonly believe in:


Economic liberty, lower taxes and a free market economy
A small government and individual rights of citizens
An ""original intent"" approach to Constitutional law

A strong national defense system

, Many political conservatives also believe in traditional social values. These may include:


An emphasis on faith, family and religion
Belief in traditional marriage and other family values
Belief that abortion should be severely restricted.

, You don't have to join or affiliate with a political party, but learning about them is a good starting place.


Read the platforms of conservative-leaning political groups. Most conservatives identify with the Republican Party.
Also read up on the Tea Party and Libertarian Party.
Decide which, if any, resonates with you.

Take the Measurement: Measure your head for kippah by wrapping a tape around in the place the kippah will end.
,
Select the cloth for kippah: Traditionally, Jewish people use black color for kippah, but you can choose any of your favourite color as per your choice.,
Give a Circular shape: After choosing the cloth and measuring the head size, with the help of a compass or a bowl mark a circular shape on your cloth and cut the cloth as per the size of the head of wearer with the help of scissors.,
Measure the Radius: Mark a straight line and cut from the edge of the cloth to the center forming the radius of the cloth.,
Stitch the cut together: Start from the edge to the centre and stitch the cut together till the middle of the overlap.,
Fix the edges: In order to fix the edges, simply fold the rim around 5 mm and sew it all around.,
Decorate your kippah as you like.",How to Make a Kippa,", When choosing the material of the cloth you can use velvet, suede or hand crocheted cloths, once again the choice is yours, depending on the one you want to use for your kippah.,, Pull the cloth together forming a cone like shape giving an inch of overlap. You may also cut another line to the centre, 2 inches (5.1 cm) apart from the other cut making it look like a pie without a slice., You can easily do this by running it on your sewing machine or simply by hands. If you do not wish to use a needle and thread, you can also use adhesive., For this you can use sewing machine but it is not difficult by hand as well. You can use the same color tape for a solid colour look, or a different colour to create a different style., With these simple steps you can make a nice looking kippah that you can either gift to your friends or for your own use."

Make sure that your suit fits.,
Dress for your body type.,
Wear the suit properly.,
Choose the right accessories for the occasion.,
Choose comfortable, yet stylish shoes.,
Have your suit pressed or steamed.,
Be well-groomed.",How to Look Good in a Suit," These are some important elements to note when you purchase a suit:


Your suit jacket should fit well and give you a full range of motion, both buttoned and unbuttoned.
You should be able to fit one finger between the collar of your shirt and your neck, but no more than that.
The shirt cuffs should not slide up when you stretch your arms. If you are wearing a button-cuff shirt, the cuffs should break exactly at the wrist; if it's a French-cuff shirt, the cuffs should break about 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) further.
Your vest should button comfortably and hit just below the waistband of your pants.;
, If you're a shorter person, stick to single-breasted jackets. Double-breasted jackets can give you a ""drowning-in-fabric"" look and make you appear smaller. If you're bigger around the middle, wear a lower-buttoning jacket rather than one with a higher placket. It will give you a longer silhouette.

, Button all of the buttons on your dress shirt. If you are wearing a button-cuff shirt, remember to button those buttons — don't forget the small one on the placket!


For two-button jackets, button the top button only.
For three-button jackets, button the middle button, and the top button .
Or, don't button any of the buttons on your jacket at all; this is also acceptable. However, you should NEVER button the bottom-most button on any jacket unless at a funeral.

, With a black tuxedo, try a silver necktie, or one with a subtle stripe or weave. White ties are ultra-formal. Black ties are formal. Colored ties can fit a wide range of occasions — just make sure that it doesn't take away the focus from your overall suit. Wear a matching belt — black is usually a good color for everything, except for khaki-toned suits, which should be worn with brown belts. Your belt buckle should match any other accessories that you are wearing, such as a watch. If you are wearing a watch, and your sleeve is above it, consider that your sleeves are too short. Other accessories to consider are cuff-links and a stud set. Save your necklaces for when you are wearing a tee as they are inappropriate with a suit.

, The whole idea is to make sure they match the rest of the suit and don't cause any unwanted pain during the day (or night). Besides, you don't look good when you are wincing in pain or constantly adjusting your shoes. Your shoes should match the belt color.

, This is an obvious step, especially for important occasions. This ensures that you're clean-looking and not rumpled.

, Perform all the small hygiene tasks that are not usually done every day. Remove earwax, clip your nails, remove your unibrow, and take care of any nasal or ear hair. Since your face is the first thing people notice when they meet you, make sure it is in top shape. This does not mean you have to shave off all your facial hair. If you have a mustache or goatee, make sure it is well defined, and that you keep unwanted hairs shaven off. Take a shower, brush, floss, and use mouthwash, and apply your favorite deodorant and cologne to your wrists and neck. Remember, less is more."

Learn a bit about vision, both in the daytime and at night, think about some things like silhouette, shine, texture.,
Go over how you usually/plan to be stealthy, do you crawl around a lot or do you run from cover to cover?,
Decide on tightness for your clothing; tighter clothes are usually quieter but silhouette you and make your form recognizable, baggier clothes are usually louder and more likely to snag and catch on snags, however they break up your form more and make it less recognizable.

,
Consider the social implications of your clothing if you plan on using a mixture of social and physical stealth.,
Decide on a color or pattern, be sure it matches your environments, or is versatile if you plan on moving into areas that look different.

,
Match.,
In terms of versatility you can choose from a few different options; multi-environmental patterns like ACU or Multi-Cam or a solid color.,
Pay attention to your footwear.,
Get the right headgear.",How to Know What to Wear for Stealthy Movement,";
, Take the environment into consideration as well.

,, You might have to compromise to arouse less suspicion in public places.

,, When choosing a pattern or color that matches your surroundings you should choose a pattern that matches well if one is available or a solid color that works well. Despite what many people think specialized hunting patterns are more effective than military ones, since they are designed for very precise types of environments.

,


Many people seem to knock wearing the color black for nighttime stealth. Black is not a ""blending"" color, nothing at night is truly black. However black is a versatile color in that it doesn't look out of place anywhere at night it must also be taken into considerations that many blending colors such dark red or navy blue will look unnatural and out of place when hit with a light which may occur. Black can also be used to create silhouettes at a distance, maybe an extra fence post or a rock.

, Footwear should be a compromise between protection, support and noise. More protective footwear is usually louder and heavier while lighter footwear is often quieter.

, Headgear should distort the form of your head and maybe your shoulders but shouldn't restrict your vision.

Spend a few hours looking through and organising your closet; you'll get to see what you have and where any new pieces you really need would fit in––most likely you'll find a few gems you forgot you even had!

, Don't impulse buy, you're only wasting money on clothes you're never going to wear! If you go into a store and feel tempted to buy something don't hand over the money until you've had a good look in the mirror. If you're not 100 percent in love with an item, put it back. Don't listen to friends trying to tell you ""you look great in that!""––if you don't feel great in it, it's a waste of money!

, Think about how to recreate some of your favourite past looks. If you had a bob when you were 14 and loved it, why not bring it back?

, If you want to stand out from the crowd and have your own sense of style, then don't shop in the same shops as everyone else. Think about possibly designing or making your own clothing. There are lots of workshops and classes and it's a chance to make friends as well as making some pieces that you really love!

, Often the trends involve a revival of fashion from a previous decade, so if you love rocking a 20's flapper dress or a 60's beehive, then embrace it! It will give you the edge over everyone else and presents a chance to learn a bit about historical fashion.

, If you are unsure what you feel most comfortable wearing, or what best suits you, or even if you just like trying something new, then experiment! How else are your going to know how you like to look?

, From your elderly neighbour to your baby cousin, other people's style ideas can be fantastic influences, more personalized than those from the broad-sweeping fashion trends. Ask yourself these questions: Do I like what they're wearing? If yes/no, then why? Would I like to wear that? How best could I? Use the answers to help you develop your ongoing sense of style.

, Your money should not be spent on magazines if they make you feel unfashionable or frumpy. Rather, think of magazines as an idea of how some people may want to look, not what is normal or compulsory. They are also marketing vehicles, made to sell clothes; this should help you to realize that if you don't like a trend, it is never a personal reflection on your fashion taste.

, Often when too many people wear the same thing, it looks embarrassing and as though they can't think for themselves. Don't be a sheep.

, Pride yourself on knowing you have created your own style and are wearing what you like to wear and what isn't being worn by the masses.

, Don't compare it to anyone else's; unless, of course, you can reinterpret what they're wearing as you love it so much!

Ask yourself, ""Do I really need to use the zipper/buttons""?,
Know what parts of your back you can reach most easily.,
Be happy if the garment is a skirt, bra, or bikini top.,
Use a mirror.,
Zip a dress with a full zipper.,
Tackle buttons in the back.,
Tie a garment at the back with relative ease.",How to Dress and Undress Easily in Clothes with Back Zippers and Buttons," Some back closures must really be open for the garment to be donned or removed. Others are only there for aesthetic purposes or can remain closed on certain figures. Since this could be the case, test the garment to see if it can simply be slipped on.


If it is a blouse or dress, try pulling it over your head.

Most turtlenecks, mock turtlenecks, sweaters, and T-shirts with zippers in the back feature zippers to provide the option of pulling the garment over your head without damaging your hairstyle or are there to make the garment extra fashionable. Often, they can remain closed during the pullover if one so wishes.


If it is a skirt or slacks, and the waist is elastic, you may be able to just pull it on, either over your head (for skirts) or by stepping into it.
Even if a zipper must be open, perhaps it need not be open all the way. For example, on some dresses with full back zippers, the zipper need only be open a few inches to allow the head and arms through. On some tops, the zipper need only be open to allow the head through. On some garments with back buttons, only the top button needs to be open. This may vary depending on figure.
All this depends on figure and fabric. If a waistline is smaller than a bust and is not stretchy, the waistline must be open. For one who has a heavy waistline, it could possibly remain closed. Stretchy fabrics are more likely to be able to remain closed than the non-elastic.;
, This varies with each person. Almost everyone can reach the back of their neck and waist with no trouble. This makes it easy to zip a skirt, skort, or slacks, to button a single button on the back of a blouse, or tie a single tie on the back of a dresser bathing suit.


To know what else you can reach, place your dominant hand over your shoulder and your weaker arm behind your lower back. Try to get your two hands to reach. If they can, you can reach every part of your back a zipper would cover with no trouble whatsoever.

, If so, there is some really good news. You don't need to reach in back at all. The same is true for some other garments too, including some dresses and blouses.


For a skirt, simply put it on 'backwards' (closures in front), fasten, and rotate 180°. To be sure you have the zipper fully centered in back, check that the side seams are at your sides.
For bras, fasten before putting your arms in the straps, rotate, then place your arms in the straps (they are usually stretchy enough to allow this).
For bikini tops, do this, then you can tie easily at the back of the neck (see step 2), or tie in front then stretch over your head.
For a sleeved garment, such as a dress or blouse, you can do this if you are able to remove your arms from the sleeves while fully fastened. To do this, put on the garment backwards, zip or button all the way, remove your arms from the sleeves, rotate 180°, then place your arms back in the sleeves where they belong.
For a strapless dress, follow the instructions for a skirt.

, This allows you to see what you are doing better. The mirror allows you to see exactly where you are placing your hands behind your back and is useful when you're a beginner.

, Many dresses have zippers that must be zipped all the way down to don/remove. If a dress is non-elastic and has a fitted waist and/or bust, this will most likely be the case. If so, your method depends on the type of zipper. Examine the pull tab of the zipper to determine what the method will be.


If the pull tab has a hole in it, it is very easy to zip. There are two ways to do this. Either you can tie a string through it. Or you can use a hook-like object attached to a stick. Many common objects can fulfill this purpose, including those used for hanging pictures or a paper clip bent into the proper shape. Attach it to a stick-like object about 12-18"" and there you have it - a zipper tool. To zip up the garment, you can either place it in the zipper's hole before getting into the garment. Or you can probably reach the zipper while the garment is on you (see step 2). As for undressing, if the zipper pulls up to the neck, you can easily reach it as in step 2. If it is at a lower point near chest-level, you will probably have more trouble doing it this way, but you could probably reach it with your hand and zip it down yourself.

One option for zippers with holes is to attach a permanent pull strip that'll become a part of the garment. A 2-3"" piece of leather, suede, or a matching strong fabric is best. To do this, thread the strip through the hole in the zipper, then tie it in the middle once or twice. The strip will then just become another interesting part of the dress. Some dresses actually come with such a strip included.


If the pull tab has no hole, as in the invisible zipper that's been common in the 21st century, construct a tool as described above, but instead of a hook-like object, use a metal clip like the type found in an office supply store.
Many zippers come paired with hook-and-eye closures. Many women disregard fastening them, though if they are fastened, the appearance is more flattering. If the hook-and-eye closure is at the back of the neck, it should be pretty easy to fasten. Using a mirror as in step 4 could help. If it is in the middle of the chest, use two metal clip and stick devices as described in the above step, clip one on each side of the fabric, and push together until you get them linked.

, Buttons in back of a dress or blouse may seem more challenging than zippers. But they are not impossible, and they are more doable than you think.


A single button at neck-level is very easy, and is in fact quicker and easier than buttoning 6-7 buttons in the front of a classic button-down shirt. Wear enough of these tops and you will soon discover that. Ditto for 2-3 buttons near the top.
If the top has buttons going about halfway down the back from the neck, determine how many of those buttons really need to be open to get the garment on and off. If only some of them need to be open, you may just be able to reach them like in the above step. If not, you can pull up the back of the garment until the lower buttons reach neck level, then button/unbutton them.
If buttons run the full length of the back, it may sound tricky. But it is not hopeless. The good news is you can probably reach all but the middle buttons easily. The middle buttons may or may not be reachable by pulling up as in the above step. But they are probably below shoulder level. This means you can put the garment on backwards, button them in front, rotate the garment until the buttons are in back, place your arms in the sleeves, then button the rest. Try this a few times and you'll be a pro.
Many garments with buttons in back are roomy enough that you can put them on backwards (as in step 3), fasten the buttons, remove your arms from the sleeves, rotate 180°, then put your arms back in the sleeves where they belong.

, Some dresses and tops have a tie at the back of the waist that makes the waistline fitted and therefore must be open to don/remove the garment. Bikinis and even some one-piece bathing suits tie at the back of the neck and sometimes the back of the chest. If you can tie a shoe, you can tie something in back too, and it should be the last of your worries.


Step 4 (using a mirror) may be good advice here until you get the feel of what you are doing.
As mentioned above, for a bikini with a double tie, the tie in the back of the chest can be tied in front.
Untying should be as easy as pulling a string unless you end up with an accidental knot. To untie a knot, follow the advice in step 6 for removing your arms from the sleeves then rotating. This will bring the knot up front, allowing you to work on it.

Buy or bid for cheap and trendy clothes on eBay.,
Search for baby clothes on Craigslist.,
Try searching some online consignment stores.,
Find some good quality garage sales.,
Shop around in consignment stores.,
Look for off-season sales in popular baby stores.",How to Get Cheap and Trendy Baby Clothes," With its huge selection of new and name brand clothing, eBay is a great option for budget-conscious parents. Search for your desired size with a specific brand name to see what other sellers have listed, such as “girls 6 month Ralph Lauren”.


You can also type in the style of clothing you are looking for and the size, such as “2T maxi dress”. You can then sort by only new items, or expand your search to save on previously owned items.
Sellers can list all sorts of items on eBay, so be sure to read the entire description before purchasing so you are aware of the true condition and what is included.
eBay sales are either done via auction, in which case your price isn’t solidified until the auction period ends, or use a “buy now” price to buy the item outright right away.
Payment is reliably made through PayPal, and then items are shipped straight from the seller’s home.;
, Craigslist works in a similar way to eBay, by allowing users to sell just about anything. The difference with Craigslist is that each geographic area around the country has its own page on the site, meaning you can search for items just in your area and pick them up on your own.


Keep in mind that Craigslist is dependent on what users are selling at the moment and tends to have its up and downs with trendy baby clothes. Check the site often with certain key words, such as a specific size, style, or brand, to see what is for sale.
When you are interested, contact the seller through the site and make arrangements to meet for the sale. For your safety, bring a friend or meet in a public place. Craigslist users may be more opening to bartering than shopping at other places, so you may be able to grab a great bargain.
Craigslist can be the home of great deals, but is limiting because you are only open to items sold in your area.

, Virtual consignment stores follow the same general principles of traditional consignment stores, but allow you to shop from the comfort of your own home. There are a wide variety of online stores, but popular options are swap.com and mylittleclothesline.com.


At online consignment stores, users sell and mail their used baby items to a central warehouse where the company photographs and uploads each item with a price and description. Buyers can then search for their desired items and purchase, where they are sent from the central warehouse.
Online consignment stores have a variety of items available, and can be more convenient than traditional stores because you aren’t driving around looking for items.
Most online consignment stores only take items in very good condition and that follow the latest trends, so it may be easier to find what you are looking for than shopping at places that take all levels of clothing.
However, you end up having to pay shipping costs, which can mean the deals aren’t as great as they seem.

, Garage sales give people a chance to sell used items from the comfort of their own home, but they can be a little hit or miss. Do the research in your area to find the best days of the week for garage sales and the best neighborhoods to shop.


Search community boards and websites, as well as classified sites like Craigslist to see the garage sales happening this weekend. You can also search for garage sales that list that they are selling baby clothes. Some garage sale organizers will even list specific brands they have for sale.
While it isn’t a guarantee that these sales will be selling trendy clothes in good condition, garage sales are some of the best places to get incredible bargains. If you are willing to shop around and wade through piles of outdated clothes, you may be able to find some amazing deals.

, Consignment stores buy used clothing and resell it at incredibly discounted prices. Most consignment stores only take items that are in like-new condition, and many are partial to brand names or trendy baby clothing.


Do your research and ask around to find the right consignment store for your taste—some might cater to certain brands or ages.
Before planning your shopping trip, check for extra discounts, such as seasonal sales or additional reductions on certain days of the week. If you have used baby items to sell, many consignment stores offer more money for buying items if you get the money in store credit, which you can then use to get trendy baby clothes.
Consignment stores don’t have a guaranteed inventory, but do tend to more consistently have trendy clothes items. Most stores only stock items that are in season, so don’t try to buy a designer coat during the summer.

, Baby stores almost always have something on sale, and they tend to have their largest sales at the end of a season when they are trying to clear the store for new inventory. Shop these sales to buy trendy items for the following year.


For example, you can get great deals on summer clothes, swimsuits, and sandals at the end of summer and beginning of fall. Purchase them in the size your child will be the next summer for fantastic deals.
Combine these sales with membership perks for great deals. Many baby stores offer frequent shopper rewards, such as discounts after you’ve spent a certain amount of money, or access to member-exclusive coupons or sales.

Compare the most popular jacket styles.,
Get the perfect fit.,
Stick with black or brown.",How to Choose a Leather Jacket1," Bomber jackets, double riders (also called “Schott Perfecto”), and moto “racer” jackets are the most common, classic leather jacket styles. The best jacket style for you will be the one that matches your taste. Start by looking at variations of these three styles.


The double rider is considered a classic American leather jacket. While it varies between different manufacturers, it usually has an angled zipper across the front, wide lapels, and a flared collar.
Bomber jackets are waist length, casual, and have a soft inner lining. The lining usually extends to the collar, so it is fabric instead of leather. They typically have large pockets and are built for warmth and comfort.Moto “racer” jackets are the dressiest leather jackets, with a snug fit and a small or absent collar.;
, You want your leather jacket to fit snugly, but not so tight that you can’t move your arms. When trying on your jacket, be sure to wear the type of clothing that you will wear underneath it on a normal day—this will help you ensure that there is enough room inside the jacket. Hug yourself and lift your arms above your head to be sure that you are able to move comfortably without pulling the back of the jacket too much.


Armholes that are higher up on the jacket will give you a wider range of motion than lower armholes, which tend tend to pull on the body of the jacket when you move your arms.
Be sure to check the sleeve length of the jacket. You will want the sleeves of your jacket to stop just before or at your wrists. They shouldn't extend down over your hands.

, Of course, the color that you choose depends on your personal preference. Just keep in mind that black and brown are the most versatile colors, and they will hide imperfections and marks better than a colored jacket.


If you want to wear your leather jacket to dressy events, consider a moto ""racer"" jacket in black or brown.

Choose cowhide if you want a tough, durable jacket.,
Go with lambskin for a softer, smoother leather.,
Consider goatskin for a durable, soft, and flexible leather jacket.,
Get a suede jacket if you prefer a more velvety texture.",How to Choose a Leather Jacket2," Cowhide is one of the most common and most affordable types of leather used in leather jackets. It is very tough and stiff at first, but as you wear the jacket in, it will become softer and more supple. If you want a jacket that is durable and will provide maximum protection, go for a jacket made of cowhide.Cowhide is most often used for motorcycle jackets, due to its thickness and strength.Calfskin is a more expensive alternative to cowhide—it has the durability of cow skin but is much softer.
Pigskin and Bison skin have similar qualities to cowhide. Both are very durable. Bison skin has a large, deep grain pattern., Lambskin is soft, supple, and lightweight, which means you can wear it year round. Lambskin jackets are more expensive than cowhide or horsehide. Buy a lambskin jacket if you are willing to spend a bit more money, and if you want a smoother, softer leather.


Lambskin is popular for being extremely lightweight and comfortable, but this also makes it less durable and more prone to tearing. Consider what type of activities you will be doing when you wear the jacket to help determine if lambskin is the best choice for you.

, Goatskin is slightly less buttery soft than lambskin, but is still soft and supple. Choose a goatskin jacket if you want a soft yet durable jacket with a slightly pebbled grain. Also, goatskin jackets are known for looking better as they become worn in over time.


Goatskin leather is used for the U.S. Navy’s G-1 jackets and the U.S. Air Force’s A-2 flight jackets., Suede is made from the underside of the animal’s hide, and is thinner and more delicate than leather. Suede jackets are typically made from goat or lamb suede—lamb is softer, and goat is more durable.


Keep in mind that, if you choose suede, you should never let it get wet. When it does, it dries extremely hard.

Look closely at the stitching.,
Pay attention to the lining.,
Look for heavy zippers that zip smoothly.,
Assess the grain.,
Avoid over corrected leather.",How to Choose a Leather Jacket3," You can tell a lot about the quality of the jacket by examining the stitching, both inside and outside. Are there loose ends on the thread? Does the thread look thin in areas? To help determine if the jacket is good quality, make sure to look for dense and even stitching throughout the jacket., Lower quality leather jackets will have a thin or cheap-feeling synthetic lining. This type of lining is more likely to rip and to be less breathable. Higher quality jackets will have two separate linings—one in the body, and another in the sleeves. The lining of the body should be a thick cotton or high-quality synthetic fabric, and the sleeves should have a soft, silky lining., Try zipping the jacket up and down a few times to see how it feels. A high quality zipper will zip up easily, and will feel relatively heavy. Look to see what brand the zipper is to help you determine the jacket’s quality. YKK is a common zipper brand that is quite cheap. More expensive jackets may use the zipper brand RiRi, or another custom zipper that feels heavy and sturdy., Different jackets are made from leathers with a different grain. If you want a breathable jacket that looks more natural, with natural markings of the animal and natural oils, go for full grain leather. If you want a thinner, more comfortable leather, choose naked top grain leather instead.


""Naked"" top grain is top grain leather that has not been sanded down and that still retains its natural grain.

, Corrected leathers are sanded down, and then coated with oils and dyes. These processes remove the original grain of the leather, and can often make it look fake, plasticky, and without character. Often, the leather is stamped with an artificial animal skin grain. If you want leather that looks more natural, stick with leather that is uncorrected or minimally corrected.


One thing to keep in mind is that all corrected leather is made from top grain, but not all top grain leather is corrected. For a more natural looking jacket, stick with either full grain or naked top grain leather.

Put the coat and cleaning compound into the cleaning drum for 20 minutes.,
Take the coat out.,
Remove the coat from the rotating shaker and lay it on a table.,
Use a fur glazing machine to polish the coat.,
Use a steam iron to press the lining of the coat.,
Look over the coat to make sure no damage was done.,
Hang the coat up and make sure it isn’t pressed between any material.",How to Clean and Glaze a Fur Coat," Examine the fur coat, looking for rips, tears, stains, or anything that can be further damaged during cleaning. Some damage may not be visible to the eye, so run your fingers along the edge of the lining, the collar, the armpits, the elbows and the shoulders. These are the parts that tear the most often and can be difficult to see. Check the pockets as well to make sure nothing is in there that can cause damage during cleaning.;
, Lay the fur coat down on the table with the lining out; then use a soft bristle brush on the lining and fur with petroleum based cleaning solution to remove dirt, residue, and stains.

, Brush all edges of the fur with a wired fur brush to try to remove any knotting or matting that has occurred from regular wear.

, Take a metal pan, use a measuring spoon pour six ounces of corn cob compound into the pan, then use your liquid measuring cup apply ⅓ of a cup of the fur cleaning conditioner to moisten the compound. Mix together thoroughly with your hands.

, Make sure you secure the door of the drum by sliding each lock into place and then turn it on for 20 minutes. After 20 minutes, the compound should be embedded into the fur.

, Once the compound is successfully embedded into the fur, remove the coat and put it into the rotating shaker. Again, make sure you secure the door of this shaker by sliding each lock into place. Leave it in for another 20 minutes; this will remove the excess solution from the fur.

, For this step, you will need an air compressor that releases at least 90 lbs psi air pressure. Use the air compressor to blow out the remaining cleaning compound that the rotating shaker couldn’t get off. This will also loosen up the hair for the glazing/polishing.

, For this step, you will need a fur glazing machine. Before beginning the process, the rotating cylinder needs to be heated up to approximately 300 degrees. Once the cylinder is heated, put the fur under the cylinder with the grain of the fur going in the same direction as the cylinder is spinning. Begin by having the cylinder roll over each part of the coat one section at a time. This step polishes, lifts, and grooms the hair to its natural state.

, The most effective way to do this is to turn the coat inside out so only the lining is showing, and to move the hose up and down the material. Make sure not to touch any fur with steam because it will ruin the pelt.

, Make sure the lining is intact and there is no damage in need of repair.

, This step is important because the fur needs to breathe after being cleaned. If the fur is laid down or hung up and mashed between two other materials, it would flatten the fur and cause knotting and matting.

Consider matching your tights or stockings to your shoes instead.,
Choose something sheer that matches your skin tone if your shoes and skirt/dress are both bright colors.Remember, not everything that is labeled ""nude,"" ""skin tone,"" or ""buff"" will match your legs.,
Avoid wearing white tights, especially with black shoes.",How to Choose Color Stockings or Tights1," Nude is a great option, but you should also pay attention to your personal skin tone. Just because the package says ""skin tone"" or ""natural,"" does not necessarily mean that it will match your skin tone. For example, if you have very pale skin, you don't want something that is tanned or dark; it will look fake against your complexion. Instead, you could try ivory or something labeled ""fair."", For example, if you have a black dress, then choose a pair of black tights or stockings. There is an exception to this rule, however; if your outfit is darker than the shoes you are wearing, choose nude-colored tights or stockings instead.The nude color should match the color of your legs, be it fair, neutral, Nubian, etc.

, For example, you are wearing black shoes, then you could wear black tights or stockings.You could also wear tights or stockings that are a little bit lighter than your shoes, but within reason. You don't want to wear white, opaque tights with black shoes.


If your shoes are darker than the skirt or dress you are wearing, then wear stockings that match your skin color instead.

Avoid wearing tights that are the exact, same color as your shoes.",How to Choose Color Stockings or Tights2," These include colors like eggplant, burgundy, navy, and hunter green. Avoid bright colors, like purple, red, blue, and green.For an even more slimming effect, go for opaque-colored tights or stockings., Bright colors don't necessarily have to be hot pink and neon green. They can be red, blue, and green.Consider opaque tights and stockings for this; they'll work better with dark-colored shoes than sheers. This will help blend your legs into your shoes and make them appear longer., For example, if you have a dark blue dress, you can pair it with forest green tights or plum-colored tights., If your outfit has a colorful print, you could choose a pair of tights that matches that color. For example, if you are wearing an ivory skirt with a purple, green, and brown pattern on it, you could wear plum, dark-green, or brown tights.

, In general, you'd want to match your tights to the hem of your skirt or dress, but you don't want them to be the same, exact color. For example, if you wear a dark blue dress blue dress with dark blue tights, your entire outfit will blend together too much, and lose all of its uniqueness. Instead, you could try a dark blue dress and grey or brown tights., When it comes to neutral colors, you want to try to match your tights and stockings to your shoes, but this is not the case when it comes to fun colors, such as plum, blue, green, and burgundy. Matching your tights to your shoes in this case will bring in too much of the same color, and make your outfit look less unique.Instead, you could try lighter green tights and darker green shoes.

For example, if you have mostly grey or brown skirts and dresses, choose tights or stockings in those colors., Certain colors just go better with certain occasions and locations than others. For example, bright red tights might not look very professional in an office-type setting, but they'd work great for a party or concert. On the other hand, black might be too severe for a casual picnic in the park, but they'd be appropriate for a grand evening at the opera.Nude-colored tights and stockings are suitable for all occasions.Remember to choose a color that matches your skin tone.

, There are no rules as to what you should and should not wear, but dark colors tend to look better when it's cold, and light colors tend to look better when it's warm. You'd probably want to avoid wearing dark colors during the hot summer month; they are too warm and absorb too much heat. In fact, you might want to skip wearing tights or stockings during the warmer months altogether!If you do choose or need to wear tights or stockings during the warmer months, choose something that is lighter in color, or something that is close to your skin tone.

, Many fun-colored tights contain patterns. This is a great way to add movement to your outfit and make it look more complete. You have to be careful, however; too many patterns can make your outfit look cluttered. Stay on the safe side, and choose a pattern that matches your outfit. Another option would be to pair patterned tights with a solid-colored outfit.For example, a pair of lacey black tights would look cute with an ivory, fit-and-flare dress and a thin, black belt.

Toner will help close your pores, while moisturizer will smooth out your skin and make it easier to apply foundation. It will also prevent your skin from drying out and flaking beneath your foundation.










When applying moisturizer, focus on areas that dry out the most, such as the forehead and cheeks.
It would be a good idea to use moisturizer even if you have oily skin. Choose a light-weight, gel-based formula meant for oily skin types.
If you have very dry skin, basic moisturizer may not be enough for you. Choose a rich, cream-based formula that is meant for dry skin.;
, While not essential, primer can really take your makeup to the next level. A little bit goes a long way, so you do not need a lot to cover your face. It helps reduce shine and fill in large pores or fine wrinkles, making it great for photoshoots and special events. Most formulas do not clog pores.

, Foundation comes in many different forms, including powder, liquid, and cream. Powder foundation (loose or pressed) is best for oily skin, while liquid or cream foundation is best for dry skin. Normal or combination skin can use any formula they want.In the end, however, you should choose whatever you feel most comfortable with.


Some foundations come in warm and cool shades. These shades relate to skin undertone, and can help you achieve an even closer match.
The thicker the formula, the more coverage it will have. For a lighter, more natural look, try BB cream instead.

, Start by dabbing or brushing it onto your nose, chin, and forehead. Next, blend it outward towards your jaw and hairline for a smooth, seamless finish. Use a foundation brush or sponge if you are using liquid or cream-based foundation, and a powder brush if you are using a powder-based foundation.









, It is not a required part of the daily makeup regime, but it can help you feel better if you feel insecure about things like pimples, birthmarks, and under-eyeshadows. Choose a shade that matches your skin tone for the most natural look.How you apply it will depend on what you plan on covering: 








To cover up under-eyeshadows: apply your concealer in an upside-down triangle shape, extending it all the way down to the tops of your cheeks. Gently blend it in using your ring finger or a blending sponge.
To cover up extra-dark under-eyeshadows, apply an orange or peach-toned concealer first, then apply your usual concealer on top.
To cover up pimples: use a dab of green concealer first to cancel the red tones, then your usual concealer on top of that. Apply it with a mini sponge applicator or brush, then blend it in with a clean mini-sponge applicator using tapping motions.

, This will not only help your makeup last longer, but it will also help reduce shine and give you a smoother finish. Setting spray can simply be sprayed on, while setting powder needs to be dusted on with a soft, fluffy, powder brush.










Only apply a light layer. The idea is to finish smoothing your complexion, not to create a mask of cosmetics.
If you accidentally used too much setting powder, use a clean powder brush to dust the excess off., Bronzer can be used on its own, without blush, or in conjunction with blush for a sun-kissed look. You can also skip the bronzer altogether, and move on straight to the blush. To get the most control over your bronzer, choose a brush with soft, short bristles. Be sure to blend it in well. If it is still too harsh, smooth it out with some translucent powder.If you choose to use blush alongside your blush, apply along the hairline/upper forehead area, into the hollows of your cheeks, and just under your jaw.If you choose to use bronzer instead of blush, apply it to the places that the sun would naturally hit: the tops of your cheeks, your forehead, the bridge of your nose, and your chin. Some people also like to dust some bronzer under their neck to brighten the area, especially if it looks grey., Like foundation, blush comes in many different formulas, including powder, cream, and gel








If you have fair skin, go for rosy pinks and peaches, and avoid anything too brownish.
If you have medium-toned skin, you can use most pinks and peaches. If you have a cooler skin tone, you could also use something mauve-toned.
If you have dark skin, try corals, oranges, berries, or rich bronzes. Stay away from blue or light-toned blushes, or your skin will look ashy.

, How you apply the blush depends on what formula you chose. Powder-based blushes should be applied with a powdered brush, while cream and gel-based formulas can be applied with your fingers. Blush should typically be applied at an angle, starting at the apply of your cheek and going up towards your temple. You can also use blush to contour or shape your face, however. For example:If you have a round face, and wish to slim it down: suck in your cheeks, then apply the blush to the hollows. Extend the blush up to your temples
If you have a heart-shaped face that you'd like to balance out: apply the blush just below the apples of your cheeks, then blend it towards your hairline.
If you have a long face that you'd like to soften, apply blush just below the apples of your cheeks and blend it in, but don't extend it towards your temples.

, This will help prevent your blush and/or bronzer from rubbing off or fading. It will also cover any areas that you might have missed earlier.

, Eyeshadow primers help even out your eyelids and make it easier to apply your eyeshadow. They can help your eyeshadow appear brighter and last longer. Apply the primer over the entire area between your eyebrow and upper lash line.









, The colors themselves don't matter, as long as you have a light shimmery shade, a light matte shade, a medium shade, and a dark shade.You can use the same color palette for a unified look, or contrasting colors for something more dramatic.


For a natural look, choose a neutral palette with lots of creams and browns.
For an evening look, consider something more elegant, such as silver or gold.
Don't be afraid to try other colors, such as green, blue, or brown.
To make your eyes stand out, choose colors that contrast it. For example, if you have brown eyes, choose blues, greens, or purples. If you have blue eyes, try copper or gold.

, Start along your lash line, and blend it up towards your eyebrow. This shade should be close to your skin tone—not too light and not too dark. It can be matte for a natural look, or shimmery for something more dramatic.


If you want to go super-simple, you can stop doing your eyeshadow right here. If you want to get fancier, then keep reading!

, Apply the shade with your eyeshadow brush first, then blend it in using a blending brush. Focus more on the outer part of your eye rather than the inner.

, This should be the darkest color from your chosen palette. For a smokier effect, extend some of the shadow to outer corner of your eye with a thin brush. Blend the shadow into the outer corner of your eye to create a < or > shape. Focus on the outer portion of your eye, and avoid extending it to the inner corners.


For a smoky look, apply some of your dark shade to your lower lashes.

, This should be the lightest color from your palette. White or a very pale color will work best for this. The lightness and the shimmer will help open up your eyes and make them look larger and brighter.

, Tilt your head back and lower your eyelid. Gaze into a mirror, and carefully run your eyeliner along your lash line. If you are having too much trouble, gently pull on the outer corner of your eye. Keep in mind that this is not recommended, because it puts too much strain on the fragile skin around you eyes, and could lead to wrinkles.








For daytime looks, use a slightly lighter and more natural shade of liner, like a gray or brown.
For a more natural look, use a pencil eyeliner, in brown or soft black. Smudge it slightly to soften any harsh lines.
For a dramatic look, try liquid liner in black. Consider adding a wingtip by extending the eyeliner just past the outer corner of your eye.

, Choose a mascara that lengthens and volumizes. Brush the mascara on starting from the base of your lashes. Work your way to the ends of your lashes using short, zigzag motions.










For a natural look, choose a dark brown or soft black mascara, and apply it only to the upper lash line. This creates a more subtle look.
To an evening look, apply some mascara to both your upper and lower lashes. Choose a mascara that lengthens and volumizes.

, Not only will this make your lips appear fuller, but it will also help make them appear smoother.If you want to go with a more natural look, you can stick with just tinted lip balm and call it a day. If you want to get more fancy, keep reading!


If your lips are really chapped, consider exfoliating them with a toothbrush or with a sugar lip scrub.

, You can choose whatever color you want, but make sure that they match. For a more natural look, consider something nude-colored or something that is one or two shades richer than your natural lip color; avoid anything too shimmery. For a more dramatic look, consider something bright and bold, such as red. Shimmery colors also work well for the dramatic look.


If you decided to go fancy/dramatic with your eyes, choose a neutral shade. This will prevent your lips from overpowering your eyes.

, Not only will this define your lips, but it will help keep your lipstick from bleeding.If you want to make your lips appear fuller, you can extend your lip liner just past your natural lip line; don't get carried away, however, or your lips will look fake!

, This step is often overlooked, but it is an important one. It helps make your lipstick last longer because it gives it something to stick to. It also makes the color richer. Lastly, it makes any fading less noticeable.









, You can apply the lipstick straight from the tube, but a lipstick brush will give your more control. Do not extend the lipstick past the lip liner.









, This will help make your lipstick last longer. Simply fold a tissue in half, and gently press your lips around it. Reapply your lipstick the same way as before, and then blot it once more.Check your teeth for any lipstick that might have smudged onto them. If you find any smudges, wipe them off with a tissue.

, This is not completely necessary, but it will make your life a lot easier—you also won't have to reapply or touch up your lipstick as often! Start by pulling a tissue apart so that you have a very thin tissue. Place the tissue over your lips, then gently tap your lips with setting powder; use a soft, fluffy powder brush to do this. Pull the tissue away when you are done, then discard it.

, This can help make your lips appear fuller. Instead of applying the lip gloss all over your lips, simply tap it onto the center of your lips where the light hits them.

, Koreans value clear, dewy skin, so set up an extensive skin care routine to make sure your skin is hydrated, clear, and free from oils, pimples, or any other blemishes.


Start by removing all makeup. Use an oil cleanser to clean your face thoroughly, then exfoliate with a natural scrub. Use a toner or refresher, an ampoule or essence to brighten your skin, and a sheet mask to hydrate your skin. Pat rather than rub eye cream around your eyes, apply a layer of moisturizer, and then add a night cream to help your skin refresh overnight., Many Korean girls wear their eyebrows straight and thick, so waxing your eyebrows will help achieve the look. In addition, shaping your eyebrows differently can affect the perception of your overall face, so it's important to choose a style that will enhance your face shape.Use your eyebrows as an easy way to make your face structure look more Korean.

, Use lotion and a primer base, which will help reduce the look of pores. Apply a foundation with SPF, such as a BB cream. Then add face powder to finish your base. Consider using an anti-sebum powder, which reduces oil on your face. This is a very commonly-used product in South Korea.

, Use any color you want, but a medium shade of brown will often look best. Use a darker shade near the eye and on the outside edge of your eyelash to create a 3D appearance.

, Add wings by extending it past the end of the eye on the outside and turning it slightly up, to give you almost a catlike look. Then extend your eyeliner on the inside of the eye no more than 3 mm, just below your tear duct. This will widen and flatten your eyes, which is one of the defining features of Korean makeup.


Apply teardrop eyeliner underneath your eyes to give them a sparkling look that is very Korean. Popular colors include: gold, white, and cream.







, Remember, this is just your basic makeup. Focus on different aspects of your makeup to achieve different effects. Pick aspects of your face that look most Korean to emphasize with your makeup, or focus on using your makeup to hide or change other areas.

Contacts can be expensive and, if you have never used them before, dangerous to put on, so make sure you're serious about contacts before you buy them. Learn how to use them before trying to put them on yourself.

, Despite common belief, there is no stereotypical ""Asian eye""--however, because double eyelids are generally seen as more desirable than monolids, it's become more and more popular to try to get double eyelids. In fact, it's one of the most popular cosmetic surgeries in South Korea. However, you can still achieve the look without surgery. There are many special glues or tapes available to create it.


As with all products, be careful when using tapes or glues for extended periods of time. They can damage your eyes and face if used continually, causing sagging eyelids or eye inflammation.
It isn't necessary to change your monolids if you have them, though, because many celebrities and many more average people choose to be happy with the way they look naturally. Some examples of monolid celebrities include: soloists Baek Ah Yeon and Boa, and Minah from Girl's Day.

, Achieve this look with eyeliner or dark eyeshadow carefully applied about half a centimeter below the bottom of your eye.

Avoid matte lip looks.,
Use gradient lips.","How to Do Korean ""K‐Pop"" Style Makeup4"," As mentioned before, having a dewy, moist look is essential for Korean beauty. Lip glosses and tints, rather than a drier lipstick, are the way to go. Although very natural makeup looks are the norm, many people wear bright red lip gloss/lip tint., This is a style first used on a Korean drama that has since grown hugely popular.Apply a bright pink color lipstick to the inside of your lips. Apply a little foundation to the outside of your lips. Blend the two products across your lips, so that they form a consistent gradient. Once you've gotten practice, try other colors like red, orange, peach, or brighter pinks. This is probably the most ubiquitous Korean beauty trend. Despite its popularity, it's sometimes considered a bit weird-looking to Westerners, so don't be surprised if you get confused glances.

Play down the rest of your makeup. Do only basic foundation and, if you contour, keep it minimal. Use a light amount of blush and lipstick to avoid an overwhelming look., To start, add primer to your eyes. This will make them brighter, calling attention to your reverse eyeliner. Dab a small amount of primer on your eyelids and use your fingers to gently blend it into your skin.Wash your hands before applying primer.

, Apply your eyeshadow as you normally would for an every day look. You do not want bold eyeshadow, like a smokey eye or bright colors. Stick to neutral shades, like browns or peaches, that compliment your natural skin tone or eye color. This way, your eyeshadow will not distract from your eyeliner., Take an eyeliner pencil in a dark shade like brown or black. Draw a line just underneath your lower lash line. Keep the line thin and keep it as close to your lash line as possible. Move from one end of the eye to the other.If your eyeliner pencil needs sharpening, do this before applying the eyeliner. This will allow you to make a distinct, clear line.
You do want to end up with a slightly thicker line for reverse eyeliner. Keeping it thin at first, however, is important as this will help you keep the line as close as possible to your lower lash line.

, When you're done, you want to use a smudge brush to gently smudge the line you drew. Use sidewards swiping motions to bring the line down slightly. You want to make it slightly thicker, as reverse eyeliner is somewhat dramatic.You can also blend the line closer into either corner of your eyes during this step.

, As you smudge your eyeliner, make a small wing pointed upward slightly at the outer corner of each eye. When you reach the outer corner of each line, make sideways swiping motions with your brush that direct the eyeliner out and upward to form a wing., You can use either liquid or pencil eyeliner. Gently trace over your line with a black eyeliner. This will further define it and make the reverse eyeliner look more apparent., You do not want too much eyeliner on top for a reverse eyeliner look. However, move the wing inward slightly onto your upper lash line. Draw a small line going a little into the outer corner of your upper lash line.If you want, you can also draw a small line going into the inner corner of your upper lash line. This makes your eyes look slightly more defined and dramatic.

, Take a black eyeliner pencil and look closely at the eyeliner you drew. If there are any obvious gaps, or places where the eyeliner is lighter, fill them in using your eyeliner pencil.If you want, you can fill in your waterline as well. This is optional, however.

, After doing your eyeliner, add a few coats of black mascara. This will really make your eyes pop, leaving you with a dramatic reverse eyeliner look.Avoid adding too much mascara and do not go for fake eyelashes. Remember, your reverse eyeliner should be the focus of your look.

Set up your studio.,
Obtain camera equipment.,
Create an outline.,
Obtain video editing software.,
Prepare your makeup.",How to Do a Makeup Tutorial1," A studio for creating tutorials will be very similar to a photography studio. Your studio can be a corner of a room or, if you have the extra space, you can dedicate an entire room to be your studio. Generally speaking, the smaller the space, the better. It will improve the sound quality if you are not using a microphone.Set up a backdrop if there is a lot of furniture or clutter in the background of your shot. This will make your tutorial look more professional. You can use a glittery or sparkly background for the holiday season and pastel colors for summer. Feel free to be creative with choosing your backdrop!
Make sure you have suitable lighting. A dark video is not useful to anyone, especially for something as detailed as applying makeup. Ring lights are a popular lighting tool for makeup artists and vloggers.;
, The best camera for creating makeup tutorials will be a high quality camera, such as a DSLR, which stands for digital single-lens reflex. Point-and-shoot cameras and camcorders lack image quality and features such as white balance, both of which are crucial for filming something as detailed as makeup.Purchase a tripod if you do not already have one. There are short tripods that will sit on a desk and there are tall ones that will stand several feet off the ground. Be sure to purchase a higher-quality tripod, since cheaper ones are flimsier and may not support the weight of your camera.
There are DSLR cameras that have a Vari-Angle LCD screen, which is a screen that folds out and can face you, so that you can make sure you are always in the viewer.
You can use a phone camera, such as the iPhone camera. It may not be as high-quality as a DSLR camera, but it will do the job and will allow you to make tutorials.

, It may be helpful to create an outline of your video beforehand so that you remember to do all of the things you intend to do in your tutorial. It can be easy to miss a step in the hustle and bustle of filming and it would be a pain to go back and record what you missed. Save yourself some time in the long run by creating an outline.


Create a transcript. If you plan to do voiceovers for your tutorial, it can be helpful to write your transcript beforehand. This can also help you stay on track during filming so that you are remembering to demonstrate every part you intend to talk about.

, Other than the camera and the video footage itself, the video editing software is the most important part of creating tutorials. There are usually awkward moments during filming that you may want to edit out, and you may also wish to add effects and interesting transitions. There are plenty of programs that are available for free and at a cost.


WeVideo is a free, relatively easy-to-use cloud-based editing software that allows you to store your video in the cloud rather than on your computer.VSDC is a free video editing software available for Windows. You can use this program to create videos that look professional., Before recording, prepare your makeup and clean your makeup brushes. It won’t do you any good to use dirty brushes, since it could cause an infection and could taint the colors that you are trying to demonstrate. Set out the makeup you intend to use on a table or desk near your filming setup.


Pick up a daily brush cleaner from a drug store or a makeup store. Sephora offers a great brush cleaner that dries quickly and moisturizes the bristles."

Lay out all of your makeup and supplies.,
Do a test video.,
Record voice and video separately.,
Upload the audio file to your computer.,
Demonstrate the steps carefully.",How to Do a Makeup Tutorial2," Have your supplies in front of you so that they are easily accessible during filming. Having your supplies within arm’s reach will save you time and prevent you from having to get up and dig around your home to find something you need. Make sure your makeup and brushes are ready to go before you start recording.

, Before launching into your tutorial, do a brief test video. It would be frustrating if you recorded an entire tutorial and part of your face was out of the frame! Make sure that the shot is exactly how you want it to be before you begin recording. This may take several attempts.

, If possible, record your voice and video separately so that you can add in and edit audio without altering your video. You can use your video editing software to combine your voice and video files into one seamless tutorial.


After your record your video, use a microphone to record your voiceovers, following what is laid out in your outline or transcript (if you made one). Microphones can be purchased online or at an electronics store. You will want to purchase a microphone that can plug into your computer and record the sound on your desktop, such as a USB microphone., When the audio recording is complete, upload it to your computer if it has not already been recorded using your computer. Then upload the file to your video editing software and edit it into your video. This varies from program to program but there should be a button or command to import sound files on just about every video editing software.

, While you are recording, be mindful of the viewers and make sure that you are clearly recording what you are doing. You may want to go a bit slower than you are used to, to allow viewers to see exactly how the techniques are carried out. Make sure that you are always in the viewfinder and that the camera is focusing on you. Makeup requires very small, precise movements at times. Make sure that these are very apparent to the viewers. There are many cameras available that come with an autofocus feature, which can be quite useful for recording tutorials.

Choose your clip speeds.,
Edit transitions.,
Add in effects.,
Upload the video.",How to Do a Makeup Tutorial3," There will be certain areas of the tutorial that you will want to speed up or slow down. For example, if you are blending out your eyeshadow, you may want to speed that portion of the video up, so that viewers aren’t watching you blend for more than ten seconds. This can be quite boring and repetitive for the viewer. Any clips that could be boring could be edited out or sped up, and any clips that show a great amount of detail or precise movements could be slowed down to benefit viewers.

, There are times when you don’t need to add in transitions between clips, such as when you are talking to the camera for a length of time and want to edit out small bits and pieces. For something like this, adding transitions would be overkill. If you are transitioning from one part of the video to another, such as the introduction to the makeup tutorial, you may want to add in a transition, which will help the viewer understand that you are moving into a different part of the video.


Most video editing softwares come with preset transitions. These can be fun to experiment with.
Transitions can be as creative or as simple as you would like them to be. Use them to have fun and create exciting effects in your videos or use a simple one to indicate that you are moving on to the next step with little fanfare. For example, you can use a transition that makes the current screen spin away, making way for the next scene. Or you can simply have current screen move to the left or right until it disappears from the screen before the next scene pops up.

, Many makeup artists and vloggers enjoy using effects in their videos, such as bright flashes or sparkles. This can be a fun and whimsical way to show off the finished product. Some vloggers also add in text, which can be done with the editing software. The text can be helpful tips or something that was missed.

, There are plenty of video streaming services available, such as Vimeo, but YouTube is a massively popular platform that will allow you to get plenty of views on your video. Log into your YouTube account to upload your video. Once you are logged in, you should be able click on “Upload” in the upper righthand corner. Follow the prompts and select your video. It may take a few minutes to finish uploading.

Set your budget.,
Choose a fur that matches your climate.,
Know your options.,
Consider your allergies.,
Decide on the style.,
Ask if the coat is made from full or partial skins.,
Try on the coats to see how they fit you.",How to Choose a Fur Coat1," Fur is an investment piece, especially if you’re buying new. Even an inexpensive new fur can cost thousands of dollars. If you don’t want to spend that much money, that doesn’t mean you can’t buy a fur coat. Vintage and faux furs are both readily available at lower price points.


Check online for good deals, but watch out for scams. If it’s too good to be true, don’t believe it.
Try to visit sample sales if you can. This is not an option for everyone, but they can be a great place to buy a fur if you’re able to attend one.;
, Fur is a great option for staying warm, but if you live in an area with mild winters, you may realize that your fur is too warm. You can find lighter coats made out minks or broadtails, but heavier coats made from foxes, raccoons, and coyotes may be too warm.Look for coats that are made to be lighter. Mink coats can still be warm. You may also find a lighter fur in another animal, such as rabbit.

, You can find furs made from many different animals, though minks, rabbits, foxes, raccoons, chinchillas, beavers, coyotes, and lambs are the most commonly thought of. Unless you’re looking for something that’s rare or exotic, most of your choices will be from one of these animals. Each one is different.


Mink fur is shorter, coarser, insulating, shiny, and easily colored.
Rabbit fur is fine, silky, affordable, and easily colored.
Fox fur is plush, thick, and soft. Most fox fur coats will be cognac or white-grey in color.
Raccoon fur is plush, thick, and soft like a fox, but it’s color is usually the ombre grey of a raccoon.
Chinchilla fur is very soft, but expensive and rare. It’s usually a grey or bluish color.Beaver coats can be long and luxurious or cropped and colored. The fur is very versatile.
Coyote fur is durable, short, and dense. The colors range from creamy tan to grey.
Lamb coats are available both is light textures such as the broadtail or in thicker, curlier textures that are very warm, such as the Mongolian lambs., Some furs like those of a fox or coyote can trigger allergies in people who are allergic to dogs since foxes and coyotes are part of the canine family. Additionally, you may find yourself sneezing around a fluffy rabbit coat. If your allergies are mild, you may be able to choose a short-haired coat instead, such as a nice mink.

, Coats come in various colors and lengths, so consider the look you want. Since furs are an investment piece, it’s important to know if you want a classic or trendy look.


Consider your coloring. Know what looks good on your skin tone. A coat that makes your best friend look like a screen queen could make you look washed-out.
Decide if you’d prefer a natural or dyed color.
Know the length you want. If you plan to wear your coat to work, you may want a shorter length; however, if you plan to wear it as eveningwear, then choose a longer coat.
Consider your size and the volume of the fur.

, Because the animals are small, many coats will be made from partial skins; however, how many partial pieces were used is also important. Full skins will cost much more, so budget for the added expense if that’s your preference., Your coat should fit comfortably and feel light on your shoulders. Leave enough room to wear your clothes under it, so consider the thickness of what you’ll wear when you purchase the coat.


For example, a coat meant for warmth should be large enough to fit over sweaters, while an evening coat can be more fitted.
Look at where the natural markings on the fur fall to make sure that you like how it looks on you. The markings may look great while the coat’s on the hanger but strange when it’s on your body."

Inspect the fur for missing fur patches and damage.,
Feel the texture of the fur.,
Check the condition of the pelt under the fur.,
Smell the coat.,
Know what you can fix.,
Pick the fur that fits your budget.,
Try your coat on.",How to Choose a Fur Coat2," Over time, fur can become damaged due to age, pests, or wear-and-tear. Look over the entire coat carefully, but pay special attention to the hems, zipper, neckline, and sleeve lines, which all are more likely to come in contact with skin oils, personal care products, dirt, and grime.Before dismissing a piece that has minor damage, think about your needs, the cost, and what you’re willing to pay.


For example, a bargain-priced coat at an estate sale may be worth a buy even if it has a few hard-to-spot bald spots or small ink stain.

, Fur is usually soft and plush, but an older coat may have matted or coarse spots, which cannot be repaired. Decide before you buy a damaged coat if it’s something you’re okay with.Run your hands over the entire fur, including the edges.
Double check areas that will get a lot of exposure, like the back of the coat.
If you find damage, consider putting the coat on to see how easily the damage is to spot while you’re wearing it.

, The pelt is the skin that the fur is attached to. Overtime, it can start to break down or the seams can pull apart, especially if the previous owner(s) didn’t take care of the coat. This damage can result in holes in the coat. Before you buy a vintage piece, make sure that the pelt is still in good condition.Look at the seams of the coat.
Gently part the fur in various spots to look at the pelt underneath.
Look inside the coat to see if you can see part of the pelt due to either a damaged lining or an unlined coat.
Check if it has a French hem, which means that the fur and the lining will not be sewn shut at the bottom of the fur. This will allow you to get a good look at the pelt., You don’t want to get your new coat home only to find that it reeks of mothballs or mold. Give the coat a sniff, and try to have a friend smell it as well so that have someone else’s opinion to consider.


If the smell is minor, you can get rid of it by sealing the coat in a container with activated charcoal or kitty litter, both of which absorb bad odors. You can also try spritzing the coat with white vinegar, which will deactivate the odor. The vinegar smell will evaporate afterwards. If you choose to use vinegar, try it in an out-of-the-way location first., If your coat has an inner lining that is damaged, this can usually be repaired. You can also handle light odors. On the other hand, matted patches of fur and bald spots will be there to stay. Think carefully about what is acceptable to you before you make the purchase.If you are a DIY fashionista, you may be able to get creative with a damaged coat, so consider your sewing skills before dismissing a piece.

, Many vintage buyers choose mink coats because they’re both well known and common, making them an easier find at a lower price point. Rabbit and fox furs can also be great choices for a quality vintage fur.


If you have a bit more money to invest, you can look for furs that are no longer made, such as an ocelot fur. These pieces are rare, so if you can afford them they are a real statement piece., Make sure that the size, style, and color look great on you and capture the image you’re going for. Even if a piece is in great condition and at the right price point, it doesn’t make sense to buy it if if doesn’t look right on you. Bring a friend for a second opinion, and consider having someone take photos of you from different angles."

Feel the texture to see if it’s soft.,
Mash down the fur to check the quality.,
Check the label.",How to Choose a Fur Coat3," Faux fur is made from a variety of materials, some of which are scratchy and itchy against your skin. Poor quality will make it easy to spot your fur as a fake, plus it’ll ruin the experience for you. A good quality faux fur will feel soft and luxurious, much like a real fur. In fact, some faux furs are hard to detect because they are so similar to the real thing., Press your finger into the fur and run it along the surface of the fur. Watch to see how the fur reacts to being pushed against. A good quality faux fur will quickly return to it’s plush state, while poor quality faux fur will stay flat and not bounce back., Read the label carefully to find out what your coat is made from. Many faux furs are made of acrylics, but they don’t all have the same texture. Additionally, go online to check any words that you don’t understand.


Some manufacturers have been accused of using actual fur pieces mixed into their faux fur to add quality while keeping the price low. If you are buying faux fur for ethical reasons, then you will want to know if your faux fur contains real fur.
Kanecaron and Tissavel are two acrylic fibers that work well for faux fur coats."

If someone makes a disparaging comment on your appearance, pretend you did not hear it and walk away.Sometimes, people may think they're being helpful with their comments. Someone may say something like, ""You would look so much prettier without makeup,"" thinking of this as a compliment. Simply smile and offer little response. The person may take the hint.;
, If someone is mocking you about your makeup, even after you ignore them, think of a comeback. You could sarcastically say something like, ""Thanks for sharing. I really value your input,"" and then roll your eyes. Oftentimes, people tease those who they think won't fight back. If you're able to make a witty comeback, people may realize they can't make fun of you as easily., People who shame others often thrive on a response. Avoid showing that someone upset you. If someone comments about your makeup, try not to react with anger or sadness. Remain neutral instead.It's important to let your emotions out, so remember to deal with them later. You can rant to a friend or write a journal entry, for example.

If someone else makes a different choice, it does not make them superior to you.Be confident in your choice, and remind others when necessary that it's okay that you chose makeup. If someone tells you that you wear too much makeup, say something like, ""I'm glad you choose not to wear makeup, but I love makeup and am making a different choice.""

, Makeup can be a form of self-expression. You have the right to express yourself however you see fit. Think about why you choose the makeup you do, and what it says about you.Think about the colors you usually use. Maybe there's something about, say, pink eye shadow that feels fun and quirky, reflecting your personality.

For example, someone who is very judgmental about makeup may be very insecure about themselves. If they're shaming you, they may be jealous that you're talented at applying makeup. This is a reflection of their insecurity and not you as a person.

, Sometimes, we feel shame because we're not dealing with other emotions. If someone is able to make you feel bad about yourself, it may be easier to deal with this external negativity than internal negativity. Examine whether your feelings about makeup shaming have something to do with buried emotions.For example, if you do feel insecure about yourself, you're more likely to get mad at others for chastising you. Evaluate whether your self-esteem could use boosting.
If you find you're not feeling great about yourself, do something to change this. Take up a new hobby, for example, or work on developing a new skill. The better you feel about yourself, the less likely you'll be to succumb to shaming.

, When you react to makeup shaming, take stock of any negative thoughts you're experiencing. Try to engage with these thoughts and redirect or reexamine them. Combating negative thoughts can help you be less affected by makeup shaming.Recognize when you're having a negative thought. For example, you may think something like, ""Maybe I am insecure and that's why I wear makeup.""
Confront this thought. Think something like, ""Even if I am insecure, isn't it good my makeup makes me feel better? Everyone has ways to boost their self-esteem.""

, Sometimes, it takes awhile to become confident with yourself and your choices. Ultimately, it may simply take awhile to learn to disregard shaming. Work on being confident in your choices and embracing your love of makeup. With time, you will be less affected by shaming."

Start with your foundation.,
Next is your blush.,
Now for the fun part.,
Eyeliner.,
Mascara.,

Glitter.",How to Do a Makeup Parody," The key to a makeup parody is to be hilarious. So, when you apply your foundation, use something that is five times darker than your normal skin color. Say something like, ""First, you want to start with a nice, tan foundation that gives you a really glowing complexion. "" Have a hint of sarcasm as you say this. Also, apply the makeup with your fingers. When you do that, say, ""Real makeup artists use their fingers."" Make sure it looks really streaky. After you applied it, say how beautiful it looks.;
, When you apply it, just like your foundation, use your fingers. Make sure you really load up on it and look sunburned. If you want to say something funny while applying it, you can say, ""This gives you a really nice flush of color. It's just gorgeous. ""

, Eye makeup. First you want to pick out some color combinations that look like horrible together. Like blue and black and yellow, red, brown and green, pink, black and gold. Be creative and have fun with it. When you put on eyeshadow, use your fingers and smudge it on. Make sure you do your under eye, brow bone and lid. After you put that on, you can say something about how it really compliments your eye color.

, Pick the darkest black you can find. Smudge it all over your lid and under eye. (Go for the ""raccoon"" look). As you apply it, say how just a little black eyeliner can compliment anyone's eye shape and define the eye. (Remember to say how beautiful it looks)

, Take a black mascara, and really cake it on your bottom lashes. You can say it doesn't matter if it doesn't go on your lashes. (Be sarcastic). For your top lashes, apply it really heavily and make sure you ""accidentally"" get some mascara on your skin.

, These are simple. Just take the same eyeliner you used on your eyes and draw some fake eyebrows on your forehead.

, Take the reddest lipstick you own and out it ALL OVER. Go outside your lips almost to your nose and say how sexy big lips look. Then, take a clear lipgloss and put on your normal lips and where you drew lips. You can say the lipgloss adds a little, ""Sheer chic shine"".

, This is optional. Just take some craft glitter and put it all over your face. This would be funny if you filmed the video around a holiday like New Years or Christmas.

Choose a cover make-up or camouflage make-up.,
Cleanse the skin.,
Moisturize, if necessary.,
Apply foundation in several thin coats.,
Blend make-up as needed.,
Add powder.",How to Cover Vitiligo Patches with Makeup1," If you want to cover vitiligo patches, regular department store make-up won't cut it. You'll need to buy specialized make-up designed to cover discolorations caused by vitiligo, referred to as camouflage or cover make-up. Skim camouflage is typically used by both men and women. It does not look like you're wearing make-up. It just smooths out discolored patches of skin.Skin camouflage usually must be ordered online. You may be able to purchase it from your dermatologist's office. It does not require a prescription. You should select a shade that matches your regular skin tone. You may have to do some trial and error when purchasing camouflage products. It may take awhile to find a tone that best suits your skin.Skin camouflage is safe for adults and children. You can wear it safely all day as it tends to stay on very well.;
, Once you've obtained your product, you should cleanse the skin in the areas where you plan on applying camouflage make-up. This simply means to wash your skin thoroughly, using an antibacterial soap. Pat dry with a clean rag when you're finished.Keep in mind you should check your product's instructions before starting. While most products suggest you cleanse your skin first, some products may have special instructions for use. Always read instructions before using a new skin camouflage product., Once you've cleansed your skin, it may be necessary to moisturize. You'll be coating your skin in quite a few layers of skin camouflage, so if your skin is already dry or sensitive a moisturizer may help. However, some types of skin camouflage recommend you not moisturize, so check your product's label first.Most people do well with a water-based moisturizer with a light feel. Greasy or oily moisturizers may irritate skin. However, if your skin is dry, oily, or otherwise sensitive, you may need a special moisturizer.If you have dry skin, go for an oil-based moisturizer as this will help rehydrate. If your skin is very dry or cracked, look for a petroleum-based product. If your skin is very sensitive, go for a moisturizer that contains soothing ingredients like chamomile or aloe vera.As oily skin is more prone to acne, look for a moisturizer that is labeled noncomedogenic if your skin is oily. This means it is less likely to clog pores., You usually apply skin camouflage products in several thin coats. The aim is to make the make-up look as natural as possible to cover up discolorations.


Start from the middle of the discolored patch of skin. Work outwards as you apply each coat. You can use your fingers if you wash your hands first. However, if you prefer you can also use make-up brushes or sponges.You should always spread the make-up a few millimeters beyond the white patch. Allow one coat to dry for about 5 minutes before applying a second coat. Add as many layers as needed to cover up to your liking.If you're unsure of anything, there's usually a number you can call on the bottle to ask questions. Many companies have video tutorials online you can watch to understand how to apply the product correctly., As you start from the middle of a vitiligo patch, the make-up will deplete as you work outward. Blend your make-up into the surrounding skin as it depletes so it fades naturally into your normal skin tone. If you are wearing other make-up, apply it afterward. Apply your make-up as you normally would, placing it over the camouflage make-up.Blending will be more effective if you choose a brand of make-up that closely matches your skin tone. Remember, it can take quite a few tries before you find a brand of camouflage make-up that works for you. Prepare for some trial and error along the way., Once you finish applying the initial layers of make-up, there should be a thin powder that came with your package. This is usually dusted over your skin, much like regular powder foundation, to give your skin a smooth, natural look. When you're done applying layers of skin camouflage, add the powder. You can use a make-up brush to apply."

Comb your eyebrows and pluck if needed.,
Trace your eyebrows.,
Brush out your eyebrows.,
Use a brow pencil or eye shadow.,
Set your brows.",How to Cover Vitiligo Patches with Makeup2," Some people with vitiligo end up with whitening of the hair around the eyebrows. If this is the case with you, you can use make-up to enhance the shape of your eyebrows. To start, you'll comb your brows. If your normally pluck your eyebrows to reshape them, do that as well.


You can purchase an eyebrow comb at your local beauty store, which you can use to gently comb out your eyebrows. You can also wash a fine-toothed comb and use that instead.You can then use a pair of tweezers to pluck your eyebrows into your desired shape and size. Not everyone plucks their eyebrows. If it's not something you normally do, skip this step. If your eyebrows are losing color, only pluck the portions of hair you can easily see., From there, you will trace the bottom of your eyebrows with a light shade of eyeshadow. Choose a shade that matches your regular hair. You can apply the eyeshadow with an angled eyebrow brush, which you should be able to purchase at a local cosmetics store or supermarket. While cosmetic products are typically marketed toward women, the main goal here is to fill in your eyebrows in a natural color. This method can work for men as well.Gently trace the bottom of your eyebrows, moving in the natural direction of your eyebrows.Apply in swift, gentle strokes. You may need to apply several layers before you begin to bring out the natural color of your eyebrows.Once you've traced the bottom of your eyebrows, trace the tops. Repeat the same gentle motions, following the natural angle of your eyebrow., In order to remove any clumps, you should brush out your eyebrows to smooth out the color. You can use a brow brush. If you don't have one, you can wash out a mascara brush. Run the brow brush or mascara brush over your eyebrows, following the direction of your hair. Do as many strokes as you need to get your eyebrows to look smooth and natural., Once you've smoothed out your brows, use a brow pencil or eye shadow to darken the center of your brows slightly. Choose a shade that matches the natural color of your hair. This makes them look more defined.


Draw a line through the middle of your eyebrow. Avoid drawing around the edges, as this can make the brow look unnatural.Do not press too hard on the brush. You want the line to look soft, blending into the rest of your eyebrow. Pressing too hard can cause an unnatural appearance., You can purchase a clear brow gel at a local department store or make-up store. This works something like hairspray. It sets in the product, preventing it from smearing or fading throughout the course of the day. Once you've finished applying brow make-up, apply a single layer of brow gel over both eyebrows."

Learn about the benefits and risks.,
Figure out if you can afford treatment.,
Prepare for the procedure.,
Recover afterwards.",How to Cover Vitiligo Patches with Makeup3," Micropigmentation is a form of permanent cosmetics. It's similar to getting a tattoo. An instrument is used to implant pigment directly into your skin. It's usually most effective on people with darker skin and on patches of discolorations around the lips.The main upside of micropigmentation is that it's a form of permanent make-up. You will not need to worry about applying make-up products in the future. If you have discoloration that's spreading and not easy to cover by make-up, micropigmentation might be a good option for you.
Micropigmentation can cause drawbacks as well. Skin color can be difficult to match, it may fade over time, and in rare casing scarring during the process can cause further outbreaks of vitiligo., Treatment is usually several hundred dollars. As micropigmentation is considered a cosmetic surgery, it's usually not covered by insurance. Therefore, you will need to pay for the surgery upfront. See if you can get a cost estimate from a dermatologist. Determine whether micropigmentation is within your budget., If you do decide to get micropigmentation done, there are several things you need to do to prepare for the procedure. You will need to meet with a dermatologist ahead of time. You will give him or her a detailed medical history to make sure the procedure is safe for you. The doctor will also inform you of any potential risks. If you and your dermatologist still feel micropigmentation is the best option for you, you can schedule the procedure from there., Full healing will generally take 4 to 6 weeks. You will meet with your dermatologist during this time to assess whether follow up treatment is necessary. During recovery, you may have to ice skin to prevent swelling. Your dermatologist may prescribe a cream or ointment to aid with the healing process."

, Good stores to buy makeup are MAC and Sephora. If you want something cheap, check out your local drugstore (Rite Aid, Walmart, etc.)

, Cleaning your face, applying toner, using moisturizer, and a good primer are the most important things you can do, as this will improve your skin without makeup, and minimize what you need to wear to have flawless skin. (They all should be appropriate to your skin tone, of course).

, If your eyeshadow results in a lot of fallout (or dropped eyeshadow under your eyes), it's easiest to do your eyes before your face and lips, as you can just wipe away fallout with a makeup remover wipe. If you will not be wearing eyeshadow, or if your eyeshadow doesn't result in much fallout, you can get away with doing your face makeup first.

, While your face makeup will likely always be the same (primer, foundation, concealer), your eye makeup will likely change from day to day, so decide if you want to focus on your eyes or lips, and then apply your eyeshadow accordingly. If you're playing up your eyes, experiment with fun colors or new techniques, like a cat eye liner shape, or a smokey eye., If you're focusing on them, try a bold color like bright red or a deep color like wine or berry. If you'd like a light makeup look, you could use tinted or untainted balm, or a light gloss. If you want to wear a little more makeup and have some more upkeep, exfoliate your lips either with a wet rag or a lip exfoliator, then apply a balm or primer. After letting this soak in, wipe off any leftover product, and apply your lip liner, either clear, a color matching your natural lip, or an exact match to your lipstick or stain. Then apply your desired lip color, and rock it!"

It also helps makeup to last longer. Using a primer that treats acne also helps the acne while giving your face a smoother look.Apply a small amount evenly across your face. Using too much can make your foundation appear uneven, which is the opposite effect of what you want when you're trying to cover a blackhead.Make sure that you wait a minute to let the primer dry before applying any other makeup.You can use a tinted primer to improve your facial color.;
, It is important to apply treatment concealers before foundation so that your skin can receive the treatment within the concealer.To apply, dab the concealer on top of the blemish. Pat, don’t rub, to remove excess concealer.Ideally, you'll need a concealer that is similar to your skin color.Depending on your skin tone and the color of the spot (if it is dark or inflamed and red), you can use a color-correcting concealer. For instance, red helps to hide redness on your face, while pink to orangish-pink concealer can help conceal dark spots and marks on your face (pink for lighter skin tones and orangish-pink for darker skin tones).Treatment concealers often come in color correcting shades., After applying concealer, set it with translucent powder. This will help to keep the spot matte. It will also help to reduce the visibility of any blackhead or other acne., Doing so can irritate your skin. You don't want to irritate an already irritated blackhead. If you want to get the best results, you may want to choose one option that has acne treating qualities, such as your concealer, foundation, or primer. , Many want to go for a radiant look. However, the foundations that do that will highlight rather than obscure the blackhead and other blemishes. A matte finish foundation will work well with the matte setting powder, and make your skin look smoother., You need a foundation that matches your skin tone, and that doesn't clog your pores.When applying makeup over a blemish, it is often a worry that you will make the blackhead worse or cause even more acne. With a non-clogging foundation (non-comedogenic will usually appear on the label) you will be able to cover the blemish without making things worse.If you're having trouble finding the right shade, you may want to go to the makeup store for professional help. A makeup consultant can help you find the shade and type that works for your skin., Once you’ve picked a good non-comedogenic matte foundation, you need to apply it to cover up the blackhead.At first, apply as light a layer of foundation as you can. Start with the uneven portions of skin and work out from there. Keep applying with light layers until you smooth out your skin. You can use a foundation brush or a stippling brush to help if you feel that your fingers aren’t working well on your skin.Typically, foundation is applied all over the face and blended with the neck.Don't apply too much. This will make the makeup look cakey., After your done with your foundation, use your translucent matte powder to set the foundation. This will help reduce any shine, and smooth out the overall look. Don't use much. A light dusting should do.You can choose to dust powder only on the oilier parts of your skin, including the blemish.Make sure you've blended your foundation before you add the setting powder. However, the foundation should not be dry before you apply the powder., This will help reduce the excess oil without adding undue irritation and redness to your skin. It will also help clear the skin so that your makeup will go on smoother. A gentle cleanser will usually have anti-irritant ingredients.It's often best to choose an alcohol-free cleanser.Cleansers with emollients such as lanolin or ceramides will help keep your skin moisturized.Avoid any harsh cleansers or astringent products before applying makeup. These dry out your skin, and will cause the skin to produce more oil. They can also make irritate the blackhead itself, making it harder to cover up., This can irritate your skin, causing it to produce more oil. You should only wash your face twice a day, and for about two minutes each time. Washing too many times and for too long will only make the blackhead worse., Scrubbing your face can irritate the skin and actually make acne worse. Instead use your fingers or a soft cloth to wash your face. You won’t want a washcloth that is too rough, as it will irritate your skin. If you use a washcloth, make sure you don’t wash for as long as you would with your fingers, as even the softest cloths are likely to be rougher than your hands., While this certainly goes for the cleanser you choose, it also applies to any facial products you use. The worst common ingredients for your skin (and especially blackheads) are isopropyl isostearate, isopropyl myristate, myristyl myristate, laureth-4 and oleth-3. While these are the worst, there are also many other ingredients to look out for including coconut butter, cocoa butter, and soybean oil., Many people think that with acne-prone or oily skin you don't need to moisturize, but often you still need moisturizer. Using an oil-free moisturizer can help keep your skin healthy without adding unnecessary oils to an already oily complexion.Make sure you apply your moisturizer evenly across the skin., This will reduce inflammation before applying makeup. Apply for one minute only. Then wait five minutes. If it is still really inflamed you can apply for one more minute."

Dull any obvious lines with a blending brush.",How to Contour Without Looking Fake," Foundation is meant to match your natural skin tone. It should not lighten your skin or give you a tan. You will be applying a layer of foundation prior to contouring, so make sure you select a foundation that does not change your skin tone.As with any makeup product, some experimentation goes into finding the right foundation. Try buying several small containers of foundation to find one that matches your skin. If you're shopping at a department store, a worker at the desk may be able to help you find a match.
You can add a small swab of foundation to your hand or jawline before applying it to your face. This can help you see if the foundation matches your skin. Some stores may let you test products prior to purchase.;
, If your foundation looks caked on, the contour lines you apply on top of it will suffer. When applying your foundation, make sure it gets buffered on smoothly. Use the right tools for the product you're applying, and always use circular motions to apply foundation.Unless you're very skilled at makeup, go for a buffing brush over a flat brush for most foundations. All you need to do is buffer the foundation into your skin, swirling the brush in circular motions.
If you don't have brushes, you can use your fingers to apply foundation. However, this tends to work best with cream products. Dab a dot of foundation on your forehead, cheeks, and chin. Swirl the foundation into your face using your middle and ring finger.

, The products you use have a dramatic effect on your contouring results. You need bronzer, highlighter, and blush to contour.Select matte products for contouring. Shimmery products tend to make contour lines look obvious.
You will need at least one large, fluffy brush to smooth contouring lines when you finish.
You should have a separate brush for each product you're applying. For the bronzer, go for a very narrow brush. This makes it easy to draw on thin contour lines., Contouring should enhance where the sun naturally hits your face. This will assure it looks natural. You do not want to create contour lines in areas where they would not naturally occur, so observe your face under sunlight prior to contouring. Notice how the light hits your face and focus your contouring here.








Notice where the sun naturally hits your face. The sun usually falls around the top of your cheekbones and your forehead. This is where you will apply bronzer. You will then use your blush and highlighter to add the illusion of depth to these lines.
Pay attention to where shadows naturally fall on your face. This is where you'll be adding blush and highlighter to enhance the bronzer.

, You will start off contouring by applying your every day look, using products such as foundation and concealer. Avoid applying too much makeup near your cheeks. You want the amount of makeup here to look minimal in order for your contouring to look natural.If you prefer to do your eyes and lips first, you can do your eye makeup prior to contouring. However, you can also do your eye and lip makeup after finishing the contouring process.

, Bronzer should be used to add two lines to either cheekbone. Use your thin tipped brush so you can draw the lines precisely.








Start your line near where your hairline and ear meet. Following the natural direction of your cheek bone, draw a line angling downward.
You should draw your line about an inch and a half in length.

, Take your flat brush and sweep it back and forth alone your line, something like the movement of windshield wipers. This will cause the contouring line to blend out into your face slightly. This will create a more natural look, as the line will not look too drawn on or obvious.







, Use a wider, fluffier brush to apply your blush. Make sure to add the blush above, not below, the contour line you just drew.








You will start your blush line slightly below your contour line, on the apples of your cheek.
Move your line upward, following the contour line. Make sure not to cross the contour line as you follow it.

, The highlighter should brighten up your face slightly, making your bronzer lines more dramatic. Therefore, select a shade that's slightly lighter than your skin tone to get the highlighter to show up. Unlike foundation, highlighter should not be an exact match for your skin tone., To start, you will want to brighten up your contour lines slightly, and add additional light elsewhere. Using a fluffy brush, dust on some highlighter above your blush and contour lines. Then, dust some highlighter under your eyes to reduce dark circles.








Use gentle, sweeping motions to apply the highlighter.
Sweep over your highlighter several times. This will assure that your makeup blends more naturally.

, From here, dust some highlighter onto your chin. In addition to making your face more angular, this has the added bonus of covering up blemishes.








When applying highlighter to your nose, move the brush in a back and forth motion across the bridge of your nose.

, You should also run two lines down either jawbone using highlighter. This will give your face a more angular appearance. Sweep the highlighter back and forth over your jawlines to create a smooth, defined look.







, If you want your contouring to look natural, blending is a vital step. Take a large, fluffy brush and dust it over your face, blending all the contour lines together slightly. The end result should be a look that gives your face natural angles and lines without any obvious lines visible.








Make sure not to over blend. You do not want to eliminate the distinctions between highlighter, blush, and bronzer altogether, as this will destroy the contour effect. Just strive to have the lines blend into each other so the distinction between colors is not obvious.

Testers are there to be used and with a range of brands, you can easily compare and discover which brand you prefer, price-wise and quality-wise.;
, If you're considering several brands, research reviews for each individual brand and compare their ratings. If you're unsure of which brands to consider, research a list of makeup brands that are available in your country or online.

, Makeup prices are high these days and finding cheap brands can be difficult. Comparing the prices of makeup brands can really assist you in saving a heap of money and looking fabulous at the same time. The average price of lipstick is $17.50 for some brands; that's just a simple example of how expensive makeup is.

Compare the application quality of different brands.,
Compare the colour and pigmentation of different brands.,
Compare the texture of different brands.,
Compare the packaging of different brands.,
Compare the promises of different products.",How to Compare Makeup Brands2," Application is an important feature when it comes to makeup; the application and overall feel of the product can help you decide whether or not the brand is of good quality. The product should have easy application and should not feel uncomfortable on your skin.

, The colour of the product should be true to the packaging or what it looks like on the outside of the packaging. If the colour is not to your liking, you should attempt to get a refund. A good brand will always accept constructive criticism and a refund.

, Depending on the type of product you choose, your product should be true to its title. If the product promises a creamy finish, the finish should be creamy and smooth. If the product promises a matte finish, you should receive zero (or very minimal) shine or shimmer. The product should not set in fine lines into your skin and should have a comfortable wear.

, The appearance of the product from the outside doesn't seem to worry many, but the way a product is packaged can affect the overall result and performance of the product. If you are paying an expensive fee for the product you are purchasing, then you should receive a container that is appealing. A good example of high quality packaging includes MAC lipsticks and Gerard Cosmetics lipsticks; these brands are high in quality but pricey too.

, What the product claims to do should be done. Products constantly offer things such as ""24 hour lasting""; if the product claims to do so, it is expected that it will be true to its promise. The product promise of a brand can assist you in comparing that particular brand to another ""24 hour lasting"" product of a different brand. For example, it can happen that during advertisements, lip glosses are constantly portrayed as highly pigmented when in fact, they're not very opaque and quite sheer.

Coordinate the colors.,
If you're light skinned, you should wear bronze or lavender purple eye shadow.,
If you have medium skin color: Choose chocolate brown or olive green (Make sure the olive is a bit shimmery, so it doesn't drag your eyes down).,
If you have dark skin: Choose a dark plum or black-brown matte eye shadow.",How to Choose the Right Makeup," If you have fair skin, go for a small amount of pinkish blusher on the cheeks. But the first thing you must know, is that if you put on eye shadow, don't ever put on lipstick or lipgloss at the same time. For the eyes, it really depends on your eye color; for blue eyes you shouldn't go for a blue eye shadow, but earth-tones instead. If you want to jump out of earth tones, light pink always looks good. Those with brown eyes can get away with wearing almost any color of eye shadow. But if you really want to make them pop out go for either green, pink or blue eye shadow. In order to get green eyes to pop, you should try wearing various purple shades. If you want your eyes to stand out but look more natural, you may want to try warmer mocha brown shades or warm colors with slight orange undertones for green eyes. Keep in mind that you should have fun with your eye shadow and it shouldn't be a bothersome process.


A general rule of thumb with eye shadow is that it should first complement your eye color and then it shouldn't contrast your clothing. In other words, don't wear a purple based eye shadow on your blue eyes while you are wearing a coral toned shirt.
For lipstick and gloss: Gloss always looks better for people with a fairer skin tone and a light pink would look perfect.;
, Apply it up to your crease. For the blush, you should choose a medium rose. If you are slightly dark-haired, you should choose black mascara. For the finish, put on a natural medium pink or a coral/orange color.

, The blush should be a natural dark coral. You should definitely choose either black or blue mascara. Blue really brings out the eye colour.


This only works for medium skin tones: Put on a matte bronzer on the bridge of your nose, forehead and chin. Make sure it looks very natural, and that you barely notice it. Brown stains on your face are not a good look. Choose a matte, light red lipstick.

, The blush should be dark plum or bronze. It really makes the cheekbones pop. The mascara should be a very black one, and the lipstick should be a creamy wine or plum tone.

Choose a hydrating makeup primer if you have dry skin.,
Pick a mattifying primer if you have oily skin.,
Select a simple primer for sensitive skin.,
Use a nourishing makeup primer on mature skin.",How to Choose Makeup Primer1," If your skin begs for lotion after a shower, you definitely need to get a makeup primer for dry skin. A good, nourishing primer can take the place of your lotion, so you can hydrate your skin and prep it for makeup in one step. Look for primers with words like “hydrating,” “soothing,” or “replenishing.”, If you struggle with excess oil and shine, you want to combat this with your primer. To do so, your best bet is a great mattifying primer that will reduce your skin’s oil production. Products that minimize pores typically help to minimize shine as well. Look for oil-free formulas – your skin doesn’t need any help with that!, If you've found that your skin is sensitive to the products you use, it's a good idea to choose primers with a short ingredient list. Many beauty supply stores will have primers for sensitive skin that are oil-free, fragrance-free, paraben-free, and so on. The less additives in your facial products, the lower chance you have to experience a negative reaction., As you age, you may struggle with fine lines and blotchy skin. For this type of skin, look for makeup primers infused with antioxidants. A hydrating primer will help to give you some needed moisture while locking your makeup in place."
"
Use a color-correcting primer if you have issues with skin color.,
Choose a gentle primer for acne-prone skin.,
Hide large pores and fine lines with a pore-minimizing primer.",How to Choose Makeup Primer2," Some primers are clear, which are great for people hoping to skin improve texture and help makeup stay put. If you have blotchy or uneven skin, however, you might want to use your primer as a color corrector. You can choose a primer in the same color as your foundation color to even out your skin, or use a specific color-correcting primer.Green makeup primer will reduce redness. Whether you have a sunburn or just struggle with an overly rosy complexion, the green will help balance the red.
If you have yellow undertones, apply a purple makeup primer to cancel these out.
Pink makeup primers work a little like blush by making your complexion look illuminated and healthy.
If you can see the bluish veins in your delicate skin, a yellow makeup primer will help cover these up.
A peach-colored primer will help cover up dark circles and hyperpigmentation.

, Using the wrong products on acne can make the problem worse, so it’s incredibly important that people with acne choose the right makeup primer. Primers with salicylic acid are great for people with acne because they actually work to reduce acne while you’re wearing it. Avoid products with added oils or fragrances, because these can irritate your skin. Look for products that are specifically labeled ""non-comedogenic,"" which means they won't clog your pores.Oil-free and oil-absorbing primers are good choices for acne-prone skin because they will not block pores and aggravate the problem.
Primers with vitamins E and A can help heal and moisturize your skin.

, These products are well-labeled for the problem they address, luckily. If you want to blur these imperfections, look for bottles labeled with words like “pore-minimizing” or “poreless.” Some of these primers can be used alone while others work best in conjunction with foundations, so read the packaging carefully.If you have wrinkles or large pores, it’s important to see if your primer stands the test of time. A primer may look great at first, but then you’ll see your foundation settling into fine lines. The best primers will hold your makeup in place (and out of fine lines) all day!

Buy a sweat-resistant primer if you’re active.,
Get an eyelid primer to hold eyeshadow in place.,
Use a primer with SPF in the summer.",How to Choose Makeup Primer3," If you’re sitting in class or work all day, you may be fine with your everyday primer. However, if you’re headed to a packed party or to an outdoor lunch, your makeup may slide off your face by the end! Use a sweat-resistant primer to make sure it stays put. These primers are meant to resist water and sweat, and will help your makeup stay in place despite the conditions., If you don’t wear much or any eyeshadow, you are absolutely fine applying your normal makeup primer to your entire face. However, if you spend a good deal of time on an elaborate smoky eye, you may want to invest in an eye-specific primer. These will prevent your eyeshadows from creasing or fading, helping your eyelid artwork last all day and night., If you want your skin to look beautiful, you need to protect it from the sun. A makeup primer with SPF is great year-round, but especially during the summer months. The higher the SPF the better! For added protection on really sunny days, skip the primer and use sunscreen underneath your makeup."

Moisturize your face.,
Highlight your cheekbones.,
Protect your skin from hair dye and self-tanner streakiness.",How to Use Petroleum Jelly for Beauty Uses1," If you have chronic dry skin or tend to get dry patches in cold weather, petroleum jelly can be an effective moisturizer for your face. It creates a barrier over your skin that helps lock in the natural oils and moisture. Massage it over dry areas of the face or apply a light coat to your entire face.Even after you rub petroleum jelly in, your skin may be slightly shiny and tacky. As a result, it’s usually best to use it as a night cream.
Despite its heavy consistency, petroleum jelly doesn’t clog your pores so it shouldn’t cause any breakouts. If you have acne-prone skin, though, it’s best to ask your dermatologist before using it as a moisturizer.
Petroleum jelly isn’t just for moisturizing your face. Use it on any dehydrated patches of skin, such as cracked heels, ragged cuticles, or dry elbows.;
, If shimmery highlighters are too heavy for you, substitute a little petroleum jelly. Its shiny finish catches the light without chunky glitter so you get a more natural highlighting effect. Use your finger to lightly dab and blend a small amount of the jelly along the tops of your cheekbones.If you apply a heavy layer of the jelly, it can make your skin look greasy instead of highlighted. Start with a very small amount of the petroleum jelly to avoid applying too much.
You can also highlight your brow bone with the petroleum jelly.
If you prefer, you can use a makeup sponge to lightly press the petroleum onto the high points of your face.

, Because petroleum jelly provides an effective barrier over your skin, it can help keep your skin from getting colored by hair dye or developing streaks from self-tanner. Apply a light layer on areas where you don’t want the dye or self-tanner to soak into the skin before you begin your hair coloring or self-tanning process.When you’re dyeing your hair, smooth the petroleum jelly around your hairline on your forehead, around your ears, and at the nape of your neck.
When you’re self-tanning, rub a thin layer over your wrists, ankles, elbows, and knees to keep the tanner from collecting in dry patches and developing streaks.

Exfoliate your lips.,
Moisturize your lips.,
Create custom lip gloss shades.,
Transform matte lipsticks.",How to Use Petroleum Jelly for Beauty Uses2," If you have rough, flaky lips, you can use petroleum jelly to create an effective scrub that removes the dead skin. Mix a small amount of the jelly with sugar to create a gritty lip scrub. Massage it over your lips and wipe it away with a tissue or clean washcloth.You can also exfoliate your lips by applying a layer of the petroleum jelly to your lips and using a clean toothbrush to gently scrub away the dead skin.

, When you have dry, chapped lips, petroleum jelly makes an extremely effective lip balm. Just as it does with your skin, it helps lock in moisture and soothes flaky, cracked skin. Use your finger to apply a small amount of the petroleum jelly over your lips, and allow several minutes for it to sink into the skin.If you plan to apply lipstick after the petroleum jelly, use a tissue to blot your lips first. That will remove any petroleum jelly residue that might keep your lipstick from going on evenly.

, If you need a certain shade of lip gloss that you can’t find at the store, use petroleum jelly to create a custom gloss. Mix a small amount of the petroleum jelly with loose powdered eye shadow or blush in the shade you want. Apply the mixture to your lips with a brush for a pretty, glossy lip color.Add as much or as little of the eye shadow or blush pigment to create the shade that you want. The more pigment that you add, the more concentrated the gloss shade will be.
If you don’t have loose eye shadows or blushes, scrape a little powder from a pressed version to mix with the petroleum jelly.
You can also use powdered drink mixes, such as Kool Aid, to color the petroleum jelly. Not only will the mix color the jelly, it will flavor it as well. For example, make a cherry-colored and flavored gloss with Cherry Kool Aid.

, If you have the perfect shade of lipstick but wish it was glossy and shiny instead of matte, petroleum jelly can help. Apply the lipstick to your lips as you normally would, and blot it with a tissue. Next, dab a light layer of the petroleum jelly over your lips for a glossy finish.

Condition your eyelashes.,
Tame your eyebrows.,
Add shine to matte eye shadows.,
Remove stubborn eye makeup.",How to Use Petroleum Jelly for Beauty Uses3," If you want longer, thicker lashes, petroleum jelly can help condition them so they’re softer and less brittle. Use a clean spoolie to gently coat your lashes or rub a small amount over your lashes with your fingers before bed each night. You’ll wake up with healthy, soft lashes.If you don’t like mascara, you can apply the petroleum jelly during the day. Not only will it condition your lashes, it can also help define your lashes without adding any color.

, When you run out of your usual brow gel, petroleum jelly can help keep your brows in place all day. Dip a clean spoolie or brow brush in the jelly, and comb your brows into place.If you don’t have a spoolie or brush, rub a small amount of petroleum jelly over your brows to smooth them in place.

, If you’re tired of your usual matte eye shadows, petroleum jelly can help give them a shiny, almost wet look that’s sure to turn heads. Dab a light layer of the petroleum jelly over clean eyelids as a base, and use a small, dense eyeshadow brush to press the matte shadow over the jelly to give it a glossy sheen.Be sure to wipe off the brush on a tissue or towel if you have dip back into the shadow after it’s already touched the petroleum jelly on your lid. The petroleum jelly can leave a film on a pressed shadow that may ruin it.

, Waterproof mascara and eyeliner can be extremely difficult to remove. If you’ve washed your face and there’s still residue from your makeup, take a small amount of petroleum jelly on a cotton swab and run it along your lashline to remove the makeup.Petroleum jelly can also help remove eyelash glue. Rub it along your lashline, and you’ll be able to pull off your lashes with ease.

Make your perfume last longer.,
Control flyaway hairs and hide split ends.,
Make it easier to open nail polish bottles.",How to Use Petroleum Jelly for Beauty Uses4," If you’re tired of your favorite fragrance fading before the end of the day, dab a very small amount of petroleum jelly on the inside of your wrists, behind your ears, and anywhere else that you normally apply perfume. When you spray the fragrance over the areas, it will cling to the jelly so it lasts longer., If you’re having a bad hair day, petroleum jelly can help smooth flyaway hair and disguise split ends. Tame flyaways by placing a pinch of the jelly in your palm, rubbing it between your hands, and smoothing it over your hair. For fried-looking ends, dab a very small amount on your fingers and run it over the ends to smooth them.Be careful not to go overboard when using petroleum jelly on your hair. If you apply too much, your locks can wind up looking greasy and limp.

, If you find yourself frustrated with nail polish bottles that won’t open because of dried polish along the rim, petroleum jelly is the answer. Before you close the bottle after polishing your nails, spread a small amount of the jelly along the rim. The bottle will open easily the next time you use it."

Use rose water as a cleanser for your face.,
Use rose water as a toner.,
Refresh your face and skin with rose water.",How to Use Rose Water for Beautiful Skin1," Since rose water hydrates and moisturizes the skin and has anti-bacterial properties, it makes a great natural cleanser for your face. It can even replace your current facial cleanser. Mixing rose water with glycerin and rose essential oil can make a hydrating cleanser to use on your face every day.


Obtain rose water, glycerin, and rose essential oil. Glycerin moisturizes the face without making it oily.Glycerin can be found and purchased at most drugstores or grocery stores. Rose essential oil and rose water can both be purchased at a store that specializes in organic food and/or natural cosmetics, such as health food store or Whole Foods.
In a medium-sized mixing bowl, add one cup of water, two teaspoons of glycerin, and ten drops of rose essential oil and stir.
When the ingredients are blended together and are viscous, pour into an empty toiletries bottle.
Screw on the cap and save your cleanser for later use.;

Use a rose water and sandalwood face pack.,
Use lemon juice and rose water.,
Try a cucumber juice, honey, and rose water pack.",How to Use Rose Water for Beautiful Skin2," Rose water’s antimicrobial and antibacterial properties help treat and prevent acne. It will also help heal scars and wounds that are a result of acne. Sandalwood powder is excellent for absorbing the excess sebum from the face, thus effectively treating the source of acne.Add two parts sandalwood powder to one part rose water.
Stir until the powder is completely dissolved in the rose water.
Apply to your face. Leave it until it dries completely.
When the mixture is dry, rinse your face and gently pat dry.

, Lemon juice is another common natural acne cure, due to its antibacterial and astringent properties, which reduces the oil in the skin and kills bacteria.

Leave the mixture on for ten minutes.
After the ten minutes have elapsed, rinse your face well and gently pat dry., If lemon is too harsh for your skin, a cucumber and honey face pack should be a soothing remedy for acne.

Obtain coconut oil and rose water.,
Combine the ingredients.,
Pour mixture into a container.,
Apply to your face.",How to Use Rose Water for Beautiful Skin3," An effective and natural rose water makeup remover will contain some oil. Coconut oil is inexpensive and both the coconut oil and rose water are nourishing for your skin. Rose water can be purchased at an organic food store, such as Whole Foods. Coconut oil is frequently available at most grocery stores.

, Mix equal parts rose water and coconut oil together. Since coconut oil is solid at room temperature, it can help to warm the coconut oil on the stove first so that it melts. Use a wooden spoon or whisk to mix the ingredients together well.

, Once you have combined the ingredients, pour the mixture into a jar, such as a Mason or Bell jar. This will make it easy to dip into the mixture with a spoon or your fingers. Coconut oil hardens at room temperature but will melt if you rub it between your fingers and hands. You may need to dig some of the mixture out with a spoon whenever you use it from the jar.

, To remove makeup from your face, apply the mixture to your fingers or spread it on a cotton pad or ball. Rub the areas that contain makeup, until all of it has been removed. You may need to replace the cotton ball or pad with a fresh one as it gets saturated with makeup.

Plan ahead.,
Consider cutting the bar in half or into quarters with a knife.Bubble bars create a ton of bubbles, and sometimes, you don't even need to use the entire bar to get a decent amount.,
Make sure your bathtub is clean, then start filling it with water.,
Crumble the bar, and hold it under the running tap.The bar will start to melt in your hand and release its scent and/or color.,
Turn off the tap when the tub is full and give the water a swish with your hand.,
Get into the tub, and relax for 10 to 20 minutes.",How to Use a Bubble Bar1," Make sure you have enough time for a nice, long, relaxing bath. About twenty minutes should do. Bubble bars are luxurious, and not worth a quick, five minute bath. Save them for when you have time to take a longer bath and relax.;
, By cutting your bar into smaller pieces, you'll be extending the life of one bar, and saving money. You can store the extra bars in a plastic bag or box. Make sure that the bag or box seals up tightly.


Keep the labels, and stick them onto the bag or box. This way, you'll have the name/scent, and use-by date.Be careful not to get water into the bag or box. The extra bars must be kept dry until you are ready to use them., Use a temperature that is most comfortable for you. Have your bubble bar ready.

, The tub will begin to fill with thick, fluffy bubbles.


Some people prefer to put the crumbled bar into a strainer first, so that they don't drop any pieces into the water.
The stronger the water flow, the more bubbles you'll get.Some bubble bars are colored, but you may not see the color at first. The color will become deeper the longer you hold the bar under the water., This will help create more bubbles. If there are not enough bubbles to your liking, add a little bit more of the bubble bar.

, Light some candles, turn on some music, or read a book. Baths are supposed to take a little longer than showers so that the body and mind can relax.


Expect the bubbles to last about 20 minutes."

Set the bar down on a towel to dry.Once it is dry, you can store it in its bag, or in a plastic box with a tight fitting lid.,
Climb into the tub and relax.",How to Use a Bubble Bar2," Bubble bars are luxurious, so you wouldn't want to waste them on a quick, five minute bath, Make sure you have about 20 minutes to spare so that you can enjoy them.

, These bars are relatively new, so not every place may have them. They are harder than regular bubble bars, and don't crumble as easily. They usually come on a string or stick, and can be reused up to 10 times., Use a temperature that is most comfortable for you. Have your bubble bar ready and a towel handy. You will need to set your bubble bar on the towel so that it can dry.

, These bars don't need to be held under running water. When the tub as full as you like it, turn the water off and stick the bar under the water. Swish it around until bubbles form. You won't need to use the entire bar.

, If you store the bar in its bag or box while it is still wet, you'll trap the moisture, and the bar will melt away.

Use fragrant bubble bars as air fresheners.,
Freshen up your clothes with a bubble bar.,
Use them in a foot soak.,
Sprinkle bubble bar crumbles over a carpet, then vacuum them up.",How to Use a Bubble Bar3," If you like the smell of bubble bars, but don't like taking long baths, use them to freshen up your room. Find a pretty dish that matches the bar, and place bar onto the dish. Set the dish down someplace safe, such as a shelf, dresser, desk, or vanity.


These bubble bar ""air fresheners"" can also double up as pretty decorations.

, Place the bubble bar into a dish or a chiffon bag. Place it in the corner of your dresser drawer or wardrobe. Bubble bars are made out of baking soda, so they will absorb bad odors, and the essential oils in them will fragrance your cloths.

Keep your new hairstyle looking great.,
Try new makeup.,
Wear different makeup depending on your style.,
Shake up your wardrobe.,
Let your shirts work their magic.,
Find clothes at second-hand stores.,
Accessorize.,
Flatter your feet.",How to Change Your Appearance," It won't really matter what you look like if people can smell you because you haven't washed, or if bits of that onion bagel are still stuck between your teeth. Good hygiene means brushing, flossing, and washing regularly.


Make sure that you brush your teeth at least twice a day. Remember to get your tongue to fight halitosis (bad breath). Floss nightly.
Wash and condition your hair every other day. Your body makes good oils for your hair, so you don't want to wash them away every day. But you also don't want them to build up. If you have very oily skin or hair, six out of seven days per week.;
, Your skin is another important part of your body. Treat it kindly, with care, and it will glow for you.


Wash your face in the morning and at night. If you're starting to develop or already have pimples, use a light topical cream at night.
Apply a face mask once a week. If you can't afford one, there's no need to skip this step. Half of a mashed up banana with some tea tree oil is great for budget-savers.
Apply hand cream whenever possible and stay well-moisturized. Moisturize whenever you wash your face or after each shower.
Keep your nails painted and nicely filed all the time. Get them done at a salon if you're anxious about how they might turn out.

, This is your first real step to a noticeably different you. Don't be afraid! Before you go to the salon, spend some time looking through magazines and figure out what you like. If possible, it's best to bring the hairstylist a picture so you are close to guaranteed to get it the way you like it.


Highlights, layers, beveled ends, shorter styles or side bangs are really beautiful. Contrary to popular belief, one length is NOT drab; but it certainly does not look good on everyone.
If you are going for more of an emo/punk look, think about cutting your hair short, layering it, getting bangs, and dying a portion of it a color like pink or purple.
If you are going for more of a California/surfer girl look, think long, slightly wavy hair with lighter highlights.
If you're trying to go classic/preppy, think side-swept bangs and straight, long hair that you can eventually put up into a bun, or chignon.

, Now that you've got a beautiful haircut, show it off! Make sure you do your hair every morning. Pay attention to what product you put in it and how often you crimp or straighten it. Messing with your hair too often can result in damaged hair, split ends, or hair loss.


If you shower in the morning, use a tad bit of product and let your hair go natural. Natural looking hair will keep your look pretty and soft, even more approachable in some ways.
Headbands are in right now. Black, brown, or white headbands will go with almost any outfit. There are tons of wire and jewelry-like headbands available as well.
In a rush? Put it up. This can be beautiful, too. Ponytails and messy buns are great, and braids are back in style.

, Makeup is not a must, but you may want to use it. A little bit of lip gloss over a color or on its own will fill out your lips. Unless you're absolutely not allowed to, you should keep a little concealer, too, to cover up major blemishes. If you can't wear makeup, make sure you take really good care of your skin. This way, you won't have as many blemishes.


Keep your makeup in a cute carrying case and keep any essentials with you all the time - in your school bag or in your purse, depending on where you're going.
Think about getting a natural blush. The right kind of blush will make you look like you're naturally blushing, not actually wearing blush.
Get an eyelash curler if you can. Curling your eyelashes is a great alternative to mascara; curling opens your eyes up and makes them appear brighter and bigger.

, Again, the type of makeup that you use will depend on what kind of style that you're going for. Here are a few suggestions.


For an emo or punk look, think dark eyeliner and dark mascara, plus a little bit of red gloss to your lips for a pop. Don't opt for pale foundation! The pasty-face is a misconception. Just because you're emo doesn't mean you have to look lifeless!
For a California or surfer look, think natural tones and minimal makeup. A bit of bronzer, light mascara, and a small application of dark eyeliner. You want to look sun-kissed and beach-bodied, remember?
For a classic or preppy look, think either red or nude lips, mascara and a white pencil liner around the inner corners of the eye, along with a three-color eyeshadow that's perfectly blended. What a classic look!
Practice, practice! Practice these looks with your girlfriends. Take pictures to study what looks good and what doesn't. Remember, a little goes a long way with some makeup.

, You're probably going to need to go shopping in order to give your appearance a makeover. But don't fret. Think about versatility when shopping: If you can make an article of clothing fit with several different items, you've done your job. You don't necessarily need a ton of new clothes to change your look; you just need to try to wear them differently.


Make sure you've got a couple of well-fitted, cool pairs of jeans. Avoid flares, as they're currently not in style. Try jeggings, too, as these offer comfort plus a little bit of style.

For emo/punk looks, opt for darker pairs of jeans. You can also try ripping or distressing your old jeans.
For surfer looks, go for lighter jeans or also jeans that are distressed. Think linen pants and capris as well!
For classic looks, try indigo or black skinny jeans (or maybe even some stylish plaid jeans if you're bold!), undistressed.



, Shirts and tops are, of course, essential to any look. Tailor your tops to the kind of style that you're looking for. Even if you've got a really low budget, you can make some great changes with only a few new pieces.


Tank tops and fitted tees can make a huge difference, and generally round out the surfer/preppy look. Get a couple of tank tops, or a bunch of tanks lined with lace might be nice, too. Wear these underneath tee shirts that aren't that cool, so that they show at the bottom. Try layering a couple.

Collared shirts work really well also if you're going for more of a preppy look. Loose-fitting button-downs (plaids or denim) can look very flattering with the right pair of skinny jeans.


Think band shirts if you're going for the emo/punk/indie look. Look for pre-washed or worn-looking shirts that have that vintage feel. They don't have to be baggy, either. Flatter your physique.

, Even cheap clothes can be great clothes. Not all thrift stores, however, are created equal. When buying second-hand, always be extra-careful about small tears, discolorations, or other defects.


Look for brand-name clothes that have been worn only a couple of times. The real steal is when you find a great jacket or blouse that hasn't even been worn but has that discount-price.
Visit second-hand shops right after the holidays. Often, people will get presents from their parents or relatives that they don't really like, and they'll gift or sell it back to the second-hand store. This is the perfect time to go.

, Jewelry is really important. You don't need to wear too much, but make sure you've got a couple of great pieces, because they'll round out the rest of your collection. Keep it simple.


Try a circle-shaped pendant set with fake stones, or maybe some hoop earrings. Studs would work well if you're going for a grungier look.
Silver tones are very nice. They're very fashionable, inexpensive, and go with everything.
If you're going for preppy, make sure you've got a cool watch or two. Black or multicolor rubber bracelets work well for emo/punk.

, Shoes are important, too. Shoes can really make or break your look, and they're the perfect accessory. Pay attention to what your feet get dressed in!


For preppy/classic, get a cute pair of flats, a pair of heels, and a pair of running shoes. High boots with fur are nice for the winter.
For surfer/California, try a pair of Keds, maybe some Uggs (only for the winter, though!), some flats, and some flip-flops.
For emo/punk, think Vans high tops, some black Converse, or maybe even some boots.

, Go for drastic. It sounds severe, but you're never going to change yourself, or feel better if you have basically the same thing you started with. Go to a well reviewed salon, and talk to the stylist first.


Try dying your hair a lighter colour, with subtle highlights, or go for it completely, and go for a bold red. Then get it cut. Try going shorter, it will make you feel confident and fresh. Layers are also a good change, to make it more casual, tousled look.

, Don't ever overdo it and look like a tart, but used in the right amounts and it can make you look flawless. You may want to try out going to a department store and get them to give you a make over, but if you don't want to do that there are other ways to find the perfect look.

Get a tape measure.,
Stand up straight with your body relaxed and feet close together.,
Make both measurements just as you finish exhaling.,
Wrap a tape measure around the skinniest part of your waist.,
Use the tape measure around the widest part of your hips.,
Take both measurements a second time to account for any changes from breathing.,
Divide your waist circumference by your hip circumference.,
Aim for a WHR lower than .90 if you are a man.,
Keep your WHR lower than .80 if you're a woman.,
Know that a WHR above 1.0 for men and above .85 for women indicates high health risks.,
Learn the risk factors you need to fight in order to return to a positive WHR.,
Know that WHR is only one of several tests to determine a healthy weight.",How to Calculate Your Waist to Hip Ratio," The only way to accurately measure around your body is with a flexible, wrap-able tape measure.

For professional results, which are not necessary for home testing, the World Health Organization suggests stretch-resistant tape with 100g of tension.;
, Don't slouch or lean, as this can throw off the measurement. You also don't want to hold your breath or suck in your stomach, as this will give an inaccurate reading.You should be wearing very little or no clothing. Get your measurements as close to the skin as possible.


, This is going to get the most accurate measurement. Try to get the measurement in the space between finishing to exhale and beginning another inhalation., More often than not this is just above your belly button, up above the knobs of your hip bones. Keep the tape flat against your belly, not kinked or twisted. You don't want to squeeze or pull, just get a snug measurement.

Write this measurement down as ""Waist Circumference."" For an example, say this is 26"" 

It does not matter if you use inches or centimeters, so long as you use the same measurement for your hips, too., This is frequently the widest part of your butt, just below where your thighs hinge. Wrap your tape measure, again trying not to kink, twist, or pull tightly on it.

Write this measurement down as ""Hip Circumference."" For an example, say this is 32""

If you measured in inches for the waist, use inches again here. If you used centimeters before, use centimeters now, etc., This is the clinical standard, but if you're just curious for a rough figure you can skip this step. Doctors do this to ensure they get the most accurate reading possible.
, The result is your waist-to-hip ratio, or WHR. Simply pull up a calculator and divide the waist measurement by the hip measurement:

For an example, assume your waist circumference is 26"" and your hip circumference is 32""


26in32in{\displaystyle {\frac {26in}{32in}}}


WHR = .8125


, A healthy male generally has slightly bigger hips than waist, but there should not be a huge difference. This is why the ratio for a healthy male is close to 1. Note, however, that small changes make a big deal for men -- any ratio above .95 poses a health risk. Staying at .90 or lower is ideal., Women naturally have bigger hips for childbearing, meaning a healthy ratio for women is much lower than for men. This is why their ratio is generally lower -- they are dividing by a bigger hip circumference in general. Anything above .85 is a reason to reexamine diet and exercise habits., Your waist to hip ratio is a proven indicator of future cardiovascular disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, and gall bladder disease., Lowering your waist to hip ratio to a healthy level is largely a factor of diet and exercise. Aiming to eat more fruits and vegetables, lean meats (like chicken, turkey, and fish), and cut back on total food consumption is the best way to fight an unhealthy WHR. You should also consider:

Quitting smoking

Walking, running, or biking 30 minutes a day.

Talking to your doctor about cholesterol or blood pressure medication

Cutting back on alcohol, soda, and other ""empty"" calories., While waist to hip ratio is an important indicator of health, it is not the only one you should pay attention to. Use another test, such as your Body Mass Index (BMI), to help put this number in context.

BMI is a measure of your total body fat, meaning how much of your body is comprised of fat. People with naturally atypical body shapes (very tall or short, broad or skinny, etc.) tend to learn more from BMI than from WHR.

While not a measure of obesity, you should have blood pressure tests if you're worried about the effects of a poor diet or lack of physical activity.

Be a loving and caring girl. Beauty begins from the inside.;
, Confidence is the second crucial thing. It makes you all the prettier to others if you like yourself already. If you are not confident yet, then ""fake it till you make it."" Never be overly cocky. Be confident yet sweet. After doing the next steps regularly you should build confidence.

, Own your own personality even if it is different. That makes you fascinating. But do incorporate the first two steps into your own personality.

,, Getting your beauty sleep helps a lot. People do not think of this as much anymore. Do not stay up late browsing the Internet. A well rested girl has nicer skin especially under the eyes. You will need less makeup. A well rested girl is also a nicer one. Get at least 9 hours a night. On busy weekends take a quick nap between activities to refresh and recharge. All the girls on Gone With The Wind did it.

, This in turn hydrates your skin and makes it more beautiful.

, Obviously this helps your weight but many dark veggies help the skin. Also getting a lot of protein grows your hair and nails. Stay away from processed food. Eat whole foods. The modern world and its cheap quick processed food is making us less attractive and healthy. Research nutrition and what foods are good for what.

, You do not have to be model thin because it's not hot anyway. Just keep in mind your hip to waist ratio. It's one of the first things men are programmed to notice. It's all about the curves of the body, not how small the whole body is. Eating whole foods and not much sugar will help. Also find an exercise that makes your waist smaller first. Wear high waisted skirts and slim dresses sometimes. When you wear jeans make sure they are not giving you a muffin top. If you have a belly and you wear jeans make sure you top is fitted but long so you can scrunch it over the tummy.

, They don't have to be big to be nice ones.

, Check them everyday to see if you need to pluck some new little guys. Nice eyebrows make everything else look better. Work with you natural arch and don't to make them too thin. An unnatural eyebrow job is so unflattering.

, Being soft is gorgeous and it gets noticed. Put it on right away after your shower because you'll absorb more moisture. St. Ives Naturally Soothing Oatmeal and Shea Butter is awesome. But also wear sunscreen when your going to be outside all day. You may think tans are attractive now but they will make you wrinkle faster besides the threat of skin cancer.

, Go to the dermatologist and get a prescription. If you can't afford it then get something over the counter. Sulfuric acid or Benzoyl peroxide are the ingredients you're looking for in the highest quantity possible in the grocery store. People have different types of acne so experiment with trying one of these ingredients at a time, one should work for you. Also there are many cheap home remedies you can search for on the Internet to try.

, Shower everyday. Brush teeth twice or three times a day. Always have clean soft hair. Try out different up hair styles to use on the days you do not shampoo. Variety in hair is cute. Guys like it and girls compliment it.

, Body splash is your friend.

, But do not wear the crazy make up everyday especially around the guy you like because many men like a natural look. You can always wear a subtle amount of blush and concealer under your eyes and curl your eyelashes to look more awake. Cover blemishes with mineral based make up or make up or medicated make up. There is really no point to caking the foundation all over your face. Show off your adorable freckles. Keep your lips moist with chap stick every day even if you don't wear lipstick or gloss that day.

, If you straighten your hair use something to protect it. It's wonderful to do new looks but let your hair be natural a couple days of the week. It is prettiest natural,no matter how much you want to fight that. It will be healthier, stronger, and grow faster that way too. Use sulfate free products. If you want to curl your hair try doing it in a heat/damage free way like doing old fashioned pin curls. Deep condition hair once a week. Buy something or whip up something at home.

, Pulling off something that stands out will boost your confidence and get you noticed. But make sure it looks good and is flattering so you are noticed in the right way. It is okay to look simple sometimes too. Nothing is sexier then a plain white or black v-neck or tank top, or a simple sexy dress. You do not have to show skin to be sexy but if you do want to show some then just pick one feature and mostly cover up of the rest.

, Nails are so noticeable.

,, Look like you are having a good time as much as possible and laugh a lot. This makes people gravitate to you. Keep your teeth white! Use white strips or just brush with baking soda.

, Do not take it seriously and then nobody will think anything bad about what you just did.

, But don't show off too much or be cocky.

, You want to know what most of the words in the ingredient list are.

, It's so refreshing, hydrating, and healthy. It wakes you up and makes you feel beautiful.

Be bold.",How to Change Your Image," Before you can come up with the right new image, put some thought into the image other people have of you now. What kind of things do people tend to say about you? What are some of your best qualities, according to your friends? Reflect on your many interactions and how others often regard you. Identifying your existing image is the first step to making a gradual shift.Put yourself in the position of an outside observer and think about your role amongst your friends and family. Are you the shy one that’s hesitant to come out of your shell? The loud, boisterous joker? Examining yourself in these terms can help you target which parts of yourself you want to work on.;
, You’re on a quest for a new image, but what should it be, exactly? Decide what characteristics you want people to associate you with. You might wish to be admired for your bravery and stoicism like your favorite adventure hero, channel the sensuality of a fashion icon or give off the class and sophistication of a classic movie star. Think about what your idols are like and how you can tailor your public appearance to be more like them.Start small. Obviously it’s impossible to become an entrepreneurial success or a beloved socialite overnight. Begin with the basic personality traits you wish to have and make room for them in your life.
Choose your new image carefully. It should still be in line with your personal values and beliefs.

, Your image is largely the result of the parts of your behavior that you put on display. Therefore, changing yourself in other people's eyes will require you to make your good qualities more obvious while working to minimize your negative ones. Think about a certain aspect of your character that someone has taken issue with in the past and make a note to yourself to amend behaviors that others find off-putting. If you often find yourself getting defensive and becoming argumentative in disputes, for instance, make an effort to keep a level head and acknowledge the opinions of others. After a while, people will pick up on these behavioral differences and begin to view you in a new light.Figure out what you've done to earn a tarnished image and try to do the opposite. If people think you're hard to talk to, practice your conversational skills; if you're often seen as cold or insensitive, go out of your way to show more concern for those around you, etc.
Everyone has room for improvement in their interpersonal habits and characteristics, even those commonly perceived as being ""nice.""

, Come up with a projection of how you’d like to change the way people view you in a week, two weeks, a month, a year, etc. Focus on becoming more outgoing, or make a resolution to keep your cool in stressful situations, one day at a time. Keep your goals and progress written down in a notebook to serve as a reminder to exhibit the characteristics you’re trying to develop.No matter what your long-term goals are, always think day-to-day. It can be very helpful to simply say “Today, I will be more generous and caring” at the start of each day.Try to exercise your desired trait in different circumstances in your everyday life. Eventually, it will become an ingrained part of your personality.

, The thoughts and actions of the people we choose to spend our time with have a great impact on our own. If you think the company you keep might be playing a part in being negatively received by others, it may be time to make new friends. Look to become friends with individuals who have good images themselves, and reflect on what you and other people like about them. Too often, your social circles come to think of you a certain way and expect a certain type of behavior from you. It can make it difficult to shatter your current image if you feel locked into it.You don't have to completely abandon your old friends. Just make room in your life for people with the kinds of qualities you want to have.Hanging around new people can also give you a fresh chance to make a good first impression, helping you settle into your new image right off the bat. Once people begin seeing and treating you a certain way, it can be easier for you to see yourself that way, too.

, There are those might not want to give the new you a chance if they think you haven't turned over a new leaf. That's why it's important to take the first steps in changing people's minds about you. Rectify as many cases of bad behavior from the past as you can. Offer sincere apologies to people you've offended, resume friendships that were ended over petty disagreements, and erase any gossipy or vindictive posts from social media that might make you look spiteful. Your detractors will be more willing to accept a change in your image if they see that you're making a real effort.Always be the first to apologize, even if you weren't really at fault. It shows that you value your relationships more than being right.With a clear conscience, you'll be in a better position to move forward in constructing a new image.

, Before you can overhaul your image with others, you have to be able to accept your own self-image. Do this by changing the internal language that you use. Take into account the traits you want to have and start thinking about yourself in those terms. For instance, if you’re use to thinking “I’m not sure I can do this” when confronted with difficult tasks, and you want your new image to be that of a strong, self-assured leader, start telling yourself “I’ve got this, and if I fail at least I gave it my best shot.” Your actions will follow the same course as your thoughts.It can be daunting to make such a big change, but remember that many of your thoughts and characteristics are formed through behavioral patterns and can be relearned with enough conditioning.
Changing your external image starts with changing your internal attitude.

, Take account of your actions to make sure that you’re being the kind of person you want to be seen as. Remind yourself of the goals you set and the traits you’re trying to promote. Modifying your image can be a long, repetitive process of making small corrections to your behavior until they become second nature. You’ll find yourself gradually becoming more comfortable with yourself as you evolve.Audit your behavior constantly. Keep in mind the way you want to come across and choose your words and actions accordingly.

, Don’t try to do too much at once. If you've always been the shy, quiet type, there’s no use in trying to immediately transform yourself into the life of the party. Pick one or two characteristics you want to tweak and give those your attention. Once you’ve changed your patterns of thought and behavior, you can use this progress to guide yourself toward bigger, more substantive changes.Be patient. It can be disheartening to feel like people aren’t seeing you the way you want to be seen, but changing your image just takes time.
Reward yourself for small successes. Practice positive thinking by encouraging yourself whenever you break a bad habit, or react to something in a way your old self wouldn’t have.

, Though changing your image is mostly about altering the way you view and carry yourself, it’s other people that witness the image you put forth. Make sure they notice the development you’ve undergone. Let your new practiced characteristics be the ones you use to interact with those around you. With time, they’ll come to stop thinking of you the way they always have and get used to the new you.Since no one can read your thoughts, a change of image means a change in the ways you act and react toward other people. Be mindful of the way you want to come across when presenting your new image.

, Like it or not, the way you feel about yourself, and the way others view you, is closely linked to how you look. When searching for a new image, make clothing and style choices that reflect the attitude you’re trying to display. For example, wearing dark clothing can help you give off an edgier, more confident image if you’re used to wearing brightly colored clothes, or you might simply take the slouch out of your posture, smile and look people in the eye to get the message across that you’re socially at ease.Wear clothes that accentuate your new outlook. Take chances. Sometimes, a new wardrobe is all it takes for people to start looking at you differently.Body language is every bit as important for making a good impression as clothing, grooming, makeup and other accessories. In fact, your body language speaks more about your inward personality than the way you dress yourself., Use your new look to advertise your new image. Getting your appearance in order will give you the confidence to implement your new character traits and help you feel more like the person you want other people to see. Let your new clothes, style or body language serve as cues to remind you how to carry yourself. Think of your appearance as a kind of uniform that represents your desired image.Take some time to fix your appearance before dealing with people, even if it’s just to practice smiling or keeping an inviting stance. This can make you feel more self-assured.

, This could also be written ""treat others the way you wish to be seen."" The ""Golden Rule"" is an age-old adage, but it's one that's easy to forget when you're too wrapped up in your own perceptions. If everyone else doesn't seem to be viewing you the way you'd like, it may be a reflection of your actions. Make sure you're living up to the standards you've set for your new image. Remember that people form their impressions of you based on what you show them.Your reputation with others often acts as a kind of mirror for the way you're living.
Being more conscientious about how you treat people will not only help you improve your standing but bring you personal satisfaction., Making changes to your image is not the same as acting like someone you’re not. There’s no sense in acting differently if you’re not being yourself. Be yourself and listen to your intuition. If something doesn’t feel right, don’t do it, even if you want it to be part of your new image. Rather than ignoring who you are at heart, your new image should be sincere, refined by the addition of characteristics and values that you admire. It’s about becoming a better version of yourself and putting that on display to the world, not fabricating a fake persona.Your new image should be authentic in the sense that you act in a way that is consistent with your true feelings.
Acting like somebody you’re not can be emotionally exhausting and leave you feeling dissatisfied with yourself and your relationships., Change is intimidating, but it can be very empowering. Don’t give in to self-consciousness or be afraid of being different. Take pride in being honest and trying something new. Get excited about making positive adjustments to your life. Determination and persistence are necessities for becoming the person you want to be. You have a chance to let people see you in a whole new light—take it!Starting small, being sincere and doing a little at a time is key to gaining confidence in your new image.

Allow yourself to want to be hot.,
Exude self-confidence.,
Have realistic body image goals.",How to Become Hot1," Maybe you want to look like a hot guy or girl, but you're afraid you’ll be judged or looked down on. For some, wanting to be hot has negative connotations of someone being too vain or shallow. Don’t let these stereotypes and misconceptions stop you from achieving hotness. Give yourself permission to become hot.


Being hot should be something you want and not something you feel pressured to be. Today’s society puts a lot of importance in looking attractive in a certain way, but it’s not necessarily the only way to be attractive;
, In order to be hot, you have to believe you’re hot. Have confidence in your decisions, in the way you look, and in who you are or want to be. It will also help you bounce back from setbacks and accepting difficult challenges that come your way.


Remind yourself of what you’ve already achieved and enjoy these successes. Don’t forget how much you’ve accomplished and the goals you’ve reached in the process of trying to reach a new one.
Don’t put too much importance on how others perceive you. If looking hot makes you feel happy, then that’s more important than what others might think.

, You don’t have to look like a model. You should be the shape you're happy with. Half of that means changing your body through exercise and eating healthy, but the other half is accepting your body's own uniqueness.


It's understandable to want to reach a healthy weight level, but it's not realistic to achieve a tiny waist if you're naturally top-heavy or try to make your butt bigger if it's naturally petite. Don't ignore your own assets in the process of trying to mimic someone else's.
Avoid labelling a certain body type as the “perfect” body. There are many kinds of bodies that are beautiful in their own way.

Get your body in order.,

Get some masculine hobbies.",How to Become More Masculine when Feminine," There's a lot of evidence that men tend to act more confident and self-assured than women, even when they have equal qualifications.If one of your goals is to be taken more seriously or to command more authority, make it a priority to fight self-doubt and unnecessarily passive behavior. Anyone can take these steps, even people who decide to stick with a more feminine appearance:


Adopt confident body language, including straight-backed posture, eye contact, and arm positions that leave the front of your body ""open.""
Accept compliments and stop over-apologizing. (Say ""Thank you, I appreciate that."" instead of ""It's nothing."")
Practice asking for what you want and acknowledging your own abilities. (""Yes, I do have experience in ____ but I charge $___ for this kind of work."");
, Much like confidence, risk-taking is often associated with a masculine attitude. This can show up as a reckless behavior for its own sake, but a more positive aspect is the ability to push yourself to make smart but scary choices. Examine the assumptions in your life that are holding you back, and think outside the box for ways to break free. Are you only staying in your job because change frightens you? Is your romantic life suffering because you are timid about pursuing or advancing relationships? Sometimes you need to risk bold steps to get where you want.


If you get nervous about everyday risks, start facing your fear in minor ways. For example, push yourself to try something difficult in your hobby or workout. You'll either gain confidence by succeeding, or practice handling failure in a context with no major consequences.

, In most Western societies, men are expected to have thick skins and handle themselves.The next time you feel like complaining about something, stop and think. If it's just a minor annoyance, let it go without trying to seek sympathy. This may help you most in professional contexts, where avoiding grudges and gossip can make your work life much easier.


It's important to realize the negative side of this cultural pressure as well. American men are much less likely than women to seek help for serious problems, especially ones related to emotional and mental health. This makes it much harder to recover, and ironically places a burden on their friends and family who have to deal with the unresolved turmoil.It's not a virtue to pretend you can handle absolutely everything without help.

, Take responsibility for your own practical upkeep. Unless you're doing this just to meet other people's expectations, that means learning how to darn your own socks, not just ""male"" activities like changing a tire.

, Ambition and confidence in your goals are two traits often cultivated more in men than in women. Adopting a more ""manly"" attitude helps some people focus on their goals and get past the worrying stage. Whether it's a career, romance, or a personal achievement, set your eyes on the prize and find a way to start on the path today. Ask the hard questions, and work as hard as you can to answer them until you figure out your goals and know how to reach them.It's okay for things not to go your way or to find that reaching your goals is harder than you expected. React with calm and determination.

, Hyper-masculinity is the attempt to embody masculine stereotypes as fully as possible, even if they don't benefit you. These stereotypical behaviors include extreme competition (especially with other masculine people), aggressive pursuit of sex, and seeking conflict or domination (especially over feminine people). This lifestyle makes it difficult to form close relationships, since it tests boundaries and rejects cooperation. People who act in hypermasculine ways are more likely to physically or sexually abuse their partners.They may also take dangerous risks for little benefit, or feel forced into behaviors they don't enjoy in order to maintain their image.


Participating in sports and competitive games can be an excellent way to let loose your inner ""alpha male"" in a controlled context.

, What did Rafael Nadal do right after he won the 2013 U.S. Open? He cried like a baby. Does that mean he isn't masculine? Absolutely not. Past generations of men lionized the blank-faced cowboy, but it's increasingly common for masculine people to express their emotions. People of both sexes who hide their emotions are more likely to have unhappy relationships, experience severe anxiety or depression, and even develop stress-related diseases.At the very least, stay emotionally open with the closest friends and family in your life. Even in professional contexts, expressing your emotions without flinching or looking ashamed can support your masculinity by demonstrating self-assurance. If you're not at that stage, it's okay to put on a stoic face in public. Just don't be afraid to express emotion when it matters.

, If you have something constructive and useful to say, say it. A masculine conversation style revolves around assertion, and a willingness to voice your opinion even if you might make a mistake.


There's an ugly side to this divide: in mixed-gender groups, men usually dominate the discussion, and often don't realize that they are interrupting women or not giving them a chance to speak.Whether you present as a man or a woman, try to pay attention to this dynamic. The group might get a lot more out of a meeting with a more cooperative or speak-in-turn format, or a social hangout that breaks into small groups., Being masculine means knowing exactly what to do — or at least making it look that way. Admitting to a mistake or uncertainty can lead hypermasculine, competitive people to value your opinion less. Whether or not you think this is healthy, the reality is that hiding the chinks in your armor can help you win a fight when it counts. Ideally, do this in a way that doesn't bulldoze over a better idea or devolve into a pointless shouting match. If it becomes clear that your initial decision was the wrong choice, graciously propose a change without dwelling on your mistake or over-apologizing.


This works best in a debate where you are the most knowledgeable person in the room. If someone is trying to ""out-male"" you, responding in kind with a confident demonstration of your expertise is a quicker path to success than trying to compromise.

, Men tend to make many more jokes than women, even though there doesn't seem to be a major biological difference in ""funniness."" In heterosexual romance, women tend to find funny men attractive, while men like women who laugh at their jokes. If you present as male, making witty observations (even if they sometimes fall flat) may help you be seen as more masculine. People who present as female, unfortunately, have a much harder time adopting that stereotypically male style, and may get mixed reactions even when they make the same jokes.Women who want to be ""one of the guys"" can try amping up the humor, but the success may depend on how traditional their friends' viewpoints are.

, Everyone has a mix of masculine and feminine traits, not to mention non-gendered characteristics. Your masculinity will shift in style and forcefulness depending on context, and that's fine. Before you turn every conversation into a testosterone contest, remember the flip side of masculinity: the confidence to be honest without letting fear of judgement hold you back. Sometimes you need to take off the Indiana Jones hat and soften a little:


Own up to your mistakes. If you can't admit your flaws, people will characterize you as the worst masculine stereotype: someone so invested in having their way that they end up emotionally fragile and sabotaging others' success.
Don't let pride and confidence cross the line into bragging. Yes, showing off for a crush is one of the most universal masculine activities, but it gets old fast if you overdo it.

, Looking the part isn't fundamental to changing your inner behavior, but it has a huge effect on how other people treat you. In most places in the U.S., a masculine look usually involves neutral or darker tones, few if any accessories, fairly loose-fitting trousers, and leaning toward rugged or casual instead of clothes that look carefully selected or expensive.


It's impossible to lay down one masculine stye for the entire world. There are countries where men wear brightly colored robes, and social groups where a custom-tailored suit and silver cufflinks are an expression of male power. Observe your ""manly"" friends and ask them for advice if you're not sure where to start.

, If you're male, growing more facial hair is an obvious way to appear more masculine. Fuller beards or scruff are generally more masculine than a carefully trimmed style, but like clothing this varies based on context. People of either sex can adopt a shorter, simpler hairstyle, or ask a barber to recommend a more masculine look.


Even if you want to be more masculine, you should still take care of your hair and body by showering frequently enough to stay clean, but not so frequently that you don't give off some natural odor.

, If you are biologically female and want to present as male, you'll likely need to bind your chest. Whether you do or not, baggy clothing that hides your curves can make a big difference.


Use a professional binder only, avoid over-compressing, and rely on it only for short-term use. Binding your chest incorrectly can cause lasting damage., If you want to look like a man, adopt masculine body language. Stand proud and tall when you walk into a room and keep your shoulders out. Walk quickly and with purpose, and look straight ahead of you, not down at the floor. Lead with your shoulders rather than your hips. Be quick to smile and don't fidget, play with your hands, or groom yourself in public.


Look like you're happy to walk to whatever destination that lies ahead of you, even if it's your math class.
Smile at people, but don't slap a goofy smile on your face at all times. Don't bite your lip or squint with uncertainty. Instead, keep a straight face with just a slight smile and keep your eyes wide open, ready for the next challenge ahead.

, You don't have to become a bodybuilder, but physical fitness goes a long way toward a masculine appearance. Hit up the gym a few times a week, play basketball, go running to improve your cardio, go for a hike, or just do whatever makes you happy and improves your physical condition. Being masculine means being in control — and your body is one of the things that you want to have control over.


Pride in your body helps with that fundamental masculine trait: confidence. Keep in mind that almost everyone needs to work on their attitude to achieve this, not just the treadmill.

, That's right. If you want to be more masculine, then get some dirt on your body. Don't be afraid to fix your own car, mow the lawn, paint your house, or do any household chores or recreational activities that put some dirt or grease on your body. None of this makes you a man, but it might be what you're looking for if you enjoy the hands-on, practical use of your muscles that has formed the bulk of ""men's work"" for all of history.

, If you want to act more masculine, then you should take on some more masculine hobbies. It could be carpentry, motorcycle riding, taking care of your car or truck, hunting, fishing, or sports. This isn't a requirement, but it's one way to reinforce your own feelings of masculinity.

Be confident and self-assured.",How to Be Stunning," This means very few junk foods and more of the hunk foods, namely vegetables, fruits, nuts, protein sources and a little dairy. You can do your research on healthy eating, starting with How to eat healthy and you might do well to discuss it with your doctor or another qualified professional before making major dietary changes.


Drink sufficient water daily.;
, Preferably, do some form of exercise every day, at least 30 minutes in 10 minute bursts of activity. This could be as regimented as gym workouts or as random as long walks with the dog. Do whatever keeps you fit and that you'll stick at.

, For example, acne or dandruff. List these and come up with solutions, such as:


Bad breath: Brush teeth two to three times a day, floss daily and carry breath mints.
Acne: Get acne treatment and use this on a regular basis.
Dandruff: Use a shampoo specifically able to clear up dandruff.
Smelly feet: Use deodorant powder or see a doctor for advice about dealing with sweat issues or sores.
Bad nails: Cut them short and start over. See a beautician for assistance with improving the nails, or see a doctor if your nails appear unhealthy.
Yellow teeth: Use a whitening toothpaste. Most importantly, keep your teeth clean and ingesting or using things that can stain teeth long term.

, Skin care is important.


Your best bet, if you're acne prone, is to visit your local dermatologist/GP. Don't be embarrassed.

, Keep hair healthy and combed. Wash regularly (but not daily) and get it trimmed about every eight weeks( but it changes from person to person, so if it stays neat and split free for 3 months then only get it cut when you need it).


Change your style, have it up one day, down the next, etc. But don't use heated appliances too often - the heat will damage your hair.

, Remember that makeup is meant to enhance your natural beauty. For example, if you have beautiful cheekbones, learn how to use blush and bronzers to bring them out to their best advantage.


Only use the makeup that you need. The best forms of makeup to use include: Mascara, light foundation or concealer, light blusher and lip gloss.
However, you may not be a 'natural' kind of person. If you're going for a more daring look, make sure it's dramatic yet attractive, and not overdone.

, A mini manicure set is useful to have, so you can trim, file and push back your cuticles. Or, get a manicure done professionally.


Only use nail art if you really know how to do it well. Otherwise, it can look sloppy and will detract from your appearance.

, Disregard the sizes on the labels––they're there for guidance, not for self-judgment or proof of anything. If your clothes are too tight/loose, they let you down. The key is to try things on, check the look in the mirror and be absolutely honest with yourself. If the size up from the one you feel compelled to wear looks and feels better, then go for it instead; you'll be much more likely to look stunning.

, Glamorous shoes don't have to kill your feet or hobble your capacity to move gracefully and swiftly.

, Beauty starts from the inside.

, Cliché? Yes. But a true one? Yes. Don't look at this and think, ""Smile? Really? How cheesy can this get?"" Just do it. It'll help you to appear approachable and beautiful from the inside out.

, Walk tall, with a good posture. Be confident but not cocky.

Figure out what body shape you have and dress to flatter it (for women).,
Invest in clothes tailored for your body (for men).,
Polish your look by matching simple colours with bold statement pieces.,
Follow fashion trends.,
Show off a little skin or wear a form-hugging outfit.",How to Become Hot2," A great outfit should accentuate your best features and minimize unflattering parts of your body. Here are some ways to dress some common body types:Apple or circle shaped: Counter the roundness and softness of your body by adding structure to your outfit, especially on top. Wear a fitted blazer or wrap dresses that create asymmetrical lines across your body. Straight-legged pants help elongate your legs and draw attention to your body vertically. Large prints and patterns will flatter you better than small prints, especially if worn on top. Avoid covering yourself up with large or loose shirts – instead, wear more form fitted items or clothes drape down your body.

Pear or triangle shaped: Balance out your great hips by creating layers on top. A cardigan or a jacket cropped at the waist helps even out your slender top half with your curves at the bottom. Show off those great shoulders by wearing one-shouldered shirts or shirts with embellished collars. Boot-cut or slightly flared pants paired with high heels will elongate your legs.

Hourglass shaped: You’ve got the shape everyone is looking for! To better show off those sought-after curves, dress simple. Items in solid colours with cinched waists show off your small stomach. Avoid prints that take away the spotlight from your silhouette.

Athletic or ruler shaped: Your slender body can sometimes look too boxy so avoid stripes or cropped shirts. Try fitted tank tops with smaller straps, or halter-tops that enhance the look of your bust. High-waist pants and skirts give the illusion of that hourglass shape. Stick with soft fabrics that flow off your body to counter the hard lines of your athletic build.

, Learn what fit suits your body best or go to a tailor to have your clothes fitted for you. There’s nothing worse than wearing clothes that are too baggy or too tight in all the wrong places.Shoulders: The seam where the sleeve attaches to the body should rest on top of your shoulders. They should not hang down onto your arms.
Arms: The fabric under your armpits should be tapered to your skin but still allow motion for your arms.

Chest: Your chest should fill out the front of your shirt so that its shape can be seen through the fabric. You should also have a full range of motion in your arms. Try reaching up, back, and forward. If you can’t do those things, then your shirt is too tight. Buttons that looked pulled and cause wrinkles are another tell tale sign that your shirt is too tight.

Sleeves: If you’re wearing long sleeves, the cuff of your shirt should stop just at the base of your thumb.

Pants: If you’re opting for a slim-cut or skinny pant, make sure there is a straight cut from your knees to your ankles. The cuff of your pants should never create flaps or pool at your feet. They should stop just at the ankles or little past your shoes.

Belts: They should really only be a way to accessorize and should not actually be holding up your pants. If a belt is the only thing keeping your pants on, then they’re probably too big.Shoes: Many stylists claim shoes are the foundation of men’s looks. An outfit is dependent on the colour and type of shoe you're wearing. So dress from the shoes up., Solid coloured clothing items make statement pieces pop. Choose statement pieces like large earrings, patterned shoes, a colourful bag, or a fancy hat.


Black is always hot and matches with almost anything. An all black outfit gives you a clean look but also gives you a little edge and mystery.
Use the power of contrast to your advantage. Darker coloured clothing can help you achieve a more slender look or mask unappealing features. While patterns or light coloured items can highlight areas of your body you’d like to show off.

, Fashion is always changing so keep up with the latest trends to stay hot. Although, not every trend is worth following or is flattering on everyone so pick what will look good on you and what fits with your style.


Avoid age-inappropriate fashion trends. Being hot doesn't mean looking younger or more mature.

, A bit of sexiness can go a long way when you want to look hot. However, make sure it’s an appropriate amount of skin. You’ll know when you’re being too revealing when:


It gets in the way of forming meaningful relationships. We live in a sex-fuelled society, so it’s not surprising when people can’t help but look at bare skin.It can make people perceive you differently or draw focus away from what you have to offer and more towards what you look like to them. If this type of attention is not what you want, then it’s not the right moment to show off too much skin.
It prevents you from furthering your career or getting hired. In most work environments, showing off too much skin is discouraged.
You receive negative or dangerous attention. It’s difficult for many people, especially women, to show off skin without attracting negative attention. And since you can’t control other people’s reactions and actions, your safety and comfort should always come first.

Radiate confident body language.,
Get in shape.,
Have good posture.,
Choose a trendy haircut that compliments your look and face shape.,
Develop a skin care routine.",How to Become Hot3," It's not always enough to just dress the part, but you have to appear hot. And a few tricks to improve your body language can help:


Stand tall and with purpose. Stick your chest out and keep your hands from fidgeting. The power position is often described with the image of Superman with his hands at his hips, chin high, and legs apart.
Move steadily with your actions. Talking too fast or doing things in a hurry shows that you're nervous or anxious.
Have a variety of expressions on your face and body. Confident people are able to express themselves naturally but won't overdo it. This makes you more approachable and open.

, Whether you want to achieve a certain body weight goal, or just become more physically healthy, getting in shape is a great step towards becoming hot.


Invest in a gym membership or a personal trainer. With a trainer’s guided advice and encouragement, you can start to work on areas of your body and achieve weight goals in a safe and effective way.
Eat healthy. Cut down on junk foods and start eating a better balanced diet.
Exercising and eating well will make you feel more comfortable in your own skin and improve your overall mental health as well.

, Improving your posture not only makes you look more confident, but also has many health benefits. Fixing your posture can reduce head and back pain, inflexibility, and prevent compromised muscles.


Assess your posture so you can work on your body’s problem areas.Generally, your shoulders should be balanced and one shouldn’t appear higher than the other. They should also be aligned with your ear so your neck and head aren’t jutting forward. Your back should not be rounded and your arms should relax at your sides.
Do posture-improving exercises everyday. They can be simple exercises like straightening your back while sitting, walking more, or stretching out those kinks. Or they can be more complicated exercises that stretch and form your back to the correct posture.Be conscious of how you hold yourself. It’s easy to start slumping forward when you’re working at your desk or sitting down and relaxing. Make an effort to sit in the correct position with your back straight, arms back, and head and neck aligned with your shoulders.

, Try dyeing your hair, cutting it extremely short or getting extensions to mix it up every once in a while and give off a dynamic appearance.


Take care of your hair. The simplest thing you can do is wash your hair and condition it. Invest in hair products or natural remedies to fight problems such as frizzy, dry, or greasy hair.
Get a haircut every month or two to avoid split ends and the unkempt look.

, Your skin is the foundation of your look. Keep it clean and clear of blemishes and other problem factors by treating and protecting it. Try out different products to make sure they’re right for your skin.


Wear sunscreen. It’s the easiest thing to forget but a little sunscreen every day can prevent wrinkles and skin discoloration.
Moisturize your skin. Use lotion, cream, or body butter for your hands, arms, legs, and face. Lip balm helps with chapped or cracking lips.
For oily skin, use oil-free products to cleanse your face.
For acne prone skin, avoid touching your face or popping your pimples. Instead, wash your face with an acne cleanser or warm water and hypoallergenic soap and keep your skin well moisturized. Acne develops when oils, either from your fingers or overactive hormones and glands, mix together with dirt to clog up your pores.

Show your cool side.,
Play up your sex appeal.,
Be humble.",How to Become Hot4," Ironically, being hot means being cool. It’s a likeable quality to have that attracts people to you because of your laid back demeanour. A few cool things to do:


Don’t try so hard. Or at least look like you’re not trying so hard. It gives the impression that you’re so smooth, you can get want you want without even trying.
If you fidget a lot, bite your lip, stumble in your speech or am just generally nervous, try feeling cool. It’s hard to monitor or stop the nervous little ticks our body does when we're nervous so the best way to go about it is from the inside out. Feel cool and your body language will follow.Be a little rebellious. Sometimes a little rule breaking or risk-taking is very cool and makes you appear powerful. But don't do anything illegal!

, There are many ways to be sexy and look sexy. Try:


Wearing red. There have been numerous studies that the colour red is the sexiest colour. Something in our human brains are highly attracted to the colour.
Smiling. Looking happy and approachable is very sexy. So flash does pearly whites!
Making strong eye contact. This is a highly confident move that draws people in. Pair it up with a smile or flirtatious look to amp up the sexiness.
Flirting. It’s a sexy and fun way to communicate with someone you’re interested in. Subtly draw attention to your body or tease your target with flirtatious looks or bold compliments.

, The worst thing you can do is brag about how hot you are. Modesty and being gracious to others are attractive qualities. The most confident people are those who are able to build others up.


Give compliments. If you want to attract someone’s attention, pay them a genuine compliment.
Don’t brag and look down on others. The attention that comes with being hot can easily develop into a large ego. Your friends, family and other people will be turned off by someone who constantly needs to prove they’re hot or thinks too highly of themselves.

,
Recognize and acknowledge the gorgeousness and sexiness around you.",How to Become Gorgeous," This step is important.;
, This includes your: breath, body, clothes, shoes, bag, backpack, your purse and if you want to go even farther, spray a little perfume in your notebooks (if you go to school) that way, if someone wants to borrow a page or copy some notes, then it will smell like perfume, not like old books.

, Use mirrors! Make sure you don't have anything in your teeth, anything around your mouth, sleep in your eyes, sloppy makeup, or dirt under your finger nails. Clean out your ears! People really do see the inside of your ears, even if you have long hair. Also clean the back of your neck and behind your ears.

, Because no matter how clean you look if your clothes are dingy and you haven't washed your hair then you'll be a walking contradiction. You know? You won't look clean if you have greasy hair, if you have dry flakes in your hair, if you have rips or stains on your clothes, or if you have an excessive amount of dirt on your shoes.

, Whiten your teeth, get those braces and brush 2 to 3 times a day. (use mouthwash and floss too.)Do whatever you have to do to feel confident in your smile. It's your most important asset as far as nonverbal communication goes. It shows when you're happy, angry, sad, scared, or even when you're in pain. Also...

, Girl your eyes are truly the window to your soul. (but we'll get to the soul later on.) Wear makeup to play up your eye color and lengthen your eyelashes. Put Vaseline or Olive Oil on them at night to help them grow. The moisture will help them flourish. Another thing to play up your eyes is learning how to smile.

, It's actually not always about the clothes! On my bum days (sweats and slippers baby) I'm most comfortable, and therefore the people around me are more comfortable with me too. But when I'm in my jeans, gym shoes, and t-shirt I am uncomfortable, ergo people are less comfortable around me. The moral of this story is, wear what you're comfortable with. If you love high heels but you're tripping over yourself then learn to love flats. So I don't really recommend doing a wardrobe overhaul.

, Why? Because high pitched things irritate the ears. Squeaky voices aren't attractive and happen to be annoying so if you have a high pitched voice or have a tendency to have an overexcited voice then aim to lower the pitch. You don't have to sound like a surfer, just like a person with some gorgeous things to say.

, Be comfortable in your own skin. Love yourself. There are many ways to say this but it all boils down to how you feel about yourself. You can only attract things/people that are like you. So if you have a low-self esteem you're going to attract people who are going to want to take advantage of you, or OTHER people who have a low self esteem, like you. So if you love yourself then what? Get it?

, Don't take too many things too seriously. And even if something does catch your attention and you want to acknowledge it then do that in private, but in front of other people just let it roll of your shoulder.

, Have some type of flaw about you that you and others find attractive. For instance, if you snort when you laugh, only snort around your closest friends. Then when you find other people that you want to reveal that cute quirk to, then that will be something that you two can share.

, Don't share too much too fast, with anyone! Not even your best friend. Practice in private so that you can shine in public, and be abnormally well prepared. Don't ever show off though. But if you're well prepared, then when the time is right, you'll be ready. Hone your skills and talents and evolve them as much as you can and be humble when you're praised for them. This will help you to become gorgeous on the inside too!

,, Get into nature and savor that, but also recognize the good things in other people. To be gorgeous you have to know what gorgeous is. So if you see something that another girl or boy does that you think is cool, sexy etc. then don't hate on them. Make a mental note of that thing and add it to your own sexy arsenal.

Focus on lean proteins.,
Eat lots of vegetables.,
Be smart on grains, fruits, and dairy.,
Avoid sugars and too many unhealthy fats.,
Practice portion control.",How to Be Naturally Thin1," A recent study from the NIH in the UK found that on average, people who eat a low carb diet as opposed to a low fat, carb-focused diet lose more weight, maintain their weight better, and have greater loss of unhealthy cholesterol.If you want to lose weight without putting in much effort, switching to a low-carb diet (less than 40g of carbs a day) is probably your best bet.


Good sources of lean protein include chicken without the skin, turkey, salmon, anchovies, sardines, tofu, edamame, soy nuts, almonds, walnuts, and peanuts.
Try meals like turkey-sausage and eggs, spinach salad with yogurt dressing, or pan-seared chicken with a side of broccoli.
Low carb diets work by switching your body over to using fat as an energy source instead of carbs. This means that you can eat loads of fatty meat if you want to but the less fat you take in, the more of your existing fat will get burned. Choosing lean proteins will give you the greatest weight loss effect but you can balance with red meat and fatty protein once you reach a weight you're comfortable with.
About 50% of your diet should come from one of these protein sources.;
, Vegetables should make up about 30% of your remaining diet. These can be tricky though, since some contain a lot of carbs themselves. Focus on really nutrient-rich vegetables with as few carbs as possible.


Good options include spinach, broccoli, kale, brussels sprouts, and swiss chard.

, These foods can all be eaten with a healthy, low carb diet. However, you'll want to choose which ones you eat carefully and not eat them in too great a number. Your diet should remain focused on meat, nuts, and vegetables.


Dairy is a common staple of a low carb diet. However, dairy products are relatively light on nutrients so don't consume a lot of these. Make the dairy products that you do eat relatively low in fats, by choosing low-fat options. Cottage cheese is a good example.
You can still eat grains on a low carb diet but you'll have to eat only small portions. Choose nutrient-dense grains with a high protein count in order to make these fit with your diet. Good grain options include quinoa and oatmeal.
Fruits contain lots of sugar and carbs, so try to similarly choose very nutrient rich options. A kiwi is a good option, since just one fruit contains more than an entire day's worth of vitamin C and only 13-16 g of carbs., Avoiding eating any foods with a lot of sugar or unhealthy fats. Unhealthy fats include saturated and trans fats and can usually be identified because they are usually solid at room temperature. You should, however, eat lots of healthy fats.


You'll find sugar in soda, juice, candy, and fruit.
Unhealthy fats are usually found in red meats, processed meats, butter, and cheese.
Sources of healthy fats include salmon, anchovies, sardines, and eggs.

, Even on a low carb diet, you want to avoid overeating. This means that you need to control the size of the meals that you eat. Try to learn how to recognize when your body is full.


Try eating from a small side plate instead of a standard dinner plate. Wait 15 minutes after you finish the plate before taking seconds. Sometimes your brain doesn't get the stomach's signals right away.
Remember that sometimes when you feel hungry you're really just thirsty or bored. Try dealing with those feelings first before resorting to food.

Try to avoid sitting for long periods.,
Walk as much as you can.,
Take up an active hobby to adopt a slimming lifestyle change.,
Fill your waiting time with activity to burn calories without even trying.,
Exercise as much as possible to stay naturally thin.",How to Be Naturally Thin2," Sitting around uses very little of the energy that your body takes in. Just standing alone burns more energy than sitting does. If you can get up and move in more ways than just standing, you'll be even better off.









Switch to using a standing desk if you can. You can also walk around while you study or record audio instead of sitting down at your desk to type.
Long periods of sitting have also been found to be linked to many negative health conditions., Walking may not be as effective as running but it will help you to burn some calories and help maintain your weight. Even if you don't have the time to take a walk on purpose, at least try to sneak in reasons to walk a little bit more in your day. For example, you can:









Park further away when you drive somewhere.
Take the bus instead of driving to get somewhere.
Always take the stairs instead of the elevator or escalator.
Take a walking lunch or meeting, making a few laps around your building while you eat or talk.

, Having something to do for fun that also gets you burning calories can go a long way towards keeping you thin without any extra ""work"". Try finding a new hobby that you can either do on your own or maybe as part of a club.









You can find many activities through your local college clubs (even for non-students), as well as community centers and community colleges. Scholarships will often be available for those with a low income.
Try hobbies like rock climbing, adventure photography, or dance. Even theater can mean lots of physical activity.

, When you're waiting for something, try to sneak in just a little bit of physical activity. Even a few minutes, while perhaps not enough to get the full health effects, can at least help you burn more calories than if you'd just sat around refreshing Tumblr.









Do squats while you wait for your dinner to cook.
Do planks or jumping jacks while you wait for the commercials to finish during your favorite show.

, If you can make time for it, exercising is definitely one of the most effective ways to keep yourself thin. Just 30 minutes a day of intense physical activity is all that's recommended for adults, and even that can be split into two fifteen minute sections and still give the same benefits.









Make what exercise you do do count by doing efficient, full body exercises. Once good example of a full body exercise is the burpee. This exercise looks complicated but is actually easy to do and requires no extra equipment.

Invest in some good shapewear.,
Wear underwear and clothes that fit.,
Wear colors and patterns strategically.,
Choose smart clothing cuts.You can also use how a piece of clothing is cut, what it's shape is, to help make you look thinner.,
Distract with accessories.",How to Be Naturally Thin3," Shapewear is a type of clothing which goes under your street clothes. It is made using a lot of carefully shaped, strong elastic which helps mold your body into one streamlined shape. While cheap versions will have a marginal effect, a really good pair are worth investing in because the difference will be noticeable.


The most common brand name of shapewear is Spanx. Generally you can purchase shapewear in any large department store.
When you have a streamlined shape, even if it doesn't remove many inches from your waist it will still make you look thinner. This is because people generally perceive rolls as indicating that a person is ""fat"". The lack of them will do just the opposite.

, Much like you want to smooth rolls with shapewear, you also want to make sure that you aren't creating any rolls (whether you're wearing shapewear or not). The best way to do this is by wearing clothes that fit. They should be neither to big nor too small, instead fitting your body as well as possible. You should have room for movement but most items should not be so loose that they drape.

, Using colors and patterns can help you to create the illusion of a more slender shape, even if you don't have one.


Black classically makes you look thinner, by keeping the eye from seeing shadows which help us perceive depth.
You can also use bright colors contrasted with neutral colors to draw attention to a different part of your body, like your calves or feet.
Vertical stripes will also make you look taller and thinner, wile horizontal stripes should generally be avoided for making you look shorter and wider.

, Play around with how different outfits make you look to find the right lines and shapes for your body. Everyone will look different in different clothing combinations.


Use a cinched waist and full skirt, for example, make your waist look super small.

, You can also use accessories to direct the eye and make yourself look thinner. Use bold hats or shoes to draw the eye to naturally small parts of your body. Also, much like with horizontal stripes, you can use long thin pieces (like scarves and necklaces) to make you look taller and thinner.

Sleep more.,
Get a haircut.,
Consider growing a beard.,
Keep your skin clear.",How to Be More Physically Attractive (Men)1," If you don't get enough sleep, or your sleep is interrupted through the night, you'll end up having more wrinkles on your forehead, and your eyes and cheeks will be redder if you're fair skinned.Try to go to bed earlier if you aren't getting enough sleep at night. If your sleep is interrupted by a medical condition like sleep apnea or you have insomnia, talk to your doctor about treatments that can help you get a good nights rest.


Adults between the ages of 18-64 require seven to nine hours of sleep per night, while teenagers require eight to ten hours of sleep.;
, If you feel like you're stuck and can't change your look, consider getting a new haircut. If you've had the same style forever, you may be surprised at how much it can change your look. Your hair helps frame your face, so think about your facial features and how to best compliment them.For example, if you have a thick jaw, it may be a good idea to grow your hair out on the sides to balance your face.
Experiment with different haircuts and ask your friends what looks best.
Ask a stylist for suggestions. You can say, ""I'm going for a suave and sophisticated look. Do you have any ideas?""
If you like a haircut of an actor or musician, bring in a picture of him and see if the stylist can replicate it.

, Growing a beard may make you more attractive. It all depends on the existing symmetry and construction of your face, and your ability to grow facial hair. The most attractive facial hair is ""heavy stubble"" or a beard that hasn't been shaved in about ten days.If your beard grows out in patches, consider staying clean shaven or try to grow a goatee.
Growing a beard can make your chin look broader.

, Clear skin indicates that someone is healthy and happy, while acne prone skin can be a turnoff for some people.Wash your face daily and try to find moisturizers and face scrubs that work with your skin. If you are having problems with keeping your skin clear, consider changing your diet so it includes more fruits and vegetables and make an appointment to see a dermatologist who can diagnose and treat your acne or any skin rashes.


Olive oil, tomatoes, and dark chocolate have been shown to promote clear skin.Consuming an excess of unhealthy and sugary foods can lead to bad skin."

But if you're the first one to make jokes, if you participate in a little self-deprecating humor, they'll be much less likely to make them. It will also make them like you more because it will be clear that you have a good sense of humor, and people like that.


""You wanna come grocery shopping with me? I'm tired of having to rely on that creepy guy in aisle three to reach the top-shelf shampoo for me.""
""I may be even shorter than Woody Allen but I'm also way more charming."";
, People will tease you about how you look so young or you're so little, but don't worry about it. We hate looking younger when we're young, but short people get to look younger even when they're old, and that's awesome. You're going to look young and hot for years after they start looking old and gross.

, When people tease you, point out that they are average size and who would want to be average? Not you! You're unique and just can't fit in that average label. Boring!

, You might get teased about how you're going to find someone to date because of your size. But what they forget about is that there are lots of other average or small size people. Shorter/average size guys will want a short girl because they might not want to date a girl that's taller than them, and average size girls will have fun dating a guy that's their same size (because making out works a lot better!).

, Another common joke is that you'll always get picked last in sports. But don't worry about this. Tell people that the reason you have to get picked last is because picking you first would give the team an unfair advantage: you're way too much awesome to have in a team all at once and they need to balance you out first with guys that suck.

, You're not short. It's not fun to think of yourself as short. So find another term or phrase to use when people call you short. Make it funny and you'll get a lot of laughs and people will like you more. So now when someone calls you short you'll be able to say, ""No I'm not, I'm..."":


""...travel sized for your convenience.""
""...vertically challenged!""
""...height disadvantaged.""
""...fun sized.""
""...playing it safe with gravity.""
""...enjoying the weather down here better.""

, You may hear that companies don't really make clothes for girls who are short, but don't think this will keep you from getting clothing. Short girls have way more options for a number of reasons. First, you can also shop in the teen section, which often has really cute clothes which are cheaper than the stuff in the women's section. Second, the smaller sizes are less in demand, so you will have a better chance of finding things on the rack or in the bins. It's also the fringe sizes, like the really small clothes, that go on sale most often.

, Yeah, your pants drag on the floor. It sucks. But you have an option open to you that tall people do not: you can get them hemmed. Either learn to sew (either by hand or with a machine) and you'll have clothes that fit in no time. You can also easily get clothes tailored. This isn't as expensive as it sounds.

, Everyone else is going to struggle to sit in crowded planes or trains. Meanwhile, for you, everything is like first class. Stretch those legs out! Suckers!

, Because you look more like a little kid, older people and even people your own age are going to assume you're super innocent. You can use this to your advantage and get out of all sorts of trouble and situations you'd rather not be in.

, There are a lot of short and pretty people in the world. Plus, if you're tiny and so are your features, you can be classed as cute-and that's pretty sweet. So don't feel so down about being short. If you're a man, remember that men get judged on a lot of things besides their appearance - jockeys are great athletes too. Skills, successes, fitness, brains and resources can make you very attractive to women.Other than this short guys and tall women do look good together .No matter what people say if you are a good person and your mindset is healthy you can conquer this world.

, Soccer, rugby, cycling, gymnastics, figure skating: there are lots of sports where being short is a huge advantage! Take advantage of this and boost your confidence by being the person that everyone wants on their team.

, Lots of totally cool people are actually super short. Tom Cruise is only 5'7"". Daniel Radcliffe is only 5'5""! As for girls, lots of famous actresses are 5'3"" or shorter, like Vanessa Hudgens (5'1""), Reese Witherspoon (5'1""), and Snookie is only 4'8""!

, Find things that you like about how you look. Maybe work out and get a nicer body over-all. Realistically, you have to remember that when people are looking for someone to date seriously, height is usually going to matter the least after general appearance personality, and work ethic. Find confidence in other things that people will find attractive and you won't have to worry about your height.

, You should develop your confidence in things other than how you look, because this is a healthier mindset anyway. Learn a cool skill, travel around and have lots of experiences, or even just do something great like volunteering. This will make you proud of yourself and build your confidence.Work hard and built a good career if you can.Really a rich wife /girlfriend is automatically beautiful,believe it or not. A rich guy even better.

, You can make a short body look perfectly nice. Just wear clothes that fit and make you look proportional. Girls can wear heels if they want, and guys can sometimes get an extra inch out of platform shoes. Work with what you've got and you'll find that most people won't even notice.


You should also remember that while you can make yourself taller, really tall people can't make themselves shorter. You got the better deal.

, You're awesome! People will perceive you the way you want to be perceived, so when you start thinking you're great, other people will follow. Tell yourself every day how awesome you are, take good care of yourself because you deserve it, stop the internal dialogue about how much you suck, and maybe make a list of all the things you like about yourself.


If you don't have a lot of things that you like about yourself, then work on that! You are more than your height, just as everyone else is. I mean, if height was all that was important, no one would like Tom Cruise. Find reasons to be proud of yourself because you should be proud of yourself. You're great!

, Tall people will have all sorts of their own problems to deal with and things that make them uncomfortable. It's a good case of be careful what you wish for, so just be happy with yourself the way you are.

, If you're young, even as old as 18 or 19, you should keep in mind that you might still get taller. Many people are ""late bloomers"" and gain an extra several inches much later than people their same age. If you notice that your parents are average height or taller, you'll probably get there in time.

Keep the makeup that suits you best.,
Wear a mini-skirt if you want.,
Follow the rule of two if you want a sexy and dignified look.,
Keep your shoes like you - sexy, but dignified.,
Update the hair.,
Exercise as always.,
Stand tall and strong.",How to Be Sophisticated and Sexy at 40," If you have a style you like now, keep it. If not, get some advice on changing it. We all need a change now and then, not just because we've turned 40 but because it does us good to look good and to update when we're feeling frumpy.;
, Old fashioned nonsense about not wearing this and not wearing that just because of your age is out the window. If you've got great legs, you're not about to saw them off are you? Think Desperate Housewives, think Elizabeth Hurley, think of all those great women in their 40s wearing what they know looks good on them and not listening to a 16 year old or a 26 year old telling you what to wear. Respect comes from what's inside, not from the clothing.

, Split yourself in two - top and bottom. Now add two categories - tight and revealing. If your top is tight or revealing, keep the bottom plain. If the bottom is tight or revealing, keep the top modest. If low cut, wear it with a jacket. Also, if you have exceptionally nice calves, a knee-skirt can look good. Keep suits in conservative colors if that is your daily requirement, but add interesting quirks. A black business suit, with a high-quality, silk, black and turquoise top, can be paired with turquoise heels.

, Heels are good if they work for you and low-pumps are acceptable attire. Consider the kitten-heel; enough heel to be business like, but also very trendy. By now, though, telling you how to wear a shoe is a little on the side of bad mannered. You know by now what works best.

, One thing many women do get into a bad habit with is hair - forgetting it has outgrown current needs. Seek an honest appraisal from a good hairdresser and set things straight. You'll feel like a new woman.

, Never stop exercising. This will not only help your physical appearance by making you look younger, but you will also have improved emotional health. It also helps to guard against potential oncoming problems such as osteoporosis and breast cancer.

, You're in your 40s and you're beautiful. You're also wiser, often wealthier (and if you're not, start saving now) and you're still the wonderful woman you've always been. Don't let the media, misguided youth and outdated notions tell you otherwise.

Identify the source of your lack of confidence.,
Address your body image perception.,
Write down your positive attributes.,
Analyze your positive attributes.,
List your best features.,
Look in the mirror.,
Be skeptical of the media.,
Work on positive re-framing.,
Keep a confidence journal.,
Seek counselling.",How to Be Confident in Your Looks1," Figuring out why you lack confidence can help you target those feelings. Start writing a ""self-esteem"" journal, where you note when you feel more and less confident about the way you look. After a week or two, look back at your notes and try to find patterns to the way you feel.


Were you more confident in any of the following situations: after spending more time grooming or getting ready, if you dressed a certain way, spending time in smaller groups, spending time away from certain individuals, or spending less time on social media or looking at celebrity media?Are there any ""bigger"" issues, such as your employment status or personal troubles that seem to trigger your feelings of low confidence? Some people turn this type of anxiety towards their self-perception, which may seem easier to deal with than the “bigger” problem of job security or personal problems.If you don't see any patterns or you're still not sure what is causing your lack of confidence, you may want to try a number of different tips to find what seems to help the most.;
, Dr Vivian Diller has a number of different cognitive behavioral techniques for improving your confidence in your looks, which she calls “beauty self-esteem.”These techniques focus on evaluating the source of your self-esteem, questioning your negative opinion of your looks, and thinking about ways to think about your looks more positively.


Focus on sitting up straight with your chest pushed out while doing the following steps for maximum confidence., Write the 3 things about your looks and the 3 things about your personality that you like the most. Place all 6 items in order of importance and write 1 sentence about each. For example, “I help others. I volunteer every week for a local charity and always call my friends back right away when they need to talk.”

, Notice where the physical features ranked relative to your personality features; most people rank personality features above physical features, which emphasizes not only that our self-esteem is influenced more about how we feel about our personality but also that others’ opinion of us is likely more influenced about personality too.

, Write down the 3 physical features that you think are most appealing to you, using a sentence to describe each one. For example, “My long curly hair - especially just after I leave the hair salon and looks so full and bouncy” or “My broad shoulders, especially when my girlfriend puts her head on my shoulder for comfort.”


This exercise shows that everyone has features they can be proud of. These features can be accentuated by clothing choice.

, Look at yourself in the mirror and see what thoughts come into your head. Whose words are they: your own or someone else’s? Whose words do they remind you of: a bully’s, a parent’s or a friend’s?


Question the accuracy of the words in your head: Are your muscles really smaller than most people’s? Are your hips really that big? Are you really that much taller than other people? Do any of those things really matter?
Think about how you would talk to a friend. How is it different than your self-talk, and how can you get yourself to think positively about yourself instead of using the critical or negative tone you likely used to begin with?
Find what you like about yourself in the mirror and from now on, whenever you look in the mirror, look at this attribute rather any perceived negative attributes you normally focus on.

, Remember that the media portrayal of the body is designed to make you feel bad about yourself because that is what gets you to buy products and new clothes. Not only are the body images portrayed not average, they are often helped by digital enhancement using software like Adobe Photoshop. People who recognize this and are more media savvy often have better self-perceptions. , If you find yourself having negative thoughts about the way you look, stop yourself and re-frame it as something positive. For example, if you think your nose is too big, stop and remind yourself that you have a strong, unique profile. If you think you are overweight, think about your awesome curves and plan what lifestyle changes you can make.

, Every night before you go to sleep, write down 3 positive things about yourself. Then in the morning, read them and add two more. It's okay to repeat what you have said before. The more positive self-thought you have, the better your overall self-esteem will become.

, If your negative self-perception persists, you may want to consider seeing a therapist. Your thoughts about the way you look may be related to deeper issues that you're not fully aware of, and counselling can help you have a healthier self-esteem in general.

Dress to feel confident.,
Wear red and black colored clothes.,
Be yourself.",How to Be More Physically Attractive (Men)2," When you wear nice clothes, you feel good. Feeling confident and comfortable will make you appear more physically attractive to other people.Try to dress nicer than those around you. Make sure that your clothes are well fitted and not too baggy or tight. If you have no fashion sense, or you're not sure what to wear, ask a friend or a sales associate for advice.


Keep your clothes clean, pressed, and neat. For the most part, this will make you appear more attractive., Red and black are the most attractive colors that men can wear. Wearing these colors has a biological significance that makes you subconsciously more attractive to other people. Black and red demonstrate dominance, attractiveness, and aggressiveness in men, and could enhance your look.Your style of dress still matters regardless of the color. If you look offputting or antisocial, the general public probably won't find you attractive.

, While following these steps will help you appear more attractive to the general public, being yourself also plays a key role in how other people perceive you. Dressing in an outfit that feels forced or unnatural will hurt your outward confidence. Being yourself will enhance your attractiveness to others.Just because other people don't like a certain style of dress doesn't mean that you shouldn't.
Try to inject your personal style into your clothing. For example, if you're known to be more energetic, try wearing bright colors to represent your light personality.

Maintain good hygiene.",How to Be More Physically Attractive (Men)3," Keep good posture by putting your shoulders back and holding your head high. Slouching over or having bad posture shows a lack of confidence and will make you appear less attractive to others.Practice maintaining good posture throughout your day by being aware of how your back is curved while you sit or stand. When you notice yourself slouching over, correct your posture.


If you are prone to slouching over, it may take some time to change the behavior.

, Lean muscle is perceived to be the most attractive body types for men. Try to maintain a fat to muscle ratio of 16% fat and 80% muscle to appear more attractive. A personal trainer of physician will be able to calculate your fat to muscle ratio.. Stay within the moderate rep range, or 10-12 reps, with a weight that remains challenging.Hit the gym or do exercises at home to achieve a leaner, more muscular body.


Do cardio exercises, like running, along with weightlifting exercises like the bench press, leg press, squats, and curls.
You can also join a sports team or take up an active hobby to help work out your body.
Exercises that will help build lean muscle include rock climbing and swimming.
People's tastes all differ, and some will not like the lean muscle.
Work out to feel more confident in your skin and aim to be a healthier person.
Some guys won't be able to attain a lean or muscular body, but it's okay. As long as you are working towards your goal, your chances of being perceived as being more attractive go up.

, Being tan is considered to be attractive by most people's contemporary standard of beauty.To get a tan, you can lay out under the sun, go to a tanning salon, or get a topical spray on tan.The sun isn't the only way to tan. Eating certain vegetables will give you what's known as a Carotenoid tan, which when paired with a melanin tan, or natural tan, will make you appear more attractive.To get a Carotenoid tan, make sure you're regularly eating fruits and vegetables like sweet potatoes, tomato juice, carrots, red peppers, cantaloupe, and melon.Tanning under UV light has been linked to cancer.
The tan you get from Carotenoids is sometimes referred to as a ""glow.""
Other than making you more attractive, most Carotenoids are also healthy for you.

, Maintaining your personal hygiene is an important factor when talking about your physical attractiveness. If you smell bad or look dirty, others will perceive it as negative. Things like a bad odor or unkempt clothing will often turn people off.Remember to use underarm deodorant and shower or bathe every day. Brush your teeth so your breath smells good.


Having good personal hygiene can also prevent harmful health conditions like head lice, athlete's foot, and infections."

Wear clothes that make you feel comfortable.,
Wear clothes that accentuate the physical features you like.,
Wear clothes in the appropriate size or have them tailored.,
Wear the right lipstick.,
Apply make-up based on your face shape.,
Get a good haircut.,
Stay well-groomed.",How to Be Confident in Your Looks2," The clothes you wear can really have an effect on your self-esteem. For example, wearing a superhero costume can boost confidence and make people feel stronger; women perform better on a math test in a sweater than in a swimsuit; and a white coat gives people more “mental agility.”Focus on wearing clothes that make you feel comfortable, such as a nice soft sweater, your favorite jeans, and a suit and tie (or something else professional looking).
Examine your wardrobe and make sure your clothes fit your style. If they don’t, you may need to go shopping! If you dislike shopping in public or don’t know what is in style, consider a service that selects clothes for you and sends them to your house or find an online retailer with an easy free return policy.
Wear colors that you like. Doing so will help boost your mood. If you can’t decide on a color you like, a good go-to color is blue because people general respond positively to it., Find outfits that will look good to you when you look in a mirror because they match your body type or include accessories that show off your good features. There is no perfect body type, but there are good and bad clothes for particular body types. Clothes that fit because they match your type are more likely to look good on you.If you are very skinny, avoid wearing dark colors, such as black, which are slimming. Wear lighter colors instead. Slim women should try to create some curve by belting a flowing dress in the center.Thin men should avoid wearing large or baggy clothing to add the appearance of bulk; dressing in the appropriate size will look better.If you have broad shoulders and narrow hips, avoid scarves with patterns (calling attention to your shoulders), shirts that accentuate your shoulders, and footwear that looks small for your body type, but do wear pants that make your hips look bigger and shoes with wider heels or boots with buckles that call attention to your feet.
If your body is pear-shaped, wear bright colors or patterns on top and dark, solid colors on the bottom and avoid horizontal stripes, particularly on the bottom.If you have a round body type, avoid too much fabric in the middle of your body, belts, and skirts less than knee-length, but do wear details above your bust line and below your hipline.
If you have a curvy body shape, try clothing that is skinny at the waist but flowy at the top and bottom. This will accentuate your curves and downplay your legs a bit., Wearing clothes that fit you at your current weight and height will make you feel better about the way you look, even if the clothes are not the ideal size you want to be.


Special order clothes in sizes that actually fit you. If you are a very tall and skinny man, for example, you may need to order Medium Tall sizes online rather than settling for clothing in the store that is too wide and baggy on you because it is the appropriate length.
Have clothing tailored for length or width to fit you well. Tailors also know tricks like adding darts (folded sections of fabric that create a flattering shape) to clothing to accentuate positive features such as curves.

, Using lipstick well means more than just selecting the right color; it also means taking care of your lips as a part of your overall look by exfoliating (eg, with a mixture of salt and almond oil) and applying balm twice a week. For the lipstick itself, makeup artists recommend the following:Avoid lipstick that shimmers and sparkles because it tends to look cheap
Choose a bright color based on your lip color (eg, pale lips=cherry lipstick, natural=cranberry, and dark lips=burgundy).
Choose a nude color based on your skin tone (choose something slightly brighter or deeper than your skin).
Avoid blue or black based shades, as they tend to make you look older, more severe, and yes, even scarier (think vampire).
Liner is not necessary, but when you use it, pick a color that matches your lips, not the lipstick.
Apply lipstick carefully then smudge the border slightly for a softer effect.
Apply starting in the center and then blend the color towards the corners, careful not to apply directly to the corners of your mouth.
Apply strong lipstick shades to the bottom lip and then press your lips together for a lighter application.
Apply lipstick once, blot your lips on a tissue, and apply again for a longer lasting effect.

, Although makeup is not for everyone, those who use makeup can improve their self-image by becoming more educated on how to use makeup to improve their confidence in their looks. Just as with clothes, the goal is to match your shape (in this case face shape) and direct the eyes to the features you want to accentuate. To determine your face shape, pull your hair back and look in the mirror at your hairline and chin:Heart-shaped faces (broad forehead and pointed chin) should draw focus away from their prominent chin and cheekbones with soft tones on the face and color on the lips.
Rounded faces (forehead and lower face are the same width) should help add definition using makeup on the cheeks and eyes (eg, using smoky eye shadow).
Square faces (Angular jawbone and hairline) should use soft colors on the skin, mouth, and eyes to soften facial features.
Oval faces (forehead and lower face are same width with longer sides) should apply blush with horizontal strokes and define their eyes and lips to reduce the length of their face.

, A great haircut from a stylish salon or respectable barber shop can make you feel more confident about your looks and will give you a more up-to-date, fashionable style. As with makeup, the key to a good hairstyle is to match the shape of your face:Heart-shaped faces should consider bangs and side-parts with chin-length hair that helps to round out the face more.
Round faces should consider a center or slightly off-center part and “face-framing layers” that minimize the fullness and create “a more chiseled illusion.”
Square faces should consider “face-framing layers” and a side-part that draws attention to the cheekbones.
Oval faces should find that most styles work for them as the techniques for other face shapes are meant to make the face look more like oval-shaped faces.

, Looking like you thought about your appearance and are taking care of yourself can boost your confidence and can be achieved with a few simple grooming tips:Keep your nails trimmed and shaped neatly (women and men can benefit from this tip). Be sure your nail beds are clean.
Brush your teeth several times daily, particularly after meals with tooth-gunk potential.
Keep moist wipes and cleansing cloths with you to clean off makeup, sunscreen, and sweat, or just to refresh yourself after a few stressful hours. Make sure to also do a full facial wash every 2 to 3 days to keep your skin clear.
Use an anti-aging moisturizer, sun protector, and concealer (to even out skin tone).
Use your fingers (as opposed to brushes) to apply makeup and get a better feel (literally) for how much makeup you are applying that can lead to a more natural look.
Use press-on nails for a quick manicured look. Even for people who experienced the 80’s, they are more socially acceptable today than you might realize!
Apply a deodorant or antiperspirant regularly.
Use natural oils (eg, avocado, coconut, or almond) to keep your body and hair moisturized.

Choose your friends wisely.,
Smile and laugh as much as possible.,
Take a compliment.,
Exercise regularly.,
Eat a healthy diet.",How to Be Confident in Your Looks3," Pay attention to your friends and how they make you feel. Surround yourself with people who don’t criticize or judge you because it can negatively affect your body image.Friends can even help you work towards your health and fitness goals, which may help you feel more confident in your looks as well. Find a gym partner or a hiking buddy.

, As easy and obvious as it sounds, smiling, even when you are forced to do it, can lower stress and make you feel better about yourself.Furthermore, people will see you as approachable and trusting., If you get a compliment, don’t deflect it, take it!If you are uncertain about your looks, it may feel awkward to get compliments and your anxious reaction might be to deflect or down-play the compliment. For example, if someone compliments your shirt, you might tell them it is a hand-me-down that you only wore because all of your other clothes are dirty. This is a reflection of your anxiety about your looks and can make both you and the person who complimented you uncomfortable. Instead, just say thank you and fully enjoy the compliment you earned.

, Whether or not exercise actually changes your physical appearance, it can change your perception of yourself, which can lead to increased self esteem. A national survey of physical activity and weight has shown that people who were not satisfied with their body size were less likely to be physically active, regardless of how much they actually weighed. This finding suggests that just being physically active can be related to a better self-image. The amount of exercise needs to be enough to give you a sense of accomplishment and needs to be regular, but does not need to be any specific type of exercise or be done for any specific amount of time.

, Certain foods, such as those high in carbohydrates and sugar, can cause you to become sluggish and negatively affect your mood. Foods that can improve your mood are those that are low in fat and release their energy slowly. These foods give energy for sustained periods of time and do not carry the risk of weight gain, bloating, and irritability; they can also lead to stronger hair and nails, which can improve your overall self-image.Avoid eating foods that are sugary, fried, or overly processed.Eat more nuts and seeds, legumes, and fresh fruits and vegetables, particularly produce with vibrant, rich colors."

There are a number of different salt types you can use, including table salt, sea salt, Himalayan salt, Dead Sea salt, kosher salt, or Epsom salt.


Sea salt and Epsom salt are some of the most common salts used in these scrubs. The type of salt you use isn't as important as the grind. For a salt scrub, choose finely ground salt over coarse salt, because fine salt is better at exfoliating.
You can also combine different types of salts together in one scrub.
You can also substitute white sugar, brown sugar, coffee, oatmeal, or ground nut shells for all or part of the salt called for in the recipe.;
, The carrier oil is the base that will keep the salt scrub together, but it will also moisturize your skin. You can use specialty oils or oil you have on hand in the pantry. To prevent slips in the shower, choose a thin- or medium-consistency oil that will be washed away easily:Grape seed and jojoba oils are thin and have very faint aromas
Sweet almond oil has a medium consistency and a mild aroma
Vegetable, olive, and canola oils are medium and have little aroma
Coconut oil is medium and has a very strong, sweet aroma
Peanut, walnut, and hazelnut oils are thin to medium and have nutty aromas
Castor oil is thick and difficult to wash off

, A salt scrub doesn’t need anything other than salt and an oil, but you can add fragrances and essential oils if you want to change the aroma of your scrub. You can pick fragrances that you like, that suit different seasons, or that are holiday-specific. Be sure they are suitable for use on the skin.


Citrus oils like lemon, orange, and grapefruit are fresh, energizing, and great for spring- and summer-themed scrubs.
Flower oils like ylang-ylang, rose, and geranium are sweet and summery.
Peppermint and cinnamon are invigorating oils that are also great for Christmas and winter scrubs.
Lavender, vanilla, chamomile, and frankincense can be very calming fragrances., Find a glass jar with an airtight lid to store your scrub. Pour the salt into the container, followed by the carrier oil. Finally, add some drops of essential oils or fragrances until you achieve an aroma and strength you like. Stir the mixture well before using., When you’ve finished with your salt scrub, put on the airtight lid. Store the scrub in a cool, dry location, such as a bathroom cupboard. Because salt is a preservative, the scrub could last anywhere from one to two years without going rancid.Sugar is also a preservative, but a sugar-based scrub will only last for a few months.

, Citrus scrubs are great for the morning because they're fresh and invigorating. They're also nice for after a workout or nap. To make a citrus scrub, combine in a glass jar:The fine sea salt
Sweet almond or jojoba oil
Zest from an orange, lemon, lime, or grapefruit, or a combination

, Coconut oil is cooling and moisturizing for the skin, so it makes a nourishing oil to use in salt scrubs. Combine the coconut oil, Epsom salts, and 8 to 10 drops of essential oils in a glass jar and stir until you achieve a smooth consistency.Good essential oil pairings for this include:


Vanilla
Patchouli
Orange
Rose
Geranium

, A degreasing salt scrub is great for washing your hands after cooking, working in the yard, or doing maintenance in the garage. The liquid castile soap in the recipe eliminates the need to use soap, and the salt works to scrub away dirt and grime.Combine the salt, grapeseed oil, and soap in a glass jar. Add 12 drops of essential oils. Stir to combine, and store the degreasing salt scrub at kitchen, bathroom, laundry, and utility room sinks.

, A coffee salt scrub is another great way to start your morning, and is an alternative to the citrus scrubs that people often use. To make this scrub:Mix together the salt and coffee.
Add in room temperature coconut oil (it will be soft and easy to stir)
Stir to combine.

, This multicolored salt scrub is great for the holidays, and makes an excellent gift. To make this scrub, combine the salts, oil, and six drops of peppermint oil in a mixing bowl. Stir to combine, and then divide the mixture in half, pouring one half into a second mixing bowl.Use the red food coloring to color one batch red. Stir to distribute the coloring evenly throughout the mixture.
Use a spoon to add a layer of the red scrub to the bottom of a glass jar. Pack the layer down. Spoon a layer of white over top of the red. Continue alternating like this until the jar is full or you run out of salt scrub.
Other colorants you can use to dye salt scrubs include FD&C water-based liquid dyes for vibrant colors, or pearlescent mica powders for shimmery and pale colors., Draw a bath or run a shower. Hop in for a few minutes and get your skin nice and wet. This will make it easier to spread the salt scrub over your skin.


To scrub just your feet or hands, fill a bucket or bowl with water and soak your feet or hands for a few minutes.
You can also use a salt scrub on your face, but be very gentle, and avoid your eyes. Fill a sink with some water and use your hands or a face cloth to wet your face.

, Open the jar of salt scrub and use a spoon to stir the mixture. Spoon out a tablespoon (15 g) of salt scrub and place it in your palm. Gently rub the salt scrub into dry or rough areas of skin, such as your hands, feet, and elbows.Rub in a circular motion for one to two minutes to exfoliate and remove dead skin.


If you use a salt scrub on your face, be very gentle when rubbing your skin. Do not get the salt scrub in your eyes.
It’s important to use a spoon for the scrub, otherwise bacteria, soap, and water from your hands may contaminate the mixture.

, After gently rubbing the scrub into your skin, rinse the salt scrub off under running water. If you're in the bath, dip the scrubbed area under the water and rinse the salt away.


For normal skin types, don’t use a salt scrub or exfoliate your skin more than twice per week.Over-exfoliating can lead to dry, red, itchy, and sensitive skin.
For oily skin, use a salt scrub two or three times per week.
For dry skin, only use a salt scrub once weekly, or as needed to remove dry skin.

, The sugar will help further exfoliate your skin. For something even more exfoliating, you can use raw cane or palm sugar.


For an even more exfoliating scrub, use sea salt instead., If you can't find any, you can use other types of food-grade oil, such as almond oil or grape seed oil.If you are using coconut oil, melt it in the microwave first, then let it cool slightly.

, You will need ½ teaspoon of vanilla extract and/or 1 teaspoon of ground cinnamon. These are not completely necessary, but they will make your scrub smell delightful, just like a latte!, Ideally, the scrub should feel like wet sand. If it is too dry for your liking, add a little bit more oil. If it is too wet for your liking, add a little bit more sugar.

, The oil, sugar, and coffee may separate over time. If this happens, simply stir the scrub up using a spoon or your finger. The scrub should last up to two months. If it does start to smell or look strange before then, throw it out and make a new one.


If you used coconut oil to make your scrub, store it at room temperature so that the coconut oil doesn't harden too much.
Use a glass jar, if you can. The oil in the scrub may degrade plastic over time; glass will last much longer.
If you wish to give the scrub away as a gift, consider sticking a personalized label onto the lid., Scoop up 1 to 2 tablespoons of the scrub into the palm of your hand.

Before you begin, be aware that the scrub can cause temporary blotchiness in sensitive skin.Just in case, wait until you have an evening to yourself before trying it for the first time.;
, Olive oil is a common option, but any natural carrier oil will work. The oil makes it easy to apply the sugar, and can help your skin health at the same time. Choose the oil based on your skin type and personal preference:


For greasy skin, try safflower oil, hazelnut oil, or grapeseed oil.For very dry skin, try coconut oil, shea butter, or cocoa butter. Optionally, whip it for easy spreading.
To avoid strong scents, try grapeseed oil, safflower oil, and sweet almond oil., Mix 1 part sugar with 1 part oil for a basic scrub, forming a thick paste. For a more powerful scrub, try 2 parts sugar and 1 part oil.


If using white sugar, the 2:1 recipe is recommended.If you are treating an area with acne or broken blood vessels, use a very mild scrub, such as 1 part sugar to 2 parts oil. Exfoliants can make these conditions worse., For additional scent and possible health benefits, add an essential oil. No more than 1 or 2 percent of the scrub should be essential oil. Typically, you can use up to 48 drops per cup (240mL) of other ingredients, or three drops for every tablespoon (15mL).Thyme, mint, and other herbs and spices make antimicrobial essential oils.These are good at fighting acne but may cause irritation in sensitive skin.
Do not use citrus oils, cumin, ginger, and angelic oils before talking to your doctor. These can trigger photosensitivity, a painful reaction to sunlight., If your skin is dirty, use mild soap and warm water to wash it. If your skin is clean, just wet it thoroughly. Scrubbing dry skin can cause redness or irritation.


Hot water or harsh soaps can irritate your skin, leaving it tender and painful. Skin in this state might hurt even when a gentle sugar scrub is used.

, Gently rub the sugar and oil mixture over your skin. Rub in circular motions, for about 2 or 3 minutes in each area. Rub gently; any pain, discomfort, or redness means you are scrubbing too hard.

, Rinse off with warm water, and pat dry. Optionally, apply a moisturizing lotion, or an additional touch of oil without the sugar.

, Your outer layer of skin takes about two weeks to replace itself.If you repeat the scrub before this time is up, you may damage living cells instead of removing dead ones. This leads to red, raw skin, which may be vulnerable to infection."

It is also a natural astringent, so it can help tighten your pores and reduce oiliness.The coffee grounds will also help exfoliate away dead skin cells.

, Olive oil is a good choice, but you can use another type of oil instead. If you tend to get breakouts, however, you should avoid olive oil and the following oils as they tend to clog pores: coconut, flax seed, linseed, palm, and wheat germ.Here are some suggestions based on certain skin types:Acne-prone or oily: argan, grapeseed, hemp, jojoba, sunflower seed, or sweet almond.
Dry or mature skin: apricot kernel, argan, avocado, hemp, jojoba, sunflower seed, or sweet almond.
Normal: apricot kernel, argan, grapeseed, hemp, jojoba, sunflower seed, or sweet almond.

, Avoid using white sugar or ""raw"" cane sugar if you can. These will make the scrub too harsh and abrasive for your face. Brown sugar is the better for the face, because of its smaller grain size. It is still exfoliating, but in a gentle way.

, This is not completely necessary, but it will give your scrub a nice fragrance.

, The scrub should feel like wet sand. If this is too dry for you, add a little more of whichever oil you were using. If the scrub is too wet, add a little bit more ground coffee or brown sugar. Remember to stir the scrub well after each addition.

, If the oil, sugar, and coffee start to separate, simply stir the scrub with your finger or a spoon. The scrub should last up to two months, but if it starts to smell or look strange before then, discard it and make a new one.


Try to use a glass jar, if you can. The oil in the scrub may deteriorate plastic over time; a glass jar will last longer.
If you plan to give the scrub as a gift, stick a homemade label onto the lid for a personalized touch.

, Wash your face first using warm water. This will get rid of any surface dirt and open up your pores.

This means it tears away the dead skin, and can irritate sensitive areas such as the face. Most people rarely have issues, but overuse or improper use can leave your face raw or painful.Abrasive scrubs are not recommended for people with acne or broken blood vessels on their face., Brown sugar is the softest type of sugar, making it the best choice for the sensitive skin of your face. Granulated white sugar contains less liquid and tends to feel a little grittier. It can work, but it's not recommended if you have sensitive skin.

, Mix 2 tbsp (30mL) sugar with 2 tbsp (30mL) vegetable oil. Alternatively, use honey instead of oil. Honey is mostly sugar, so it provides additional exfoliation.


Safflower oil and olive oil are common options. For more advice on which oil to pick, refer to the body scrub section above.

, If your face is dirty, clean it with mild soap and warm water. Otherwise, just make sure that your skin is completely wet, so the sugar scrub will not feel too abrasive.


Wash your hands as well to avoid introducing contaminants onto your face.

, If necessary, tie back your hair to keep it away from your face. The sugar scrub will rinse off in the shower, but avoiding sticky hair in the first place is the way to go.

, Scoop out 1-2 tablespoons (15–30mL) of your sugar exfoliant onto your fingertips. Place this on the location you want to remove dead skin, and being scrubbing in a circular motion. Do this gently for 2-3 minutes to remove the dead skin. While you’re scrubbing, you should feel no pain or discomfort. If you experience pain or tenderness, you are rubbing too hard with the sugar.

, Wet the softest washcloth you have under warm water, then wring it out. Lay it over your face and gently rub off the sugar. Repeat until clean., Use a clean cloth to pat your skin dry. If you are looking to soften your skin, you can finish up the process by massaging a moisturising lotion into your skin. Do this for 1-2 minutes, and your skin should be silky smooth and soft.

It’s going to need them for protection against the heat styling you’re about to do.
Use a rich, hydrating conditioner, and then, for extra protection, use a leave-in conditioner.;
, If at all possible, avoid drying your hair with a blow dryer until your hair is damp or nearly dry to minimize damage.Dry your hair using either a cotton t-shirt or a microfiber towel using a squeezing, blotting motion, not a rubbing motion, which causes breakage.

, You’ll only need a dime-sized amount at most--any more will weigh hair down and leave it limp.


Look for products that protect and moisturize hair, like blow dry primers, frizz-control sprays, or smoothing balms.

, Use a round bristle brush to pull your hair straight as you dry it.Direct the nozzle down as you dry to help prevent hair from frizzing.Get hair completely dry before moving on to flat ironing.Be patient. This step may take some time, particularly if you have very curly hair.
If your hair is too curly to make the conventional brush-and-blow-dry method workable, you can try setting your hair in large rollers and sitting under a hooded dryer (if you have one) or setting the curlers before you go to bed at night and straightening with a flat iron in the morning., Once your hair is completely dry, pull the top layer of hair into a temporary ponytail or bun, then begin straightening hair in 1-2 inch sections.If you have a temperature setting on your flat iron, use the following as a guide: for fine or damaged hair, 250-300 degrees; for medium or average hair, 300-350 degrees; for thick or coarse hair, 350-400 degrees.Use a comb to pull your hair taut and away from your head with one hand. With the other hand, iron the section of hair in one fluid motion from root to end.
Repeat if necessary until the section of hair is straight.
After you’ve straightened the bottom layer of hair, undo the bun or ponytail holding the top layer of hair. Then begin straightening the top layer, using 1-2 inch sections.
Don’t use a flat iron on wet or damp hair--it can literally break your hair., Use a finishing serum to smooth hair and add shine.

Take care of your blowout.",How to Make Frizzy or Curly Hair Into Straight Hair2," Brazilian blowouts, also called “thermal hair straightening” or “keratin straightening,” are professional chemical treatments that relax hair. The overall process of getting a Brazilian blowout takes an average of 90 minutes and is largely the same anywhere. It will usually look like this:The stylist will wash and towel dry your hair.
He or she will then divide your hair into sections and begin applying the straightening product.
The stylist will next blow dry your hair, trying to make it as straight as possible.
Next, he or she will flat iron your hair to seal in the straightener.
Then the stylist will rinse the solution out of your hair and apply a conditioning mask.
He or she will then rinse your hair again and apply a smoothing serum and/or balm before blow drying your hair once again.

, If you're not sure you want to get a blowout, start by setting up a consultation with a stylist who can lead you through the process and answer any questions.


Be aware going in that professional straightening treatments are expensive (anywhere from $175-$350, depending on the length and texture of your hair) and will take as long as three hours.
Also note that if you have very curly hair, a Brazilian blowout will smooth out your hair, but it won’t completely straighten it.Despite some claims to the contrary, these treatments do damage hair.

, Your hair will need some care after the treatment, though you shouldn’t feel compelled to buy expensive salon products; drugstore brands can work just as well.


Look for products that are gentle on hair and offer frizz-fighting benefits.
Don’t use any products that contain sulfates., After a Brazilian blowout, there are some general steps you should follow to maintain it (though your stylist may have different specifics).


Don’t put your hair up or in a clip during the first 72 hours after the blowout, and don’t tuck your hair behind your ears.
Don’t get your hair wet during the first 72 hours. If your hair does somehow get wet, immediately blow dry and straighten it.
Straighten hair at home as needed. As your hair grows, it will grow in curly again and you’ll need to straighten those portions at home.

Straighten the crown.",How to Keep Your Hair Healthy when You Straighten It Every Day," A quality flat iron will be made of ceramic, tourmaline, or titanium. It should have multiple temperature settings so that you can choose what’s right for your hair’s texture and thickness.These irons may be in the pricier range, but most very inexpensive flat irons only offer a single setting which is too high (usually 450 degrees) and will damage your hair with time.


Ideally, you want to use a flat iron that has a temperature gauge with numbers rather than simple On, Off, Low, and High settings. This way you can gauge exactly how much heat your hair is getting.Find an iron that is an inch and a half wide or smaller. Irons larger than that won’t be able to get closer enough to your scalp.Ceramic plates ensure that the heat is evenly distributed across your hair as you straighten, and ceramic is good for most hair types and textures. Stay away from “ceramic coated” flat irons, which can dry out your hair.If your hair is curly, however, you may need gold or titanium plates.;
, You will commonly find heat protector sprays made specifically for use with flat irons; there are also numerous creams and serums on the market, and some mousses contain heat protection.


Some frequently recommended choices included Living Proof’s Straight Spray, Moroccan Oil (for thick or coarse hair), or products made with silicone.

, While these won’t make your hair straight, they can add moisture to your hair and therefore help to prepare it for the process of straightening.Alternately, you may want to try a strengthening shampoo if you find that frequent straightening makes your hair weak., Typical hairbrushes, which are made of nylon and plastic, cause static. But a brush made boar bristles and nylon will give your hair shape and polish and eliminate the fly-aways., These products will help keep your hair healthy by increasing moisture. Since they may make your hair oilier or heavier, try using just once a week.


Some options include Luster’s Pink Original Oil Moisturizer and Aveda’s Dry Remedy., Damaged hair will only become more damaged as you put it through the daily straightening process, and you won’t be able to get the sleek look you’re after. If you’ve got split ends or inches of damage, start fresh by having your stylist cut them off.


If you really don’t want to cut your hair, it may be possible to repair some damage over time with products containing oils and moisturizers. This is not a quick-fix, though—it could take two to three months to see improvements., Use your smoothing (or strengthening) shampoo and conditioner and rinse them well.

, Depending on the product(s) you choose, you may need to apply it while your hair is still wet. Some products direct you to use them on damp hair, while others are for dry hair and you should apply them immediately before using the flat iron. Whatever the case, be sure to follow the directions on the packaging for best results.


Use only as much product as you need for your specific hair type and length. Using too much product could result in hair that is weighed down and looks greasy, rather than sleek and shiny.

, Allowing your hair to air/towel dry for at least part of the time will reduce the amount of heat—and thus drying—endured by your hair. If you are able to straighten and style your hair to your satisfaction after allowing your hair to completely air/towel dry, this is a great option for reducing damage.

, Blow-drying your hair adds more heat, which can cause additional damage, but many people who straighten their hair also need to blow it dry to get the look they desire.


To create volume, blow-dry by lifting at the roots.If you have thick hair, you will want to apply tension with a brush as you dry—this will help to get the hair as smooth as possible.Do not attempt to straighten your hair until it is absolutely dry. If you hear a sizzle, stop!, To avoid damaging your hair, set the flat iron to the lowest temperature that will work for your hair. This temperature will depend on the specific qualities of your individual hair.


The finer your hair, the lower the setting you should go with.For fine or very damaged hair, use the “low” setting or 250–300 degrees. For medium (average) hair, use a mid-range setting or 300–350 degrees.Even if you have very thick or coarse hair, you should be able to use a setting below the very highest one. Try 350–400 degrees if your flat iron has a temperature gauge.Experiment with settings in the middle–high range before opting for the very highest one because repeatedly using that amount of heat can be very damaging to your tresses.
If you have chemically processed hair, then your heat tolerance will be reduced. The same goes for badly damaged hair.

, Divide your hair into sections of about a half an inch to two inches. Pin or pull the top part of your hair out of the way and begin with the pieces underneath, near the nape of your neck.The more hair your have, the more sections you will need.
Don’t try to straighten your hair by randomly grabbing pieces from all over your head; this will take forever and you’ll end up with an uneven looking result.

, Place the hot flat iron on a section of hair and smooth it down from top to bottom. You should start about a half an inch from your scalp in order to maintain some volume.Apply some tension as you go from top to bottom so that you can get the desired straightness., Don’t let the straightener linger on any one section of hair for more than 3 or 4 seconds, as doing so will damage and possibly singe the hair., Straighten the various sections of your hair, moving from the sections underneath to the middle sections of your hair.


Try not to go over the same section of hair multiple times, as this increases the likelihood of damage to those particular strands of hair. If you have curly hair, however, you will most likely have to go over your hair multiple times to get it to become straight.

, Once you get to the top section of your head, place the flat iron as close to your scalp as you can, and smooth it through your hair. This will help you to achieve a sleek finish."

, Natural honey can be mixed with your favorite shampoo for a healing, protecting shampoo.

, Comb it first to free the tangles and undo the knots. Then you should brush it to give it shine and volume. Always carry a comb and/or brush with you in case your hair gets messed up.

Do a blow-out on your hair.,
Use a flat iron.,
Get a Brazilian Keratin treatment.,
Use a relaxer on your hair.,
Try a new haircut.",How to Straighten Men's Hair1," Although the term may sound strange, a blow-out involves straightening your hair using a blow dryer. After you shower (having shampooed and conditioned your hair), towel-dry your hair and use a comb to brush through it. Then, turn your blow dryer on high for both heat and speed, and begin drying your hair. As you dry your hair, pull the hair straight out from your head with a brush (hence creating a blow-out). Move the air from the dryer up and down these strands as they are pulled from your head; this will dry them straight.









Use a round-barreled brush for the blow-out. This will prevent the hair from blowing all over the place when you pull it away from your head.
Always ‘wiggle’ the blow dryer a bit to prevent burning your scalp or singing your hair. The movement will keep the heat from focusing too much in one spot.
If you’re having trouble, ask your hairstylist (or girlfriend, boyfriend or sister) for a tutorial. It may be difficult to do at first, but with practice it’s easy to catch on to.;
, Yes, the all-powerful flat iron isn’t just for girls to use. Flat irons work by heating up two very hot ceramic plates which you run your hair between, thus making your locks ultra straight. Flat irons range in temperature and size; choose a flat iron that is 1-inch wide or smaller, especially if you have short hair, and one that gets above 350-degrees Fahrenheit. To use it, turn it on and give it 2-3 minutes to preheat. Then, run small ½-inch sections of hair between the plates, away from your head.








Don’t hold the flat iron on a section of hair for longer than 3-5 seconds; your hair will singe if the heat is not moved down the strand.
If you want to set your straight hair, blast your head with your blow dryer on the ‘cold’ setting to cool down your hair after being heated with the iron.
If you have long hair, pin or tie up the top section and start from the bottom. Working in sections will guarantee you straighten all the hair, and help speed up the process.Always be careful when using a flat iron near your roots, as it may burn your scalp.

, If you’re willing to shell out some money, you can have super soft, ultra straight hair after getting a Brazilian Keratin treatment. This special straightening treatment is applied at a salon, and lasts anywhere from 6-8 weeks. It works by sealing liquid keratin (the protein your hair is made out of) into each individual strand of hair. A chemical that preserves this keratin is placed over the top, to help it to last longer.








Brazilian Keratin treatments don’t show any side effects as of yet, but they are banned in Canada and the European Union because of some of the chemicals the treatment contains., If you have very curly or kinky hair, you may consider getting a relaxer done. This is the chemical version of the Brazilian Keratin treatment, and works by permanently altering the strands of hair to make them straight (like a perm for curly hair). Relaxers can be very damaging, but they will definitely give you straight hair. Keep in mind that although the relaxer is permanent, it must be re-applied every few weeks or months to straighten the roots of your hair.


If you ever want to have your natural hair again, you will have to cut off the relaxed part and grow out your roots.

, In general, the shorter your hair is, the less texture/wave it will show. Therefore, if you have long hair and are struggling to keep it straight, you might consider cutting off a few inches. On the flip side, the longer hair is, the more weight it has, and therefore the straighter your hair will look. Aim to have your hair 1–2 inches (2.5–5.1 cm) long, or at a length somewhere near your shoulders. These two cuts will take advantage of the illusion of straight strands.









Avoid layers in your hair cut, as these add texture and wave/curl to hair."

When you apply your conditioner in the shower, massage it in, pop a shower cap on and leave it while you wash.",How to Straighten Hair Without Hurting Your Hair," Wet hair and hot appliances don't mix; this should be common knowledge, but many people try straightening damp hair - which is just as dangerous. Want to boil your hair? No, didn't think so.






;
, Serums are usually best as they get right into your hair, though if you know of a quality spray you can try that. Make sure it's a good quality protector. Rub it all over your hair and give your hair time to absorb it, making sure it's applied evenly.








, Only choose a heat you absolutely need. For people with straight or loosely wavy hair, you do not really need to heat your straightener up to 200 degrees - 180, 150, around that area should do the job. Only people with very frizzy, thick curly hair should go right up to 200 degrees.








, The slower you go the faster it will get straightened, meaning you don't have to go over it endless times and break the hair shaft. Try not to go over each section of hair more than 5 times. If you want to do it the most effectively, don't just smooth the straightener over the chunk of hair-clamp it onto the top portion of that chunk/strand, count slowly to ten or fifteen seconds, then move it down until you get to the ends. It takes longer but is way more effective especially if your straightener is small or old.








, A straightening serum/spray will do the trick too, as will non frizz products. The more you work to keeping your hair straight longer, the less times you have to straighten and damage it.








, As an apology for drying it out, make sure your hair gets a regular dosage of the moisture it craves. You don't have to buy expensive products. Olive oil can be heated up and massaged into the hair easily, and is renowned for its ability to strengthen the shine and moisture of hair. There are also tons of home made remedies available on the net.








, This will prevent split ends - a common issue when straightening - from getting any worse. It also gets rid of damaged ends, the part which gets dried out the most.








, This allows the product to seep into your hair and really give it the treatment and moisture it craves from straightening damage.

Then gently tousle your hair with the towel, making sure not to rub the ends of your hair together if you have long hair.

, Blow drying your hair with hot air is not only damaging to your hair, it also creates frizz and encourages curls. Instead of blow drying with hot air, towel dry and then blow dry with cold air going section by section while brushing with a flat paddle brush.Blow drying with cold air will take longer than drying with hot air, so be aware of that if you are in a hurry or are timing your morning.

, If you don’t want to use a blowdryer, gently towel dry your hair and continue to brush it until it’s dry. Brushing helps to separate your hair and remove moisture. Brushing also encourages straightening because it slightly pulls on your hair and helps it not curl up as it usually does.If you don’t want to continually brush, you can brush your hair in spurts, with five minute breaks between each spurt to let it air dry.

, Once your hair is almost dry, use a smoothing hair cream or mousse to discourage frizz and waves in your hair. Try to find a product that contains a natural smoothing agent like coconut oil or jojoba oil to relax your hair."

Be as gentle as possible, since your weave can tangle easily while shampooing.If you work out or sweat a lot, shampoo every 7 days. Otherwise, try to go about 14 days between shampoos.
Opt for sulfate-free shampoos, which are more gentle on your weave and the hair underneath.;
, Mix shampoo and water into a nozzle bottle and squirt the mixture under and around your braids. Use your fingers to massage your scalp and between braids. Rinse out the shampoo, then repeat this two more times.Do not hold your head upside down to rinse, as this can cause tangles., Keep your leave-out hair — the edges, hairline and part — healthy and unbroken by deep conditioning every time you shampoo. Pour a dime-sized amount into your palms and smooth it over your hair. Rub gently with your fingertips, then cover with a shower cap and wait about 20 minutes.If you're having trouble reaching the roots with the conditioner, use a nozzle bottle to help you get into those areas.
Rinse with warm water and follow with a light, leave-in conditioner.

, A tight style, such as braids or locks, will take a long time to dry, making it more likely to develop a moldy smell. To prevent mildew from developing, use an antibacterial weave spray. Use after your shampoo and each day before you head out the door., Working with wet, just-conditioned hair will make combing easier. Start combing at the bottom and gently work your way up until the weft is tangle-free. Be very gentle. If you pull too hard, you can loosen the weft and even damage your natural hair to the point it falls out., Weaves can get moldy and smell like mildew if left damp.

If you must use a hair dryer, use the lowest heat setting.Heat can loosen the bond of your weave, so limit the use of heat-styling tools as much as you can., A little bit of light, alcohol-free pomade on your edges will tame frizz and keep your style smooth. Add a small amount of pomade to your palms, then gently smooth it over the edges.Avoid using too much product, which could weigh down your hair and make it look greasy.

, To freshen up between shampoos, apply a small amount leave-in conditioner to your weave each day. Massage the moisturizer gently into your scalp and through your natural hair and weft. This will keep your weave untangled and looking shiny., Visiting your stylist often for professional maintenance will keep your weave fresh-looking. The stylist will trim any broken hairs, tighten loose braids, and make sure the weft is secure and your natural hair is healthy., Because you are only washing your hair every 7 to 14 days, your scalp might get itchy. Don't use your fingernails or a rat-toothed comb to scratch your scalp, since the skin is fragile and you could end up with scabs. Instead, use soothing oils and massage them gently into your scalp with the pads of your fingers. Mix tea tree oil with grapeseed, olive or coconut oils.

Any material will work, but many prefer the smoothness of a satin or silk scarf. Using a satin pillow case, with or without a head scarf, will also protect your weave., An easy way to keep your weave wavy or curly is to braid it at night. Once it is sectioned and braided, tie it up in a head scarf to secure the braids in place while you sleep.If you wear your extensions straight, you can simply cover them at night. If you are looking for big, soft curls, use bobby pins to hold pin curls in place under your scarf., Weaves last anywhere from six to 12 weeks, depending on the weave and how well you care for it. When it is time to take out your current weave, be prepared to wait two to four weeks before adding a new one. Your hair needs that break to avoid being permanently damaged.You’ll want to thoroughly condition your hair during this time to get it in the best shape to support a new weave.

Get a quality electric hair trimmer.,
Pick an attachment size and buzz your entire head.,
Consider a a military style buzz cut.,
Check for any long or out of place portions of hair.,
Use a face razor to clean-up any lines along your neck and sideburns.

",How to Buzz Cut Hair," Most quality trimmers come with length attachments, so that you can decide upon the length of hair you would like.;
, Make sure this is the length you want for the longest part of your hair.

, This typically leaves the hair slightly longer on top than on the sides.


For this look, start be using the number 5 attachment and decide from there if you would like the top shorter than that. Don't worry about the sides at this point. Though you should be buzzing your whole head, it is the top of your head that you should be concentrating on during this step.
Pick an attachment at lease 1 size smaller than the one you just used on your whole head. At this point you are going to be shaving only the sides of your head. This part can be tricky and may require having help from a friend or family member.
Starting at the lowest point of your sideburns you are going to run the trimmer up the side of your head. Do not past the curvature of your skull. Imagine a straight line running up the side of your head. You should be shaving upward, and continuing straight upward away from the head as your skull curves to the top of you head.
Keeping a straight fade line can be terribly difficult at first and takes a lot of practice. Fortunately your hair grows pretty fast so to keep the buzz cut look you will be performing this haircut at least once every 2 weeks.

, Ruffle your hair. Trim anything that's still too long.

, A parting will work best if it's in a place where it has been parted before, so as not to pull your hair or look askew.

, The thickness of the sections will depend on which braid you are doing, for example, a fishtail, Dutch braid, etc., just be sure you know how to braid the type.


Have your ribbon at the ready, and also a bobby pin.

, Clip it into place on a part of your top hair that you won't be braiding.


It is also possible to braid in a ribbon for each strand. If you decide to do this, it's best to try with just one ribbon first, to get the hang of it, then try the three strands. Also, be sure to either use all the same color of ribbon for each strand of hair, or match the colors so that they don't clash.

, Again, braid according to the type of braid you have chosen. As you braid, keep the ribbon aligned at all times with the same section of hair you chose to begin with.


If you've added a ribbon to each of the sections of hair, keep each ribbon aligned with that section of hair.

, Secure it tightly with a hair band/bobble to ensure that it doesn't fall out.


You could add a cute hairband to finish off your look, or maybe even a bit of holding spray to fix in any unwanted flyaways. If you want it to be a bit messy, just leave it be.

, If you perhaps wanted to hide the bobby pin, or even the hair bobble, you could retrieve a prettier clip from somewhere, or wrap a bit of left over hair around the bobble and clip that into place, too.

, The braided hair now contains a strand of ribbon running through it. At each upturned interval of the hair section that contains the ribbon, the color will show outward for everyone to see. It's a very effective look, especially when paired with your clothing color scheme.

Allow your hair extension to air dry.",How to Wash Hair Extensions1," One of the advantages of clip-in extensions is that they are temporary and easy to both apply and remove at home. Removing your extensions will make washing them much easier.


Be sure to always remove your clip-ins before showering or swimming. Sometimes the metal used in the clips can rust or otherwise be damaged by water.;
, Just like your natural hair, it's best to detangle extensions before washing them. Gently run a wide-tooth comb to remove any knots. Start at the extension's clip and end at the hair tip.Hair extensions are prone to drying and may need extra care if tangling occurs. If you cannot remove the tangles with the extension dry, try wetting it with detangling spray and trying again. If you still have a stubborn knot, try wetting the hair completely and adding conditioner before combing.

, Fill up a clean bathroom sink or a small plastic tub with warm water. Avoid using hot water, as this can damage your extensions.However, keep in mind that too-cold water will not effectively rinse grime and shampoo from the extensions.

, Hold the extension by the clip and dip it into the basin. Avoid getting water on the clip. Run a wide-tooth comb through the hair to make sure it has been evenly wetted., Select a shampoo that is gentle, moisturizing, and free of sulfates. Lather a dollop of shampoo and work it into the hair from just under the clip to the tips. Try not to create tangles, but use the wide-tooth comb again if needed.


Lather the extension just like you would washing your own hair. The major difference is the hair in the extension is likely to be much dryer and delicate than your natural hair. Make sure it is soaked through before working in the shampoo to keep in from tangling., Start by dipping the extension back into the basin. Gently squeeze the extension from clip to tip while submerged. Then, delicately run the extension under warm water from the faucet.

, Use a light-weight moisturizing conditioner. Massage in a dollop of conditioner, focusing on the center of the hair and working up and down. Treat it as you would natural hair. Rinse again with warm water. Remove excess water by gently squeezing the extension with a towel., Hang up your hair extensions to dry straight.

Clarify your hair and scalp.,
Pick the right shampoo.,
Shampoo your hair.,

Repeat as necessary.",How to Wash Hair Extensions2," Because your extensions aren't getting the moisturizing oils produced by your scalp, they have a tendency to dry out much faster. Dry hair of any kind is much more difficult to wash and is prone to breakage. Add a little hair oil to your weave before you shampoo.


Place a shower cap around your hair and allow the oil to infuse into your hair for about an hour before moving on., This will remove built-up hair products and prevent dandruff. Fill a spray bottle half with water, half with apple cider vinegar. Spray it track-by-track onto your scalp and massage it in. Then give the weave itself a few spritzes. Leave this to set for five minutes before rinsing with warm water.


You don't have to clarify every time you wash your hair. Once a month should be enough to keep your scalp healthy., There are many shampoos on the market specifically made for hair extensions. However, some stylists recommend that any mild shampoo can be used.Others advise to treat your weave like dry, damaged hair and use a deep-moisturizing shampoo. Like your natural hair, finding what works best may require some trial and error.

, Wet your hair thoroughly before applying the shampoo. Add a dollop of shampoo into your hair and lather it. Massage the shampoo into your roots. Be gentle to avoid tangles and breakage. Rinse with warm water. You can do this in the shower or using a sink or wash basin.


When you clarify your roots, you can skip shampooing them., Keeping the hairs moisturized will extend your weave's lifespan. Deep condition with your choice of moisturizer. Leave it for 15-20 minutes before rinsing thoroughly with warm water., Either allow your hair to air dry or sit under a hooded dryer. You may also use a blow dryer, but this may damage your weave. Focus drying your roots. Make sure your natural hair and the portion of your weave attached to it dry out completely. Damp hair under a weave can cause mildew or even a bacterial infection., It is generally recommended to wash your weave and natural hair once every one to two weeks. Washing too often will cause breakage and result in a weave that doesn't last very long. However, not washing at all can damage your natural hair and may end up being unhygienic."

, Shampoo your hair, including the extensions, as you normally would. Take a dollop of shampoo and lather it into your hair. Massage it in beginning at the scalp and work your way down to the bottom hair tips. Rinse the shampoo out with warm water.

, Keep in mind that extensions will not be reached by your scalp's natural oils. Even if you don't normally need to condition your hair, use one when wearing extensions., Hot water may damage your extensions, while cold water will not properly remove residue. Wrap your hair with a towel to remove excess water when you're finished. Leave your hair to air dry.

, Remember that more frequent washings will shorten the lifespan of your extensions. If you normally go longer without washing your hair, add a leave-in conditioner to your extensions to keep them moisturized.

Repeat all steps with each segment.

,
Do some after care.",How to Use Straightening Combs on African American Hair," It is best to use a hot comb on freshly washed and detangled hair for a longer lasting effect.;
, The conditioning is the most important part, as it reapplies moisture that may have been stripped during the shampooing. Wash the conditioner out a few minutes later to ensure that the hair is moisturized, or follow the directions on the bottle. Using heat on dry, brittle hair will cause breakage, which is why it's important to make sure your hair is well conditioned.

, In substitution, you can towel dry your hair. When towel drying, make sure not to rub the hair, which can cause breakage. Instead, wrap the towel around your hair, and remove it when it's no longer soaking wet. As another substitute, you can blow dry your hair while detangling with a nozzle-comb attachment. Be careful of heat, however, since the nozzle, although mostly equally distributing the heat, will require that more is used for the hair to become flat. To combat this, either apply a heat protector, or turn the blow dryer to its cool setting.

, On each segment, you should apply a heat protector. Although hot combs don't damage the hair as much as straighteners, it's best to make sure that the hair is well protected from possibly heat damage that could cause it to be dry and brittle. Tie three of the regions away from the one you're working with, and then split that region in half. For a thorough straightening, the hair should be combed through with a wide-toothed comb. Bring the two halves of the first region together once both have been properly detangled with a wide-toothed comb..

, Make sure to only do half of the region. Go over it until you reach the straightness you desire, though two-three times works best for straight, but not flat, hair.

,, For the best, long-lasting results, apply an oil, butter, or leave-in to the newly-combed hair. Olive oil, castor oil, or shea butter is recommended. The hair is likely to be dry due to heat, so remember to moisturize thoroughly about twice a day. At nights, wrap the hair up in a satin or silk scarf or bonnet, and, if you can, put it up in a pineapple at the top of your head to keep the style.

A blunt cut will allow you to maintain your hair’s length while creating the illusion of full, thick hair.If you prefer a less severe look, ask your stylist to add a few face framing layers.
Too many layers will cause fine, straight hair to look thin and stringy.

, Shampoo strips your scalp of its natural, nourishing oils. When you over shampoo your hair, it becomes dry and lifeless. Those with fine straight hair will need to shampoo their hair more frequently than those with thick straight hair.


Fine straight hair becomes oily quick. Apply shampoo 3 to 4 times a week. Use a volumizing shampoo that does not contain any heavy conditioners.Thick straight hair benefits from the presence of your scalp’s natural oils. Apply shampoo directly to your scalp 2 to 3 times per week.Purchase a product with natural oils, such as keratin and argan oils., In addition to hydrating your locks, conditioners produce a glossier, healthier mane that is less prone to breakage and damage. The number of times you need to apply conditioner to your hair each week depends upon your hair type.If you have fine straight hair, over conditioning will weigh down your locks and make it difficult to style your tresses.

Give it a few days.",How to Cut Long Hair Short," Are you going for an ultra-short punk rock look, or just taking a few inches off to give yourself a nice summer style? Whatever kind of new look you're going for, it's very important to match your style to the shape of your face. Keep your hair longer and layered to make your face look longer, and keep it cropped to emphasize petite features.


If you have a very round face, you could try a bob or a layered cut that frames your face better.
If you have a narrower face or more highly defined structure, a pixie style may look better with your features.;
, If you want a dynamic and layered cut, that will involve sectioning off your hair into usually three separate sections and cutting them at slightly different lengths to get the hair to fall gently and evenly with the back of your head. This will take a little more work to pull off, and might require some help and mirrors.


To cut your hair in layers, separate your hair into three sections along the back of your head, tying each with a hair band. Cut them separately, going a few inches at a time until each is the desired length. Then work back over the layers to make sure they'll be uniform.

, Maybe one of the easiest ways to cut long hair short is to use hair clippers and start buzzing. If you're tired of long hair and want to go ultra-short, you don't need to give it much time or thought with a good pair of clippers.


Another way to go the quick and dirty route is to put your hair back into a ponytail and just cut it off. Using a mirror, go back over the ends and clean them up, snipping the ends at angles so it'll look more layered.

, As with any haircut, it can help to find some pictures of hairstyles that you really admire to help you get geared up for the cut. If you think you might like having short hair, it'll definitely help assuage any fears you have if you pick out some flattering short styles to emulate with your own.


Try to find someone with a similarly featured face. If you've got a rounder face, it probably wouldn't make any sense to pick someone with a very long face to model your hair after.

, If you want to get a lot of hair cut off, it's usually best to go and talk to a hairdresser who cuts hair professionally. You're perfectly capable of cutting your own hair, but if it's going to be a big job, it's usually best to go to a pro. You can talk about what will look best for your own style, and make sure the cut gets done evenly and professionally. It'll look great.

, If it's been a long time since you've had your hair cut, it's usually a good idea to do some treating to make sure that the sudden loss of body doesn't make your hair look limp and thin. Using treatments along with regular shampoo and conditioner will help to keep your hair strong and healthy.


Try to use treatments that contain keratin which helps to strengthen and nourish your hair. If your hair is severely damaged, use double or triple concentrated keratin treatments.

, Comb your hair thoroughly and cut your hair damp. Straighten out curls or waves with a straightener tool or a brush and some hairspray or water. If the curls or waves are very loose, you don't need to worry too much.


The straighter, the easier. You can use curlers, rollers, or hair tools to restore the curls or waves once the hair is cut, unless you like the straight look.

, Hair shouldn't be cut with a ratty old pair of kitchen shears. Make sure that you're using sharp, clean scissors appropriate for cutting hair, so the job goes smoothly and your hair ends up looking great.


Some people like to use razor combs to cut hair, but if your hair is very long, you need to do some cutting with regular scissors first. If you want to finish it with a razor comb, after you've layered, that's fine.

, If you haven't gotten your hair cut for a while, there's going to be a lot of it to collect. If you start with a ponytail, you'll be able to keep it all in one place relatively easily, but otherwise you're going to make a big mess. Take some steps to make sure that it'll be easy to clean up, if you're going to cut indoors.


Make sure you're somewhere with hard, laminated floors, like the kitchen or the bathroom. Clear out all bathmats, rugs, and other things that'll get in the way of your sweeping. Sweep up the hair immediately when you're finished, into a trash can.
Alternatively, going outside can make clean up a whole lot easier. Set up a chair on a warm night in the backyard to cut your hair and don't worry about cleaning it up.

, The back of your head will be the hardest part to get cut. Regardless of whether or not you or someone else will be doing the actual cutting, it's a good idea to have a couple of hand mirrors ready so that you can periodically check on the work and make sure you're not taking too much off the back. Mirrors allow you to see your head from all angles, making sure that you're not missing anything.

, Depending on how damaged your hair is, you will generally want to cut just above where a majority of your split ends are, a half inch or so. This will cause your hair to be much healthier and will help you to maintain your locks. Worry about getting the hair styled and shaped after you've done the damage-control of getting your split ends taken off.

, If you are uncertain on what style you want and are not happy with what has been advised or do not think that it will suit you, start by cutting your hair inch by inch. This way you can tell how short is too short. Don't try to get it over with and chop the hair off in a few seconds. Take your time.


Measure off the hair accordingly and hold the hair straight in between your fingers. Cut in a straight, even line, unless you're going for a bob or other hairstyle. For layers, clip off the hair being used for the next layer or so in sections.

, You don't want to cut straight across your hair, but make short diagonal snips when you've got your hair about as long as you want it. This helps to keep hair looking healthy and flowing, rather than lank and flat.


You want to avoid making long, straight cuts on your hair, or it'll look flat and dull. Remember, your hair will dry and won't be as straight (even if you have very straight hair), so there's little point in worrying about getting all the ends the exact same length. Hair looks dynamic when the ends are ""evenly irregular.""

, Often changing from long hair to short hair can be such a change that you may not like your end result at all. Often the change only seems bad to you and it can usually take up to a week for the hair to grow to a nice length or for you to get used to it.


Try to style it in a few different ways and give yourself a chance to experiment. It'll always go back, so even if you're not thrilled with it at first, treat this as a fun little project. Try new styles you've never tried before. Be a new you.

, If you have very thin or straight hair, you may want to begin with a light spray of volumizing hairspray.


To tease, bend your head forward so that your hair falls over your face. Take 1–2 inch (2.5–5.1 cm) sections of hair, starting from the middle of your head. Run a comb back and forth through each section in small, quick motions (called backcombing). This will loosely knot your hair together and give it volume.
Start at the middle (or 2-3 inches from the root) of the strand, rather than at the root. Make sure the top of the chunk of hair remains smooth, and that you’re only backcombing underneath the top most layer of hair.

, After you tease the front, go wild on the rest of your hair. Then flip all your hair back and run a brush over the topmost part of your hair, to smooth it out.


Always tease the back section after the front. It can be hard to tease the front section after you do the rest, and then you run the risk of a half-teased pouf that starts too far back.
After your smooth out the top layer of hair, you may lose some volume. Don’t be afraid to re-tease your hair as needed.

, Tilt your head back, and separate the top quarter of your hair, starting from your crown. Gently brush out this outer layer so that it is smooth.


Be careful not to brush out too much of your backcombing. This will cause the hairstyle to lose volume.
Brush upwards rather than down to keep from squashing the big hair that you've teased.

, Gather your smoothed hair and your teased hair together, except for a few side strands by the ears. Sweep your smoothed hair over your teased hair and secure it in the back with bobby pins.


You don't need to pin your hair to your head. Instead, you're trying to pin your hair together, so that it keeps its shape. If you have a lot of hair, start with one pin, then keep gathering and pinning until you have reached your desired shape.
If you sweep your hair straight back, you may flatten it. Keep it in the back, but once you've gathered it, push it towards the front of your head. Pushing it will force it upwards so that it has height and volume.
Push the bobby pins in upwards, and roughly at a 45 degree angle (as diagonal as you can) for maximum hold.

, Smooth your side sections of hair and pull them taut. Pin them in the back of your head, below your pouf.


Unlike your pouf, you should pin your side strands close to your head. Don't pin them to your pouf, or they will get loose.
Keep your hair as tight as possible to keep it looking clean. Use a brush to comb out your side strands if they've gotten very messy.

, Gather up the remaining strands at the back of your head and pull them together like you’re creating a low ponytail.Twist the ponytail upward and close to your head. When it is tight, tuck the tips into it and secure it to your head with bobby pins.


You can use a clip to hide the bobby pins or you can just shellac the back with some more hairspray.
Make sure you give your entire ‘do one final spray and use a comb to smooth down flyaways and loose strands to achieve the evenly (and overly) sprayed stylized look of the times.

Grab a clipper and attach the desired guard.,
Run the clipper along the child’s head, starting at the back.,
Use a longer guard length to give your child a fade.,
Clean up the neckline.,
Finish by trimming around the ear.",How to Cut Kids' Hair2," Make sure to have a conversation with your child before starting the haircut. You need to agree with them as to how short they’d like their hair. This is important to avoid grumpy children after the haircut. You can use Google to find images with the corresponding guard number (such as number 3) to show your child what to expect.


Remember that the smaller the number, the shorter the resulting haircut.
If the child’s hair is particularly long, you may want to start by trimming their hair with scissors before using a clipper.

, Make sure to keep your strokes slow and smooth. Work your way up towards the crown, and finish by cutting the sides.With this method, your child’s hair will be one uniform length. If you’d like their hair to be longer on top, you can give them a fade.

, A fade refers to a haircut where the hair is longer on top of the head than the sides and back. For instance, if you used a number 3 guard for the top of the head, you might use a number 2 guard for the sides. Start from the nape of the neck, bringing the clipper up towards the bottom of the crown. As you do, bring the clipper towards you in an arc to blend the different lengths together., Take the guard off the clipper, so it will cut hair to the skin. At the neckline, trim until the hair forms a straight line across the neck at your desired height. Then, turn the clippers over to clean up the fuzz below this line., Leave the guard off the clipper. Gently fold down your child’s ear, then cut the hair, following the ear with your clipper as if you were tracing an ear pattern in their hair.Don’t cut too high: you’re just cleaning up the hair around the ear.


For the sideburns, just place the clipper straight across the sideburn at the desired length and cut. Look at your child from the front to make sure the sideburns are even.

Move to the opposite side of the neckline and repeat this process.,
Repeat this same cutting process for the back and sides.,
Cut the hair around the ears.,
Cut the hair at the top of the head at a 90 degree angle.,
Check the haircut’s uniformity.",How to Cut Kids' Hair3," You can use a comb to straighten the hair out as you grab it. The 45 degree angle is important to ensure the hair blends well at the back and sides; the slant should go down towards the neckline. Your fingers will serve as a guide; all the hair beyond will be cut.You want to hold the hair firmly, so that it is taut, but not so much that it hurts your child.

, Be sure to maintain your grip on your child’s hair, so it doesn’t slip out as you cut.


These scissors are very sharp, be careful not to cut yourself.

, Again make sure the 45 degree angle is slanted towards the neckline. Cutting this way will ensure the hair will have a soft V shape as it tapers towards the neck. Bend down to eye level to ensure the neckline is even.

, Always start by taking the hair between your index and middle finger at a 45 degree angle, holding it taut, then cutting along your fingers. To ensure the length remains uniform, ensure that each new tuft of hair you grab includes some of the hair you’ve already cut. This way you can keep the length with each.Cut hair this way until you reach the bottom of the crown of the head.

, Gently fold each ear down, and use your scissors to cut the hair around it. Cut as if you were tracing the pattern of an ear., The process for cutting here is similar to the sides, save for the angle. Pull the hair straight out of the head at a 90 degree angle rather than 45.Hold the hair between index and middle fingers, and cut along your fingers.


As with the sides and back, each new cut should have a few hairs from the previous cut to serve as a guide.
If you don’t want the hair across the forehead to be too straight, you can point-cut it (angling the scissors upwards and cutting at the hairs to vary lengths). Be careful not to cut the hair too pointy.

, Do this by running your fingers through different sections of the hair, pulling up. While the hair should angle as it transitions from the top to the sides and back, there should be no long hairs sticking out"

Cut the right section, using the back section as a guide.,
Repeat this process with the left section.,
Let down hair from the clipped sections in half inch sections and cut.,
Comb wet hair towards the eyes and cut bangs.",How to Cut Kids' Hair4," Use a fine comb to brush the hair out to its full length. Start just behind one ear, combing towards the other. Treat all hair above this line as the top section. Comb it up and use hair clips to clip this section up., This will give you a more accurate cut. Split the hair here into a left and right section, and hold the right section tautly between your index and middle finger.

, Use hair shears to cut the hair along your fingers. Remember that hair tends to shorten when it dries. For every one inch of hair you want to take off, cut half an inch.


Note that curly hair is much longer when straight and wet. For every inch you want to take off, cut no more than a quarter inch., Make sure to hold some hair from the right section to serve as a guide. Follow the length of the right section as you cut the left.

, Start these side sections along a line about an inch above the ear, going around your child’s hair. This should include the back sections you’ve already cut. Use hair clips to secure the rest of the hair to the top of your child’s head., Hold the right section between your index and middle fingers. Make sure to include hair from the back section in your grip. Hold the hair tautly and cut along your fingers.

, Your child’s hair should then have the same length all around. You can check the length by running your fingers through the child’s hair at various sections, pulling lightly on the hair. If any long hairs stick out, trim them to match the rest of the hair.

, While cutting in smaller sections takes more time, it will make for a better, more accurate cut. Holding the released sections between your index and middle finger, cut to match the length of the side sections., How you do this depends on the kind of bangs you want to give your child.


For straight bangs, part the hair horizontally, starting about an inch back from the child’s forehead. The part should end at the outside corner of each eye. Clip the remaining hair back, and cut the bangs across the middle of the eyes.For triangular shaped bangs, choose a point on top of the head, depending on how wide you want the bangs. Comb from this point to the outside of the eyebrows, and clip remaining hair back. Again, cut across the bangs so they fall at the middle of the eyes."

Split up the beginning section of hair.,
Create the first stitchings of the braid.,
Incorporate hair into the braid.,
Finish the braid.",How to Do a Reverse French Braid," Use a wide tooth comb or a brush to remove any tangles and knots from your hair. This is extremely important because as you braid, the ends of your hair are going to get particularly crisscrossed, creating tangles.


You can do this braid with either dry or wet hair, but for beginners, it may be easier to separate and control the hair if it’s wet.
Braiding your hair while it’s wet creates a wavy look once your hair has dried and you remove the braid.;
, Use your thumbs to trace along your scalp, through your hair, and separate the beginning section of hair you are going to use to start your braid.If you want your braid to start at your hairline, use your thumbs to create a smaller, triangle shaped section near the front, top of your head. This section should be about two to four inches wide. If you want your braid to start more toward the middle back of your head, position your thumbs at the side of your head (near your temples), and trace along to the middle-back of your head, to gather your first section. This section will be significantly larger, about 10 inches wide.


If you have bangs and you want to incorporate them into your braid, start your braid at your hairline.
For short hair, it may be easier to incorporate all of your hair starting at your front hairline.
For longer hair, you can start your braid near your hairline, or further down toward the back of your head.

, Once you have your first section of hair, use your fingers to split it up into three equal parts.


This section needs to be split three ways evenly, so the braiding portions are all similar in width. If not, your braid could look uneven and lopsided.

, A stitching of hair is anytime a piece of hair crosses another piece. Begin the braid by crossing the right portion of hair under the middle portion of hair. Now, it’s essentially as if these two pieces have flip-flopped; the original right portion of hair is now the new middle piece. Then, cross the left portion of hair under the new middle portion.It is very important that the side portions of hair cross under the middle. This is what gives the reverse French braid its signature pop out look.These first stitchings of hair are made like a normal braid. There is no new hair incorporated just yet. This gives a small, solid start to the braid where you can then start adding hair into the stitchings.

, Now that you have the beginnings stitches, you can start adding hair into the braid. From the right side of your head, add in a new section of hair to the right-side portion of hair.This new portion of hair should be about ½ of an inch thick. Once this new piece of hair is incorporated into the right portion, cross the entire right portion under the middle portion of hair. Do the same procedure with the left portion of hair. Gather a ½-inch piece of new hair from the side of your head, add it to the left portion of hair, and cross it under the middle portion of hair.


Keep braiding in this manner until you have added all outside hair to the braid, and have reached the nape of your neck.

, Now with all of your hair incorporated either into the braid or into the three braiding portions of hair, continuing braiding the three portions of hair.Once some hair starts fraying from the braid, use an elastic hair tie to secure and finish the braid.


You can use a clear elastic tie of you have blonde hair, or a black hair tie if you have dark hair.
You can also bring the three portions of hair over one of your shoulders to make the finishing braiding easier.

Brush out your hair completely before you begin the process of curling.If you just got out of the shower, let your hair dry completely after brushing it. You should not use a flat iron on wet hair.;
, Any time you use a flat iron, you should take steps to protect your hair from excess heat. Pick up a heat protectant spray at a local beauty salon or department store. Gently mist your hair with the spray before using your flat iron.Refer to the bottle's instructions to know precisely how much to use. Usually, you only need a light layer of protectant spray to keep your hair safe from heat.

, Part your hair down the middle. Then, pull about half your hair, found near the crown, into a ponytail. Secure it with a tie or hair clips. You will start curling the under layers of your hair before you get to the outer layers., Start on one side of your hair and work your way around. Clamp your hair into the flat iron at the nape of your neck. Work in strands big enough to comfortably fit into the flat iron. If you want smaller curls, use can use smaller strands., After clamping the flat iron down near the nape of your neck, bend the iron in a roughly 90 degree angle. Then, take the end of your hair and hold it with the hand that's not holding the flat iron. This will be the starting position for curling your hair., Pull the flat iron very slowly and move it down through your hair. As the flat iron moves through your hair, release your hair with your other hand. Keep releasing your hair until you reach the end of the strand of hair., After curling a strand, twist the curl in the direction it naturally flows. This will make the curl a little more apparent and create a ringlet shape., After you've curled enough strands on one side of your head, switch to the other side. Repeat the process of starting at the nape of your neck and running the flat iron through your hair as you hold on to the ends. Twist each strand after you finish curling it., After you've curled your lower locks, remove the top of your hair from the clips or hair tie. If your hair got messy while being clipped, run your fingers or a brush through it before proceeding., You curl the top layer of hair the same way you curled the bottom layer. Clamp the flat iron down at the roots of your hair. Slowly run the flat iron through each individual strand, holding onto the ends and gradually releasing them as necessary. Twist each lock after you curl it.You can start on either side of your head. It does not matter where you start to curl your upper hair.

, When you're done, your hair should have a very tight, ringlet appearance. If you want your curls to be tight and neat, avoid touching or brushing your hair further., If you want more wavy hair, gently run your fingers through your hair. This will loosen up the curls slightly, giving them a wavier, more relaxed feel., After setting your hair the way you want it, mist on a light layer of hairspray. This will keep your look intact throughout the course of the day.If you want to add volume, you can add something like wax or mousse. This can also help hold your curls in place throughout the day.

Preserve your curls at night.",How to Do Bantu Knots," Your scalp needs to be very clean since Bantu knots leave a large portion of it exposed. If you have too much product buildup, grime, and flaky skin on your scalp, the style can become itchy and lose some of its glamour.


You do not need to use any special shampoo for this task. Simply use the same hair care products you always use when washing your hair.;
, If your hair is prone to frizziness or flyaway strands, using a conditioner can help prevent some of this effect. You can opt for either a rinse-out conditioner or a leave-in conditioner.


A rinse-out conditioner is recommended if your hair dries out easily but is not notably prone to flyaway strands, while a leave-in conditioner is recommended if your hair gets especially dry and frizzy when you work with it.
Either way, conditioner offers a layer of protection for your hair, which can help prevent breakage as you coil, twist, and wrap it into knots.

, If your hair tangles easily, you should brush it using a special detangler brush or comb. Consider applying a detangler serum, as well.









This may not be necessary if your hair is already very stretched-out or relatively tangle-free.
Detangling your hair help make your knots and knot-outs as smooth and shiny as possible when all is said and done., There are conflicting opinions concerning whether to work with wet, damp, or dry hair, but the general consensus is that damp hair is best for setting both knots and knot-outs.


Dry hair tends to be more difficult to set, and the knots or knot-outs may not hold well if you have straight or kinky hair that tends to lose a curl after a few hours.
Dripping wet hair will not dry while knotted, however, and the knots or knot-outs may become limp as a result of being over-saturated.
As a general rule of thumb, aim for towel-dry hair that is still damp to the touch but no longer wet enough to wring moisture out of.

, The exact width will vary depending on how short or long your hair is, as well as the look you want to go for if you plan to do knot-outs. Typically speaking, if you have short hair, you should use smaller sections, while women with long hair can opt for larger sections. Typically, the bigger the section the bigger the curls. 








A Rattail comb is usually the best tool to use when separating your hair. Work with the end of the comb to divide your hair into even, clearly divided sections.
If you have shorter hair, keep the sections about 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) wide or smaller.
If you have longer hair, you can create sections that are roughly 3 to 4 inches (7.6 to 10 cm) wide.
If you plan to create knot-outs, consider the final texture of the curls you will create when determining the width of your sections. For wavy hair, use medium to large knots ranging from 1 1/2 to 3 inches (3.8 to 7.6 cm) wide. For more defined curls, use small knots that are roughly 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 4 cm) wide.

, Stick with a product that has light to medium hold to create knots and knot-outs that hold their form without becoming stiff. Twist the product into each section of hair.









Rub the styling product onto your fingers and twist each section of hair in between your fingers, starting from the roots and working down. This allows you to apply the product while forming a beginning ""rope"" of hair to build upon for your knot.
Note that you will need to keep the tension of the twist fairly high to maintain the shape.

, Twist each section of hair for a few turns in between your fingertips, as though screwing in a screw or turning a doorknob. Only wind the the hair enough to create a short spring-like coil against your scalp.









Do not twist your hair up completely in this manner. Twisting a small coil into your hair should be fine, but twisting the entire section into a knot can cause major breakage.

, Gradually wind the remaining hair in the section around the base coil, bringing the hair closer to your head with each wrapped layer.









When working with longer hair, the knots will take on a pyramid or funnel shape. When working with shorter hair, the knots will look more like rosebuds or baguettes.
The end of each section must be as close to your head as possible in order to hold the knot in place more effectively.

, If the coils are tight enough, you can usually tuck the ends under the coil to hold them in place. If the coils feel a little too loose, however, you can use hair pins or small elastic ponytail holders to hold the end of the knots in place.









If you have naturally curly or kinky hair, you can usually tuck the ends underneath and have success. If your hair is fairly straight, however, you will probably need to rely on hair pins or elastic ponytail holders.

, Each section of hair needs to be twisted into a small coil. Wrap the remainder of each section around its corresponding coil and tuck or pin the ends in place.









Note that you should also apply the same styling product to each section before beginning to twist and wrap the knots in place.
If the hair starts to dry out as you work, you can lightly mist it with water from a spray bottle to keep it damp.

, Bantu knots can be sported as their own style. At this point, the Bantu knots themselves are complete, so you can wear them around town as you please.









If you let your knots down after they set, however, you can form a curly hairstyle known as Bantu knot-outs.

, If you plan to do a knot-out, it is recommended that you let the hair air dry on its own. Placing a shower cap over the Bantu knots overnight can create a humid, steamy environment for your hair, though, which can help set the style naturally.


Using a shower cap creates a type of ""greenhouse effect,"" allowing your hair to dry as slowly as possible while retaining enough moisture to prevent them from losing form.
After you remove the shower cap, your hair will still feel slightly damp. Let it continue air drying for about 15 minutes before pressing forward., If you need to set and dry your hair in a hurry, the next best option is to sit under a bonnet dryer and let your hair dry under the warm, steady heat for 30 to 60 minutes.


Do not blow dry knots. This will cause them to become far too frizzy when you take them down.

, Unpin and unwrap each knot. You should expect to see tight, twisted coils of hair after this step.









As you work with your hair while taking it down, it is recommended that you apply an oil or anti-humidity serum to your hands. Doing so prevents friction from hands from causing your hair to become frizzy.
The knots should be unscrewed gently as though you are unscrewing a cap. Do not pull the knot apart.

, Gently separate each curl using your fingers. To minimize frizzing, you can gently finger-comb a little more styling product into the hair as you loosen the twists.









You could also use a wide-toothed comb instead of your fingers.
Avoid playing with the twists too much, though. If you handle your hair too much at this point, it can become frizzy rather easily.
Avoid pulling each section apart. Instead, you need to lightly ""fluff"" the hair, arranging it so that the curls look natural and your scalp is no longer visible.

, A light mist of hairspray or oil can help prevent flyaway hair while giving your hair a subtle, healthy-looking shine.


At this point, the Bantu knot-out is ready to sport around town.

, At night, you should pin your hair up and wrap the sides with a scarf. When you wake up in the morning, unpin your hair and re-style the curls gently using your fingers.









Use a satin scarf, bonnet, or wrap at night for best results.
You should also sleep on a satin pillow to avoid damaging your hair as much as possible.
If you want to maintain the look for one or two weeks, clean your scalp with witch hazel or another astringent every three or four days while following this procedure at night to keep your curls looking great.

, Your hair should be damp, but not wet, before styling. You may want to keep a spray bottle of water handy during styling to re-dampen hair as you progress.


Hair that is too wet will take longer to dry.
Hair that is too dry will not twist together properly.

, More sections and smaller twists will create a better twist out. , Be sure to twist in the direction of the hair’s natural curl: don’t fight nature! Within one of the sections, separate a small square of hair.
Divide the square into 2 strands and twist them around each other, allowing each strand to twist on itself as you twirl the strands together.
Repeat, dividing and twisting one square at a time until each section is fully twisted.

, Give your hair a nice shampoo lather and rinse followed by a thorough conditioning. Once you have finished washing your hair begin drying by only removing excess water; It is very important to leave the hair a little damp.









Try removing excess water by blotting or squeezing the hair gently with a cotton t-shirt. Do not rub your hair!
Don't use a towel because it will dry your hair out. Also, it will make you hair frizzy and your curls can get tangled in the towel.
If your hair has drops of water dripping off the ends it is still too wet and you should continue blotting.

, Comb through the hair with a wide-tooth comb.









Start by combing the ends of the hair. Once those tangles are gone then slide up an inch or so and (still combing downwards) keep combing until all tangles (from the roots - down) are gone.
Use detangling spray (i.e. Kinky Curly Knot Today) for a smoother comb through.

, Use a rat-tail comb (a comb that has teeth on one end and a styling separator on the other) to part the hair horizontally from ear to ear.









Hold the top and bottom sections separate from each other by using hair clips for each section.

, These are the sections you will use to make your twists (Please note: This is example is only using six twists, however the procedure is the same for many).









To create three sections on the top part, part the hair running from the crown down to the horizontal part you previously made. Clip each section so they remain separated.
To create three sections on the bottom part, part the hair running from the base of your scalp up to the horizontal part you previously made. Clip each section so they remain in place.

, This will be the only section that has been unclipped/not twisted and loose.









It may be easier to work from the bottom to the top so you do not take the chance of messing up the top twists.

, Use the wide-tooth comb again to remove any tangles that might have been created in the separating and clipping process.








, Hair lotion or pomade makes the hair follicles sticky and will help to lock in the style.









Rub either the hair lotion or pomade onto your hands and smooth into the loose section of hair to be twisted.

, Use an elastic rubber band (optional) to hold the hair into place and separate the hair into two new sections.









Place the rubber band as close to the roots as possible while taking care to not pull the hair too tightly.
Make sure the two separated sections are even.

, Cross left over right until the end of the section is reached.









Allow the ends to curl on each other and apply hair gel to hold the twist in place.

, The embellishments can be added to the ends or base of the twists.









Barrettes, bows and elastics are normally snapped/tied into place.

Beads can be added by sliding them over the ends of the twists far enough up so they stick in place.

, Wear a satin scarf or sleep on a satin pillowcase to help your twist style stay intact.
