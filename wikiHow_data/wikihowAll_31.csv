Let your hair dry and give it the finishing touches.",How to Dry Curly Hair1," Curly hair is often more dry than straight hair because the natural oils produced at the scalp have a hard time maneuvering their way through the twists of curly hair. The result is that these natural oils aren’t distributed throughout the hair, especially at the ends. This causes hair to be dry, and then break and become frizzy. If you wash your curly hair every day, use a moisturizing shampoo that will hydrate it to prevent it from breaking, and to reduce frizz, split ends and add shine.Choose a shampoo that’s either sulfate free or doesn’t contain ammonium lauryl sulfate, ammonium laureth sulfate or sodium lauryl sulfate. These are essentially powerful detergents that strip your hair and scalp of the natural oils your hair needs.Try to stay away from all products that contain alcohol, which sucks up hair’s moisture and gives curls that crunchy look and feel.;
, Hair needs a balance of both moisture and protein to have elasticity. This means it stretches without breaking, and it is the primary indicator of your hair’s health.Protein conditioners not only penetrate the hair shaft to make it stronger, but they also form a film on the hair cuticles, or the outer layer of the hair, so they lay flat. This helps reduce frizz.Use a protein conditioner containing wheat, keratin, silk, milk, collagen or soy or a moisturizing conditioner containing jojoba oil, glycerin (or vegetable glycerin), aloe vera, shea butter or Vitamin E.You can alternate between the two daily, every few days or weekly. You may even use one more often than the other depending upon your hair’s texture and how often you use heat to style it.
Use a protein conditioner more often if your hair feels dry and frizzy, stretches a great deal but still breaks, feels limp when wet or if it doesn’t hold its curl or style very well.
Use a moisturizing conditioner more often if your hair breaks or snaps very easily, feels brittle or straw-like, or doesn’t stretch much or at all., The “co-washing” movement calls for primarily skipping shampoo because it strips away natural oils over time. Instead it recommends using a gentle cleansing conditioner.Choose a conditioner that is designed for co-washing or that says it’s a cleansing conditioner. They often will label themselves as such and contain natural ingredients like aloe vera. Avoid any with silicones because they will weigh down hair.Wash hair with a cleansing conditioner every 3-7 days depending upon your hair type. Wash less often the curlier and more coarse it is.Use more than you normally would, massaging it in from root to end, and let it absorb for 3-5 minutes before rinsing.Wash your hair with a sulfate-free, clarifying shampoo every 2-4 weeks because cleaning conditioners do cause build-up.Co-washing is not recommended for those with fine hair because it will weigh thin hair down and make it too oily.If you don’t know your curl type, go to sites like this to find out: .

, Never rub your hair with a towel to get it drier. Towel-drying your hair vigorously creates friction, causing your hair cuticles to roughen up. You want them to lay flat and smooth to reduce frizz. Instead, gently squeeze dripping water from your hair using your hands. Next use a towel or micro-fiber, super-absorbent cloth to soak up more water by first squeezing and then patting downward.T-shirts are a great alternative for curly hair because they’re smooth and don’t roughen up the hair’s cuticles., Air drying allows hair more time to absorb moisture from the air and swell. This makes it more apt to break and the cuticle to become rough and cause frizz. Leave-in conditioners contain polymers that form a barrier or film on the hair strand, blocking humidity and reducing frizz.Comb the leave-in conditioner through your hair with a wide-toothed comb. (Using a brush to tug through your hair after you wash it is very damaging.) Focus on the mid-shaft, or the middle of the length of your hair, to the ends. Here are some detangling tips to make the process less damaging.


Divide your hair into 4-8 sections and pin each up with bobby pins, flat pin curl clips or crocodile clips.
Release one section at a time and use either your fingers or a wide-toothed comb to gently rake through your hair, starting at the ends and working up toward your roots.
If you encounter a particularly troublesome knot, put some conditioner on your fingers to work it out.
Once you have detangled a section of hair, give it a twist and pin it back up before moving on to another. When each is done, take all pins and clips out of your hair.
If your hair is very thick, very curly or you have masses of curls, use a comb with long teeth that’s able to penetrate your hair., Air drying your hair doesn’t mean only letting it air dry.Using products make a big difference when you’re styling without heat. You should apply an anti-frizz and/or curling serum, oil, cream, gel, mousse, lotion or spray before your hair gets too dry to control frizz and to define and control/hold your curls. The type(s) you choose depends upon the texture of your hair, your curl type and how you want your curls to look. You may find that a combination of two or more works best.Serums, oils, lotions and creams are generally used to smooth.
Gels and thicker creams are used most often to help control/hold or to define/shape.
Mousses and foams add volume and also help define/shape.
Sprays can do many of these things, in addition to add texture.
Reading reviews online is a great way to help select products.

, Use a comb or your fingers to form your natural part. Find your natural part by combing hair back and then shaking your head. This will cause it part naturally. Then move your fingers in a zigzag motion at your scalp to lift your hair away from the roots. This will give it lift and air circulation to dry more quickly.Next use your hands to either scrunch your hair or twist it, depending upon your curl type and the look you desire.


When scrunching, either stand straight or flip your head first to one side, to the other and then forward.
Either way, place your hand under the end of your hair, one section at a time, and scrunch upward toward the root a few times. Then move to another section.
When twisting, use your fingers to hook onto 1-3"" sections of hair and twist it around your finger, moving from the bottom up, and hold for 15-30 seconds. They should be pretty well defined. If not, add a bit more product to your hair.As your hair dries, don’t touch it! Running your hands through your hair only breaks up the curls and creates flyaways and frizzy pieces of hair., One of the benefits of using heat to dry your hair is that it helps lift roots to provide volume, especially at the top of your head. Here are some tricks to add volume that involve parting your hair and pinning it in different ways as it air dries.


Part your hair to the side you normally wouldn't and then flip it back just before it’s dry.
Create a deeper side part on the side you normally part your hair and then flip it down just before your hair is dry.
Make a zigzag part, and use your fingers to part along your natural part just before your hair dries. Or you can make a zigzag part after your hair dries.
Take flat pin curl clips, which won’t leave lines or marks in your hair, and clip them at the roots on the top of your head and along your part line. Remove them when your hair is dry.Use claw clips to secure rows of hair. Grab two, roughly 1-2” sections of hair near your forehead (one on each side of your part), crisscross them and secure it with a small claw clip. Make 2-4 more rows behind, or going away from your forehead., Let your hair fully dry, and then remove any clips. Use your fingers to separate your curls unless they’ve dried in the style you prefer. If separating, use only one or two fingers to gently loosen each curl. You can loosen them more a second time; however, over-loosening isn’t an easy fix. Finish with a styling product such as these.


Spritz or spray a medium-hold flexible or medium-hold humidity-resistant hairspray all over your hair. Hold the can about 12” from your head. Keep your hand moving the whole time, and use the smallest amount needed.For a textured or piece-y finish, rub a penny-sized amount of pomade between your palms. Use your fingers to apply it from the mid-shaft to the ends.Use thicker, water-soluble gels (or those with guar gum) that don’t feel sticky to help tame and control medium-to-big curls. Use denser creams for tight curls.You can also finish your hair with an anti-frizz or smoothing serum or a natural treatment oil like argan, coconut, avocado, sweet almond or grape seed. Use only a dab and rub it between your palms before either a) applying it to areas that are frizzy or need more control or b) to the ends using a twisting motion.
Avoid products with silicones unless they are water-soluble or more gentle on the hair. More gentle silicones are amodimethicone, cyclomethicone/cyclopentasiloxane and trimethyl-silylamodi-methicone. Silicones that are more water-soluble include behenoxy dimethicone and stearoxy dimethicone."

Buy the right blow dryer.,
Make sure you get a diffuser.,
Wash and condition your hair.,
Apply an anti-frizz, curling or smoothing product and detangle your hair.,
Apply a thermal protectant.,
Dry your hair with the diffuser.,
Allow your hair to completely dry and apply a finishing product.",How to Dry Curly Hair2," All use of heat on hair is damaging in some way, particularly so for curly hair that already tends to be dry and more prone to breaking. In fact, excessive heat changes the proteins in hair that creates the signature spiral shape of curly hair.So use a blow dryer that’s no more than 1300-1874 watts (1400 watts is all you really need) with a cool shot button and multiple heat and speed settings.If you plan to dry your curly hair frequently, get a ceramic, ceramic ionic or ceramic tourmaline blow dryer. All reduce damage by either emitting infrared heat or using negative ions to break down water molecules., Some blow dryers come with diffusers; others do not. Yet they are crucial for blow drying curly hair because they help evenly distribute heat, create volume in heavy curls, minimize frizz, and help keep curls intact. The normal nozzle on a blow dryer blows hair everywhere, which only distorts curl patterns and creates frizz. Diffusers also enhance curls for hair that’s less wavy.


Choose a diffuser that's concave in the center, or not flat, so curls can rest inside it and take shape naturally.Or buy one that has a cup-like shape in which curls can nestle.
Also look for a diffuser that’s about 2½-3” wide for better heat distribution and that has at least 1-2” long “fingers” to help separate curls. They need to be long enough to reach roots for lift and volume.While many diffusers claim to fit all hair dryers, online reviewers say this isn’t always the case. You may have to go by trial-and-error.
You also might buy a blow dryer that comes with a diffuser, buy a diffuser that comes with a ring or strap to help secure it to your blow dryer, or go to your blow dryer company’s product website and see if it recommends particular diffusers for your dryer model.

, After you’ve washed your hair, use a wide-toothed comb to distribute either a moisturizing or protein conditioner through your hair. Unless you are-co-washing, alternating between the two on a daily or weekly basis will help to maintain the proper balance of moisture and protein hair needs for strength and elasticity. Let it absorb into your hair for a few minutes before rinsing. Then rinse your hair again with cool water to seal the cuticles.


Afterward, use your hands to gently squeeze excess water from your hair. Next squeeze your hair with a t-shirt, soft towel or super-absorbent, micro-fiber cloth to soak up more water before patting downward to help cuticles lay flat.

, Divide your hair into sections, and use a wide-toothed comb to detangle your hair. After you have detangled a section, twist it and pin it up with a clip. Once done, remove all clips.


You can apply the product to each section of hair as you detangle. Or you can apply it afterward.

, Though you’ll be drying your hair on low-to-medium heat, any heat is damaging to hair. Thermal protectants form a protective barrier around each hair stand to reduce damage to hair cuticles. They also cut down on drying out the hair shaft more than necessary. Some are silicone-based and offer the most protection, but these also create the most build-up and often weigh down hair. Others are water-based and oil-based. Avoid the latter should if your hair gets greasy quickly.After you comb it through your hair, create your part, hold the ends of your hair with your hands, shake them side-to-side, and then let go so your curls bounce back up., There are a few ways to do this, and much of it depends upon the length and thickness of your hair and how much volume you want to create. For starters, though, always work in sections (you can use clips if that helps). Also blow dry on low-to-medium heat so you don’t burn your scalp and use a low-to-medium air speed setting to reduce frizz. Additionally, only dry your hair 80-95% if it’s curly, not wavy, before letting it air dry the rest of the way. Do the ends last or not at all. Both of these measures will reduce damage and frizz.One way to dry with a diffuser is to hold the blow dryer at a 90˚ angle from your head and place the diffuser at the roots of one section of hair. Start at the nape of your neck and gently hold the ends away from the blow dryer. Turn on the blow dryer and use the fingers of the diffuser to lift hair at the roots. Move in a circular direction at the same time.Another way, one that will add more volume, is to flip your head upside down and place the diffuser at the roots of your hair. Use the diffuser’s fingers to lift the roots in a circular direction. Then use the diffuser to scrunch up the mid-shaft to hold and dry. With this method, you want the roots and mid-shaft to dry completely to lock in volume.Another option is to tilt your head to one side and use your hand to cup up one section of hair from the mid-shaft to the root. Place the diffuser at the roots and hold the dryer at a 90˚ angle.Then turn on the blow dryer and dry for a couple of minutes before turning it off to move to another section. Tilt your head the opposite direction to do the other side, then start at your crown and move down. At the end, go back through using the dryer’s cool shot button to set it.Finally, if your hair is wavy and you’re trying to add more curl, place your ends in the cup of the diffuser one section at a time. Push it to your scalp and hold until dry.Some also find it beneficial to let their hair air dry for 20-30 minutes, or until it’s about 50% dry, to allow its natural curl pattern to better form. If you’re trying to enhance curl, however, you should begin drying immediately.

, Once your hair is dry, you want to set it. Spritz or spray a medium-hold flexible or humidity-resistant hairspray in a continuous motion over your hair. You can also use a pomade, especially if your hair feels a bit crunchy, by smoothing it over, not through, your curls. Or you can finish with a drop of serum or a naturally based oil. Smooth it over frizzy spots or apply it to the ends with a twist."

Pin-curl hair and wrap it.,
Try “plopping” your hair to cut down on drying time.,
Use a bonnet dryer or hooded dryer.",How to Dry Curly Hair3," Drying mid-to-long curly hair with heat will typically take 30 minutes, if not much longer. If you don’t have this time, the best choice in many cases is to set and wrap your hair before you go to sleep. While your hair is still damp, not wet or dry, wind 1-2” sections toward your scalp and secure each with bobby pins. Then wrap your hair in a silk scarf to reduce flyaways. When you get up, use your fingers or a wide-toothed comb to unravel your curls and style.


If your hair is particularly curly, you can also twist or braid your hair before wrapping it., The idea behind plopping is that it not only reduces how long it takes your hair to dry but it also helps create a more polished curly look. Because your curls will stack on top of each other through plopping, they will have more spring and shape, and you’ll get more volume at your roots. Wash, condition and apply an anti-frizz or curling product to your hair first. Then follow these steps.


Lay a large t-shirt on a flat surface with the short sleeves closest to you.
Bend over and place your head in the center so your hair is lying above it on the t-shirt, and fold the end of the t-shirt over your hair and top of your head.
Grab the sleeves and twist inward toward your ears. Tie it (or secure with a clip) loosely at the base of your neck.
Leave it on for about 15-30 minutes and allow your hair to air dry the rest of the way., A bonnet dryer is a plastic cap that you wrap around your hair to dry it. It’s a more gentle method of drying hair than using a blow dryer, though it takes longer. Nonetheless, it will also speed up your total drying time if you don’t want to use a blow dryer because of its damaging effects.Hooded dryers are another less-damaging alternative.They aren’t as expensive as you might think; however, make sure you get one that is large enough to accommodate your head in rollers.


Both are hands-free, too, which is an advantage.

Relax curls with a “doobie” wrap.,
Set your hair with rollers to relax curl or straighten hair.,
Use your shower’s steam to set curls.,
Use a curl-enhancing product.,
Blow dry hair straighter.,
Defy gravity if you have wavy hair.",How to Dry Curly Hair4," A doobie wrap – or simply doobie – is a Dominican technique for wrapping and pinning hair to straighten it. Start with your hair wet. Part it in the middle and begin on one side by combing 1-3” sections of hair straight. Pull and smooth each section with the comb around your head. Secure it with a long bobby pin at the crown of your head, the nape of your neck and the end point. Move to the other half of your hair and do the same, combing it on top of the hair that’s already pinned.


Wrap a silk scarf around your hair if you’re going to sleep.Otherwise, let it air dry, or use a bonnet dryer or a hooded dryer., Start by applying a setting lotion to your hair. This will help straighten it and make the straightening last longer. Use a wide-toothed comb to part your hair into sections, and roll 2-4” sections of hair onto 2-4” metal or mesh rollers. Pull tight at the scalp because this is the area that’s most resistant to straightening. Secure each roller at the scalp with a large clip. Make sure you roll backward, away from the face.


Allow your hair to dry naturally, or use a bonnet dryer or hooded dryer on a low heat before switching to cool to set your curls.
You can also combine air-drying with either dryer by letting your hair air dry for awhile before using one of the dryers. Or you can dry it partially with one of the dryers and then let it air dry the rest of the way.
Test to see if it’s dry by unrolling one roller at the back of your head after about 45 minutes, longer if your hair is very thick or coarse. , First, don’t turn on the vent before you shower. After you’ve washed and conditioned your hair, stay in the shower or the bathroom and let your hair soak in the steam. This will help enhance your curls. Then apply a curling or anti-frizz serum, lotion, cream, oil, etc. to your hair while it’s still quite wet.

, There are a number on the market, so reading reviews online is a good place to start if you don’t already use one. You don’t want to use too much of any product because it will weigh down hair, and your curls won’t last as long. Using a moisturizing conditioner and not rinsing it out enhances and holds curls unless your hair is fine or wavy. Applying mousse and then scrunching works very well for hair that is less curly. It can also help shape and define curls as well.Use roughly a nickel- to a quarter-sized amount of anti-frizz serums, creams and oils. If you go overboard, sprinkle some baby powder or dry shampoo on your hair and use your blow dryer to blast the area with cool air.
If you use mousse or foam, spray out a cloud the size of a golf ball. Pat your hands together and finger comb it through your hair, starting at your roots., This can be quite damaging to your hair, so use a thermal heat protectant and the lowest heat setting on your blow dryer. You also want to use a blow dryer with a concentrator attachment that will direct the heat so your hair isn’t flying about, creating frizz. Work in 2-3” sections, using a large, round boar bristle or nylon brush. Firmly roll under your hair as you pass over it with the blow dryer.


Make sure the blow dryer is pointed in a downward direction to smooth hair cuticles.
Always start at your roots and move to the ends., The goal when trying to make wavy hair hold its wave or to make it curlier is to avoid anything that will pull on the waves. Blow drying with a diffuser is one way. Flip your head over and to the sides to scrunch whether air-drying or using a blow dryer.


Use lower heat and speed settings when using a blow dryer for a more gentle dry that won’t stretch or blow out curls."

Decide where you want your ponytail to sit.,
Tease your hair slightly at your crown.,
Gather your hair back.,
Secure your ponytail in place.,
Consider doing a double ponytail.",How to Do Simple and Cute Hairstyles1," Ponytails are incredibly versatile. Your ponytail's placement can dramatically affect your look.


High ponytails sit on the crown of your head so that the ponytail is visible from the front. These are very dramatic and fashionable.Tying your hair just a few inches lower gives a more sporty look.
Low ponytails at the nape of your neck can make you look down-to-earth.
Another less common type of ponytail is one tied to the side of the head instead of the back. Side ponytails can make you seem quirky and fun.;
, Take a section of hair from the back of your head where it starts to curve downward. Gently backcomb the bottom part of this section with two or three passes.To backcomb, grip the section of hair and hold it vertically away from your scalp. Run a comb from the middle of the back of your hair towards the roots, stroking downward. Repeat this until the gathered strands have created a cushion on your crown.
If you are doing a side ponytail, tease a small section of hair right above where you plan on placing the hair tie.
If your hair is curly, you can skip this step.

, Use both hands to sweep the majority of your hair backward and hold it in place with one hand. For a sleek and practical ponytail to keep hair out of your face, gather all of your hair, including your bangs. For a more laid-back look, leave your bangs loose.


For a side ponytail, gather your hair to the side instead.

, Take a hair tie and pull it over your ponytail from the back. Once the elastic reaches the base of your ponytail, twist it into a figure 8. Pull your ponytail back through this new opening. Repeat this until the hair tie no longer has slack and your ponytail isn't budging from its desired position.


For extra style, you can use a colorful scrunchy. You could even create your own unique ponytail by adding braids or twists wherever you want. For a simpler look, use a plain elastic.

, One easy secret to creating a longer-looking ponytail is to stack two ponytails on top of each other. Instead of tying all of your hair back at once, separate it into top and bottom halves. Tie each half back as its own ponytail. Comb the ends of the two ponytails together so they blend together as a single, very long ponytail."

Get a hair donut.,
Put your hair into a ponytail.,
Pull your ponytail through the center of your sock bun.,
Roll your hair onto the donut.,
Roll the hair donut down around the base of your ponytail.",How to Do Simple and Cute Hairstyles2," The most important thing you'll need to make a sock bun is a spongy donut-shaped item to wrap it around. Hair donuts are what give the sock bun its perfect shape. You can either buy a hair donut or make one for yourself by cutting the toe off of a tube sock.Discard the toe. The remaining sock tube will be your donut. You don't have to shape the tube; it will take on a donut shape further on.

, Use the techniques discussed elsewhere in this article. Place the base of your ponytail wherever you want your bun to sit. The most popular position for a sock bun is on the crown of your head starting from a high ponytail. It's better to use a thin hair tie rather than a bulky scrunchie, as a scrunchie may cause bumps in your bun.

, If you're using a hair donut, just put it on just as you would a scrunchie. If you're using a sock, pull it down to the base of your ponytail. Then, take one edge of the sock and roll it up into itself until it takes on a solid donut shape around your hair., Bring the donut up to the tip of your ponytail. Spread the ends of your hair evenly around the donut. Then slowly roll the donut down towards the base of your ponytail, wrapping your hair with it., Tuck any loose strands into the donut. If you can see the donut through gaps in your hair, gently spread your hair out a bit to cover them. Depending on how tight you've rolled your bun and how thick your hair is, you may not need to secure it any further. If your hair is very fine or you've rolled it loosely, secure your bun with a few bobby pins."

Twist your hair.,
Coil your hair into a bun.,
Secure your wrapped hair.",How to Do Simple and Cute Hairstyles3," A chignon is a classic hairstyle that can be thought of as a cross between a ponytail and a bun. Make sure you have two large and four small bobby pins on hand if you decide to go with this style.

, Take your gathered up hair with one hand and twist it in a clockwise direction by rolling your wrist. Be gentle to avoid hair breakage or hurting your scalp. Keep twisting until all of your hair from the nape of your neck to the tips is a tight spiral., Hold your hair with one hand, maintaining its twisted spiral. With that same hand, begin to wrap the whole strand in a clockwise circle around its base. Place your index finger of your other hand in the center of the base to keep the bun in shape. Once you've gotten down to the end of your hair, wrap the tips underneath the rest of the bun.You can also do a counterclockwise chignon. If you choose this option, start by twisting your hair counterclockwise instead in Step 2.

, Use large bobby pins on either side to hold your bun securely. Make any minor changes to your bun's shape you'd like by gently pulling edges loose with your fingers. Once you have the desired shape, pin it in place with the four smaller bobby pins.


You may choose to put the finishing touches on your chignon by adding a little volume to your hairdo. Use the tail of a comb and gently slide it under the hair at your crown. Gently pull the hair slightly up and out of the bun. You can use the same technique on the outer portion of the bun."

Move the back portion of the headband wherever you want your tuck to be. A popular position is the nape of the neck., It must be both tight enough to stay in place all day and loose enough for hair to be tucked into. Your headband should not slide around at all on your head. You should be able to slide two to three fingers comfortably underneath the headband. Don't wear a headband that feels like it's pinching your head.

, You can wear your ponytail high, low, or right in the middle. The decision is based on your preference.Make a low to mid level ponytail by brushing all of your hair straight back and holding it in one hand. A fine tooth comb works great for smoothing out your hair once you already have it brushed back.
Make a high ponytail by flipping your head upside down, and gathering your hair in your hands. Use a brush to smooth your hair out on your head, and flatten any bumps. When you have it at the right height, pick your head back up, and check it for bumps. If you do have uneven hair, use a comb to smooth it out., Flip your hair through the hair-tie, and tie it around your hair two to three times. The amount you wrap the tie around will depend on your hair type as well as the thickness of the elastic tie. Just be sure that your ponytail is tightly secured.


Use hairspray to help hold your hair in place, and prevent any split ends from sticking up.
Try using an elastic hair tie that advertises as being damage-free. This will help protect your hair from breakage.

Make your own doughnut bun with a large, stretchy tube sock. Cut off one inch at the end of the sock, and roll it up. Then, roll the sock down toward the bottom edge so that it forms a doughnut shape. It should be rolled tight and be even all the way around.
You can find doughnut forms in the hair accessories section of most drugstores. They are sold in blonde, brown, and black colors so you can find one that best matches your hair.

, Doughnut buns look good high or low, so the height of your ponytail is up to you. Be sure to smooth out the hair on your head, and make the ponytail tight.


Use a fine tooth comb to help smooth out your hair into the elastic. If you prefer a looser, messier look, then do not pull your hair back as tight.
Consider spraying your hair with some hair spray to help hold your hair in place, and smooth it down.

, Start by pulling your ponytail through the form or sock hole. Bring it all the way down to your hair tie, and make sure all of the hair from your pony tail is pulled through. Brush your hair out again if needed., Start by pulling your ponytail up, and letting it fall evenly around the form. You should not be able to see the form peaking out through any hair gaps. Once you have fully covered the form, wrap the ends of your hair around the form, twisting all of your hair in the same direction. The ends of your hair will create a hair ring around the base of your bun.If you find it hard to completely cover the form or sock, try using a smaller doughnut accessory that your hair will more easily cover., As your hair is in place over the form, completely covering it, carefully place another elastic over the bun, and let it sit around the base. This is meant to hold your hair neatly over the bun accessory.

, The ends of your hair that are left sticking out need to be wrapped around the bun. Start by dividing it into two parts. Twirl each part around the base of your bun going in opposite directions. The goal is to create an even hair ring around the bun.

, Once you have the ends of your hair placed neatly around your bun, pin them in place. You will need about three to five bobby pins depending on your hair type. Push the pins into either the doughnut form, or just beneath the sock. Be sure that the bun is tightly secured with pins before you finish., This look should have no problem making it through the day. For extra hold, add hairspray, and bring extra bobby pins with you in case you need them later.

Brush
Comb
Several hair clips

, Once your hair is about 80% dry, add in a bit of hair mousse or another volume stabilizing product of your choice.


Carefully spray about a quarter size of mousse into one of your palms. Mousse expands quite a bit once it is out of the can, so try not to spray too much.
Rub the mousse between your palms, and then spread both hands through your hair. Start at the root, and bring your fingers down through your hair to the ends. Be sure to evenly cover all of you hair.

, Take each section, and begin twisting at the roots all the way down to the ends. You want to make the twists tight, but not so tight that it hurts your head., Make sure that you twist the hair on the inside of the twists. You can do this by coming your fingers through your hair as you twist. Simply twist the section of hair around, pulling your fingers through as you do, and then remove your twisting hand, and hold the hair section with the opposite hand in place. Then, repeat the twisting process until you have twisted all the way to the ends of your hair.You will twist each section separately, but in the same direction. So both sides either need to be twisted away from your face or towards your face., After you are done twisting, clip each section securely in place at the crown of your head. You can use bobby pins to help keep each section in place., The trick to this style is letting your hair dry overnight in the twists so that in the morning, you can remove the clips, and reveal the waves., After you have removed the clips, gently brush your hair, or use your fingers to comb through the waves in your hair. Add hairspray if you desire. The waves should last all day, but it depends on your hair type, climate, and styling products used."

Start by getting your hair in top form.,
Know the four foundational updos.,
Take your hair length and facial form into consideration.,
Ensure your updo will work with your headpiece, veil and/or hair adornments.,
Consider your dress and theme when choosing an updo.,
Look at photos of updos to help in your selection.,
Schedule or perform a trial run, or more than one.,
Don’t wash your hair the day before your wedding.",How to Do Wedding Updos1," All hairstyles will look more polished once done and be easier to create when your hair is healthy. If it’s not in its best shape, start fixing that early. Start by getting a deep conditioning and an allover trim. Continue these, in addition to maintaining the necessary balance of moisture and protein in your hair, through washing and conditioning. Finally, avoid styling your hair with heat as much as possible, or ensure you use thermal heat protectant products and low heat when you do.


You will know your hair needs more protein if it feels dry and frizzy, stretches a great deal but still breaks, feels limp when wet, or if it doesn’t hold its curl or style very well.
It needs more moisture if it breaks or snaps very easily, feels brittle or straw-like, or doesn’t stretch much or at all.Since you may not yet know what updo you will choose, don’t make any drastic hairstyle changes in cut or color before your wedding.On your wedding day, you also don’t want to overdo it on hair products. Your goal is shiny and frizz-free hair, but you also want it to look natural, not nuclear.;
, The classic updos are the French twist, bouffant, chignon and bun. From here, there are not only subcategories such as the beehive is to the bouffant but also hundreds, if not thousands, of variations to these four classics. A number of techniques are used in these variations, such as braiding, twisting, rolling, tucking, knotting, teasing and lots of pinning hair. Below are descriptions of the fundamental four.


A bun is typically made from a ponytail, though it doesn’t have to be, that’s wrapped around itself, whether twisted or braided. They can be anywhere on the head.
A chignon technically means a low bun, but in modern terms also represents using a variety of techniques like tucking and rolling hair. They are always low on the head. A French twist is a created by tucking hair in a vertical row at the back of the head. A French braid is a braid woven close to the head from three sections of hair.A bouffant is a style popularized by Audrey Hepburn, in which the hair is generally teased and arranged in a higher, rounded shape with bangs in most cases.

, When choosing an updo, thinking about your hair length at the time of your wedding (and trial run) is critical. While there are dozens of updos for short, medium and long hair, not all work for all hair lengths.Additionally, as with all hairstyles, some are more flattering on certain face shapes than others. Here are some tips for choosing an updo according to your face shape.Oval-shaped faces can do nearly any updo, and bangs will accentuate your eyes. But don’t wear too much hair in your face.
Round-shaped faces want to add focus to the crown, so a French twist with curls on top, tousled bangs to the side, and off-center parts all work well. Avoid slick-back styles, those that add width around your face, or straight and flat bangs.
Heart-shaped faces benefit from bangs and wisps on the side of the face and side parts but should stay away from slick-back styles and too much height at the crown.
Oblong/rectangular-shaped faces look good with slick-back looks, side parts, fuller styles such as piled curls and bangs to shorten your face. Shy away from tight curls on top of the head, wisps around the face and center parts.
Reverse triangle/pear-shaped faces look best with updos that add height on the crown, especially with full bangs, and updos with wisps of hair angled toward the face. Too much height, however, should be avoided as should center parts.
Square-shaped faces do well with wisps around the face and bang areas and curly updos. Straight, flat bangs and center parts, though, aren’t your best bet.Check out this website also to help you choose a flattering updo: thehairstyler.com/hair-consultations/find-your-perfect-updo-hairstyle.

, Not every bride chooses to wear a headpiece, veil or adornments in their hair, but if you do, it’s essential to factor yours into deciding upon an updo. It will affect your options. In fact, you cannot choose an updo until you’ve selected your headpiece.If, however, you find an updo you fall in love with, you might consider forgoing a headpiece altogether. Here are some tips on selecting headpieces and adornments if you decide to do so.


Stay away from headpieces that poke and prod at your head when you initially try them on; it won’t get any better, and by the end of your long wedding day your head will be killing you, literally.
Because of this, look for headpieces that require fewer pins or have fewer teeth in the combs.If your hair is fine and straight, your headpiece will need fine-toothed combs if that’s how it’s attached. If you find one with wide-toothed combs that you love, ask the store if they can replace them.Short-hair updos can greatly benefit from adornments, such as a rose tucked into the back where a bun might be if your hair were longer, for example.
Larger, oblong hair clips work well at the mid-to-lower seam of French twists, and jeweled pins clipped on low-swept fronts and among messy curls substitute nicely for a headpiece.

, What word would you use to describe your look and wedding? Vintage? Classic? Glamorous? When selecting an updo, keep this word in mind and choose accordingly. For instance, if your dress is a large but simple ball gown, a dramatic updo might be most appropriate while something more subdued and sleek might be best for a dress with a more intricate design.


Your updo should be complementary to your wedding gown, not in competition with it., When searching for a wedding gown, you’re able to try on dozens, or more. The same doesn’t apply when searching for the perfect updo. Nonetheless, to find what you most want, you need to see what’s out there from which to choose. Start looking through bridal magazines and websites, focusing on how various updos are paired with dresses and facial types.Also look at publications and websites in which celebrities are featured attending red-carpet events as many will be wearing updos.


When you find updos you like, either tear them from the publication or print them. Use a sharpie to write what you like about each, and file them in a folder marked “Updos.”
After you’ve collected a nice sample, go through them to see if you notice any themes, such as multiple photos of a side-swept, low bun or a particular way bangs are styled.
From here, narrow it down to 1-2 updo styles and choose the versions of each you most like.
If you’re having trouble, remember that classic updos are timeless, ones you won’t look back on in photos and regret. Trends come and they go!

, You may choose to do your hair yourself, or you may have a trusted friend or a stylist do it for you. Whatever you choose, don’t wait until the day of your wedding to find out what your updo will look like on you – or if it will even work with your hair texture and length. If your hair is the length it will be when you wed, you can go ahead and do the trial run as soon as you’ve selected a gown, veil and headpiece. If not, it’s best to wait until closer to your wedding day as weather affects hair, stylists move, you might change your mind and so forth.If you choose to go with a stylist but haven’t chosen one, ask other women you know, your wedding planner, the coordinator at your wedding or reception venue, look online, talk with your wedding photographer, etc., for recommendations.
Take your collected images with you, along with your headpiece, veil and a photo of your dress, to your trial run.
Ask to see the stylist’s portfolio, and don’t be afraid to not only voice your opinion but also seek another stylist if it’s just not working to your satisfaction.

, “Dirty” hair holds curl longer, is easier to tease and will have more shine as the natural oils in your scalp will have had time to spread the length of your hair. When you shower, put a cap on or pull it back with a scrunchy. At most rinse, but certainly don’t shampoo. And remember: Give yourself plenty of time, wear a button-down shirt or one with a very loose neck, and don’t suffer for hours from hair that’s pulled too tight or from pins jabbing you everywhere."

Switch to a shorter blade to finish the cut.",How to Do Undercut Hair for Women," Before going for an undercut, it’s important to consider your hair’s texture. An undercut removes some of the weight and body from your hair so it’s an ideal option for thick, coarse hair that can sometimes get too puffy.If you have fine or thin hair, you may want to reconsider choosing an undercut. It can actually make your hair appear thinner and take away the body.
An undercut can be a good style for big, curly hair because it can take out some of the bulk.;
, An undercut can be as subtle or as deep as you like, depending on how short you cut the hair. Take the length of the rest of your hair into account. The shorter that your hair is overall, the shorter you can go with the undercut without creating too big a contrast. With long hair, you may want to keep the undercut a little longer for a more subtle look. If you want to ease your way into an undercut, keep it at 13- to 16-mm. For a bolder undercut, go for 6- to 10-mm.When you’re trying an undercut for the first time, it’s best to go for a longer cut. You can always go shorter, but you’ll have to wait for your hair to grow out if you cut it too short to begin with.

, In addition to the length or depth, the size of your undercut also determines how dramatic your look will be. If you’re getting your first undercut, it’s best to keep the area that you cut fairly small. However, if you want a bold look, you may want to use a larger area for the undercut so more of it peeks out.In general, most undercuts involve just the lowest section of hair at the back of your head. The line of your natural part serves as the border. This type of undercut is usually only visible if you pull your hair up unless your overall haircut is very short.
For the most dramatic undercut, you can cut the two bottom sections or even leave just the top section out and cut all of the lower layers. Keep in mind that if you do drastic undercuts like these, your shorn hair will be visible most of the time.

, If you're doing the undercut to yourself, you're going to need to be able to see the back of your head so you know where you're cutting. Sit down in front of a large wall-mounted mirror to do the cut and have a medium-sized hand mirror available that you can hold up to the back of your head so you can see it in the wall mirror., To get ready for the haircut, you want to pull all of the hair that you aren’t cutting out of the way. Run your thumbs behind your ears to lift up the top sections of your hair, twist it to create a single rope of hair, and secure it with a clip so only the area of hair that you plan to cut is left down.Make sure that there are no stray hairs from the upper sections of your hair that have fallen loose. You may accidentally wind up cutting them, and your undercut will turn out uneven.

, For the neatest looking undercut, you want to make sure that the part between it and the rest of your hair is as straight as possible. Use the end of a teasing comb to trace along the natural part and lift out any small piece of hair that should be part of the upper sections of your hair.You don’t necessarily have to use a straight part for the top of the undercut. For example, you may prefer a zigzag pattern to add more flair to your cut. However, you’ll want to start with the straight part and use the clippers to cut the design into your hair.

, Once you’ve secured the top sections of your hair out of the way and ensured that your part is straight, you’ll still want to have a guide when you begin cutting. Place a headband right along the bottom edge of the top sections of your hair. That will block off the section of hair that you are cutting so you don’t cut any hair that you shouldn’t.Any type of headband that will stay in place on the back of your head without you having to hold it will work fine.

, If your hair is fairly long in the back, it can be difficult to take all of the necessary hair for the undercut off with your clippers. Instead, use a pair of scissors to cut off the major length from the designated area so you can just go with the clippers to buzz off the rest.Don’t wet your hair before you cut it. It’s usually easier to do when it’s dry.
Because you’re going to finish off your cut with clippers, you don’t have to worry about being precise with the scissors. That means any size scissors will work, including small cuticle scissors or the large pair you usually use for crafts.

, Most clippers come with several different blades that allow you to control how short you clip your hair. Even if you’re going for a super short undercut, you may want to start with a blade that keeps your hair longer and then switch to a closer blade to finish off the look so you don’t take off more than you want.The grade 2 length blade cuts your hair to approximately 6-mm.
The grade 3 length blade cuts your hair to approximately 10-mm.
The grade 4 length blade cuts your hair to approximately 13-mm.
The grade 5 length blade cuts your hair to approximately 16-mm.
The grade 6 length blade cuts your hair to approximately 19-mm.
The grade 7 length blade cuts your hair to approximately 22-mm.
The grade 8 length blade cuts your hair to approximately 25-mm.

, Once you’ve chosen the appropriate blade for your clippers, run them over the section of hair that you want to cut in an upward direction to just below the headband to remove it. Move the clippers over the entire section once and then go back in to cut the hair shorter if necessary.It helps to keep your free hand braced on the headband so it stays in place and you don’t accidentally cut off more hair than you intend.

, After you’ve removed the bulk of your hair, you may find that it’s not quite as short as you’d like. Swap the blade on your clippers for the next smallest size, and go over the hair a second time to finish it off.Don’t panic if you wind up cutting your hair a little too short. It will grow in fairly quickly, and if you’ve only removed the lowest section of hair, it will be fairly subtle.

Choose the right clipper.,
Identify the recipient’s upper temple area.,
Visualize disconnecting the haircut.",How to Do Undercut Hair for Men1," Without a good clipper, doing undercut hair for men can be difficult. Ideally, your clipper will be a single-length clipper. But if you want to do fading and tapering, you will need a clipper that allows length adjustments.The ideal clipper to do undercut hair for men is one of high quality and high durability. An Andis cordless clipper, for instance, is a popular option. As for corded clippers, an Andis or Oster model is preferable.
With a single-length clipper, choose one that is numbered one, two, or three. You could also use a number zero, but this tends to be too short. A clipper set at four or above is usually too long, though some men might want to “test drive” an undercut by getting the short part of their hair clipped with a number four clipper.

, The temples are the corners of the forehead’s hairline, and provide an important guide when trying to do undercut hair for men. The temples sit in different locations on each person’s face.To identify a person’s temples, first locate their hairline, the place where their hair meets their forehead. You might also be able to locate the temple based on the position of the ears. The tops of the ears, traced forward to the edges of the face, typically intersect the temples.
Trace the hairline to its outer edges on the left and right side.
When you notice the hairline angle up and out, you’ve located the upper temple.

, Disconnecting the undercut refers to the process of keeping the hair that remains long on top distinct from the hair that is cut short. To do undercut hair for men, disconnect the hair at the upper temple level.Imagine, in other words, drawing a straight horizontal line around the “lid” of the head that passes through the right and left upper temple. Cutting hair below this line short and keeping hair above this line long will allow you to achieve a quality undercut for men.

, Start on the top of your head and tease ½ - 1” sections of hair to the scalp all the way around your head before using your fingers to gently break up the teasing on the surface of the hair only, making it smooth. Next create a gentle side part and smooth the smaller section to the center back of your head, securing it with 2-3 large bobby pins in a vertical direction. Take the other side of your hair (or in sections) and use your hands or a fine-toothed comb to smooth it to the center and fold it over the exposed bobby pins.

Smooth over your hair with your hands before finishing with a medium-hold hairspray.If you have long, thick and straight hair, try this: Pull your hair into a ponytail between the crown and the nape of your head, twist the ponytail around itself twice, tuck the ends into the twist, secure them with bobby pins and finish with a flexible-hold hairspray., Tease your hair at the crown and create one tight ponytail just beneath the middle of your head, securing it with a clear elastic band. Wrap a 2” piece of hair from the ponytail around it and the band, more than once if needed, and secure underneath with 2 bobby pins. Split the ponytail into two sections – top and bottom – and tease the bottom well while you smooth the top. Smooth the top section over the teased bottom and roll it under, toward the nape of your neck, and pin at the base of your ponytail. Use your hands to gently widen each side of the roll.


Rub a natural oil between your palms and run your fingers through your hair before spritzing on a medium-hold hairspray.For a messier chignon, divide the ponytail into four sections, twist and wind each to the ponytail’s base.

Set it with a light-hold hairspray.
You can also position the bun to the side of your head by creating a low side ponytail or at the top of your head by creating a high ponytail.

, Create a gentle part and twist 1-2” sections of hair over themselves, starting at the top of your head, continuously grabbing more sections of hair to pull out and over the ones before until you reach just below your ear. Secure the twined hair in place with a clip before doing the same to the other side. Next combine both into a low ponytail at the nape of your neck and work your fingers into the hair just above the ponytail band to create an oblong pouch. Bunch up the hair from your ponytail and tuck it inside the pouch, securing with bobby pins pushed downward into the pouch.


If you want the roll that’s produced to have more volume, tease and then smooth the surface of your ponytail before tucking.
Smooth all over with your hands and finish with a medium-hold hairspray.If you have bangs, you can twist them in as you start at the front or leave them out, manipulating them to the side with a flat iron or wearing them straight down.

Hairspray and tease the bottom two ponytails. Wrap the middle one around the back of the bottom one, and secure it with a bobby pin. Next wrap the bottom one around the front of the now-forming bun and pin. Take out the front ponytail band, tease the hair, smooth the top layer, pull it back to the bun, pin it, and wrap the rest around the bun, securing it with a bobby pin or two tucked underneath.


Before pulling the front section back, you can use a small amount of pomade to smooth the bun, and use pins to tuck in stray pieces.
Give it a good, all-over misting with a medium-hold hairspray to complete the look., Create a deep side part and use either a 1-2” barrel or triple-barrel curling iron to create waves, section-by-section, throughout your hair before letting your hair cool. Gently pull back the hair from just above your crown down to your ears and secure it with a clear elastic band into a loose ponytail just above the nape of your neck. Pull the band down so there’s space between it and your scalp and tuck the tail and the band underneath your hair, holding it in place with bobby pins.


Use a light or medium-hold hairspray and lightly spray all of your hair so curls don’t become weighed down.You can loosen the curls in the front by carefully running one or two fingers through them.
For more volume in the front, finger tease the curls at the root and then set with hairspray.

, Wind 1-2” sections of hair around a 2” barrel curling iron held vertically to create large curls for texture all over your head. Let them cool and then tease the hair at your crown. Take a 1-2” section of hair at both temples and pin them at the lower part of your head with bobby pins. Continue pinning back sections randomly – you’re going for loose, not stiff and tight. Curl any strands that fall out at the bottom and any long pieces in front to frame your face.


Finish with a light-hold hairspray.Make sure you apply a thermal heat protectant to your hair before brandishing the curling iron.

, Tease the top of your hair, smooth it, twist it in the direction you want the twist to go, push up on it for volume, and secure it with a bobby pin. Take all the hair on the other side, pull it to middle of your head, and secure with a vertical row of crisscrossed bobby pins. Take 1-2” sections of hair from the other side, starting at the top, and smooth each over in a curved fashion to cover the bobby pins before securing each with a bobby pin hidden underneath the twist. Create a small bun from the remaining tail hair, tuck in the ends and pin it against your head.Spray hairspray on your hands or rub a dab of smoothing serum or argan oil between your palms and run them other the front and sides of your hair to smooth.
Add a hair clip to the seam of the twist to glam it up or to hide areas that are a bit short and aren’t cooperating.

, Curl the ends of your hair using a 1-1¼” barrel curling iron to keep them from popping out of the tuck. Then apply a very small amount of a light-hold styling cream to the ends for extra hold. Position an elastic headband 1-2” behind your hairline and pin it in place. Starting on on one side in the front and moving down, take 1-2” pieces of hair, twist them back and up, tuck them into the headband, and secure each with a bobby pin if needed. Do this all the way around your head.


Spray well with a medium-hold hairspray.
You can also lightly tease and then smooth hair before twisting and tucking if yours is particularly fine."

;
, Two popular types of synthetic hair extensions to use for this style are the ones labeled Kanekalon (silky braiding hair) and Toyokalon (yaki braiding hair).You will need 3-4 packages of hair if you're aiming for a medium-length style.You can also use Marley hair extensions, but the coarser quality of this type of extension means it is better suited for Marley Twists., Open the package of extensions and separate the strands of braiding hair, if woven together, by gently rubbing them between your fingers. Separate the extensions into sections based on how wide you want your twists to be. Then, fold each section in half so that it forms a “U” shape. The bend is the point at which the extension section will be added to your real hair, while the two ends will be woven into the twists.









Proceed to trim the strands to your desired length using salon scissors.

, Wash your hair with your regular shampoo and detangle it using a wide-tooth comb or detangling spray. Dry your hair naturally or with a blow dryer on a cool setting so as to stretch the hair before you braid it.








Do not use any hair oil. You need your hair to be straight (but not slippery) in order for it to coil correctly.

, It is best to do this before separating sections of hair, as the part you create will stay put once you do the twists, and trying to adjust it afterward can be difficult., Choose a section of hair in the lowest layer, closest to the back of your neck. The section should be 1 inch (2.5 cm) or less in width.









Comb the section of hair out to remove any tangles.
Use small hair clips to keep the rest of your hair away from your fingers as you work on each particular section.

, Use your fingers to carefully divide the section up into two halves of equal width.









Do your best to completely separate the two smaller sections. You do not necessarily need to comb them out again, but each section should appear straight, and the two should not be joined together at any point.

, Use your fingers to gradually twist each smaller section to the right. Continue twisting until each section has been begun to twist into a coil.








Grab each section 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) from the scalp and twist from that point.
The two sections should be evenly twisted.

, Lay the center of a prepared piece of synthetic extension hair over the two sections of real hair before you begin twisting and coiling them. Bend the extension hair so that the center remains in between the two split halves of real hair. The ends of the extension should drape over the two sections of real hair already separated out.








Follow the same procedure used for real hair to twist the extension hair in. Grab both your real hair and the extension hair in between your fingers and twist to the right until it coils. This way, you secure the extension hair in place and weave it into your natural hair seamlessly.

, Overlap the right-hand section of hair over the left-hand section once. Coil the combined strands of hair to the right, bringing the overlapping section under and back up once more.









From this point on, you should continue to twist and coil the hair in this manner, working over and under from the right, until you reach the end of the two combined sections.
If done correctly, the twist should be tight enough and even enough to stay in place for a little while without being sealed immediately.

, Separate your remaining hair into similarly sized sections, working on one section at a time.









Each section of hair must be roughly the same size as the other sections. Otherwise, your Senegalese twists may look uneven when finished.
Similarly, you should use the same amount of extension hair for each twist.

, Doing so will hold the Senegalese twists in place for a long-term style.









Bring a small saucepan of water to boil over medium-high heat. Once it reaches a steady boil, remove the pan from the heat completely.
Carefully dunk the bottom ends of each twist into the hot water. Submerge each twist so that all the loose ends are covered. Leave each end in water for 15 seconds.
If doing Senegalese twists on smoother hair, you might need to gently knot the ends before sealing them in hot water or use hair elastics to tie them off.
Allow hair to dry naturally.

, It is recommended to dip the ends in olive oil or Jamaican castor oil after the water dries so as to lock moisture into the ends, preventing them from drying out. Allow to dry naturally once more.

, You should only wash Senegalese twists once a week. Use shampoo diluted with equal parts water.









If you wash your hair more frequently, you could cause the twists to unravel faster.

, Two to three times a week is ideal. Doing this will help hydrate your scalp.









Peppermint, coconut, or Jamaican Black Castor Oil (JBCO) are examples of oils you could use.

, Braid spray or liquid conditioner can keep your hair moisturized and healthy. In order to promote optimal hair health, you should use it once a day.









Avoid creamy conditioners while the braids are in place. Creamy conditioners can leave residue and build-up, and this, in turn, can create knots along the base of your twists.
For an all-in-one option for both your hair and your scalp, mix a little coconut oil, JBCO oil, and conditioner into a spray bottle of water. Apply this solution to both your scalp and hair daily, and skip a separate oil treatment for your scalp.

, Pull the twists back in a ponytail and tie a scarf made from a smooth material around your hair to protect them during the night.

Apply the clipper.,
Fade the hair.,
Readjust as needed.",How to Do Undercut Hair for Men2," Turn the clipper on. Move the clipper smoothly and evenly through the hair beneath the invisible disconnect line. You can start on the left and move around the back to the right, or start on the right and move around to the left.If you want to fade the undercut, set the clipper to the setting you wish to use. Cut the hair on all sides to a point about halfway to the disconnect line.
If you wish to do undercut hair for a man who wants a more dramatic contrast between the hair above and below the disconnect line, just cut all the hair beneath the disconnect line to an even length using the single-length clipper.
Use long, steady applications of the clippers and shake off hair that accumulates at the front of the device. This will prevent the clippers from getting clogged, and allow you to see where you’re cutting.;
, If you intend to blend the top edge of the hair below the disconnect line into the hair above the disconnect line (“fade” it), use a comb and scissors. Turn the comb so that its teeth are pointed up. Use the comb and draw out a short length of hair just above the halfway point below the disconnect line (the point up to which you previously cut using with the clippers). Use the scissors to cut the hair off.Continue around the back and sides of the head to achieve the same hair length at the same height everywhere.
Then, use the comb again at a level just above the one you previously cut. Draw out a slightly longer length of hair, again keeping the teeth of the comb upright.
Cut the hair off, again working your way around the entirety of the head to achieve an even length at the level you’ve selected.
Continue in this way until the hair below the disconnect line gradually blends into longer hair on all sides of the head.
The length you leave the longest hairs of the fade below the disconnect line is up to you. There is no right or wrong length into which you should fade.
It is not necessary to fade the hair when doing undercut hair for men. Just ask the recipient of the haircut if they wish to have their hair faded, or if they prefer to keep all hair below the disconnect line at an equal length.

, Whether you apply a fade or not, you will need to change the position of the clipper and the direction it moves several times. For instance, when cutting hair on the left side of the head, you might find it easiest to hold the clipper in your right hand and move it toward the back of the head. When cutting hair on the opposite side, you might find it easier to hold the clipper in your left hand and move it toward the back of the head. Move your hand to a comfortable position when doing undercut hair for men.After each application of the clipper, brush the hair straight down with your comb. This will allow you an opportunity to evaluate your handiwork and figure out if you need to cut more or rework the line along which you’re working.

Cut the top hair.,
Plan the part.,
Clean it up.",How to Do Undercut Hair for Men3," If the hair that remains above the disconnect line is longer than 4-6 inches, it will need to be cut. As you work toward the back of the disconnect line, the hair will need to be progressively shorter to keep it from hanging down over the back of the head.Hair closer to the forehead will be able to remain 4-6 inches long. But hair closer to the rear of the head might need to be cut down to one inch or less. With the recipient of the undercut for men in profile, cut the hair in rows.
For example, you might cut the one-inch-wide row closest to the front of the forehead to a length of six inches. The one-inch-wide row that follows it, which sits closer to the back of the head, might have a length of five inches. And the one-inch-wide row that follow that one might be even shorter, with a length of four inches.
Some men like to keep the hair above the disconnect line long and tie it into a topknot or bun. Ask the recipient of the undercut hair for men whether they wish the hair above the disconnect line to remain long.

, If the man receiving the undercut knows he wants to part it, ask which side he parts from. If he wants, you could keep the top hair (the bit above the disconnect line) longer on the side from which he parts it. This will better allow the hair to lay flat when parted.For example, if the hair will be parted from right to left, the hair just above the disconnect line on the right side of the head might be closer to six inches long, while the hair on the left side of the head might be closer to four or five inches long.

, Go over the sideburns and edges of the hair with an unguarded number zero clipper to achieve straighter edges. Try to achieve a straight, sloping line from the back of the ears to the neck, and a smooth curve along the hairline around the back of the neck. Remove any straggling neck hair creeping down the neck. Don’t forget to clip stray hair that may hide behind the ears.Wash the hair out in a hairdresser sink. Dry it with a towel.

Try a hair gel.,
Comb the undercut.,
Wear the undercut with or without facial hair.",How to Do Undercut Hair for Men4," Pomade is a hair product made of water-soluble solution. It helps hair achieve a clean shine and is a popular choice for holding undercut hair for men in place. Pomade is a suitable product for slicking undercut hair back or to the side., Styling wax is a hair product that gives your hair a smooth, soft texture but also creates definition. Styling wax might feel tacky in the hair and is thicker than gel, pomade, and other hair products.One potential styling combination is to slick your undercut hair back with styling wax, then blasting it with a hair dryer for twenty to thirty seconds to achieve more volume.

, Hairstyling cream (sometimes called “styling cream”) is the best choice for styling undercut hair for men that is curly or frizzy. In undercut hair for men, styling cream provides a natural shine and creates the impression that the undercut hair is thicker. It also has moisturizing properties to keep your hair healthy. Hairstyling cream allows the undercut hair more movement than styling wax or pomade, and is a good choice when you want you wish to give the hair more freedom.

, Hair gel offers the hair only limited movement. Hair gel is good for styling undercut hair with definition, shine, and texture. If, for instance, you want to style undercut hair into a spiked or other vertically-oriented shape, hair gel is your best bet.Hair gel tends to be thinner in consistency than pomade and often has a range of holding strengths, from “lightweight” to ‘’heavyweight.”Gels are easier to wash out of the hair than pomades and waxes.

, If the recipient of the undercut has wavy hair, use a wide-toothed comb to manipulate it. If they have straight hair, use a conventional comb. You can comb the hair to the side or slick it straight back., Men may want to wear the undercut with or without facial hair. An undercut looks great with a long beard, a short beard, or no beard at all. Getting your undercut with a nicely trimmed beard, though, can give you a more classic look."

To get the exact look, cut the top at a slight angle. You want one side to be a little longer when you slick it to the side and back., All that shaving likely left a lot of short, itchy hairs all over your back, neck, and shoulders. Hop into the shower, and rinse them off. Get your hair wet as well; you will need it wet in order to style it.

, Choose your favorite product that adds volume and body. Apply it to the top part of your hair (the part that you left long)., If you want more of a quiff, use your fingers to lift your hair upwards from the roots. This will give it extra lift and volume.You don't need to blue dry the shaved parts of your hair; it will dry quickly on its own.

, For a smoother, slicked back style, blow dry your hair straight using a comb. For more voluminous quiff or pomp, get out a round brush. Wrap the front part of your hair around the brush, upwards and away from your face. Blow dry it, then blast it with cool air to set the style. Carefully pull the brush out., Apply the product to your hands first. Rub it between your palms, then distribute it through your hair. To get more of a quiff or pomp, brush your hair up and back, then use your fingers to tousle and spike it.To get the classic Ruby Rose look, brush your hair off to the side and back.


Only apply the product to the long part of your hair, not the fade.
Set the style with a long-lasting hairspray, if needed.

Protect your twists while sleeping.",How to Do Marley Twists," Marley twists are made with a certain type of hair extension packaged and marketed as “Marley hair.” You'll want to get extensions labeled for this hair style since they will usually come in pre-measured sections, which can make the styling process much easier and smoother.


The specific brand and other qualities are a matter of personal preference. Everyone has their own favorites, but if you want a recommendation, talk to someone who has done this style before and ask for her opinion.
Note that most affordable hair extensions are made from synthetic hair, but most synthetic hair can be treated as you treat natural hair, making it easy to care for. Nonetheless, before you buy your extensions, it is a good idea to look at the “care” instructions on the back of the package to verify that there are no peculiarities to watch out for.;
, If hair extensions sometimes cause you irritation or if you have never used hair extensions and tend to have a sensitive scalp, you should consider soaking or spraying the extensions with a solution of water and apple cider vinegar.Dilute 1/2 cup (125 ml) apple cider vinegar with 2 cups (500 ml) water. Soak the hair in this solution for 1 or 2 minutes. Let it dry completely before use.
Soaking the extensions in this manner can help remove the alkaline base. This base has been known to cause allergic reactions and produce such side effects as bumps, irritation, and itchiness.

, Before you install the twists, you should give your hair a thorough washing with shampoo and a deep conditioning with a strong conditioner. Make sure that your hair is completely dry before continuing further.


Most women find that blow drying their hair will make it less frizzy than letting it air dry, especially if you use a diffuser. Do whatever works best for your hair, however. You want your hair to be completely dry, but with as little frizz as possible.

, Comb out your hair with a wide-tooth comb. If necessary, apply a detangler product to remove any kinks or knots.


There is some debate on whether or not you should use hair oil at this stage. Generally, the verdict is ""no."" Your hair should be fairly straight but not slippery. Moreover, the gel you apply later on in the process will help smooth out any frizzy strands of hair as you work.

, Divide your hair into 2-inch (5-cm) sections, starting at the nape and gradually working up the back of the head and around to the sides and front of your hair.


You can either separate all the sections out at the beginning of the process or separate them out as you work. The choice is up to you, but if you are new at this and want to make sure that the sections stay even in size, you might find it easier to separate all the sections out at the beginning.
Clip each section back with a bobby pin or other clip.

, Working one section at a time, apply a dot of hair gel to your natural hair, smoothing it down securely.


The hair gel gives your hair a little extra hold. Using it helps prevent the twist from unraveling when completed.
The gel can also help tame some frizziness that may occur after you wash your hair.
You can also apply a little gel as you need it during the twisting process. Gel should only be used in small dabs for the purpose of smoothing down stray pieces.

, Take one section of Marley hair from your package and bend it at the halfway point. Hold it between two fingers at this point so that it forms an upside-down U-shape.


Take this time to separate the strands of the Marley hair. Since the hair comes in tightly bundled sections, separating these sections is definitely necessary. All you really need to do is to pull down on each section a few times until you notice the hair start to unwind or loosen from its bundle. They should still be clumped together well enough to work with when done.
You should also play with both hanging ends of the section so that the hair tapers off instead of coming to a blunt, hard stop.

, Start with a section of hair at the back and bottom of your head. Place the bent center of your Marley hair over the top of your real hair, keeping your real hair in the center.


You should be holding three sections of hair in your hands at this point.

, Braid the three sections together for about 1 inch (2.5 cm). This braid will secure the extensions in your hair.


After you braid the hair, rearrange the remaining loose ends so that you have two sections instead of three. The simplest way to do this is to split the center section in half, distributing equal amounts of the section to the two side sections.

, Twist the remaining two loose sections around each other, wrapping them securely enough so that they feel tight, but keeping them loose enough to prevent them from starting to coil into a spring.


After you let go of a finished twist, it will likely spring back a little and feel somewhat loose. This should not be a problem, though. The twist is still thick enough to stay in place., Use scissors or a razor blade to shave off any hair that extends past your desired length. Seal the end by dipping it into boiling water.


When cutting off the excess hair, use the sharp side of the blade and carefully pass it over the ends at a vertical angle. This creates a more natural looking end. Do not cut the hair straight across as though you were cutting into a piece of paper.
Boil the water in a saucepan on the stove. After it reaches a boil, remove it from the heat and dip your hair into it then. Do not dip the ends of your hair into the boiling water while it is still over an active heating element on your stove.
Dry the ends with a towel when done.

, Use the same procedure outlined above with the remaining sections of your hair. Continue twisting in Marley extensions until your entire hair has been styled.


Only leave the hair in the boiling water for a few seconds. Dry them off with a towel when done.
For added flair, you can also curl the untwisted ends of each section with perm rods or a curling iron, but doing so is only optional.

, You can maintain your usual hair washing routine as far as frequency is concerned, but to maintain the integrity of your twists, you should spray your scalp with diluted shampoo from a spray bottle. Rinse using a spray bottle of water.


Fill one-eighth of the spray bottle with shampoo and the rest with water. Shake well to combine before use.
Your main attention should be on the scalp rather than on the hair itself.
It is far better to clean your hair using spray bottles than to rinse the Marley twists under running water. Once soaked, the twists are very heavy. They can also take about two days to dry from a soaked state.Try to wash your scalp in this manner once a week. If you normally need to wash your hair more frequently than this, try using diluted shampoo once a week and dry shampoo for the in-between washings.

, At night, spray the scalp with water and follow by rubbing in a little oil, such as olive oil or coconut oil. Taking these steps can prevent both your scalp and hair from drying out too severely.


If your scalp is especially dry, you may need to do this every night. If your hair and scalp are fairly normal, though, two to three times each week will usually be enough.
Aside from olive oil and coconut oil, peppermint oil and Jamaican Black Castor Oil (JBCO) are also good options.

, If your hair is especially frizzy, you can carefully apply a little mousse or stay-in conditioner over edges. Only do this on an “as needed” basis, though.


Avoid using creamy conditioners since these can leave unsightly and inconvenient build-up in your twists. Liquid leave-in conditioners are your best bet if you opt for a conditioner.

, To keep your hairstyle safe even at night, pull the twists back into a loose ponytail or bun and cover them with a silk or satin scarf.


You can provide your twists with additional protection by placing a satin cap over them or by sleeping on a satin pillow.
On average, Marley twists that are well cared for can last for two to four weeks. At that point, the twists will begin to look too frizzy, uneven, or otherwise messy to continue on. You can redo the twists at this point, and many report that redoing twists takes less time than making twists for the first time. Otherwise, you can take the twists down and the extensions out, and move on to the next hairstyle.

They indicate the amount of relaxer left in your hair.)








, After rinsing your hair, pat dry the excess water from the hair. Apply deep conditioner to all parts of the hair. Comb it through and let it sit for three to five minutes. Hot oil treatments work wonders, too.

Add fragrance.",How to Do Gothic Lolita Hair and Makeup," Before you do your hair and makeup, remember that the essential look of Gothic Lolita is that of a porcelain doll, with flawless skin and perfect hair. These are surprisingly easy to come by. One day of the week (weekends are recommended since you can run around with goop on your head and not get funny looks every thirteen seconds) set up a 'spa' day.;
,,, Rinse, and rub on an exfoliating scrub.

,, Stay like that for about 10 minutes, five if you have sensitive skin. (Do not remain so long that the steam hurts you.) Lift up the towel to let air in until the steam thins a little. If you have blackheads, take a tissue and gently rub them after you are done.

, Two good homemade kinds are 2 egg yolks with one tablespoon of olive oil (for dry skin) and one egg white whipped fluffy with one tablespoon of lemon juice (for acne prone skin). Let these sit for twenty minutes, then rinse with cool water. Follow the directions on the bottle if it is store bought.

, Let dry, then splash your face with water, and massage your face with the facial lotion of your choice. Let it sit for 5 minutes, then press tissues to your face to remove the excess. On a daily basis, wash your face twice daily using a clean washcloth (hang it up to dry after you use it, and replace it every two days).

,, Split ends do not belong on a porcelain doll. The most popular style is long hair, with soft layers and fringe bangs. You could also leave out the layers, especially if you have straight hair. Wear your hair in a classic way that complements your face shape. Ask the person who cuts your hair if you have absolutely no idea about that.

, It's easier to apply makeup with your hair completely back and out of your face, which means a ponytail and headband. After you wash your face, rub facial lotion into your wet skin, and let dry. After five minutes, blot off the excess with tissues.

, You want a very natural look. You can forgo the wet-face-lotion bit, and add some foundation into your lotion. One tip that is really good if you don't need foundation is to take a powder based foundation in one shade lighter than your skin tone (anything else will look chalky) and apply it to your nose and the immediate area around it, forehead, and chin. Blend it outward with very clean fingers.

, After the foundation (or lotion), powder your skin with loose powder.

, You're looking to get doll eyes, so precision counts big time. Take an angled brush, and dip it into black eyeshadow, or brown if you prefer. You could really do this with any color, but darker colors are best.

, Put it just behind your upper lashes, getting wider towards the outside corner, and thinner to the inside.

, Re-dip, and extend the corner of the eyeshadow a few millimeters past the corner of your eye, no more than 5 if you want a natural look.

, Don't bother stretching out your lid when doing this, because not stretching will produce little lines that mimic eyelashes. Next, curl your eyelashes with an eyelash curler. If you're of Asian ethnicity, try a heated curler, since you tend to have very straight lashes.

, A tip for blondes - very dark brown or charcoal will make your eyes stand out more, not black. For everyone else, black will make your eyes stand out more.

, If you want a little color, go for a matte baby pink or rose if you have warm skin, or lilac or blue if you have cool skin. To tell which you have, hold something gold and something silver next to your skin. If gold looks better, you have warm skin. If it's silver, you have cool. Just apply a thin layer before you apply eyeliner, in about the same areas, but past it a little on your lower lids, and further up everywhere.

, Blend.

, Apply either no blush, or a pink that looks good next to your skin. If you aren't sure, go to a beauty shop.

, You're trying for a childish effect.

, Get a soft pink that looks good on your skin, and a lip liner that matches it. Brace your arm, and follow the line of your lips.

, Matte lipstick is recommended, and no gloss because the focus of your face should be your beautiful eyes. If you want a pouty look, take a light shade of shimmery eyeshadow that was recommended for your skin tone, and apply just a tiny bit to the middle of your lower lip. Voila!

, There are many different styles that you can have your hair for Lolita, the most popular being:


Ringlet curls. A great option if you have hair that is long, or at least shoulder length. Easily created using a curling rod, you can have small, tight curls (best for shoulder length) or larger, looser curls (best for hair longer than shoulder length). This style looks brilliant with any type of headpiece as well.
Straight hair. This should only be done if you have the right cut. Healthy hair, with a fringe that comes above the eyes (your eyes should not be hidden whatsoever. You spent all that time making them big and doll-like, why would you hide them?) and chin length-or longer. If your hair is not naturally straight, use flat irons.
Plaits. A simple, yet adorable style which is great if you are really going for a childlike effect. Can be done as either one plait (pulled back, so it falls down your back), or two plaits (one at either side). Looks great on all hair lengths.
Pigtails. Appropriate for short hair to shoulder-length hair, as it looks cutest this way. This hairstyle looks great with hair-accessories rather than headpieces, such as bows and cute girly clips (but keep it to a minimum. This is Lolita, not Decora!)

,, Get a spritz bottle full of water, and evenly mist your hair. Comb it through, and add either a little bit of mousse or leave-in conditioner, mousse if you want volume, conditioner if you want sleekness. If you have curls, use a diffuser at this stage. A diffuser is a hair dryer attachment that flares at the outside edge, and has a little flat place inside. Again, ask a beauty store if you aren't sure.

, Every ten seconds or so, scrunch your hair in your hands. Dry the rest of your hair like this.

, For straight hair, either just brush when dry, or straighten with velvet covered plates. When you use rubber bands, get the fabric coated kind with no metal connection parts.

, Choose a perfume that is flowery, playful and light. Heavier scents are better suited to Aristocratic types.

Brush out your hair.,
Decide where you want your bump to be.,
Separate your bump hair section.,
Create a bump without teasing.",How to Do Hair Styles With a Bump1," Brush your hair with a brush or comb to remove any knots and tangles from your hair. You want your hair to be as manageable as possible when creating a new hairstyle., There are many ways to wear a bump in your hair. Some like the bump high, toward the front of their head, while others prefer the bump toward the crown of their head. It’s all a matter personal preference.


Creating a bump toward the front of your head requires less hair, while creating a bump toward the crown of your head requires a bit more hair.
Bumps that are toward the front of the head work well for getting bangs and fringe out of your face.
Bumps made toward the crown of the head, work well for certain up-dos and creating retro-inspired hairstyles.

, Use your fingers or the tip of your comb to gather the section of hair you wish to use to make your bump. Be sure that the section of hair that you separate for your bump is centered on your head.If you’re making your bump toward the crown of your head, gather your hair starting from the front sides of your head, and stop gathering toward the top of the crown of your head. This section of hair shouldn’t include hair lower than the bottom of the crown of your head.
If you’re making your bump toward the front of your head, gather your hair spanning from around your two temples on the sides of your head, and stop gathering your hair section just before the crown of your head.

, While many people find that their bumps remain fuller and more secure when their hair is teased, it is not mandatory. If you don't want to tease, simply gather the bump section of hair, pinch the hair where you want the back end of the bump to be, push it forward a bit to create a bump, and secure down the base of the bump with bobby pins.You will need at least one bobby pin on each side of the bump, but two on each side will give you better hold. Cross the bobby pins on top of each other for the best results.
If you have afro-textured hair, you can easily create a bump without teasing. Simply blow dry your hair out and pull the bump section back. Then pinch the base of your bump and push it forward, securing it with bobby pins. If your hair is short enough, you can fold the ends of your hair under the bump before securing it with bobby pins.You can use some hairspray to keep your bump in place and tame flyaways.

Brush out any tangles.,
Gather the hair into a low ponytail.,
Push the band down.,
Create a gap.,
Flip the ponytail through the gap.,
Brush the ends.",How to Do Kids' Hair1," Start with clean, dry hair. Use a comb or paddle brush to gently brush out any tangles or knots.


This is a versatile style that works with straight, wavy, and curly hair. Additionally, the length of the hair can be medium or long—as long as there's enough to put into a standard ponytail, you should be able to complete this look.;
, Gather all of the hair at the back of the head, bringing it together at a point near the nape of the neck.


Keep the sides and tail as smooth as possible. If necessary, gather the hair with one hand while continuing to brush it using your other hand.
Secure the hair with a ponytail holder.

, Carefully push the ponytail holder down by 2 to 3 inches (5 to 7.6 cm).


The exact distance will vary depending on the length of the hair. Make sure that the hair beneath the ponytail is at least as long as the hair in between the ponytail and the head, if not longer.

, Use your pointer and middle fingers to carefully separate the hair just above the ponytail holder.


Try to keep this gap centered above the ponytail holder. It may not stay automatically at this point, so prepare to hold it in place with your fingers until you complete the next step.

, Using your other hand, flip the end of the ponytail up and through the gap you just created.


Pull the end of the ponytail all the way through the gap until it hangs straight down again. As you do this, the gap should remain fixed in place and the hair above the ponytail holder should twist.
If the ponytail sticks out too much instead of hanging down straight, carefully pull the elastic band down a little further to relax the style more.

, Carefully brush the hanging end of the flip tail with a paddle brush, smoothing out any tangles that may have developed as you worked.


This step completes the style.

Select a hairstyle that minimizes your hair volume.,
Add long layers.,
Thin your hair.,
Trim your hair regularly.",How to Reduce Hair Volume1," Maintain your hair at a volume-friendly length. A blunt short to medium haircut will make your hair seem more poofy. Opt instead for a super short hairstyle, like a pixie cut, or a longer hairstyle that sits below your shoulders.A long bob is an ideal hairstyle for your thick, voluminous hair!;
, Adding long layers to your thick, unruly, or wavy hair will reduce the appearance of volume. Longer layers are always recommended over shorter layers--the shorter the layer, the more volume it will create! In addition to reducing the volume of your hair, long layers also create movement in your thick tresses., Have your stylist use thinning shears to reduce the volume of your unruly hair or do it yourself at home. Before you start the process, make sure your hair is dry. Divide your hair into fistful sized sections. Grab one section of hair and close the thinning shears halfway down the length of your hair shaft Open the shears slightly and move them down the length of your hair. Stop half an inch above the ends of your hair. Once you have thinned a section, comb through your hair a few times to determine if you have achieved your ideal thickness. Repeat as needed before moving on to the next section.

Do not start the thinning process too close to your roots! You may over thin your hair. Instead, begin lower on the shaft and work up towards the roots if needed.
Try to thin all of the sections evenly. Comb through the sections to assess your progress. Even out any sections that are too thick., Hair that is left untrimmed will eventually get split or damaged ends. This leaves you with a mass of volume at the ends of the hair shafts. Clean up the ends of your hair with regular trims--see your stylist every 2 to 4 months."

Section out your hair for teasing.,
Start teasing the first section.,
Continue teasing your hair section by section.,
Consider adding in a bump tool.,
Cover the teased hair with smooth hair.,
Secure your bump.",How to Do Hair Styles With a Bump2," If you do plan to tease your hair, you should do so in small sections to create the most volume. Depending on the amount of hair you have, you should plan on dividing the bump section into three or four layers. You will tease the two to three bottom layers of this hair, but leave the section closest to your face un-teased.You may want to separate the front section of your bump (the part that won't be teased) now in order to avoid accidentally pulling it into one of the other sections. You can twist it off to the side and secure it with a bobby pin to keep to separated.

, Hold the bump section of your hair straight up and separate the bottom layer of hair for teasing. You can let the other layers of the bump fall forward or to the side, but keep holding the layer you are working with straight up. To tease, use your other hand to comb your hair backwards from the ends to the roots with a fine-toothed comb. Before letting go of your hair, spray underneath this layer with some hairspray.It's best to allow your hairspray to set for approximately five to 10 seconds before you release your hair. Then you can gently flip the portion of hair back toward the back of your head.
Once you're done teasing, your hair should have quite a bit of volume to it. If you want it to stand up even higher, tease it some more. Don't worry if it looks messy, as you will be combing un-teased hair on top of it.
You shouldn't need to use very much hairspray. A quick spray should be fine.

, Once the first layer of your bump has been teased, continue using the same method to tease the remaining layers. (You will have one or two more layers, depending on the thickness of your hair.) Remember to keep the front section of your bump separated and un-teased.Keep in mind that the more you tease your hair, the sturdier your bump will be, but your hair will also be knottier.

, This step is optional, but some people like to create their hair bump with the help of a bump tool. Bump tools are small pieces of plastic that you can place between the teased layers of your hair to add more volume to your bump hairstyle. They are available online and at many retail stores. They come in different sizes to create large and small bumps. To insert the bump tool, simply separate the teased section of your hair into two halves and place the bump tool on your scalp between the two layers, right near the roots of your hair. You may have to wiggle the bump tool a little to help the plastic teeth stick to your hair.
Use your fingers to spread out the top section of your teased hair so that it completely covers the bump tool. The bump tool should be hidden by your hair.
You can use a comb to lightly comb your hair over the bump tool, and spray a little bit of hairspray to keep everything in place. Your teased hair covering the bump tool doesn’t need to look perfect because you are going to cover it with your un-teased portion of hair.

, Whether you use a bump tool or not, when all of your teased portions of hair are flipped back, flip the smooth, un-teased section of hair over the teased portions. The teased portions of your hair will be poofed up and high. (That is where the bump look comes from.) Use your fingers to evenly spread your hair out, and lightly comb over your hair to smooth everything over.Don’t comb over your smooth portion of hair using a lot of pressure, or you may flatten out your voluminous bump.

, When you are satisfied with your bump, insert bobby pins at the base of the bump from both the right and left sides to secure it in place. You may want to use two or more bobby pins on each side to make sure your bump doesn’t move around.You can use an elastic hair tie to secure the bump, but bobby pins allow your hair to naturally fall down the back of your head, whereas a hair tie will put your hair in a small ponytail.
To get more height in your bump, consider pinching the base of the bump, and pushing the bump forward slightly, to give it more height.
Your hairstyle can be complete with a bump as is, or you can curl the ends of your hair to give your style a softer look.

When you section your hair to make your bump, separate your hair into two parts: the part of your hair that you’re going to tease (to make the bump), and the part of your hair that is going to serve as your ponytail base.Tie the bottom section of your hair, your ponytail base, with a loose ponytail holder.
Tease the top section of your hair in small sections from back to front to create your bump, making sure to set each section with hairspray.
Gently smooth the bump over, and remove the ponytail holder tying back your bottom section of hair. Hold your ponytail in one hand and add the hair from your bump with your other hand.Use your brush to gently work the bump hair into the ponytail and even everything out.
Draw out one piece of hair about ½ an inch thick from the bottom of the gathered hair, and leave it out of the ponytail as you retie your ponytail with the bump hair incorporated.
Once your ponytail is secure, wrap the loose piece of hair around the hair tie and secure it in place by tucking it into the hair tie. Use hairspray to gently set your style., This hairstyle puts a unique twist on a regular ponytail, and adds a bit more of an exaggerated bump to your look. First begin by sectioning off the front portion of your hair that will create your front bump. Pin or clip this section of hair out of the way, and pull the rest of your hair into a high ponytail. You can use some gel, shine serum, or hairspray to make sure your ponytail is pulled back sleek and smooth.
Use a small section of hair from your ponytail, and wrap it around your hair tie to hide the elastic.
Release your front section of hair and hold it up as you tease it. Pinch this section of hair around your crown area, approximately 3 to 5 inches (about 7 to 12 centimeters) back from your hairline. Twist your hair once, and then push it towards the front of your crown. Secure your bump with two crisscrossing bobby pins. Wrap the rest of the bump hair that is hanging out over your ponytail around the elastic hair tie, using a bobby pin to secure it.Brush out your ponytail, and loosely braid your ponytail in a three strand braid. A loose braid will make your ponytail look fuller. Secure the end of the braid with a small, clear elastic, or with one that matches your hair color. Gently pull out your braid strands to make your braid appear even fuller.
Finish your look by lightly misting your hair with some hairspray., This hairstyle is great for channeling vintage movie stars from the 60s. A bouffant creates the look of an exaggerated bump with lots of volume, especially for those with long hair. Create two sections of hair: one from the middle-top of your head to your hairline, and one section behind that, from the middle-top of your head, to the bottom of your crown.Take the bottom section of hair and twist it around itself until you make a twisted bun with that section. Secure the twisted bun with bobby pins or a thin, elastic hair tie. This will act as the base of the bouffant.Separate the front section of hair into smaller portions, and tease each layer (moving from back to front) to create a lot of volume for the bouffant bump. Leave the very last, front portion of hair alone and un-teased, so it can be smoothed over all the teased hair.
Flip the teased hair back, over the twisted bun, and use a comb to lightly brush back any flyaway hairs. Flip the un-teased portion of hair over the teased hair, and softly smooth your hair out with a brush.
Use your fingernails to gather hair along the sides of your head, and hold the gathered hair in place underneath the twisted bun. Push your hair forward and upward to create a big bouffant.Pinch the hair underneath the bun and use about four to six bobby pins to hold this big bouffant in place. Once in place, gently spray with a little bit of hairspray. "

Brush out any tangles.,
Apply hair gel.,
Gather the hair into a high ponytail.,
Partially pull the ponytail through the band.,
Divide the bun in half.,
Cross the center with the excess hair.,
Secure the sides with additional pins.,
Apply a light coat of hairspray.",How to Do Kids' Hair2," Start with clean, dry hair. Use a flat brush or comb to remove any knots and tangles.


This hair style works best with long hair. It's also easiest to create on straight and wavy hair, but might be a bit more difficult to duplicate on curly hair.

, Work a small amount of hair gel through the hair. Only use enough to lightly coat the hair without weighing it down.


The hair gel isn't strictly necessary, but it'll make the bow cleaner and may help hold the style in place. Baby detangler can be used instead of gel if you'd prefer a less sticky option.
Use your fingers or a comb the run the gel all the way through the hair. It should coat the hair from root to tip.

, Gather all of the hair into a high ponytail at the top of the head. Carefully shift the ponytail so that it leans to one side of the head.


The ponytail must be very tight. Use your hands or a comb to smooth down any hair sticking up around the head.
Secure the ponytail with a ponytail holder. Wrap the band around the ponytail as many times as needed to hold it in place. Pause before the final wrap but continue to hold both the ponytail and the ponytail holder.

, Instead of completely pulling the ponytail through the band during the last wrap-around, only pull a portion of it through. This should create a tight bun at the top of the head.


Position the tail toward the front of the face.
Pull the tail through the hair tie for another wrap-around. Instead of pulling it completely through, only pull one-third to one-half of it through.
Adjust the bun at the top of the head as needed to hold it in place. Note that the extra hair should stick out toward the face.

, Use your fingers to carefully separate the bun down the center. Keep both halves as even as possible.


Smooth everything out using your hands to make it look as neat as possible. Work carefully to avoid pulling any additional hair through the ponytail holder.

, Take the excess hair hanging in front of the face and draw it over the split center of the bun. Secure the hair with a bobby pin.


Pull the excess hair tightly over the center of the bun. It should be able to hold the split. Furthermore, as you cross the center, you should also notice the bun shape taking form.
Insert a bobby pin directly over the excess tail at the base of the bun and the back of the head. Keep the pin as close to the bun as possible.

, Carefully pull down on one side of the bun, fanning out the bow in the process. Use a bobby pin to hold the hair in place.


Repeat the same procedure on the other side of the bow.

, Use your fingers to smooth down any flyaway strands of hair, then gently mist the entire thing with hairspray to hold everything in place.


The style is complete once you finish this step.

Towel dry wet hair.,
Apply sculpting paste.,
Use a diffuser.,
Adjust the spikes.,
Let it dry naturally.",How to Do Kids' Hair3," Start with clean, damp hair. Use a towel to dry away any excess moisture, but do not wait for the hair to dry completely.


The hair will be easier to shape when damp, but too much moisture can make it too heavy. Towel dry it until it is no longer dripping wet, but still visibly moist.
This style is easiest to create on fairly short hair of nearly any thickness. Ideally, the nape and sides should be very short, but the top section and crown should be between 2 and 3 inches (5 and 7.6 cm) long. Note that the hair should also be fairly straight, but the style can be done on wavy hair, as well.

, Squeeze a nickel-sized dab of sculpting paste or pomade into your palm, then spread it across both hands. Massage the paste throughout the entire head of hair.


Use your fingers to evenly comb the paste through the hair. Try to cover the hair from root to tip all the way around the head.
The best product to use will depend upon the coarseness of the hair. Determine whether the boy has thick or fine hair, and choose a product formulated for use with that type of coarseness. Light pomades tend to work best for thick hair, but heavy waxes might be necessary for fine hair.

, Attach a diffuser to a standard hair dryer and dry the hair, brushing it upward as you work. Continue until the hair is mostly dry.


To help create the spikes, grab the hair at its root in small sections and pull straight up. Focus the hair dryer on this section of hair as you manipulate it.
Continue until the hair is still slightly moist to the touch, but no longer visibly damp.

, Once the hair is mostly dry, turn off the hair dryer and use your fingers to tweak the spikes as desired.


The simplest option is to quickly run your fingers through the hair, pushing it upward and in a single direction.
Alternatively, you can create a messier look by pulling the hair upward and in different directions over the top of the head.

, Allow the hair to finish drying by air. If necessary, you can hold the spikes in place with a light mist of hairspray.


This step completes the process.

Towel dry the hair.,
Apply hair gel.,
Comb the hair forward.,
Scrunch the hair.,
Allow the hair to air dry.",How to Do Kids' Hair4," Start with freshly washed, damp hair. Use a towel to blot away excess moisture.


The hair will be easier to manipulate when it's a little damp, but too much water can weigh the hair down and prevent the style from setting properly. Dry the hair enough to remove dripping water but leave it visibly damp.
Note that this style works best on boys with medium to thick curly hair. You may also be able to duplicate it on wavy hair, but it won't hold well on fine or straight hair.
Additionally, it'll be easiest to create the look when hair is kept a little long.

, Comb a soft hold hair gel throughout the entire hair, spreading it evenly from root to tip.


Squeeze a nickel-size to quarter-size dab of hair gel into the center of your palm. Rub your hands together to spread it evenly across both hands, then run your fingers through the hair to transfer it.

, Use your fingers or a wide-tooth comb to brush the hair in a forward direction, drawing it completely toward the face.


Work around the entire head of hair. All of the hair, including that at the top, sides, and back, should be redirected forward toward the face.
Combing the hair during this step also helps to further spread the gel throughout the locks.

, Grab the hair with your fingers and scrunch it toward the scalp. Work in small sections, and move around the entire head in this manner.


Start at the tips of the hair and push each section toward the scalp. Hold for 5 to 10 seconds before releasing.
As you work, make sure that the hair remains angled toward the face and away from the back of the head.
Make sure that all of the hair gets scrunched in this manner. Don't be afraid to overlap sections, as well.

, Let the hair finish drying naturally instead of using a hair dryer. When finished, the face should be framed by light, messy curls.


The style is complete once the hair is finished drying.

Select the right products.,
Shampoo your hair every 2 to 4 days.,
Condition your hair thoroughly.",How to Reduce Hair Volume2," Select a shampoo that reduces your hair’s natural volume. Choose a dense, moisturizing conditioner that will weigh the hair down, creating a more sleek appearance. Look for products with natural moisturizers, like avocado or almond oil. These products will hydrate your hair, weigh it down, and produce a sleeker look., Shampooing strips your hair of the natural oils that form on your scalp. Since it takes longer for these oils to spread through and down the shafts of your thick head of hair, you should not shampoo your hair every day. Wait 2 to 4 days between shampoos to reduce frizz and poof. Apply the product directly to the scalp, avoiding the ends of your hair.

, After shampooing your hair, always apply conditioner. Run the product through the shafts of your hair, avoiding the scalp. In addition to using a rinse-out-conditioner, apply a leave-in-conditioner too!"

Squeeze excess water from your wet hair.,
Allow your hair to air-dry.,
Protect your hair.,
Divide your hair into 5 sections.,
Blow-dry your hair.",How to Reduce Hair Volume3," Use a towel to draw out excess water from your hair. Always refrain from rubbing your hair in the towel to get rid of the water--this causes frizz!Instead of wrapping your hair with a bath towel, opt for a soft cotton t-shirt, a cotton pillowcase, or a microfiber towel. Since these items all have finer fibers than a bath towel, they cause less damage to wet, frizz prone hair.







, To reduce the amount of time you spend blow-drying your hair, let your hair air-dry. Wait until your hair is at least 50 percent of the way dry. This will also decrease your hair’s exposure to heat, which can dry out your frizz-prone locks and increase the volume of your hair., While your hair is still damp, apply an anti-frizz cream. Before blow-drying, apply a heat protectant spray. This will help prevent your hair from drying out.








, Using a comb, divide your hair into 5 sections. You will have two sections in the back, one on each side, and one on the top of your head. Clip the sections in place.








, Start with the section on the top of your head. Pull the hair taut against your forehead. Place a round brush at the roots and slowly move it down the length of your hair. Follow the brush with the barrel of your blow-dryer down the entire length of your hair. Repeat as needed. Repeat this process on the side sections and then the back sections. Apply a smoothing serum or anti-frizz cream to your hair for a sleek finish.








Experiment with hair styling products. Waxes, pomades and even anti-frizz serums smooth out frizzy hair and add weight to the hair shafts which decrease hair volume. Friction caused by hair movement causes the hair strands to separate and poof out. An appropriate styling aid will help keep hair sections together and control individual hair strands.

Heat your flat iron.,
Protect your hair.,
Straighten your hair.",How to Reduce Hair Volume4," Set your flat iron to a temperature between 350°F and 400°F and allow it to heat-up., Apply a heat protectant spray to your locks while your flat iron heats up. This product will help prevent damage caused by heat.








, Finish your reduced-volume look by straightening your hair. Always make sure your hair is completely dry before straightening it. Use your flat iron to achieve pin-straight hair or sleek hair:









If you want pin-straight hair, divide your tresses into small sections. Begin with the bottom layers and glide the flat iron over each small section a few times before moving onto the next section.
If you desire sleek hair, divide your locks into large sections. Move the tightly clamped flat iron slowly down the length of your hair. This allows the heat to penetrate your hair while minimizing your locks’ contact with direct heat. Repeat on each section of hair.

Massage your scalp daily.,
Try an oil massage.,
Use therapeutic hair masks.,
Use essential oils in combination with other hair products.,
Avoid using shampoo that contains sulfates and harsh ingredients.,
Get treated for underlying medical problems.",How to Regrow Hair Naturally1," Scalp massage promotes good circulation around your hair follicles, creating the right environment for hair growth. Use the tips of your fingers to gently massage your scalp in a circular motion. Take your time and massage every part of your scalp so that you stimulate blood flow to all the areas where you want to new hair to grow in.


Make massage a habit by doing it every time you wash your hair in the shower.
Brush your hair daily with a soft or looped-bristle brush for a gentle scalp massage. This is especially effective if you have long hair.
Getting a professional head massage could be educational, since you’ll learn the best way to massage your scalp.;
, Adding oil to the equation aids circulation even more than a standard head massage. The oil helps to unclog hair follicles and allow new growth to come in. Once or twice a week, plan to use oil to massage your head. It’s easiest to do it in the shower, then rinse away the oil when you’re finished. Here are a few popular oils you can try:


Coconut oil. This rich, emollient oil is great for your body in so many ways, and some say it helps hair regrowth. Pre-heat a tablespoon of coconut oil using a microwave (15 seconds should be enough to melt the oil) rub it between your palms, then use your fingers to massage your scalp
Jojoba oil. It’s very similar in texture to sebum, the natural oil produced by your scalp that lubricates your hair and keeps it healthy.
Almond oil. This is traditionally used in India to foster healthy hair growth.

, A good hair mask performs the dual duty of keeping your hair moisturized and healthy while also stimulating growth. Household goods like honey, egg whites, avocados, aloe and apple cider vinegar are all quite beneficial to hair. Apply a mask for 15 minutes, making sure to cover your scalp as well, then shampoo your hair as normal. Make sure you do not use a shampoo with added sulfate. Try the following masks:


For extra dry hair, combine equal parts honey, egg white, and argan oil.
For normal hair, combine equal parts honey, aloe, and olive oil.
For oily hair, combine equal parts honey, apple cider vinegar, and castor oil.

, Certain essential oils have been said to promote healthy circulation and stimulate hair growth. Adding a few drops of these oils to your oil treatments, masks, and shampoo is a good way to give your scalp an extra boost. Try adding five drops of one of these beneficial oils:


Lavender
Tea tree oil
Cedar wood
Rosemary oil
Argan oil
Coconut oil

, Many commercially-produced shampoos use sulfates as the primary cleanser. Sulfates strip the hair of its natural oils, causing it to become dry and brittle. This can lead to hair breakage and eventually hair loss. When you use a gentler, all-natural shampoo your hair has the chance to grow healthy and strong. Ditch the sulfates for a very gentle shampoo, and you should see results with a few months.

, Sometimes hair loss results from an underlying problem that you might not even be aware of. If this is the case, regrowth won’t happen until you get the proper treatment. If you’re not sure why you’re experiencing hair loss, see a doctor to find out what’s going on. The following conditions commonly cause hair loss:


Thyroid problems
Hormonal imbalances
Alopecia

Long hair and straight cuts add the weight needed to pull down hair that would otherwise puff out. An angled or slightly layered cut will remove some of the bulk. A layered cut will emphasize curls, but could result in puffier hair.






;
, Shampoo is great for cleaning dirt and grime away from hair, but it's not so great at taming puffy hair. That's because shampoo strips your hair of its natural oils, which make your hair silken and combat frizz.


Some people go for as long as a week in between shampooing.The exact amount of time is up to you, but the consensus is that waiting a couple days between washes produces healthier, less puffy hair.

, There's some debate about how effective this is, but the idea is pretty simple: cold water causes the cuticles of the hair to contract, simultaneously adding shine and taming frizz.Some scientists, however, doubt the effectiveness of cold water on the scalp, saying that since hair cuticles aren't living cells, they shouldn't contract.The debate aside, this advice shouldn't cause puffy hair, so try it out and see if it works.


As discussed below, certain specially-designed leave-in conditioners can help fight puffy hair.

, If your hair is prone to fly-aways and frizzes, carefully blot your hair dry with the towel instead of rubbing. Allow hair to air-dry as much as possible to reduce the amount of puffiness in your hair.









If you blow your hair dry, avoid a lot of movement with the blow dryer. Blow your hair dry slowly and in small sections on the lowest heat setting.
Remember to blow down the shaft of hair instead of across it, which separates hair sections, or upward, which provides volume and lift but also adds puffiness to frizzy hair.
Keep in mind that blow drying removes moisture from the hair strands, which increases frizz.

, It can be tempting to smooth out your hair with plenty of brushstrokes after stepping out of the shower. But brushing or combing your hair causes friction, which causes heat and breakage to the hair cuticle.This leads to puffy or frizzy hair. Instead of combing your hair like you've entered a contest, use a wide-toothed comb or a paddle brush with ball-tipped ends. Finish off with a light pass using your fingers as a comb.








, In humid weather, you hair will tend to do what it naturally wants to do. Fighting your hair type will probably cause you a lot of frustration; chances are you'll end up losing every time. If your hair is straight, avoid the urge to put it in curlers on humid days. If your hair is naturally curly or wavy, work with the waves instead of opting for a straight style.









Try tying your hair up in a bun or ponytail and finish off by applying some anti-frizz gel.
If you're having a truly tremendous hair day, never underestimate the help a hat or well-tied scarf can do for your hair.

, Shampoos are made to cater to hair types. You may come across some brands on the shelf that declare right on the face of the bottle that the product will reduce frizzy hair. Otherwise, look for the words ""moisturizing,"" ""smoothing"" or ""hydrating"" on the bottle of your favorite brand.

, Normal or leave-in — it all depends on what's in the conditioner. When searching for a conditioner, look for conditioners that have one or both of the following ingredients: amino silicones and cationic surfactants. These two ingredients help fight the two main causes of puffiness: damage in the hair shaft and static electricity.


Amino silicones help the silicones in conditioner to grab onto damaged hair shafts, providing more lasting conditioning.
Cationic surfactants help cut down on puffiness causes by static electricity by carrying a positive charge., Smoothing serums coat the hair shaft, helping to reduce frizz much like conditioners will. Some of these products, however, are heavy and can weigh your hair down too much. Use sparingly until you discover the right amount of the product to use for your hair.

, While serums are great for smoothing the hair sections, they do not offer a holding agent to prevent the sections from separating. Use a smoothing gel or a lightweight gel to hold the hair in place.








, Occasional deep treatments help keep frizz and puffiness under control by maintaining healthy hair. Apply a healthy spoonful or two of warm olive or coconut oil to your ends. Wrap the hair up in plastic or a shower cap and wait anywhere from 30 minutes to several hours. Shampoo and condition as normal to remove any excess oil.









Be careful about where you apply the oil. Shoot for the ends of your hair, or mid-shaft. Applying oil to the roots can clog pores and result in breakouts on your scalp.

, Leave-in oil treatments such as Argan oil (also known as Moroccan oil) and baby oil might be able to help tame your mane. Put less than you think you'll need into the palm of your hand, cover gently, and apply to your hair.








, Oil-rich foods like mayonnaise or crushed avocado may be another way to strengthen your hair and prevent puffy hair, although they are both messy to apply. Mix a tablespoon of mayo into your conditioner if you want to give it a try; or crush up avocado like you're making guacamole, apply to hair and cover for 10 minutes, then wash out under warm water until your hair feels smooth.

Eat plenty of protein.,
Add more omega 3 fatty acids to your diet.,
Take biotin supplements.,
Eat food rich in iron.,
Stay well hydrated.",How to Regrow Hair Naturally2," Protein is the building block for healthy hair. Having a diet that’s very rich in protein will help your hair grow faster. Make sure you’re getting the daily recommended amount of protein each and every day.


Protein-rich foods include eggs, meat, nuts, legumes, and leafy greens.
Vegans and vegetarians commonly eat less protein than meat eaters, since there are fewer protein-heavy options. If you’re vegan or vegetarian, pay close attention to your protein intake to make sure you’re getting as much as you need.
Proteins will help your hair the most if you eat them in combination with complex carbs. Legumes (like beans, peas, and lentils), whole grain rice and other whole grain foods, and starchy vegetables like corn and potatoes are all excellent sources of complex carbs., This healthy fat is integral to healthy hair growth, and without enough of it in your diet your hair can appear brittle and dull. Incorporate more omega 3 fatty acids into your diet on a daily basis. Your skin will also benefit from a diet rich in omega 3 fatty acids.


Avocados, nuts, eggs and fatty fish like salmon are the best sources of omega 3s.
Consider taking fish oil or flaxseed oil supplements to up your daily dose.
Almond, carrots, yeast, walnuts and fish are among the food that contain the most biotin. Consider supplements if you're not eating any of these foods daily.

, Biotin supplements are composed of B vitamins that contribute to hair health. Vitamin B12 is especially important when it comes to regrowing hair. Consider taking biotin supplements so you know you’re getting enough B vitamins every day. B vitamins are also commonly found in prenatal supplements.


You can also get your daily vitamin B12 from eating organ meats, fatty fish and other animal products.
Vegans and vegetarians have a harder time getting enough B12. Consider taking supplements if you’re a vegan or vegetarian.

, When you aren’t getting enough iron, your body produces fewer red blood cells, leading to a condition known as anemia. This can cause hair loss among many other symptoms. Add more iron to your diet by eating leafy greens, red meat and other iron-rich foods. Alternatively, consider taking iron supplements to meet your daily needs.


If you’re concerned you may be anemic, it’s important to see a doctor. In many cases the recommended treatment will be taking iron supplements, but sometimes further treatment is needed.

, Drinking water can help your hair grow more vibrant and healthy. Just like other parts of your body, your hair is greatly affected by dehydration. Make sure you’re drinking enough water every single day. Drink when you’re thirsty, and switch out coffee, soda and alcohol for water as often as possible. Recommended intake of water is 2L per day minimum.

Avoid hair extensions and other damaging styles.,
Use caution when wearing wigs and hairpieces.,
Use a silk pillowcase.",How to Regrow Hair Naturally3," When you wash every day, you put unnecessary strain on your hair follicles. The nourishing oil your scalp naturally produces gets washed away, plus you pull and tug on your hair in the process of washing it, drying it and combing it out. When regrowth is your goal, you want to treat your hair and scalp as gently as you can and leave it alone as much as possible.


Washing every three days or so, or going even longer without washing, is recommended by beauty experts as the best course of action.
In between washing days, try using dry shampoo. It’s a powder you sprinkle on your hair and then comb through. Your hair will look clean and smell fresh for the day.

, When you step out of the shower, use a wide-toothed comb to gently comb out the tangles, starting at the tips and moving up toward the roots. When you yank a brush through your hair, you damage your hair from the roots down the shaft and all the way to the tips, causing hair loss, breakage and split ends.


Be especially careful when your hair is wet, since it’s most easily damaged when it’s moist and stretchy.
The thicker and curlier your hair is, the wider the teeth on your comb should be. If you have very kinky or curly hair, don’t comb any more than necessary.

, Heat is damaging to hair, plain and simple. Even if you use a heat protectant, your hair will still be affected when you apply heat from a hair dryer, curling iron or straightening iron. Use heat only when you absolutely have to for a special occasion. Otherwise, let your hair air dry and style it without using heat tools.

, When you’re trying to regrow your hair, trimming it off isn’t going to help the problem. It’s a good idea to trim off your split ends every few months, but don’t go overboard getting brand new styles. Having a stylist cut and style your hair using heat tools and heavy products could make matters worse. It’s better to do your daily massage, use oil treatments and mask, and otherwise try to leave your scalp alone so your hair can start growing in.


When you do get your hair cut, opt out of getting a blowout. See if the stylist will use a wide-toothed comb instead of a brush to comb out your hair after washing.

, Hair extensions are hard on your hair and your scalp. The weight of the extensions pulls on your hair causing breakage, and in the worst cases, bald patches. When you’re trying to grow your hair in, you want to let it be as natural as possible. Hair extensions, chemical straightening, bleaching and dyeing are extremely damaging and will not help your hair grow back in.


Experiment with styles that look great and don’t require handling your hair too harshly.
If you absolutely have to dye your hair, try a natural henna dye, which can actually nourish your hair instead of harming it.

, Although it may be tempting to wear a wig or hairpiece when your hair is thinning, they can actually make hair loss worse by damaging your scalp and interfering with circulation. If you must wear a wig or hairpiece, take these measures to keep possible damage to a minimum:Make sure your wig fits properly. Get fitted by a hair-care professional.
Get a “breathable” wig or hairpiece that allows airflow to the scalp.
Avoid using hairpiece adhesives, or hairpieces made from materials that might irritate your scalp.
Take off your wig or hairpiece as often as possible. Don’t keep it on when you are at home.

, Sleeping on silk minimizes stress on your hair by preventing damaging tangles and frizz and helping your hair retain its natural oils and moisture during the night. Be sure to select a pillowcase made from 100% silk for best results."

Choose air-drying over blow-drying your hair.,
Skip the towel.,
Wash your hair less frequently.,
Keep your hands off your hair during the day.,
Reduce chemical treatments.",How to Prevent Hair from Frizzing After Shower1," Brushes and combs create friction that can damage your hair or upset the strands, causing more frizz. Breakage and frizzing are even more likely when using a dry brush on dry hair. To reduce frizz from brushing, use your fingers to untangle your hair when it is dry.








If necessary, use a wide-tooth comb in the shower to properly distribute conditioner and untangle hair. Avoid using combs on dry hair. Boar bristle brushes are a good choice for dry hair.;
, Air drying your hair can help to prevent frizz. Friction and heat are major causes of frizz, so avoiding blow-drying and towel-drying can help to prevent your hair from getting frizzy.


To help the hair cuticles dry flat, try tying your hair in a loose bun or braid as it dries. This will keep the strands lying flat and prevent flyaways and frizz while it dries., When drying your hair, try using a t-shirt or microfiber cloth instead of a towel.Regular towels create more friction, which may cause frizz. T-shirts and microfiber cloths are gentler and will help your hair lie flat as it dries.








, It is possible to reduce frizz by washing your hair less often. Frequent washing can strip natural oils away from your hair and this may cause your hair to frizz. Fine hair only needs to be shampooed every other day and thicker hair only needs to be shampooed about once every three days.People with oily hair, or those who sweat daily due to activities like work or exercise may need to wash their hair more frequently. Use conditioner on non-shampoo days to remove sweat and dirt and allow for easy styling.

, The more you touch your hair throughout the day, the more friction is created. This can ruffle your hair cuticles and cause frizz. Try to avoid touching your hair, or putting it up and down throughout the day., Treatments such as coloring, perms, and relaxers can dramatically change the texture of your hair, causing it to frizz in ways it hadn't previously. Reduce the number of times you get chemical treatments in a year to help combat frizz.


Consider using root touch up powders in between colorings, and find styles that allow you to rock your natural texture rather than having it chemically altered.

Wear a baseball hat or handkerchief on your head when you are out in the sun. Your skin is not the only part of your body that can be damaged from the sun. Your hair soaks in all the sun's rays as well which will dry it out. Beware of the ponytail sticking out the back, though, and tuck your hair up under the hair covering.
Wear a knit hat in the winter months since arid air will dry out your hair. This can also protect it from strong winds.

Choose the right comb or brush.,
Try a metal clothes hanger.,
Use a humidifier.,
Dry your hair with a shirt or paper towel.",How to Prevent Static Electricity in Your Hair1," Some people have had success fixing static hair by using an ionic blow dryer. This blow dryer has negative ions that neutralize the positive ions in your hair to help get rid of static. The ion molecules also break down water molecules in your hair instead of evaporating water molecules, like regular blow dryers. This helps prevent your hair of being stripped of moisture and getting staticky.These blow dryers are not necessarily that expensive and only cost around 20 dollars.;
, Rubbing dryer sheets on your hair can actually help get rid of static hair. You can alternatively rub them on your pillowcase at night instead of your hair.Try keeping your hair brushes wrapped in dryer sheets., Instead of using a plastic comb, try a metal comb. Plastic will make your hair more staticky, but metal is a conductive so it won’t. This means that the electricity goes to the metal first before it goes to your hair, making your hair have less static electricity.Rubber combs or brushes work better than plastic.You can also try using a wooden comb or brush.Use a brush with natural bristles. These brushes are more expensive but help distribute oil in your hair and prevent static., Metal is a conductive so it will help get rid of static. Rub a metal clothes hanger on your hair to help get rid of static electricity. Hold the hanger so it is touching your head and move it slowly downward. Make sure you make contact with every part of your hair., Using a humidifier will make your room moister and eliminate the static problem because the water molecules in the air break up static. If you don’t have a humidifier, simmer water on your stove with a little bit of cinnamon., Instead of using a regular towel to dry your hair, try using a shirt or paper towel. The rough material of a towel can open your hair cuticles which can cause flyaways.When drying your hair squeeze it with your towel, shirt, or paper towel, but don’t rub it.A microfiber towel may also do the trick.

Mix up an anti-frizz solution.,
Make a hair masque out of avocado.,
Try a jojoba oil treatment.,
Smooth your hair with coconut oil.,
Blast your hair with cold air from a freezer for a few minutes.",How to Prevent Hair from Frizzing After Shower2," If your hair is prone to frizz, try creating a solution of conditioner and water to apply to the tips of your hair. Take about a tablespoon of conditioner and mix it with about 1 cup of water. Use your fingers to apply a small amount to the ends of your hair. Keep this solution handy for a quick frizz fix or make it part of your daily hair care routine.








Make sure that you only apply this solution to the ends of your hair, not the roots.
You can also put some of the solution in a small spray bottle to keep with you in a purse or bag and use as necessary throughout the day.

, Mash up one avocado. Apply it to clean, damp hair with your fingers, staying a few inches away from the roots. Let stand fifteen minutes. Rinse out with water.








Those with fine hair should only apply the masque to their ends.
The oils in the avocado will naturally coat your hair and protect it from damage and humidity. It will also lock in moisture to keep it from drying out.
You can also use olive oil to create a hair masque. Warm olive oil on the stove until it is warm, but not too hot to touch. Apply it throughout damp hair. Wait thirty minutes. Shampoo and condition normally. , Jojoba oil is a natural plant-based oil that is sold as a moisturizing hair treatment. It is very useful for frizz-prone hair. Apply the oil weekly to your hair below your ears, focusing on the ends, where more damage is likely to occur. Applying below your ears will also prevent your hair from appearing flat. 







, Coconut oil has many uses, and can be used on thick hair to keep in moisture and prevent frizz. Apply to clean, damp hair, starting at the ends and working your way up. Stop midway up your hair, as applying it near the scalp will make your hair appear extremely greasy. 







, Hair frizzes from heat styling and warm weather. To set your hair after styling it, stand in front of the freezer for a minute. This will allow the hair cuticles to cool and settle smoothly before you go outside, where it may be exposed to sun and humidity.

Choose quality shampoos and conditioners.,
Steer clear of alcohol-containing hair products.,
Limit use of heat-stylers.,
Use dry shampoo between washes.,
Apply styling products right after you shower.,
Finished.

",How to Prevent Hair from Frizzing After Shower3," Sulfates in shampoo are great at stripping away dirt and oils, but they are incredibly drying to hair and can cause excess frizz. Opt for shampoos and conditioners that are sulfate-free to reduce the drying, fizzing effect on your strands., Hair products such as hair spray can dry out your hair.Before you buy any hair product, check for alcohol in the ingredients list. If you spot alcohol in the ingredients list, don’t buy the product.


Not all alcohols dry out your hair. Fatty alcohols Lauryl alcohol, Cetyl alcohol, Myristyl alcohol, Stearyl alcohol, Cetearyl alcohol and Behenyl alcohol, will not be as drying., Tools that expose your hair to heat, such as blow dryers, straighteners and curlers, can cause damage that may contribute to frizz. Using these products often can cause permanent damage, so it is best to save them for special occasions.


If you choose to blow dry your hair, consider investing in a diffuser to reduce the amount of direct heat on your hair.When using a standard blow dryer, wait until hair is 90% air dried, then use a blow dryer to dry the last 10% of your hair. This will help to reduce the damage caused by the heat.When using heat-stylers, you may also want to consider using a special spray to protect hair cuticles from the heat, and to lock in moisture. There are many products that will add a layer of protection to your hair cuticles so that they are not as easily damaged by the direct heat., Regular shampoo dries out your hair and the friction that comes from washing your hair can contribute to frizz as well. Try using a dry shampoo in between washes to help eliminate oil near your scalp. This will control frizz by reducing your need for continual washing.








Be sure to look at your dry shampoo to see if it uses a non-fatty alcohol. Short-chain alcohols can actually make the problem worse over time.

, Applying styling products right after getting out of the shower can help to lock in moisture.Just be sure to wring out your hair first or the products will not absorb. Look for products that contain polymers and silicone, which help fight humidity.


For fine, wavy hair, try using mousse. It will not weigh your hair down as much. For thicker hair, try gels and creams, which can hold up against thicker curls.When using products on frizzy hair, make sure to focus the product toward the ends of your hair. Work the product up until it is about halfway through up your hair. The ends dry out faster, and applying product to your scalp will only make your hair look greasy.,"

Dry your hair with a t-shirt instead of a towel.,
Do not shampoo your hair every day.,
Switch to an iconic hairdryer.,
Comb your hair instead of brushing it.",How to Prevent Static Hair2," The grooves on towels can pull apart the strands on your hair, creating frizz. This makes static more likely. Instead of using a towel to dry your hair, have an old t-shirt in your bathroom. Use that to pat your hair dry after a shower., Shampooing your hair too frequently dries it out. This can lead to an increased risk for static. Cut back on how often you shampoo your hair. Try applying shampoo every other day or every three days instead of every day.If you want your hair to still feel smooth even without shampoo, add a small amount of conditioner instead of shampoo.

, An iconic hairdryer can be purchased at most drug stores for about $20. They work differently from regular hairdryers and can neutralize static. If you dry your hair frequently, an iconic hairdryer may be worth the investment., Brushing your hair can create friction. This encourages static. Instead of using a brush on your hair, use a comb.Opt for a wide-toothed comb. The wider the bristles, the less static you'll generate.
If you strongly prefer using a brush, try one with boar bristles. These fibers tend to be less harsh on hair.

Do not wear rubber shoes.,
Avoid synthetic fibers.,
Do not use plastic combs.,
Limit your exposure to dry environments.",How to Prevent Static Hair3," Rubber soled shoes can contribute the electric charge when you're walking on carpeted floors. This can transfer to your hair, creating static. Avoid rubber soled shoes if you're prone to static hair., Nylon and polyester blends can cause a lot of static to build up on the body. This can lead to static hair, especially if you're using a scarf or hat. When possible, go for more natural fibers to fight static.However, some natural fibers can cause static as well, although to a lesser extent than synthetic ones. Wool and silk are not the best options if you're trying to combat static hair.

, Plastic combs can make static hair worse. Metal is conductive, meaning it can discharge any electric charges building up in your hair. Always opt to brush your hair with a metal comb or brush., Dry air can increase static electricity in your hair. Avoid going out when it's very dry out. If your home is very dry, invest in a humidifier. Humidifying the environment can help lessen static hair."

Use hydrating shampoo.,
Condition more frequently.,
Use oil products.,
Use hair spray.,
Try using water.,
Put lotion in your hair.,
Consider problems with product buildup.",How to Prevent Static Electricity in Your Hair2," Switch to a shampoo with extra moisturizer. Static electricity can have more of an impact in the winter. Even if you normally have moisturized hair, you should still change to a hydrating shampoo during the cold, dry months.Skip a day or two between shampooing. The natural oils in your hair will help with the static., Conditioner can help neutralize the static charges in your hair. Conditioning everyday may not be necessary, however, most people just need to condition each time they wet their hair.Using a silicone based conditioner may help in the short term, but over the long term coating your hair with silicon can prevent conditioner from absorbing, which can dry out your hair and make static worse.
Choose a conditioner which aims to moisturize and de-frizz hair.
You can try using apple cider vinegar for a natural conditioner option.Deep condition your hair with coconut or argan oil once a week to help keep your hair moisturized., There are many hair products out there that you can use to help tame your staticky hair. Use oil based products (such as moroccan oil, argan oil, or coconut oil) to help tame your static. Put the product in your hair when it is wet then air dry or blow dry with an ionic dryer. Try using Moroccanoil Frizz Control Spray, Alterna Bamboo Smooth Kendi Dry Oil Mist, or Oribe Cote d'Azur Hair Refresher., Spray hair spray on your comb and then comb through your hair. This will disburse hairspray everywhere to keep the staticky pieces down.You can also spray a little hairspray on your palms then rub your hands on the pieces that are sticking up.

, Depending on your hair type water can help get rid of static. Get a little water on your hands and rub them over the staticky pieces.Keep in mind that if you have hair that is straight, wavy or somewhere inbetween this might make frizz worse when your hair dries.


You can also put the water in a spray bottle (alone or with a little product) and spray it in your hair.

, It might seem a little strange, but body or hand lotion can help get rid of static electricity in your hair. Put a little bit of lotion on your hands (a little bit can go a long way) and rub it through your strands to help get rid of static.Putting lotion on your body can make your less susceptible to static electricity., Overuse or improper use of many hair products (even those mentioned above) can lead to buildup, leftover residues clinging to the hair that can prevent it from absorbing moisture. This is more common with products that contain resins, heavy oils, non-water soluble silicones or in strong hair sprays. If you find conditioning or moisturizing products make static worse, buildup may be your problem. Use a clarifying shampoo to remove buildup.A solution of 1:1 cider vinegar to water can also be used to gently remove buildup without drying out your hair.
Prevent buildup by avoiding products that may cause it, applying them in modest amounts and evenly throughout your hair if you need to, and being sure to rinse everything out of your hair when washing it. "

Tie your hair back.",How to Grow Out a Pixie Cut," In order to make your hair grow out faster, you need to keep your hair as healthy and hydrated as possible. Applying heat, dye, and certain hair products to your hair in excess can cause individual strands to dry and break, thereby hindering your hair's overall ability to grow.


If you need to smooth frizzy, flyaway hair, use a mini flat-iron and focus only on the areas in need of flattening. Do not flat-iron your entire hair unless necessary.
Switch to hydrating hair products, like cream-serums, and stay away from any containing harsh chemicals.
You should also avoid washing your hair more than necessary. Skip at least one day in between washings, and on occasion, try skipping two days.;
, Conditioner, on the other hand, helps lock moisture into your hair and makes it healthier. To stimulate hair growth faster, you should condition your hair after every shampooing while you are in the process of growing it out.


If you use a rinse-out conditioner, you can prevent your hair from looking weighed down in between washings.
On the other hand, if your hair gets especially dry, consider using a leave-in conditioner to provide extra protection and hydration.

, Oils can help moisturize your hair and create a barrier against drying agents in the air that could otherwise damage exposed strands. Coconut oil is, perhaps, the most commonly used oil when it comes to hair treatment.


Massage a few drops of coconut oil or another oil into your scalp, working it through all of your strands, as well. Let it sit undisturbed for 20 to 30 minutes before rinsing the oil out with warm water.
Repeat this procedure once a week if you have hair that gets oily easily or twice a week if your hair gets dry easily.

, Before going to bed each night, treat your scalp to a brief massage. Rub the scalp with your fingertips, working in circular motions, until you cover the entire scalp. Doing this is thought to help stimulate hair growth.


Try massaging the scalp for a full 5 to 10 minutes before going to sleep. This process is thought to stimulate blood flow, which could help your hair grow, as well.

, You may not realize it, but the overall physical state of your body can have a dramatic effect on the condition of your hair. If you are unhealthy, it might take longer for your pixie cut to grow out.


For best results, eat plenty of foods that provide nutrients involved in the hair growth cycle. Get enough protein, iron, and zinc.A few specific foods that are worth working into your diet include walnuts, salmon, eggs, spinach, and blueberries.

, It might seem counter-intuitive, but making a regular trip to the hair salon to have your hair trimmed is actually a key component of successfully growing your pixie cut out. If you do not go to the salon, split ends will develop and worsen, leading to lifeless hair.


If you do not trim your split ends near the beginning of the process, you may notice that your hair will begin to ""bulge"" out around the ear.Once you notice split ends developing, trim about 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) off your hair.

, A decorative headband can hide any sections of hair that have grown to an awkward length, but because it also doubles as a fun accessory, your hairstyle can still look playful, chic, and purposeful.


Use a thin headband to create a sleek look. With this type of band, you can slick your bangs completely back and use the headband to hold them in place.
For a more fashionable, fun look, try a thicker headband with a fun pattern or embellishment. Depending on the decorative element used, you can use the band to hold your bangs back or to distract the eye from the length of your hair.
Avoid undecorated cotton headbands. These tend to look too casual and may make it appear as though you simply forgot to take the headband out before stepping out.

, You can use clips and pins to sweep any misplaced strands out of the way while adding a touch of something special to your look. Since there are so many types of hair clips available, you can make this look work for just about any occasion, spanning the style gamut from flirty to sophisticated.


When your hair gets long enough to gather into a bundle, try using a sparkly hair pin to pin them off the the side or back, creating a sort of pseudo-ponytail.
You can also use pins and clips to sweep back long bangs.
If you do not need pins and clips for a practical use, you can still slip a sparkly clip into your hair at the side just to add a bit of flair to your everyday look.

, If you are unable to create a hair style you feel satisfied with for the day, cover up your untamable locks with a pretty hat or head scarf. Both options can create classy, stylish looks when done well.


Think outside the box when choosing the right hat. Instead of grabbing that ragged baseball cap in your coat closet, reach for something with a little more class, like a beret, cloche, fedora, bucket, or newsboy hat. Play with material and pattern to achieve a look that matches well with your personality and the shape of your face.
Wrap a scarf around your hair. A silky scarf with a beautiful print is another great option for when you want to cover your hair instead of styling or accessorizing it. Unlike a hat, however, a headscarf almost always adds a touch of classic, quiet sophistication to your look, especially if you choose one made from an elegant material.

, If you want long hair and want it now, check into buying hair extensions. Ask your hairdresser for more information about extensions, and for best results, have the hairdresser put long-lasting ones in.

, As your hair grows out, it will naturally begin to get longer in the back while remaining short in the front. To avoid looking like your hair is “business in the front, party in the back,” get some of the hair in the back of your head to be trimmed, even when there are little to no split ends in them.


To avoid the mullet look during the first stage of growth, when the front of your hair is trying to catch up to the back, see your hairdresser every four weeks for a neck trim., The right hair color can liven up your hair during the initial stages of odd growth patterns, and it can also provide a good distraction from parts of your hair style you are less than eager to show off.


Note, however, that you should not dye your hair frequently during this process. Hair dye uses harsh chemicals that can damage your hair over time, and damaging your hair will only cause it to grow more slowly, thereby delaying the end result.
If distraction is your main goal, consider choosing a bold color, like fiery red, pink, blue, or plum. Keep this color throughout the first phase of growth, until your hair reaches bob length.
If you want something to pretty up your hair without utilizing the full power of distraction, you could go for highlights or lowlights that accent your natural hair color and fade away naturally as your hair grows out.

, If your bangs or the front strands of hair become too long, you can braid your bangs off to the side. This can create a cute look while simultaneously getting them out of the way.


Start with a deep side part.
Gradually French braid your bangs, working them into the rest of your hair as they reach toward the side and back.
Hide the ends with a decorative clip or by slipping them behind your ear.

, When your hair wants to start flying all over the place on its own, encourage it. Use gel or mousse to create a spiky, edgy style for the day, focusing on creating angles that frame your face as effectively as possible.


At home, try teasing your hair to give it a fuller, wilder look. Hold it in place with a spritz of hairspray or dry shampoo, or keep it pinned in place with fun hair clips.
If you like the wild look, talk to your stylist about incorporating the look into your next cut. You could try for a piece-y, wavy bob that hides imperfections or a choppy pixie or bob with layers designed to frame the face., Once your bangs get rather long, you can create a deep side part on one side of your head and brush all the bangs forward. Use a brush to sweep the bangs off into a chic, elegant, and asymmetrical bang.


The part should be roughly aligned to one of your ears.
Sweep your bangs over the opposite side of your face and hold them in place with a light spray of dry shampoo.They should sneak just above or just over the eye.
You could also insert two bobby pins over the ends of the side-swept bangs, crossing them together in the shape of an ""x,"" to hold the bangs in place more securely.

, When all else fails, tie your hair back in a simple ponytail. This might be hard to do initially, but as your hair grows out to a satisfactory enough length, you can form a mess low ponytail at the base of the scalp.When working a ponytail, part the hair down the center and slick it back. Use hair elastics designed to avoid breaking your hair, and tie as much hair as you can gather into a low ponytail at the base of your neck.
Even if you use hair elastics designed to minimize breakage, you should still avoid doing this too often because tying your hair back can cause more split ends in the long-run.

It is up to you how long you want your mullet to be.Try to grow your hair between 2-6 inches long. The longer your hair, the more defined your mullet will be.A good guideline for a mullet is to try and keep the back about 4 inches longer than the front.;
, Using clips, divide the top of your hair into three parts. Create a section on the top of your head that runs from the front hairline to about the middle of the crown, where your head starts to curve. Section off the sides at the front hairline on both the right and left of the top section and down to the ears.Pull back any hair you want to keep long with a clip., Starting with the top middle section first, comb your hair over your forehead. Cut your bangs to the desired length. You can cut your bangs as short or as long as you prefer. Cut them straight across or cut them at an angle. There are many ways to style your bangs.


When you cut your bangs, work in sections. Even if you plan on cutting them all the same length, don't try to cut all your hair at once.Pick a side to start on, and grab a section of bangs. Hold the hair between your fingers, and work from the center towards the outer edge of your hair. Take care when you cut. You can always cut more if you want them shorter.For side swept bangs, hold the scissors at an angle when you cut., Pick a side and comb your hair forward. Using your bang length as a guide, cut the sides of your hair at an upwards angle. The hair should be longest at the top and taper down to a shorter length over the ears. Comb your hair down to trim the area over your ears.When working with the hair near the ears, take a little off at a time. Comb the hair back and forth taking about a 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) off at a time. Use vertical cuts to help create a tapered look., Comb the top of your hair up from both sides. Hold the hair in the center. Use your bangs as a guide and cut the top of your hair to match this length.Take your time and make sure you get nice, even cuts. Work from front to back until you reach the crown., Comb out small sections of your hair where the top and sides meet. Pull the hair up and out, and cut any corners or sharp angles you see.Your goal is to blend the sides of your hair to the top. Avoid making any sharp lines where the top and sides meet. The cuts should be smooth and tapered.Comb through your hair and make sure it's to your liking. If it is too long, go back through and take a little more off the top.

, Remove your hair from the clip and comb it straight down. Comb it smooth to make cutting easier., Working in thin sections, comb the back of your hair up and at an angle away from your head. Use the hair in the top section as a guide to trim the back.Hold the hair at the back of your head with some of the hair in the rear top section to make this part easier.Continue cutting until you have cut all the hair in the back. This cut will give you some layered length in the back.Comb out the back of your hair and make sure the length is to your liking.

, Check for any corners or sharp cuts by combing where the sides of your hair join the back. If you see any sharp edges cut them away until you have a smooth tapered look., For an updated version of the classic mullet, shave the sides of your head. Keep the top of your hair long and grow the back of your hair out longer than you would for a classic mullet.


When you shave the sides of your head, leave a strip of hair on the top of your head. Blend the strip on top into the long hair in the back, shaving the sides of the back of your head as well, so that the strip extends down and into the back. This mullet should resemble a mohawk, with the top strip blending into the long hair in the back. You can style the top of the hair in a traditional mohawk if you like, or slick it back.

, This requires some length on top, as you'll need plenty of hair to get the pompadour style right. Start near the crown of your head, and start slicking your hair back. Let the hair on the top of your head blend into the long hair in the back.Work your way to the front, keeping everything nice and slicked back. When you get to the front of your hair, use your comb to pull your hair up. Roll the comb back and over, creating a wave in your hair. This should be the tallest section in your hair.The back of your hair can be as long as you like for this style.

, Get a buzz cut on the top of your hair, but leave the back of your hair long. This works especially well with curly hair.


You can keep the back of your hair just a little longer, so that it is nice and tight, or you can grow it out long. Play around and find a length you like.

Watch for overheating.",How to Give Yourself a Buzzcut," You can get a decent pair for $30-$50. If cutting your own hair is going to be long term thing, consider getting professional grade clippers (usually $100-$120).


Look for a sturdy pair with sharp blades that won’t dull quickly.
The Oyster brand is known for making high quality tools, although they tend to be on the pricy side.;
, Special guards for the ears are also a plus, since that area is one of the trickiest. It's good to have an assortment of durable and sharp blades on hand, as well.

, Optional tools that you might want to consider having on hand: a comb, scissors, hair thinning scissors and a razor blade.

, Before you even get near your hair with the clippers, get familiar with them. Find the power button, turn them on and off, practice changing out the blades, clip the guards on and off, run through the speed settings, etc. Clippers tend to be heavier than people expect, so get a feel for their heft first.


Mid-buzzcut is definitely not the ideal time to reference the manual, so get to know your tool., The best space to use is your bathroom, since you can jump right into the shower after and easily sweep/vacuum the hair up from the floor. Hair can be very difficult to get out of your clothing, so wear a plastic bag over yourself or do it without clothing altogether (another reason why the bathroom is the ideal spot).

, If you're going from a longer hairstyle to a buzzcut, it will be easier on you and your clippers if you chop off most of your length first. Use a sharp pair of scissors and cut off the hair, leaving only a few inches. Don't worry about cutting it evenly, since you're about to buzz it off. Just chop most of the length off and then you're ready for the clippers.

, Run your fingers through your hair to figure out the direction of growth – the places where you feel the most force against your fingers indicates growth in that direction.


If you have a lot of variation all over your head or if you’re afraid you might forget the growth directions, take down a few notes for reference.

, When you use anything less than a #3 clipper guard, your scalp will be visible.


If you've never had a buzz cut before, you probably won’t know if you have any bald spots, lumps, scars or any other scalp issues that you wouldn’t want to be visible.Always start a cut with clean and groomed hair, which will extend the life of your blades., Start at the back of the neck and move the direction of the clippers up to ear level. Trim around the ears with a special clipper, which you were hopefully able to obtain. If you don’t have this, buzzing around the ears may be a little more difficult, but it can be done. Then buzz from ear to temple level.


If you have persistent long pieces, cut them carefully with scissors.Go slowly and pay close attention to what you’re doing around the ears.

, If you’re right handed, place your left hand on the back of your head in a horizontal position (if you’re a lefty, reverse those instructions). Your hand will act as a guide so that you can avoid cutting too far up or crookedly. Starting at the bottom, drag the clippers up through your hair until you bump against your hand. Put the clippers down and use the second mirror to check your work.


Repeat the process of making one pass with the clippers and then checking the mirror until you’ve buzzed all of the back of your head.If you don’t have a second mirror on hand, use the camera on your phone.

, Do a couple of passes with the clippers, then check to see if anything needs fixing. Due to the curve of the head, it's easy to miss some longer pieces. Try different directions to get any stray pieces that might be lingering.


Try going side to side across the top of the head, and both forward and backwards.
Feel for any leftover long pieces with your fingers and clean up whatever remains.

, Use your hand, a headband, a piece of tape, or something else as a guide for the back of the neck. Apply pressure with the clippers and move them move slowly until you hit the edge of the guide. Be careful doing this, since the clippers can easily push under your guide if you aren’t paying attention.


Use two mirrors or a camera to check your work and clean it up if needed.
Be careful not to cut an uneven line at the bottom of the style.

, Always remove any hair after using the blade. Keep the guards tidy and in order. Store all of the pieces in a case together with the clippers. Rub a few drops of oil into the blade every few times you use it. Always use a guard to cover the blade whenever the clippers aren’t in use.


Check your manual for any specific care your particular blades may need.
After having your clippers for a while, you may begin to notice that it is cutting unevenly and pulling at your hair.This means you either need to sharpen or replace your blades, whichever you prefer.

, To style shorter length buzzcuts, apply a pea-sized amount of gel or wax on the top of your head. Run your fingers up through the hair to distribute the product. This will give it texture and spike it up.


For cuts that are longer than an inch, wet your hair first and then use a blow dryer to make the hair spike up.
For additional hold or texture, apply a small amount of hair wax or cream after blow drying., Once you’re done cutting, always unplug the clippers and put them away. While you’re in the middle of cutting, pay attention to the heat the clippers are generating – some clippers can become too hot to handle during use.


Whenever you feel this happening to yours, immediately turn them off and let them cool down a bit before resuming.
This will keep your clippers functioning well over time.

Oil, which conditions hair, warmed and massaged onto your scalp will help to prompt hair growth. Heat up a bit of olive, coconut, or argon oil until warm to the touch. Gently rub this into your scalp for 5-10 minutes, and allow the oil to soak into your hair for an additional 30 minutes. Rinse out the oil with warm water when you’re finished., Apple cider vinegar is one of those ‘jack of all trades’ products; it works wonders on hair, skin, and many health ailments. Among its many abilities is the power to help stimulate hair growth. Mix three parts apple cider vinegar with one part water, and put it in a spray bottle. Every time you shower, spritz your hair with the vinegar mixture post-shampoo. Wait 1-2 minutes, and then rinse it out. You should notice a change in growth rate after several weeks of use.

, Damaged hair doesn’t grow as well as healthy hair; using a deep conditioner to repair your hair follicles will increase hair growth over time. Choose a deep conditioner for your hair type (available at most drug stores and hair salons), and follow the box directions for application. Normally, the conditioner is left in your hair for 20-30 minutes prior to being rinsed out with cold water.

, Egg whites and aloe vera have been used in hair for centuries. They add moisture to hair, giving it a healthier appearance, and also help to stimulate hair growth. Mix an egg white with fresh aloe vera (or 100% bottled aloe) and cover your hair and scalp in the mixture. Let the mask set for 15-20 minutes, and then rinse it out with cool water. Allow your hair to air-dry when finished.

, Boil a cut onion in water for 10-15 minutes to form an onion broth. Allow this to cool, and then coat your head and scalp in it. The onion provides nutrients that help with hair growth while adding shine to the strands. Rinse it out with cold water, and allow your hair to air dry. And don’t worry - the onion won’t leave a smell in your hair as long as you rinse it all out., Brushing your hair is good for increasing hair growth, because it stimulates the scalp and spreads the natural oils throughout the shaft of each strand of hair. However, there are do’s and don’t’s when it comes to brushing your hair. Aim to brush your hair 1-2 times a day (when you wake up and at night, for example). However, be cautious of brushing your hair too much, as this can pull out hair that you’re trying to grow. Additionally, never brush your hair when it’s wet, because it is most fragile and easy to break in this state.

, Although it is typically more of an issue for women than men, using hot tools (like blow dryers and flat irons) and chemicals (such as hair dyes and relaxers) will significantly damage your hair. Not only will it make your hair appear frizzy and dull, it will cause your hair to take longer to grow. When at all possible, allow your hair to air-dry and avoid styling it with any tools.

, Although it may not make your hair look the greatest, the natural oil your scalp produces are imperative for improving hair health and speeding the rate of growth. Washing your hair every day removes these oils, slowing your growth rate. Wash your hair as few times a week as you’re able, spacing washings to be at least every-other day.

, There are certain vitamins and supplements on the market which help increase hair growth. Taken regularly, you should notice an increase in growth each month. Look for Biotin and fish oil - both which increase hair and nail health and growth. You should also make sure that you’re caught up with all your regular vitamins and minerals, taking a multivitamin as a supplement if necessary., There are dozens of hair shampoos on the market, each tailored for a different hair type or ultimate style. However, the one consistent ingredient that you should avoid in shampoo is silicone. Although it is advertised as beneficial, silicone will block out moisture and nutrients, hindering hair growth. Look for hair products (shampoo or otherwise) which use natural ingredients and are silicone-free.

, As said, silicone blocks out moisture and nutrients, so look for a conditioner with natural ingredients. Another option is just to use a leave in conditioner (don't rinse leave in conditioners off).

, Hot showers may be the most comfortable, but the heat from the water opens the hair shaft of each strand of hair, letting out valuable moisture, making your hair more brittle and prone to damage. When you wash your hair, use the coldest water you can stand. The cool temperature will close the hair shaft and help to trap in the moisture that you would otherwise let out., There’s a reason people remark on ‘losing hair’ when they’re stressed; stress, poor diet, and lack of exercise can all lead to hair thinning and slowing the growth of hair. Make necessary lifestyle changes to promote good eating and exercise habits, and cut out stress whenever possible.

, Water is important for good health in general, but drinking lots of water can help provide your scalp and hair follicles with necessary moisture for increasing growth. Drink 8-10 glasses of water throughout the course of the day to supply your body with adequate moisture.

, There tend to be two major parties when it comes to hair growth: those who promote regular trims, and those who vow against any hair cutting at all. While they seem to be opposing views, both are right. The reason you trim hair is to either remove length or to remove damage. Since you’re trying to grow your hair out, you don’t want to trim your hair for the former reason. Instead, hair should be trimmed semi-regularly to cut off damaged ends. This doesn't promote hair growth, but it promotes hair health; long hair that is frizzy and brittle won’t look good. Therefore, aim to cut your hair between 1-3 times a year to keep it looking good.

, This might sound strange, but the fabric from most pillowcases (cotton or other low thread-count cases) causes your hair to fall out. The reason being that the “rough” fabric causes friction with your hair, pulling out strands as you sleep. In order to avoid this, swap out your regular pillowcases for satin pillowcases, which are smooth enough to let your hair slide without tugging."

Instead of these, use a wide-tooth comb, afro pick, or even your fingers to comb your hair.Don't comb more than necessary! Just use your comb, pick, or fingers to get rid of any tangles.
If you have a lot of tangles, try buying a detangling spray specifically designed for African American hair. This will make combing much easier and more pleasant.;
, Very curly hair tends to be prone to dryness, which means you do not have to wash it as often as you would if you had oily hair. Try to shampoo your hair three times per week (or even less if you can without it becoming oily) to prevent over-drying.While you should avoid over-washing, it is important to wash often enough to keep your hair and scalp clean. The exact frequency that is right for you will depend on your hair type and the amount of oil in our hair and scalp.
Be careful about what kind of shampoo you use, as many common ingredients can can breakage. Try to avoid shampoo that contains sulfates, polysorbates, isopropyl alcohol, formaldehyde, hydrolysed collagen, parabens, propylene glycol, or polyethylene glycol., After you wash your hair, you should apply a deep conditioner to help keep your hair soft and healthy. You will need to leave the deep conditioner in your hair for an extended period of time before rinsing to ensure that it penetrates the hair shafts.If you are buying a deep conditioner at the store, look for one that contains ingredients like cationic surfactants, cationic polymers, emollients, oils, and silicones.You can also make your own deep conditioner. You can find tons of different recipes online, but common ingredients include mayonnaise, avocado, aloe vera, shea butter, glycerin, coconut oil, argan oil, olive oil, jojoba oil, eggs, and honey.Try not to massage the deep conditioner into your scalp. This can cause flakes.
For the best results, you should cover your hair with a plastic cap while it is wet and apply heat to your hair while the deep conditioner is in. You can do this by sitting under a blow dryer hood for 20-30 minutes or by wrapping your hair in a hot, damp towel for up to two hours. If you use the towel method, you will need to remove the towel and run it under hot water frequently to keep it hot. If you don't apply any heat, you should let the deep conditioner sit on your hair for much longer.

, Moisturizing is absolutely essential to maintain a health afro. There are tons of moisturizing products out there for African American hair, so you may have to do some experimenting to find the best ones for you.Water adds moisture to hair, but only if your hair can absorb it. Try using an oil that penetrates the hair, such as coconut oil, avocado oil, or olive oil, on damp hair to help your hair hold on to that water.
When styling your hair, finish it with a sealing cream or oil that will lock in moisture. Castor oil, shea butter, grapeseed, and jojoba oil are all good choices.

, If you feel like your hair just does not grow, the problem may be that you are over-styling it, causing it to break. Try being gentler on your hair by avoiding harsh treatments as much as possible.Chemical treatments like coloring and relaxing can cause your hair to break, which means it will not grow as fast, so avoid these if you are trying to grow your hair out.
Heat treatments like flat irons, curling irons, and blow dryers can be just as damaging, so use them as little as possible.

, Many people choose to wear their hair in protective styles like braids or twists while they are trying to grow an afro and once their afro is grown to the desired length. These can be beneficial because they protect the ends of the hair from damage. They also offer a convenient way to style your hair when it is an awkward length. It is, however, possible to damage to your hair with these styles, so be careful.Make sure your hair is not braided or twisted too tightly. If it is painful for your scalp at all, it is probably damaging your hair as well.
Don't leave the protective style in for longer than four weeks at a time. It's better if you can take it out even sooner.Continue moisturizing your hair on a daily basis even if it's braided.

, Your hair will grow faster and be stronger if you are healthy. Start from the inside out to grow long, healthy hair.Foods that are rich in protein, iron, biotin, and zinc are known to promote hair growth.Vitamins A and B are also essential for healthy hair.Try to incorporate more of these nutrients into your balanced diet.
Staying hydrated is also very important. If your body doesn't have enough water, your hair will become drier and more brittle.

, It may take many months for your hair to grow long enough for you to have a true afro, so you need to wait it out. Hair typically grows about 1/2 inch each month, but this can vary from person to person.The curlier your hair, the longer it will take to grow out your afro. Don't give up because you will have the hairstyle you want eventually!
Everyone's hair grows in natural cycles, so there are times (typically a few weeks out of every several years) when growth is dormant. There is nothing you can do to make your hair grow during a dormant period, so just be patient and know that it won't last long., Trimming your hair won't make it grow any faster, but it will keep it looking neat and tame. If you see that the ends of your hair are beginning to show signs of damage, it's time for a trim, no matter how bad you want that length!


While hair care products may help prevent new split ends from forming, nothing can repair existing split ends. They must be cut off., Once you have the afro you've always wanted, enjoy it! If you want to keep it looking great, remember to keep taking care of your hair the same way you did when you were growing it. It's still just as important to keep your hair nourished, moisturized, and free from damage.

, Once you've washed and moisturized your afro, you don't need to do much more to style it. Avoid styling products and blow dryers as much as possible.Prevent frizz by always wrapping your hair in a silk scarf before bed. This will help ensure that your afro keeps looking good without the need for heat styling or additional products., If you want a fuller afro, you should comb it after applying your moisturizer. This will help detangle your curls and make your afro nice and full. Be sure to use a wide-toothed comb or an afro pick instead of an ordinary hair comb.Be very gentle while combing. Work in small sections and run the comb from the root of the hair to the ends.
Combing every day is not a necessity, especially if you have a shorter afro. Avoid combing more than you need to in order to get your desired volume, as over-combing will just cause damage.

, If you're a woman, consider adding some extra style to your afro with adornments like clip-in flowers, headbands, or scarves. You can use simple accessories or bold ones, depending on your own personal style., If you want to switch up your look, a faux hawk can make your afro look extra stylish. This works especially well with medium-length afros.Use a hair gel or similar product to slick back the sides of your afro, leaving the top free.
You can also get cornrows on both sides of your head, leaving just the top of your afro loose.

",How to Tease Your Hair Without It Going Flat," To begin with, you should wash your hair and fully dry it. Use a good volumizing shampoo and conditioner to get even bigger hair. Make sure you blow-dry or let hair fully dry, never tease wet hair!;
, To do this use a hair putty(e.g. Garnier's fiber gum in the little green jar). Wet your hands, get a good clump of putty, and rub it all over your hands, front and back. Then apply the putty to the parts of your hair you will be teasing. This will give your hair a ""fake dry/damaged"" texture when applied to heat. But don't worry, when you wash your again hair it will return to your regular texture, hints the ""fake"".

, Separate your hair into sections; thicker hair, or hair with more layers may need to have more separation. Now, spray hair all over with a thermal heat protecting spray. You can find these at Target or your local beauty salon. Protect your hair!! You will feel sorry later if you don't take the time to care for it now!!

, Try to get it pin-straight or pretty close. Make sure your top layer is straightened, because this is where you will be teasing! And it looks tacky when hair is teased and natural wavy looking, like you don't spend time on it.

,, Now, grab your teasing comb. Take your shortest layer and hold it up. Spray your roots in the area your holding, and comb backwards, towards the crown of the head.

, After all the areas you want teased are done, start by combing down the ends and work your way up, so it looks even. Otherwise, you will have combed through the teased parts and you will have to start teasing over again. If it sticks straight up, don't worry, this is what you want, you just have to control it. Look to scene girls for different teasing styles, and how high you want.

, If you have multiple sections go on to another and let the spot that you just sprayed dry.

, You will have to repeat the combing for an all-over smoothness.

, If you want a silky allusion, then spray a ph balance over the top of your hair. An easy, cheap version of a ph balance is a detangle spray, it gets the job done nicely. brush over it lightly and you are armed and fabulous!!

Try a simple high or low ponytail.,
Secure your hair in a side bun.,
Do a low bun.,
Push your hair back with a sweatband or a headband.,
Wrap your hair in a bandana.,
Make use of bobby pins.",How to Style Your Hair for a Workout1," A staple of gym style is a simple ponytail. It keeps the hair out of your face during a vigorous workout. Simply pull all your hair back and secure it using a hair tie. You can have your ponytail rest near the nape of your neck for a low ponytail or have it near the top of your head for a high ponytail., A side bun is a quick style that keeps your hair out of your face while allowing you to have a cute hairdo. Part your hair on the left and gather your hair under your right ear. Twist your hair together until it's in a tight bun. When you're done twisting your hair, use a hair tie or clips to secure your bun.








You can also do the bun on the left side if you prefer.

, A low bun is a cute, simple look that keeps your hair out of your face. To start, brush out your hair and part it on the side. Use your fingers to gather all your hair together in back, near the nape of your neck. Twist your hair a few times until you have a tight swirl of hair. Loop your swirled hair together into a bun shape. Secure your bun with hair clips or a hair tie.








This works well with natural hairstyles, like braids.One advantage of the low bun is that it's flattering on most facial types.

, For workouts that don't require a lot of movement, such as yoga or Pilates, it may not be necessary to have all your hair tied back. In this case, you can simply put on a sweat band the way you would put on a headband. Push your hair back behind your ears using the band, but let it hang loose from there. This keeps your hair out of your face without you having to secure it completely.







, A bandana is cute accessory that easily keeps your hair out of your face at the gym. It has the advantage of covering more surface than a headband, so it's better at keeping bangs and flyaway hair out of your face. Bandanas can be tied around your hair in cute knots or bows.








For natural hair, you can try using a large bandana to wrap your hair up completely. This can help protect your hairstyle from damage during a workout., Bobby pins can be used to clip down any loose hairs that do not hold up in a ponytail. However, you can also use them as accessories. For example, place a row of bobby pins together near the nape of your neck after tying your hair into a ponytail. This is a great statement piece that both helps you accessorize and secures loose hair.








If you prefer a little more color or decoration, barrettes can be used in a similar fashion.

Make a bow bun.,
Make a small hair bow.,
Make small hair bows with no bobby pins.",How to Tie a Hair Bow2," This is a fun spin on a typical messy bun or top knot.








Start by gathering your hair into a high ponytail and looping your hair through an elastic band or hair tie, with the ends sticking out.
Pull apart the bun to create two loops, which will be the two sides of the bow.
Use the ends to wrap between the two loops. This will create the illusion of a bow knot in the center.
Secure the bow bun with bobby pins and/or hair spray.

, This look involves leaving some of your hair down, creating a more relaxed style.








Take one small section of hair from either side of your head. The bigger the sections are, the bigger the bow will be, so decide how large or small you’d like the bow to be on your head.
Tie the two sections together with an elastic or hair tie to create a half ponytail. Don’t pull the ends through the elastic so there is a loop at the end of the tie.
Split the loop in half to create two smaller loops. Clip one loop aside for now with bobby pins.
Use your fingers to spread out the unclipped loop and push it flat against your head into a bow shape. Insert one bobby pin going from the top to the bottom and one going from the bottom to the top.
Repeat this same process for the other loop.
You should now have a bow shape.
Pick up the remaining ends of the ponytail and wrap them up and around the hair tie to hide it. Secure the ends with bobby pins tucked underneath the bow.

, This look creates two pigtails with bows and, best of all, does not require any pinning. However, you will need to have a tool call a Topsy Tailon hand or create one using the end of a fly swatter.








Part your hair into two equal sections on either side of your head. Secure each section with a hair tie so some hair covers your ears and the hair ties sit just below your jaw line.
Separate one section of hair so there are two equal sections and a thicker middle section. Try to make the two side sections of hair as even as possible as these will be the loops for the bow.
Clip off one of the side sections.
Take the Topsy Tail tool or your DIY version of the tool and place the stick end into the outermost layer of the hair tie. Twist the tool so the loop part is closest to your face.
Take one side section of hair and pull it through the loop part of the tool carefully. The section of hair should form a small loop. This is one half of the bow.
Pull the Topsy Tail tool through your hair to remove it and push the hair tie up to secure the section of hair so it stays in a nice, clean loop.
Repeat this process for the other side section of hair to create the other side of the bow. This time though, place the Topsy Tail tool so the loop side faces away from your face.
To hide the hair tie, place the tool in the center of the hair tie, take a section of hair from the front and loop it through the loop end of the tool. Pull the tool down and remove it. You should have a nice center bow tie.
Complete the same procedure on the other side of your hair so you have two pigtails with two bows. Fan out both bows to make them loop full. Use hair spray to keep the bows in place.

Wet your hair.,
Dry your hair with a hair dryer on medium heat.,
Style your hair.,
Secure the cowlick until your hair has cooled.,
Try a flat iron.",How to Tame Cowlicks1," It is easier to work with wet hair. Once the roots dry, the hair will be set and difficult to style. You can style your hair just out of the shower, or wet your hair in the section of the cowlick using a spray bottle.;
, Start by drying your hair in the direction of the cowlick. After several seconds, switch to blowing your hair in the opposite direction. Drying your hair in multiple directions will confuse the hair roots in the area to assist in breaking down the stubborn directions held by the cowlick.For assistance in grabbing and holding the hair, pull it in each direction by pulling with a round brush.
If you have curly hair, use a diffuser and a low air setting.

, Use a round brush to grab sections of your hair and pull it in the direction you would like it styled. Starting at the root, apply heat with a hairdryer on medium heat. With the hair on top of the brush and the mouth of the hair dryer kept close to the hair, draw the brush from the root to the tip of the hair while keeping the hair dryer in line with the brush.


Don't rush. Move the brush slowly through your hair.
Repeat this process as many times as needed until you get the look you want.
For shorter hair, draw the brush repeatedly over the top of the cowlick.
Parting your hair in the direction of the cowlick will make it easier to style your hair in this direction. Styling opposite the direction of the cowlick, though, could give longer hair more body., You will want to maintain the style and direction of your hair until it has cooled entirely. Avoid moving the hair around your cowlick at all until it has cooled.


Using a hair clip, preferably one which will not leave a dent in your hair, clip the hair in place and let it cool.Men or women with shorter hair can use your hand or brush to hold the hair in place. Switch the heat setting on your hairdryer to cool. Blow cool air on the area until it is room temperature again. This should take 1-2 minutes.
For an extremely troublesome cowlick, consider securing your hair in place the night before and keeping the hair clip in place while you sleep.

, A flat iron will provide more extreme heat to a very specific area. Plug the iron in and heat it to a medium-high heat, which should only take a minute or two. Separate out the piece of hair you would like to touch up using a comb. Get the iron as close as you can to the root of the section of hair and press this between the two heated parts of the iron. Gently pull the iron down the length of the hair in the direction you want this section of hair to lie.Avoid touching the iron to your scalp, so you don’t burn your skin.
Opt for a thinner flat iron to be able to address smaller sections of hair.

Apply hair gel to assist in styling your hair.,
Experiment with pomade.,
Massage your roots with a root brush.",How to Tame Cowlicks2," It is best to apply hair gel while the hair is still wet. Drop a small amount of gel in the palm of your hand and rub your hands together. Run your fingers through your hair over the area of the cowlick. Massage the gel into the roots of your hair and rub it in all directions for full coverage.


Once the gel is massaged into the roots, press and comb the cowlick in the direction you would like it styled.
Some gel is heat-activated. Use a hair dryer to style your hair the way you would like it after applying the hair gel.

, Apply pomade to dry hair to help style it in the direction you wish the hair to run. Run your forefinger and middle finger through the pomade to pick up some of the wax. Rub these fingers against your thumb to spread the pomade. Grab the area of hair you would like to adjust and pull it from root to end with these two fingers and thumb, covering the area with pomade, and pulling the hair in the direction you would like it styled.


Choose a pomade with a matte finish.
Avoid using more than a thin layer of pomade or your hair may appear wet until you wash the pomade out.

, Root brushes are specifically created for getting to the root and adjusting the direction of hair growth. While your hair is wet, repeatedly run the brush over the cowlick in the opposite direction of the hair growth.The bristles are very flexible to keep from tangling in the hair follicle.
Many root brushes come with a pointed end to assist in parting your hair where you like it.

Shorten the hair effected by the cowlick.,
Grow your hair longer.,
Add layers to your style.,
Curl your hair.,
Embrace the cowlick!",How to Tame Cowlicks3," This is a good plan for people with short hair and cowlicks on the nape or crown. If the hair is cut evenly, once it is dry the hair in the area of the cowlick could look longer than the rest, because it is swirling in the opposite direction. Cut this area shorter and it will blend better with the rest as your cut grows out.You can also cut the hair in the area of the cowlick extremely short so the hair lies against the scalp or neck where the cowlick exists.

, If you don't want short hair, you can increase your length, thereby increasing the weight of your hair. Longer hair is heavy. That weight could counteract the direction of the cowlick when it is affected by the hair’s gravity.This is not likely to work for cowlicks in your bangs as the hair will not likely get long enough to have an effect on a pesky cowlick.

, Consult with your hairstylist to see if they can add layers to your hair which could cover or camouflage the cowlick. A competent stylist can suggest a good cut to compliment or cover your cowlick.Longer layers can be used to weigh the area down over the cowlick while using shorter layers underneath.
Shorter hair can be styled with a shaggy cut which changes the direction of the hair surrounding the cowlick to help blend it in to your hairstyle and camouflage it.

, Adjust the rest of your hair to match your cowlick. Sending your hair in many different directions can make the cowlick seem entirely intentional. Heat a curling iron to a medium-high heat. Comb out a small section of hair on the front and side of your hair. Clip the iron around this piece of hair near the middle of the length of hair. Draw the iron down to the end of the strands, then spin the iron until all of the section of hair is wrapped around the iron. Hold for three seconds, then unwind the hair and release it from the iron.


Continue this process working your way all the way around your head until you have curled all of your hair.
Curl the area of the cowlick in the direction of the cowlick and take the hair in that area in a similar direction.

, The messy look continues to be in style. Consider allowing the cowlick to do its thing and even match the rest of your hair to that look. Spray a quarter size amount of mousse into your palm and gently rub your hands together. Apply this mousse to slightly damp hair. Massage it deep to the roots, then pull it through your hair in all directions.Women or men with long hair can also try placing your palm at the bottom of a section of hair, slowly lifting that hand to gather the length of the hair, then scrunching it in your fist to create kinks and texture.

Be sure to go to sleep with dry hair.",How to Style Your Hair Each Day of the Week," This style gives you an instantly classy look. Pull your hair over to your left shoulder, then hold it in place by clipping a fancy pin into the far right side of your hair.;
, Before bed Sunday night, wash your hair out. Braid it into two braids. For people with short hair, you may want to braid it into five or six braids. Rub with hair gel. Go to bed with your hair braided. After you get dressed Monday morning, take your hair down. Brush your hair to even it out, then spray it with hairspray to give your style an all-day hold. This gives you a cute and casual look.

, Pull your hair into a ponytail at the nape of your neck. Pull the ponytail holder down towards the end of the ponytail. Now use your thumb to make a hole right above the holder. Now flip your ponytail, pulling it through the hole. Tie a ribbon around your hairband. This is an easily elegant style.

, Take the front section of your hair and pull it up the back, in a sort of swooping/curving motion. Twist the end of this piece twice. Slide a bobby pin onto this twist, and then into your hair. Now you have a smart and girly 'do.

, With your hands, pull your hair into a high ponytail. Push a chopstick through the base of the ponytail with the right hand and hold the ponytail with the left. Holding the ponytail with your right hand, wrap the end of the ponytail around the chopstick. Twist the chopstick until it is vertical in your hair . Push it up until it is almost out of the ponytail, then flip it and push it down through your hair. This style may take some practice. Once you get it however, you will have your friends all saying wow!

, Section your locks into nine sections, holding them with six ponytail holders. In the morning, comb your hair out slowly and gently. You will have a sleek, shiny look all day long.

Many traditional shampoos strip hair of its natural oils. Look for labels that say “strengthening,” “anti-breakage,” or “restorative.”;
, Use a conditioner that strengthens while deep conditioning. A good conditioner should infuse protein, amino acids, and strengthen damaged hair.Some conditioners to try are Redken Extreme Conditioner, FiberStrong conditioner, or Bumble and Bumble Thickening Conditioner., This will help repair damaged hair. Put deep conditioner on your hair and leave it on for at least three minutes before rinsing.

A few deep conditioners to try are Aussie Deeeeep 3 Minute Miracle, Bee Mine Bee-U-Ti-Ful Deep Conditioner, and Alikay Naturals Honey and Sage Deep Conditioner .Make a homemade hair mask. One recipe includes 1 egg yolk, 2 tablespoons of coconut oil, and one tablespoon of honey. Combine ingredients until blended and then apply to damp hair, letting the mask sit for 30 minutes before washing out., This will protect your hair during a blow dry before you tease. Choose one that is aimed at your troubled area. Heat protectants exist to help frizzy, limp, color-treated, or thick hair.Try John Frieda Frizz Ease Hair Serum for frizzy hair.
Tresemmé Thermal Creations Heat Tamer Spray helps protect limp or fine hair.
L'Oréal Color Vibrancy Dual Protection Spray helps keeps color vibrant while conditioning hair.
Dove Style+Care Frizz-Free Shine Cream-Serum helps keep thick hair tame.

, Blow dry your hair before teasing. Teasing curly or naturally wavy hair can tangle hair. Straight hair will be less likely to tangle and damage.

Make sure hair is completely dry before styling. Hair is weakest when its wet., A long tail comb is helpful for sectioning off pieces of hair.The right comb will help you tease your hair properly while maintaining its strength. Good combs to try are the Tortoise Backcomber by Tool Structure, Metal Tail Comb (with fine teeth) by Tearsheet, or the Purple Teasing Comb by Teeze with Eez.

Some stylists prefer a soft bristle brush for teasing, such as the Wonder Boar-Nylon Bristle Teasing Brush by Spornette or the Concave Bristle Shape Teasing Brush by Phillips. These combs can be gentler and less-damaging.
Other salon-grade combs have a lift section on the backend such as the Comare Mark II Gripper Comb with Stainless Steel Lift or the Teasing Comb by Cardiff Brands.
A thick wide-tooth comb is less damaging for curly hair. Consider trying the Double Dipped Teasing Comb by Tool Structure, the Cricket Ultra Smooth Conditioning Comb, or the Sandalwood Hair Comb by Breezelike.

, It’s easy to tease your hair. Once your hair is healthy, you can attempt to tease it. Decide on how much you want to tease. Search teased hairstyles on Pinterest to get an idea., This can vary depending on the style you want. It may be easiest to keep your natural part. If styling your hair straight back, you won’t need a part. , If you have a long tail comb use the end of your comb to grab a 3-inch wide section of hair near the front of your crown. You can also grab a section carefully with your fingers. Brush this section straight up.""The crown” is the circular area on the top of the head.Imagine a crown or hat sitting atop your head. The area under that space is the crown. This is the primary area you’ll tease.
Teasing the crown of the hair gives your normal hairstyle added volume. Teasing the sides gives your hair a lot more height. Teasing just the top gives the intended look.
If you want the look to be looser, take larger sections of hair.

, Tilt your chin down slightly. Position your comb on the underside of the section 3-4 inches down from your roots. Hold the end of the hair section with your other hand so that one hand is combing and the other is holding the section straight up., Comb from the ends of your hair toward the crown. Make sure to only comb in the down direction as combing up and down damages hair.Repeat this technique on the same section 5-6 times. Keep your chin down as you work and set the teased section over your face to keep it separated.

Keep your grip holding the end of the section very tight so that teasing works effectively.
Avoid combing forcefully, as this can damage hair., You can put your hair back in a ponytail or bun if you so choose. You may decide to use bobby pins to hold sections back. Browse Pinterest for different hair styles to wear with teased hair.

Get rid of metal fastener ties. Fabric ties don’t allow you to stretch so tightly, which protects hair from damage.Wear hair down to give it a styling break between “up” days.Switch your ponytail height. Try a low ponytail one day and a high ponytail the next. This way ponytail pressure won’t always be put on the same place., Use hairspray to maintain your new volume all day. Spray at the roots. Mist each section separately.


Buy a hairspray with a medium hold. Most medium level sprays say Level 2 hold on the bottle. Using a hairspray with a medium hold will allow for good teasing, but won’t make your hair look and feel stiff. This will also allow you to brush out your tease at the end of the day.
Some hairsprays to try include Bumble and Bumble Thickening Hairspray (which thickens hair while holding it), Big Sexy Hair Volumizing Spray, and Pantene Pro-V Hairspray.
Don't use too much hairspray, as it can make your hair look stiff. By teasing your hair, you are giving it added volume and height. Spraying too much hairspray won’t give your hair the flow that teasing tries to achieve.

, Add a little dry shampoo to teased sections to help bulk up the volume.Some dry shampoos to try are Batiste dry shampoo, Captain Blankenship Mermaid dry shampoo, or Rahua Voluminous Dry Shampoo."

Shampoo your hair.",How to Use Mayonnaise as a Hair Conditioner1," Low-fat or fat-free mayonnaise is full of fillers that probably do your hair more harm than good. Choose regular mayonnaise for best results.Avoid mayonnaise that contains extra flavoring, such as herbs or spices. Besides smelling funny, these extra components may not be good for your hair.
If you're concerned about using the best possible product for your hair, go for an all-natural, organic mayonnaise. This type of mayonnaise usually contains olive oil and other nutritious ingredients that are great for your hair.;
, Use approximately 1/2 cup of mayonnaise, more or less depending on the length of your hair. You want to use enough mayonnaise to entirely coat your hair from the roots to the tips. Don't use more than you need, though, since it can be tricky to wash it all out.

, Take the mayonnaise out of the refrigerator half an hour to one hour before using it and allow it to warm a little. The fats and oils from the mayonnaise enter the follicles of your hair more readily if the mayonnaise is warm.

, This makes it easier to smooth the mayonnaise into your hair. Don't shampoo or condition your hair; just get it wet with warm water. When your hair is heated the follicles open, allowing the mayonnaise to enter the strands and condition your hair.

, Take care to coat each strand well, and concentrate on working mayonnaise into the tips. You may want to use a wide-tooth comb to help distribute it throughout your hair.


If you don't seem to have enough mayonnaise to coat your hair, apply an extra teaspoon or two.
Apply a little warm water to loosen the mayonnaise if it clumps in your hair.

, You can also use plastic wrap or a plastic bag. This will trap your body heat against your head and help the mayonnaise get to work deep conditioning your hair.Leave the mayonnaise in your hair for at least a 1/2 hour and up to 1 hour, depending on the level of conditioning your hair needs.


f you don't have time to do the full conditioning treatment, you can use mayonnaise as a pre-conditioner in the shower. Wet your hair, apply the mayonnaise, and let it sit for five minutes while you go about your shower routine. At the end of your shower, shampoo it out.
For maximum conditioning benefits, you can leave the mayonnaise in overnight and wash it out in the morning.

, Remove the towel and plastic covering and rinse the mayonnaise from your hair with warm water. Use just enough shampoo to remove the mayonnaise. Your hair should feel soft, but not oily.

When you're washing, drying and otherwise handling your hair, think of it as a delicate fabric that needs to be treated with extra care. That means no scrubbing, pulling or wringing it out.


When you shampoo your hair, use the tips of your fingers to gently pull the shampoo through your hair instead of roughly scrubbing it in.
Rinse your hair using cool or lukewarm water; hot water is extra damaging to dry hair.
When you're done, gently squeeze excess water from your hair instead of twisting and wringing it out. Pat it dry with a towel.;
, Hair becomes dry when the natural oils produced by your scalp aren't getting the chance to nourish it. Shampooing dry hair every day will make it ever drier and more brittle since you're stripping those oils away on a daily basis. Cut back to shampooing just two to three times a week, to give your hair the chance to receive those nourishing oils.When you first cut back, you'll notice your scalp producing a lot of oil, since it's used to having to overproduce to make up for how much gets washed out. Give it a week or two and you'll find that things balance out; you'll be able to go several days in between washings without your hair looking dirty.
If your roots start looking a little oily, dry shampoo is a great way to remedy the problem without washing your hair.

, Are you addicted to your hair dryer? Time to put it down and let your hair dry on its own. Directing hot air toward dry hair won't give it the chance to get healthy. While a blowout might make your hair look shiny, the heat is actually quite damaging, and over time will cause breakage and split ends.


When you first start letting your hair air dry, you might not be thrilled with the results. Give it some time; after a month or so of treating your hair gently, your beautiful natural texture will finally get the chance to shine through.
When you just have to style your hair with a dryer (which should be done only on special occasions), use the warm or cool setting on your dryer, and keep it several inches from your head.

, Hair brushes rip through tangles, leaving a lot of damage in their wake. Since dry hair is very breakable, this can leave your hair looking frizzy and rough. Instead, comb your hair while it's wet using a wide-toothed comb. This is much more forgiving and won't cause you to pull out or break your hair.


If you have tangles, work them out by combing out the tangles near the tips of your hair first, then working your way up gradually to your roots. If you comb straight through from the roots, you'll break your hair.
You can also use your fingers to gently work out tangles. Apply some conditioner and massage the tangles until they come out.

, Straightening, curling, dyeing, or otherwise processing your hair can cause long-term damage, even if you just do it once. If your hair is dry and you're trying to restore its health, you won't see your natural shine and texture return until you give it a break from these damaging treatments. Avoid the following:Using heat styling tools like curling irons, hot rollers, or straighteners (consider options that don't require heat).
Dyeing, bleaching, or highlighting (try a natural alternative).

, Weaves, dreads, and other styles that involve pulling on your hair from the roots are extra damaging for dry hair. Choosing one of these styles could cause breakage or even bald spots to occur. It's best to let your hair be its natural self when you're trying to nurse it back to health.

, Apply a quarter or dime-sized amount of conditioner, depending on the length of your hair. You want to use enough to coat the strands of your hair without weighing it down. Gently massage it through your hair, focusing on the tips, and rinse out with lukewarm or cool water.


If your hair is extremely dry, you might want to consider a leave-in conditioner as well. This will protect your hair from drying out during the day, helping it stay shiny and manageable.
If your hair looks dull and lifeless after conditioning, you might want to switch your conditioner. Look for one made with nourishing natural oils and free of silicones.

, Restoring life to damaged hair may require more than routine conditioning. To get the shine and texture you crave, try using a deep conditioner once a week. You can use a store-bought deep conditioner or try a household oil like coconut oil, almond oil or jojoba oil. To deep condition your hair,Dampen your hair and apply one to two tablespoons of deep conditioner. Make sure it coats every strand of your hair by using a wide-toothed comb or your fingers to pull it through from roots to tips.
Cover your hair with a shower cap or plastic wrap.
Let it sit for at least an hour or overnight.
Shampoo your hair as normal to wash it out. It may require a second shampoo to get rid of all the remaining residue.

, If you want to instantly brighten your hair and reduce frizz, make a quick homemade hair mask you can use right before shampooing. Wet your hair in the shower and apply your mask. At the end of your shower, shampoo it out. Try the following masks:


2 tablespoons honey
One mashed banana or avocado
2 tablespoons plain yogurt
1 beaten egg
A combination of any of the above

, For extra dry hair, applying a finishing oil will keep your hair from getting frizzy and puffy throughout the day. Use a dime-sized amount of finishing oil. Apply it with your fingers, focusing on the tips of your hair and avoiding the roots. Try one of these types of oil:


Argan oil
Olive oil
Coconut oil
Jojoba oil

, While you should avoid using most types of brushes, a boar bristle brush is the one exception. This brush is made with special natural bristles that mimic the texture of your hair. It is used specifically to pull your hair's oils from the scalp all the way down to the tips, without causing any damage. It's a good investment if your hair is bone-dry and you want to pull out all the stops to rejuvenate it. Here's how to use the brush:

, Fried hair is dehydrated so it requires serious moisture. A hair mask contains more moisturizing ingredients than regular conditioners so it can hydrate your hair more effectively. Use the mask after you’ve washed and towel dried your hair, and leave it on for 20 to 30 minutes before rinsing it out with cool water.Look for a hair mask with ingredients that can help damaged hair, such as jojoba oil, argan oil, wheat proteins, and keratin.
Wrapping a warm towel around your head while you have the mask on can help it penetrate your cuticle more easily and allow it to repair your hair more effectively.
If you hair is extremely fried and damaged, you may want to leave the mask on overnight. Wear a shower cap or plastic wrap over the mask so it doesn’t stain your pillowcases or sheets.
It’s usually recommended that you use a mask once a week. If your hair is very damaged, though, you may want to use it twice a week.

, Fried hair can benefit greatly from the use of a hair oil because it helps moisturize your hair in a way that’s similar to its natural oils. Apply four to five drops of oil to your palm and rub it between your hands. Work it through the length of your hair from the ears down while it’s still wet and then style as usual.A variety of oils work well for the hair, such as argan, coconut, jojoba, macadamia, and almond. You can also find serums that contain a blend of two or more oils.
The length, thickness, and amount of damage to your hair will determine how much oil you need. Start with one to two drops and add more if necessary.
You can also apply an oil to the ends of dry, fried hair. Only use one or two drops, though, or your hair may wind up looking greasy.
For severely fried hair, you may want to use a hot oil treatment. Heat the container of oil in a pot of hot water, and saturate all of your hair with it. Place a plastic shower cap or plastic wrap over your head, and allow the oil to sit on your locks for at least 30 minutes. Follow up by shampooing and conditioning your hair normally., When your hair is damaged, washing it too often can strip even more moisture from your locks and make them look worse. Instead of washing everyday, try to shampoo every 2 or 3 days to keep your hair hydrated.Concentrate the shampoo at your scalp when you wash and only work the lather down to the ends to avoid removing too much moisture.
Be sure to choose a moisturizing shampoo with ingredients such as olive or argan oil, or glycerin, sorbitol, or shea butter. Avoid shampoos that contain mineral oil and petrolatum, which can actually form a film that keeps moisture out of your hair., For a fried, damaged hair, a thin, watery conditioner usually isn’t enough to hydrate it. Instead, follow up your shampooing with a deep conditioner for intense hydration. Apply it to your hair and allow it to sit for approximately 10 minutes before washing it out with cool water.Look for a thick formula that comes in a tube or tub with moisturizing ingredients such as butters, oils, ceramides, and glycerin, as well as strengthening ingredients, such as keratin, amino acids, and hydrolyzed proteins.When you apply the deep conditioner, be sure to concentrate on the ends of your hair.
Using a deep conditioner once a week may be sufficient, but if your hair is very dry, you may want to bump it up to twice a week.

, Even if you use a deep conditioner when you wash your hair, your fried tresses may still need more hydration. A leave-in conditioner provides moisture throughout the day because you don’t rinse it out. Apply the leave-in while your hair is still damp and comb it through to ensure that all of the strands are well coated.For severely fried hair, it’s best to use a cream or lotion leave-in formula.

, While heat styling can make your hair look fabulous, it also strips the moisture from your locks. That’s why it’s an especially bad idea when your hair is fried. Try to limit your use of curling irons, flat irons, and even blow dryers as much as possible. Let your hair air dry when you wash it, and play up your hair’s natural texture rather than curling or straightening it.When you do heat style your hair, always use a heat protectant first to limit the damage to your locks. Serum, cream or lotion heat protectant formulas are best for fried, damaged hair.

, When your hair is fried, it’s often the result of bleaching or other coloring treatments. To keep your hair from getting damaged any further, make sure not to color your hair more than every eight weeks.If your roots are starting to show and it hasn’t been eight weeks since your last color treatment, use a root concealing product, such as a spray or powder, instead of dying your hair.

, It’s not just coloring and heat styling that can damage your hair. Sun, salt water, chlorine, and other environmental factors can be a problem for fried hair too. Wear a hat to cover your hair if you’re going to be spending time out in the sun. If you’re going swimming in the ocean or a pool, wet your hair with clean water to prevent it from absorbing the salt water or chlorine, and rinse your locks as soon as you’re done swimming.Some leave-in conditioners and other styling products contain ingredients that contain UV-ray protectants that keep your hair safe from the sun too.
Before you go swimming, it’s also a good idea to apply a leave-in conditioner to your hair to keep it from absorbing damaging chemicals and minerals that might be in the water.

Avoid touching your hair.",How to Wash Frizzy Hair," Shampoos containing sulfate products (specifically sodium lauryl sulfate), are great at removing buildup and cleansing your hair, but they are also extremely drying.To combat frizz, keep your hair as moisturized as possible, and use sulfate-free shampoo options. Sulfate free shampoos can usually be found at most hair salons, but grocery stores and pharmacies have effective options as well.;
, When picking out a shampoo, you should also steer clear of shampoo products that contain alcohol.Just like sodium lauryl sulfate, alcohol dries out you hair which can make it even frizzier when your hair dries.


There are two basic kinds of alcohol in shampoo and conditioning products: short chain alcohols and fatty alcohols.Short chain alcohols are used in shampoos because their low molecular weight allows them to be used as additives in shampoos to help your hair dry faster.Fatty alcohols are usually derived from natural materials, and have higher amounts of carbon, which make them oilier.These fatty alcohols are what help give your hair a smoother quality after using conditioner.
Alcohol in conditioners is usually fine, but avoid shampoos that contain alcohol.

, Conditioners that are packed with protein are incredibly hydrating and can help restore moisture in your hair.Only apply conditioner to the mid-shaft to the ends of your hair; applying conditioner to the top of your head, onto your scalp, can make your head oily and greasy looking.When you apply conditioner while you’re showering, leave it on for approximately 2 to 5 minutes, so your hair can really soak in the nutrients., For super dry and frizzy hair, consider deep conditioning your hair once a week.Simply apply the directed amount of deep conditioner to your hair while in the shower, or after you’re finished showering. Focus on applying the deep conditioner from the mid-shaft of your hair, down to the ends, and allow it to sit for approximately 30 minutes to an hour.After, rinse out the deep conditioner with cool to lukewarm water.


If your hair is less frizzy, you can apply a conditioning mask every couple of weeks, or once a month.
Most deep conditioners contain water, fatty alcohol such as cetearyl, gentle surfactant, humectant like glycerin or natural ones like honey and sugar, emollients such as oils and butters, and hydrolyzed protein. The order of these ingredients may differ from product to product but you should try to use a deep conditioner that contains these ingredients and no more or no less. Sometimes a cheaper brand may contain all of these ingredients and work just as well as a more expensive brand., Hot oil treatments can penetrate your hair shaft, and significantly add moisture to your hair. Apply the oil to clean, lightly dried hair. Cover your hair with a shower cap or some plastic wrap, and apply heat to the oil. You can apply heat by wrapping a warm towel around your head, sitting under the sun, or using your blow dyer.


You can apply hot oil treatments to your hair about once to 3 times a month, depending on how frizzy your hair is.However, overdoing oil treatments can make your hair look greasy.

, Knowing what ingredients enrich, and moisturize your hair and what ingredients dry out your hair is great, but you have to experiment with different kinds of products to see how your hair reacts.You might love the smell of one shampoo, but find that another one gives you the frizz maintenance you’re looking for. It will be a process of trial and error until you find your favorite shampoo, conditioner, and styling products that produce frizz free results for your hair type.


Those with thick, coarse hair should look for products that are advertised as smoothing, hydrating, and moisturizing.Those with fine, frizzy hair should look for products that are advertised as volumizing, and moisturizing., Most people wash their hair too often. Washing too often strips away the natural oils from your hair, which can lead to your strands feeling dry and frizzy.For days that you don’t wash your hair, consider using dry shampoo, or simply rinsing the bottom half of your hair with conditioner.The frequency of your hair washing will depend on your hair type. If you have thick, curly hair that tends to get frizzy, you can likely get away with washing your hair every two days or three days. If you have an oily scalp, thin hair and frizz, you may need to wash your hair with a sulfate-free shampoo once a day or once every other day. If you workout every day, you will likely need to wash your hair afterwards so your hair is not dirty or oily., If your hair is dirty, consider using a small amount of shampoo to gently wash your scalp. The ends of your hair do not need to be dried out more than they already are, so specifically washing your scalp can revive your hair without stripping away more natural oils than necessary.Soak your hair in lukewarm water, and massage the shampoo into your hair and scalp. After about a minute of gently massaging the shampoo throughout your hair, rinse your head. Make sure you move your hair around underneath the water to remove all of the shampoo.


If your hair has a lot of product built up on your strands, consider using a clarifying shampoo to break down and rinse away product residue remaining on your hair., If your frizzy hair gets knotty and tangled when it’s dry, consider combing it out while you’re in the shower and your hair is still wet.When you’re conditioning in the shower, use a wide-toothed comb to brush through, and untangle your hair. Rinse out the conditioner after a few minutes. If your hair is still knotty when your hair dries, gently work through any remaining tangles with your fingers.


Brushing your hair with a brush will almost always make your hair frizzy. Also, brushing your hair with a brush while it’s still wet can cause damage and breakage to your hair.Avoid brushes and use combs whenever possible.

, Rinsing your hair with hot water makes your hair cuticle open up and expand. When your hair cuticles are open, your hair looks frizzy. Rinse your hair with cold water (or as cold as you can stand it), to seal down your hair cuticle and give your hair extra shine., Whether you plan to use a mousse, a shine serum, pomade, or leave in conditioner, apply your hair products while your hair is still wet. That way, your hair can dry with the product in, you’re your hair will have a lower chance of drying with frizz., When you’re getting out of the shower, squeeze your hair to get rid of any excess water. Avoid throwing a terrycloth towel over your head and rubbing your hair dry. This could create more frizz and breakage to your hair. Instead, consider drying your hair with microfiber towels, or simply letting your hair air dry on its own., Plopping your hair consists of using a cotton t-shirt to wrap and dry your hair. Lay a t-shirt on a flat surface, with the neck of the shirt closest to you.Bend over and place your hair in the middle of the shirt, and place the bottom hem of the shirt at the nape of your neck.Tie the shirt sleeve in a knot at the back of your head, and tuck any loose pieces of hair falling out, back into the wrap.
Allow your hair to dry for approximately 10 to 20 minutes, then let your hair air dry, or diffuse with a blow dryer., Adding a diffuser to your blow dryer can still effectively dry your hair without messing up the shape of your curls. Focus your drying efforts toward the roots of your hair, and allow the shafts and ends to dry naturally. Diffusers work well on curly hair and straight hair.Use a cool setting when you’re diffusing your hair. Hot heat can make your hair more susceptible to frizz from humidity., Since your ends are furthest away from your oil-producing scalp, they tend to look, feel, and be the driest parts of your hair. While your hair is still damp, apply a light shine and conditioning serum to your hair’s ends, especially if you plan to use hot tools., Heat from hot tools (dryers, curlers, straighteners, rollers) can damage your hair and make it look even frizzier by drying it out. Try to cut back on using heat on your hair.If you do choose to use hot tools, make sure you shield your hair with a silicone-based heat protectant.

, Blunt haircuts tend to create a lot of volume toward the bottom of your hair, rather than throughout. Instead, consider going for a longer hairstyle with layers starting around your lips. This could prevent your hair from appearing heavy or frizzy, as there will be less weight to your hair.Also, be sure to trim your hair about every 6 to 8 weeks.
A frequent trim will keep the ends of your hair healthy, and prevent the prevalence of split ends.

, Running your hands through your hair and playing with your locks can disturb the way your hair has set, and create more frizz.Touching your hair also transfers oils from your hands to your hair, which can make your hair appear greasier, more quickly.

Set aside plenty of time.,
Address any large problems.,
Soak your locks for 10 minutes.,
Wash the locks with shampoo.,
Work conditioner into each lock.,
Gently pick apart one lock from the bottom.,
Comb out the loosened portion periodically.,
Repeat with the remaining locks.,
Condition your hair.,
Care for your hair well.",How to Undo Locks1," You can “unlock” your dreadlocks without cutting them, but the process will take a long time. Short locks that have only been around for a year or less might come undone within four to eight hours. Longer locks that you've had for multiple years may take 15 to 48 hours., Before removing individual locks and small knots, look for any locks that have joined together and any large matted sections at the root. Gently pull these areas apart using your hands.


Work as close to the scalp as possible while doing this.
If you cannot remove these tangles without severely breaking your hair, it's best to wait until you work on the smaller locks before removing these large knots.

, Fill a sink or basin with warm water and lean back, submerging your locks completely. Let your locks soak for a full 10 minutes.

, Work small amounts of detangling or degreasing shampoo into each section of each lock. Wash each lock with hot water, as well.


The water should be as hot as you can make it without burning yourself.
The hot water and shampoo should help melt any wax and grease that has built up.
Thoroughly rinse the shampoo out of your locks before continuing.

, Apply small amounts of conditioner to each section of each lock. Rub the conditioner into each lock using your fingers.


Do not rinse the conditioner out of your locks at this point.
If necessary, you can wrap your hair in a towel to keep it out of your face until you are ready to continue.

, Use a metal comb to pierce the bottom of the lock and work apart the knots there. Gradually work your way up the entire length of the lock in the same manner.A tail comb is easiest to use. You can use the tip of the tail to pierce the bottom of your lock.
If you're using a regular comb, you will need to work the teeth of the comb into the bottom of the lock.
After inserting the comb into the lock, gently pull it apart using the comb and your fingers. Don't be afraid to apply a significant amount of pressure.
If the locks are too tough to unravel, work more conditioner and warm water into the hair before trying again.

, After you pull apart 1 inch (2.5 cm) or so, comb through the top of the loosened section down to the very bottom.


Repeat this step for every 1 inch (2.5 cm) you unravel.
Removing the tangles and shed hair throughout the unraveling process will lead to fewer problems than waiting until the very end.

, After you unravel one lock, repeat the same process with the remaining locks. Work on each lock one by one until all of them have come undone.


If you have difficulty working the locks apart with a comb, you might find it easier to do so with a metal knitting needle or long sewing needle. When using a needle, slip the point into a loop near the edge of the dread and carefully pull the loop out. Repeat as needed along the length of the lock.

, Apply more conditioner to your hair after unlocking it all. Let the conditioner sit on your hair for five minutes before rinsing it out.


This round of conditioner should help repair some of the damage caused by the picking process.

, Your hair will probably look unhealthy immediately after the removal of your locks, but if you wash and condition it regularly, its condition should improve quickly.


Use a leave-in conditioner each time you wash your hair for the first week or so.
When drying your hair, use a low temperature setting.
Straighten your hair with a flat iron to manage any waves or frizz.

Remove a strand of hair.,





Hold the hair between your thumb and forefinger.,





Pull this curly piece of hair taut.",How to Test Hair for Structural Strength," Take it from the side, just above your ears.
, Using your other hand, run the thumbnail and index finger along the hair quickly. The end result should be spring of curls., Only do this for a few seconds and then release. This is what the test can tell you about your hair:
Hair that springs back to the curly spring is in good to excellent condition
Hair that returns in much larger loops, or barely at all, is in poor condition. In this case, your hair needs conditioning and probably a visit to the hairdresser.

Examine the locks.,
Cut the dreads near the root.,
Wash thoroughly.,
Brush it out.,
Tidy it up.",How to Undo Locks2," The hair closest to your scalp will not be locked yet, so you will need to identify areas of new growth that are still loose.Most of this new, loose growth can be saved when using this method.
Note that older locks tend to be solid closer to the scalp than newer locks.
Also note that this process is the quickest way to remove your locks and will usually take an hour or less.

, Cut the locks off one at a time with sharp barber scissors, snipping just above the solid portion of each lock.


You will likely have between 1 and 2 inches (2.5 and 5 cm) of hair left on your scalp.

, Once you no longer have any solid dreadlock to deal with, wash your remaining hair well with warm water and shampoo. Rinse well to remove any residue.


Apply conditioner to the hair, as well. A deep conditioner can repair damage and make the detangling process more successful.
Washing and conditioning your hair now will make it easier to brush and even it out later, so it is strongly recommended that you do this step before you do any further tidying.
Do not dry your hair at this point. Do so only after your hair has been brushed and trimmed.

, Use a sturdy metal comb to brush out the remaining hair on your scalp, making it as straight as possible.


Don't expect your hair to be completely smooth. Frizz is normal, but you need to brush out as many knots and tangles as possible.

, The remaining hair on your scalp will probably look uneven initially, so you may need to even it out with scissors or clippers.


The easiest thing to do is to shave the scalp clean with clippers, but doing so is not strictly necessary.

Depending on how many locks you have, how old the locks are, and how much of your hair you intend to keep, this process could take anywhere from 2 to 15 hours.

, The exact length is yours to decide, but typically, you should plan on saving at least 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15 cm) to make this method worth the time.


This method works best if you want to keep some of your hair but have locks older than four years. When you've had locks for more than four years, it is best to cut off half of your hair or more before trying to unlock the rest., Use barber scissors to cut each dread one at a time, keeping roughly the same amount of each one intact.

, Fill a bucket or sink with warm water. Sit in front of the water and tip your head back, submerging as many of your locks as possible.


For best results, try to soak your locks for 5 to 10 minutes. Any amount of soaking time is better than none, though.

, Work detangling shampoo into your locks, scrubbing it in thoroughly using your fingers. Use hot water during this process, as well.


The water should be hot, but not hot enough to burn your scalp or fingers.
Washing your hair should help remove some of the build-up that would otherwise interfere with the unlocking process.
Rinse the shampoo out of your locks before continuing.

, Rub a little conditioner or specialized lock removal product into each lock, working with them one by one.


Do not rinse the conditioner out of your hair after applying it.

, Pierce the bottom of the lock with the tail or teeth of a metal comb. Use the comb to pick out loops and tangles within each lock.


Start at the bottom and gradually work your way up the rest of the lock.
Comb out the loosened hair after every 1 inch (2.5 cm) or so.
Repeat this process on each dread, working one at a time, until all the locks have been undone.

, After undoing your locks, apply conditioner to your hair again.


Let it sit for a few minutes before rinsing it out with warm water.
The extra conditioner you apply now should help repair damage to your hair.

, Brush out the loosened hair and carefully trim the ends to balance out the entire style.


Note that it might be easiest to do this while your hair is still wet. Dry your hair after tidying it up, not before.

, Your hair may seem frizzy and unhealthy at first, but if you wash it regularly and apply conditioner after each wash, it should become notably healthier within a week or two.

Increase your iron.,
Eat more walnuts.,
Increase your vitamin C. Vitamin C not only helps your body absorb iron, but it also helps form collagen.,
Incorporate B-vitamins.,
Increase your zinc.,
Boost your protein.,
Be aware that diet may not treat all hair loss.",How to Treat Women's Hair Loss1," Some research suggests that low levels of iron may result in female hair loss.Try to increase your daily iron intake, or go see your physician to see if your iron levels are low.


You may be at a risk of iron deficiency if you’re a vegetarian, have a history of anemia, or have heavy periods.You can increase your iron through food. Lean red meat is a good source of iron. Other meat, like chicken, turkey, and fish, also contains small amounts of iron. Beans, nuts, cereals, and some vegetables like leafy greens also include iron, but the type of iron found in these sources are harder to absorb.You may consider taking an iron supplement. Most multi-vitamins include the recommended daily amount of iron, while a separate iron supplement will have more than your daily amount.
Females need approximately 18 mg of iron each day. If you are pregnant, you need 27 mg.;
, Walnuts contain many nutrients, like omega-6 fatty acids, zinc, iron, B vitamins, and protein. These nutrients contribute to hair health.The oils they contain help promote hair growth.Having proper oils in your body keeps your hair from breaking.
Eat approximately 30 grams of walnuts a day.

, Collagen helps hold in hair follicles, which helps promote healthy hair.Add vitamin C to your diet by eating fruit, like strawberries, pineapple, papayas, guava, and citrus, such as oranges and grapefruit. You can also find it in vegetables, like kale, broccoli, and Brussels sprouts.

, B-vitamins help cells thrive, including cells in the scalp and follicles. With healthy cells, your hair will grow stronger and healthier.B-vitamins are found in salmon, trout, shellfish, lean beef, pork tenderloin, and chicken breast. They're also found in bananas, spinach, turnip greens, soybeans, okra, beets, broccoli, lentils, and black eyed peas. You can also find it in whole-grain breakfast cereals, oatmeal, and low-fat cottage cheese.

, Zinc helps promote hair growth. A zinc deficiency can cause hair loss or reduced growth.You can find zinc in meat, peanut butter, pumpkin seeds, chickpeas, kidney beans, and wheat germ.

, Thinning hair might be due to a protein deficiency. Protein helps your body replace the hair that you lose daily.Eat more chicken, fish, or lean beef. Try a four-ounce serving of chicken with dinner.
You can also get protein from non-meat sources, like chickpeas, quinoa, and lentils.

, Though eating a healthier diet can promote overall health, including hair health, it may not help treat your hair loss. Many things contribute to hair loss, such as aging, genetics, and autoimmune disorders. If your hair loss is due to these factors, instead of malnutrition, diet may not help reduce hair loss."

Reduce your use of styling tools.,
Condition your hair.,
Style your hair to help disguise thinning.,
Consider using hair extensions.,
Buy a wig.,
Try a thickening spray.",How to Treat Women's Hair Loss2," You may be damaging your hair and causing it to thin. Hair dryers, curling irons, hair relaxers, extensions, and getting a perm may cause a type of alopecia. Using gels, oils, and other products may also cause this form of alopecia.Use fewer styling products and use less product in your hair. Limit the amount of heat that you put on your hair. It can damage your hair and cause it to break. Let your hair air dry whenever possible. Reduce how often you dye your hair since that can damage your hair and cause breakage.
If you think this may be the cause of your hair loss, visit your dermatologist. He can recommend medication to help treat this form of alopecia.

, Conditioning your hair regularly helps to repair damage hair, making it fuller. Consider using a deep conditioner every week that contain humectants like panthenol. By massaging the scalp and using the conditioner, you help stimulate circulation, which can help your hair grow.

, There are a few ways the way you wear your hair can make your hair look thicker. Switch your hair's part. If your hair gets used to your normal part, it may start falling flatter on your head. Switch the direction of it to help give your hair some volume.Wear your hair shorter. Shorter hair gives more volume than longer cuts. Longer styles may also separate and reveal bald patches on your scalp.
Get interior layers. If you want longer hair, these layers can help add fullness and disguise bald patches.
Stop wearing your hair in tight ponytails or buns. Instead, let your hair fall loose. Keeping it in tight styles using hair ties, rubber bands, or clips can pull hair from the roots., Since there are limited medical options for hair loss, one way to deal with hair loss is to use fake hair.Hair extensions are generally light and can be a good solution if you have a good amount of hair to attach them to.Many beauty supply stores or online retailers carry hair extensions. You can find high-quality extensions that match your hair and looks natural. You can get a beautician or salon stylist to help you put them in.
Make sure if you use extensions that you don't pull too much on your own hair. Pulling out your hair while putting in extensions will cause more damage.

, If your hair loss gets severe enough that it is making you uncomfortable, invest in a high-quality wig. There are many wig shops and online retailers that sell wigs made from high-quality synthetic hair. You can also buy wigs made from real human hair., Several hair thickening sprays are available to purchase. These sprays temporarily increase the texture and density of your hair, making it appear thicker.This may be effective for small to medium bald spots.

Try a scalp massage.,
Use essential oils.,
Try a laser comb.",How to Treat Women's Hair Loss3," Massaging your scalp can help increase the circulation of blood to the scamp, which may help promote hair growth. Try doing this while you shampoo your hair.Try massaging argan, coconut, almond, or castor oil into your scalp.
Dip your fingertips in oil and rub in small circular motions along your scalp. Do this a few times through., Adding essential oils to your massage may help promote hair growth.

Use minoxidil.,
Try medication.,
Use corticosteroids.,
Consider hair transplants.,
Contact your physician.",How to Treat Women's Hair Loss4," Minoxidil, more commonly known as Rogaine, is the only FDA-approved female hair-loss topical medication. This is the most common treatment for female hair loss. This hair treatment has to be used once a day, and generally takes three to four months to show results, but could take over six months.The treatment comes in either a dropper or a spray pump. You apply the treatment to dry hair and scalp twice a day. The treatment is applied to where the hair is thinning, then you massage it into the scalp with your fingers. Make sure to wash your hands and any places the minoxidil has dripped, like your face. Refrain from shampooing for at least four hours after applying the treatment.
The foam treatment comes in 2% and 5% solutions.
If minoxidil works for you, you will have to continue using it to keep the results.
Minoxidil doesn’t work for all women. It also won’t make all your hair grow back like it was; however, studies have shown it replaces hair in over half the women who used it.Side effects may include scalp itching or a rash, acne on the scalp, inflammation of the scalp, redness, or burning of the scalp. It may also include facial hair growth if left on the face. In rare cases, it may lead to more hair loss., Anti-androgens are a type of medication that block androgen receptors. They might make hair grow or slow the hair loss process. Most physicians will not prescribe medicine to treat hair loss since the evidence that it helps is limited. While medication is not a common treatment, physicians do prescribe it for women who an excess of androgen. Your physician will test your levels to see if your levels are connected to hair loss and require medication.Spironolactone, also known as Aldactone, is one kind of antiandrogen your doctor may prescribe. Tagamet, also known as Cimetidine, may also be prescribed.Finasteride isn’t FDA approved for women, but some doctors may prescribe it for postmenopausal women.
Estrogen and progesterone pills or creams may work to treat hair loss in women who are in menopause.Some of the medications may be combined with an oral contraceptive if the women is at a reproductive age.

, If you suffer from alopecia areata, your doctor may suggest corticosteroids to treat it. This treatment method is generally given through a monthly injection to the scalp. Depending on your condition, your doctor may also prescribe an oral dosage.Side effects of corticosteroids vary from person to person. They range from increased appetite and acne to diabetes and high blood pressure.Talk to your doctor to discuss side effects.

, Hair transplants have been used to treat hair loss since the 1950s. In a hair transplant, a surgeon will take a narrow strip of your scalp and divide it into smaller grafts that contain a few hairs. He will then place the graft into slits in your scalp where hair is missing. The hair will then grow naturally from that spot.After six to nine months after the transplant, most patients see a 60% increase in new hair growth.
Some women experience shock loss after the transplant, which is a temporary hair loss in the transplant area.
Since each woman has a limited amount of hair, there may not be enough hair to fill in larger gaps to its original thickness.
Hair transplants are usually not covered by insurance. They can range from $4,000 to $15,000 dollars.

, Hair loss generally doesn’t indicate a more severe underlying problem; however, if your hair loss includes itching, skin irritation, or any other abnormal symptoms, contact your physician. These additional symptoms may point to an underlying condition.If you experience hair loss without symptoms, you may want to speak to your doctor anyway. Getting a checkup to make sure nothing is wrong is never a bad idea.

Clip in the extensions.,
Trim the extensions if necessary.,
Curl or straighten your hair.,
Use a shine serum.,
Try a thickening spray.",How to Wear Extensions with Short Hair," Shorter extensions usually look more natural, especially if your hair is very short. Aim for extensions that are between 16 and 18 inches (40 to 45 cm). You can look for even shorter extensions if your hair is shorter than chin length.You can cut the extensions on your own or have them cut by a stylist if they are longer than you’d like.;
, This is especially important if you have a blunt haircut. Thin extensions may not blend in if the ends of your hair don’t thin out. Thicker extensions will make the transition look smooth and natural.Compare the extensions to the thickness of your own hair to make sure they are thick enough.

, Wefts are basically the individual clip in sections. You can use several wefts if you are looking for extra volume and length, but one or two wefts should be enough. One 100g (3.5 oz) weft is ideal. This will make styling easier and the possibility of the clips showing less likely., It’s very important to match the extensions to your hair color, or the illusion of longer hair the extensions create won’t be successful. The best way to find extensions that match is to go to a beauty supply store to purchase the extensions rather than purchasing them online. This will give you a chance to put the extensions up against your own hair, check them out in a mirror, and ask for advice.It’s an option to color the hair to match your current hair color.
You can also dye your hair to match your extensions.
You can look for an ombre set of extensions if your ends are a different color than the rest of your hair.

, You can buy either type of hair and look great. Natural hair, however, is probably the way to go if you have the option. It is more expensive, but it will usually look more convincing than natural hair. This is because you can use heat to style natural hair and you can dye it as if it were your own hair., Wash and condition your hair right before you plan to apply the extensions. Oily hair won’t hold the clip in extensions as well as clean hair. This may not be a problem if you have naturally dry hair., Pull up the top half of your hair. It may not be possible to hold it with a hair tie if it is very short, but you can use clips to secure your hair if that’s the case. You will apply the clip in extensions to the divide between your top and bottom half of hair., You can use a backcombing brush or comb to do this. Use the brush or comb to gently tease the hair where you plan to clip in the extensions. This will create a shelf, which makes it easier for the extensions to stay securely clipped in.You will usually secure the extensions on the back of your head if you’re using one weft, but you may also use extensions on the sides of your head if you use multiple wefts.
Spray hairspray on the “shelf” for added grip.

, Grab your extensions and undo the clips. Hold the clips up to the shelf that you created. Make sure that you are satisfied with where they are being clipped in before snapping the clips shut. Look in the mirror once the extensions are clipped in to make sure they smoothly fit in with your natural hair.You can undo and redo the extensions until you are happy with the placement.

, You may find that the extensions are too blunt at the ends to look natural. Trim the ends of the extensions to solve this problem. Vertically hold a pair of scissors made for hair cutting to the ends of extensions. For a natural look, keep the scissors in that vertical position as you cut.It’s also an option to take the extensions to someone that knows how to cut hair if you don’t feel comfortable doing this on your own.

, The texture of the extensions will most likely look at least slightly different than your hair. Blend in the extensions by curling or straightening your hair while wearing the extensions. It does not matter if you decide to use a curling iron or flat iron. Either method will help the extensions look natural., This is an especially good option you have straight, synthetic extensions. Synthetic hair extensions are usually shinier than human hair. Use a shine serum to make your hair as shiny as the extensions. Simply spray it all over your hair and style as usual., You can use this for real or synthetic hair if you want a tousled and wavy look. Thickening spray is a great option for synthetic hair extensions since you usually can’t use heat styling tools. Spray the hair all over your hair and use your fingers to scrunch your hair, including the extensions, into waves."

They can be used to add a level of texture, or naturally blend different levels of your hair. There are generally 25 teeth on this particular type of shear.;
, If you have especially thick hair to cut, these are great. However, they can be difficult to use and leave holes in the cut, so only use them for very thick hair. They can take big chunks out at once (40-80%), and can cut through thicker hair than a standard pair of shears. These even work best with curly hair, which is hard to cut with normal scissors. These shears have about 7-15 teeth on them.

, They remove much less hair than the other two pairs of shears. This is a great pair of shears to go back over your hair after you have already made a pass with the standard shears. They give your hair a softer, lived in look. However, you will have to make more passes with these shears, as they take so little off.

, Most, if not all shears, are stainless steel. However, shears with an adjustable screw can make all the difference in the world. If you find that the tension is off, then the screw allows you to adjust it.

, Make sure your hair has been freshly washed and is still damp. Then, use a comb and pass it through your hair a few times. Run your hand through your hair when you are done combing. Check for any knots or bulges. Try and shake them loose, then pass your brush/comb through the area again., This section of hair should be from the front of your face. Each section is usually around ½” thick. Pull the strands out, away from your body, and hold the ends in between your fingers with one hand. You will want to hold your hand about 2-3 inches away from the ends of your hair., Take the shears to the outer section of the hair and cut the hair diagonally about one inch inward from the outer tips. If you want to you can flip the shears around and cut at the same spot, but with the shears facing the opposite direction., This should be immediately behind the first section you just finished thinning out. Pull the hair outward and hold the section of hair in between your fingers. Take the thinning shears and cut through the section of hair, starting one inch away from the tips. Once more, you can flip the shears around and cut in the same spot for added thinning/shaping., Make sure that you get all of your ends. To ensure you get all of them, you can do some minor overlapping cuts. You can take a few hairs from a previously thinned section, and add them to the section you are about to thin. This will virtually guarantee that you snip all of the ends. Feel free to go back, and cut again if you feel as if they are misshapen, or still too bulky, but be careful not to cut too much.

, You can either take a towel, or run through the ends with your hands. You want to make sure you loosen your hair, and let the trimmed hair fall to the ground. This would also be a great time to wash or rinse your hair, and clean the snipped hair out.

, If you have just stepped out of the shower, or been outside in the rain, it is critical that you dry your hair off. Use a towel, and run through your hair. You can also use a blow dryer if your hair is really soaking wet. This is because thinning shears have a difficult time cutting through wet hair, which can make a person's head look very bad as a result.

, You can use a brush if your hair is thick, or a comb if your hair is thin. Make at least 20-30 passes through, depending on the treatment of your hair, and its texture. After you are done, run your hands through your hair to see if there are any knots. If there are, try to take a few more passes with the comb/brush.If you have curly hair, you might want to consider straightening your hair. Otherwise, the thinning shears might cut your hair unevenly.

, Each section should be about 3 inches, or 76 mm, wide. Simply grab an estimated length of hair and hold it with your hand. You can attach the hair clip against the hair bundle, or around it, as long as it remains contained and separated. Depending on the thickness of your hair, you may need to add more hair clips., The first one you remove should be in the front part of the head. Comb through that section of loose hair and straighten it out some more. Then gently pull the comb towards the end of your hair, but not all the way. Hold your hair high in the air, with the comb still attached at the end.

, About halfway down the strand, cut that section of hair with the thinning shears. The tips of the scissors should be pointing upward towards the ceiling. Then flip the scissors around and cut at the same point, with the tips of the scissors pointing downward. This will complete the thinning for this section of hair. You can now release the shears and place them on a nearby table., Go back through the sheared section, and comb through. This will release the cut hair, and get it out of the way. If some hair seems to be stuck, run your fingers through it slightly to loosen them. Otherwise, you can wait until it is over to clean your hair in the shower., Each time you complete a section of hair, allow it to fall with the rest of the hair that has already been thinned out. Remember to do both an upward and downward cut for each section. It is better to follow clockwise, or counterclockwise. Do not do random sections, otherwise it might end up looking unnatural., Depending on the thickness of your hair, you may need to go back around with the thinning shears and thin more hair. This time do not cut at the same spot. Instead, do one more angular cut and then comb your hair and check it.

Wear layered bangs for a wider face shape.,
Match your hair color with the bangs.,
Choose the right bangs for your hair texture.,
Decide between real or synthetic hair.",How to Use Clip‐In Bangs1," Straight-across bangs may bring back nightmares of bad childhood haircuts, but that isn’t an issue with clip-in bangs! Just about anyone can rock blunt bangs, but they work especially well on narrow faces. Look for blunt bangs that fall just above your eyebrows to widen your features.If you can’t find blunt bangs that fall just above your eyebrows, you can take a chance and cut them to the right length. At least you don’t have to go through the awkward growing out process if you mess them up!;
, Long and layered or textured bangs are a solid choice for someone with a wider face. Look for layered bangs that have sides that fall to your striking cheekbones. This type of bangs will accentuate your already lovely features and make them appear narrower. Consider this contouring without the effort of actually using makeup., Finding the right color bangs is a really important part of creating the (very convincing) illusion that you’ve grown them overnight. Typically, bangs come in about eleven shades. Yeah, that may not seem like a lot, but you should be able to find a close match—unless you have an unusual or unnatural hair color. If your bangs are made of human hair, you could dye them to match your current hair color. Purple bangs would make purple hair look even more magical.
It’s also an option to dye your hair to match your bangs if you think you will be wearing them often. For instance, if you’ve always dreamed of being a blonde, but aren’t sure you could work it, buy blonde bangs. Hold them up your face and learn if it’s a total mistake before making the jump.

, Not everyone, of course, has the same hair texture, so you need to consider what type of bangs would best match the texture of your hair. Soft and wispy bangs are the perfect choice for curly hair because they wouldn’t take away from your natural, bouncing curls. Arched or mini bangs are a great choice for those with straight hair because it gives you an easy-to-achieve look for hair that can often be hard to style., It won’t make-or-break your look if you choose one over the other. Human and synthetic hair both have their advantages and disadvantages. For example, human hair is usually easier to style and can be used with heated styling tools. On the down side, it needs to be styled often. Synthetic hair won’t get as frizzy and will maintain a style, but it may not look as natural. Just make sure the synthetic hair doesn’t look extremely fake before purchasing it."

Part your hair down the center.,
Apply a dry shampoo.,
Place the bangs near the crown of your head.,
Clip in the bangs.",How to Use Clip‐In Bangs2," Use a comb to part your hair down the center. Don’t worry if you usually hate that kind of part—bangs will totally transform the look. Clip-in bangs look the best this way, but the center part has a purpose. The center part keeps your hair out of the way (easy fix for annoying hair in the face!) and allows the bangs to lay flat against your head.







, This step isn’t absolutely necessary, but it definitely does help. Spray your hair with a dry shampoo or holding spray. This will help the bangs be more secure when it comes time to attach them to your hair. Then, spray the dry shampoo directly on the bangs. New clip-in bangs can sometimes appear unnaturally shiny, so the dry shampoo dulls them just enough to appear natural. 








Don’t worry about buying dry shampoo if you don’t have it. You’ll look just as awesome without the help of it.
Look for a good-smelling dry shampoo so you don’t have to hold your nose as you spray.

, Applying the bangs too far back on your head or too close to your hairline can ruin the illusion, even if you chose the right bangs. You may feel like Goldilocks as you play around trying to figure out what is “just right” for you. About one inch (2.5 cm) back from your hairline is a good spot to place the bangs.








One inch back is recommended, but really, you should just use your judgment to see what make you immediately want to snap a selfie to show them off.

, Make sure that you feel fierce and confident with the look of the bangs before securing them. First, secure the fastener in the middle of the bangs to your hair. Then, secure the clips on each side of your head. Do a little dance to make sure that they won’t be coming off anytime soon.








Cover the clips with your hair so that they don’t show and expose your stylish secret to the world.

Trim the bangs vertically instead of horizontally so that they maintain a natural texture.

, If your bangs are still looking unnatural, you can use styling tools to fix that problem. For extra volume, use a curling iron. Use a straightener to smooth out the bangs, especially the bulge that may appear at the top of your bangs. , How often you wash the bangs depends on how much you wear them. You may want to wash them once a week or once a month. Basically, if you wouldn’t go out in public with your hair looking that dirty or messy, it’s time to give them some love.

To help you focus on one section at a time, leave any sections you're not currently flat ironing clipped or tied up., Once you're ready, start with the first section. Take a one-inch strand of hair from this section and use your flat iron to create a wave.


Place the flat iron near your scalp and clamp down on a lock of hair. Bend the iron away from your face. Move the iron downward.Stop when about three quarters of the way down the lock.

Give a spray of hair spray, and you're finished!

",How to Use Hair Straighteners on Short Hair," Use a shampoo designed for straight hair and a conditioner too, as this will protect your hair from heat and keep it shiny. It also slightly weighs down the hair, preventing it from curling as much.;
, This stops your hair breaking as much; a good method is to gently pat the lengths and ends of hair.

, This straightens your hair and the comb prevents breakage usually caused on wet hair by a bristle brush.

, This focuses the air flow and when teamed up with brushing, can give a straight blow dry.

, For volume, brush hair towards the ceiling and aim the air flow at the brush, or hang your hair upside down and aim your dryer at it, whilst brushing. Depending on hair length, you may want a different look. You can achieve a straight 'do with curled under ends with a round brush. Position the brush under the hair (roughly a two inch wide strip) and brush outwards, then once you reach the ends, keep curling it in towards you (all the while focusing the air flow onto the part of the hair in the brush)

, This step is only required if the blow drying did not straighten as desired.

, Hold the ends of your hair towards the ceiling and clamp with the straighteners. Depending on the style of hair, the top layer may only be required(and the only layer safely possible!)

, Clip top layers up and work from the bottom, curling under if that is the look you want (as short hair tends to flick out if it rests on your shoulders). To avoid too much flicking out if you want a poker straight look, straighten hair upside down and keep brushing out until it cools, otherwise when you stand up again it will cool to the shape of your shoulders.

Wrap your hair around the roller.,
Place the matching cap onto the steamer for 3 to 5 seconds.,
Place the cap over the roller.,
Continue curling your hair.,
Leave the rollers in your hair for 20 minutes.,
Gently remove the rollers.,
Loosen the curls with your fingers.,
Apply your favorite finishing product.,
Take care of your curls.",How to Use Steam Rollers for Hair," You can curl your hair just after you washed it, but it needs to be perfectly dry.Steam rollers will work the best on straight hair, but you can try using them to define curly or wavy hair. If you have natural or kinky hair, however, you will need to start with a blow-out., Even though steam rollers are much gentler on your hair than regular hot rollers, they still use some heat. Apply your favorite heat protectant evenly throughout your hair. If you need to, use a comb to help distribute it.

, Fill the tank with cool to room-temperature water up to fill line and replace the lid. Set it down on a stable surface and plug it in. Turn the tank on and wait for the steam to form. It will take about 1 minute before you start seeing steam come out of the lid.


How much water you use depends on the size of the tank.

, Wait 3 to 5 seconds for it to soak up the steam. Some manufacturers may recommend up to 7 seconds. It's okay if you go over that time, but be aware that it may take longer for your hair to dry.If you have natural or kinky hair, choose the largest roller and leave it on for 30 seconds. This ensures that it is saturated enough for your hair type., Grab a 1 to 2-inch (2.54 to 5.08-centimeter) wide, horizontal section of hair. If you are using a smaller hair roller, can use a 1-inch (2.54-centimeter) section of hair.If your hair is natural or kinky, take a 1-inch (2.54-centimeter) section and smooth your hair with a comb., Place the roller under the strand of hair, about halfway down. Wrap your hair around the roller, finishing off with the ends. Next, roll the roller downwards, towards your scalp., This will help make the cap more pliable. It will also help set the style further.Hold the roller in place while you wait for the cap to steam.


If your hair is natural or kinky, leave the cap on for 10 seconds., This will secure the roller to your head and keep it from moving. You are now ready to move onto the next roller and section of hair.

, Work your way from the top of your head towards the nap of your neck, then down the sides. Use neat, even rows. You can use the same size of rollers, or you can play around with different sizes. Be sure to use smaller sections of hair for the smaller rollers.The smaller rollers will give you tighter curls while the larger ones will give you loose waves and lots of volume.For natural or kinky hair, continue to use the largest roller size in the kit. If you use the smaller rollers, your hair will turn out too frizzy., If you can't wait that long, you can blow dry your hair using a cold setting for about 1 minute. Your hair must be completely dry and cool before you move on, otherwise the curls may come out. Keep in mind that the longer you leave the rollers in, the tighter the curls will be.For natural or kinky hair, let the rollers sit for 2 hours. You can use a hooded dryer for 20 minutes to speed up the process., Begin by pulling off the clamp. Unroll your hair to loosen it. Once it is completely loose, you can pull the roller out, and let the strand of hair fall naturally., Do not brush or comb your hair.If you do, the curls may come out entirely or turn frizzy. The more you run your fingers through the curls, the fluffier and looser they will turn.

, Great choices include shine sprays, serums, and creams. Gently scrunch your curls in an upward motion while applying the product. This will help further define them. Set the style with hairspray, if needed.Apply a shine/smoothing serum to the ends of your hair., Gently comb through them with your fingers to detangle them. Your curls should last a few days; if you wash your hair that day, however, the curls will come out. Keep in mind that if you have natural or kinky hair, the curls may not last as long."

Create longer, tighter curls.,
Create bigger curls.,
Add a gentle bounce.",How to Wave Your Hair With a Flat Iron2," If you want a slightly curlier wave, you can use your flat iron to create this effect. It's similar to the above process. However, you hold the flat iron at a vertical angle and curl all the way down your locks.


Bend the hair vertically as you iron. Place about a one inch section of hair in the flat iron, starting near your scalp. Keep your iron in a vertical position and bend it towards you. Glide the flat iron downward through your hair until you reach the end of the lock.Repeat until all your hair is curled.Use force when pulling your hair downward. You should not feel pain but you should be able to feel a slight tugging at your scalp. This can help your hair curl effectively the first time around.

, If the above method makes your hair look more curly than wavy, you can try making the curls bigger. This effect can easily be achieved with a flat iron.


Work in two-inch sections of hair. Clamp the flat iron down near your scalp. Twist the flat iron 90 degrees. You can twist the iron either towards your face or away from your face. Both methods are effective.Glide the iron down through your hair until you reach the end of the strand of hair. It's a similar process to curling a ribbon with a pair of scissors. Repeat this process, working with two-inch strands of hair, until all your hair is curled., If you want hair with only a slight wave, you can add a gentle bounce to the ends of your locks. Separate your hair into sections and work with locks 1 to 2 inches in width. Take a lock and place the flat iron three inches from the end of your hair. Then, flip it up about 90 degrees. Pull it down gently, creating a nice wave. Repeat with the remaining sections."
"
Apply an anti-frizz product.,
Use heat protectant.,
Go for a lower heat setting.,
Make sure your hair is dry.",How to Wave Your Hair With a Flat Iron3," Once you're finished with any of the above methods, you should apply an anti-frizz product to your hair. A flat iron can dry out hair slightly, resulting in a frizzy effect. You usually only need to use a small drop of an anti-frizz product. You work it through your hair from the roots to the tips. However, check the directions on your specific product just to be sure there are no special rules or considerations with the brand you're using., The heat from a flat iron can be very hard on your hair. You'll need to buy some kind of heat protectant at your salon. These products create a protective barrier around your hair, guarding it from some of the heat.You only need to use a small amount of a heat protectant for it to work. Therefore, it might be best to invest in a more expensive, higher quality product. It will last awhile and can serve to keep your hair safe from heat damage.

, Cranking your flat iron up to the highest heat setting can damage your hair. You should stay in the 300 degree range when using a flat iron on your hair. This should be hot enough to effectively curl your hair without causing damage.If you have a flat iron with only two heat settings, high and low, you may actually want to use the higher setting in this case. A low heat setting means styling may be ineffective and you'll have to go over your hair again and again. This can cause damage., If you hear a sizzle when using your flat iron, stop. Your hair is not dry yet. Using a flat iron on wet hair can damage both your flat iron and your hair. If your hair starts sizzling as you use your flat iron, turn the iron off and wait a half hour or so. Run your hands through your hair to make sure its dry before attempting to flat iron again."

Repeat on the other side with the other braid. You should end up with something that looks like a head band.


Be sure to tuck the ends of your braids under your braided ""headband.""
If you have very long hair, you may have to wrap the braid around to the side or back of your head.

, Pull your hair into a mid-high ponytail on the back of your head, and secure it with a hair tie. Gather a small section of hair from the ponytail, and braid it. Wrap the braid around the base of the ponytail to conceal the hair tie. Secure it with a bobby pin.Give your ponytail more body by spraying it with a texture spray.

, Part your hair down the center. Starting near your left temple and finishing at the nape of your neck, Dutch braid the left side of your hair. Repeat the process for the right. Pull the rest of your hair into a low ponytail at the nape of your neck, then twist it into a bun. Secure the bun with a hair tie and some bobby pins., Start by creating a side part above your left or right eyebrow. Pull your hair towards the opposite shoulder, and start making a loose braid. You can do a standard braid or a French braid. Tie the braid off with a hair tie.Here are some ideas on how you can style your braid further:


For a messy look, pull out a few strands around your temples, and gently loosen the braid with your fingers.
For a sleeker look, use bobby pins and/or hairspray to secure any loose strands.
For a boho look, try on a delicate flower crown—nothing too full or fancy.
For something more elegant, add a fancy hair clip to the bottom of your braid to hide the hair tie.

, All of these styles are quick and easy to do, and will go a great job of hiding your dirty, greasy hair. You may want to dust some dry shampoo onto your roots to further conceal any grease, however.

Keep your hair back with some boho braids.,
Try a faux-hawk for a trendy, chick look.,
Hide greasy tresses with a scarf.,
Wear a trendy hat for something quick and easy.",How to Wear Dirty Hair3," Dirty hair is the best for creating beach waves because it holds the style so well. Start by dividing your hair into three sections: left side, right side, and back. Take a clump of hair from the left section, and wrap it around a curling iron. Hold it for a few seconds, then left go and move on to the next clump of hair. When you are done with the left section, move on to the right, and then finally to the back. Finish off with some sea salt spray, if desired.Set your curling iron to medium heat to prevent any damage.
Use a heat protectant spray to prevent heat damage.
Don't use the clamp on your curing iron. This will help create that wavy look.

, Take a 1-inch (2.54-centimeter) wide section of hair from your left temple, and plait it into a loose braid. Repeat the process with the hair on your right temple. Pull both braids towards the back of your hair, smoothing down the rest of your hair as you do so. Pin them in place at the nape of your neck with some bobby pins or a hair clip.If your hair is too short, you can pin the braids at the back of your head instead.

, This style is perfect for those with very curly or African-American textured hair; your hair should be long enough to pull back into a ponytail. Start by creating a side part above your left eyebrow, then section it off with a long hair clip. Repeat on the right side, just above your right eyebrow. Next, comb the rest of your hair back and up using a boar bristle brush. Pull the hair back using a banana clip that matches your hair color; position the clip at the nape of your neck. Finally, use your fingers and bobby pins to shape and secure your faux-hawk.The two hair clips at the top of your head should be touching in the center.
The longer hair clip you use, the better. It should at least reach to the top-middle of your head.
Set your look with hairspray.
If your hair is too sleek, try a texturizing spray or mousse on it first.

, This style works for just about any length of hair. Get a long, skinny, fabric scarf and wrap it around your head; make sure that the scarf goes under your hair. Tie the ends of the scarf into a tight, double-knot, then move the knot towards the nape of your neck.


For a trendy look, drape the ends of the scarf over your shoulder.
Can't find a long, skinny, fabric scarf? Get a square one instead, and fold it diagonally until it is the right thickness.
You can scrunch the scarf up so that it is more like a headband, or you can left it drape over the back of your head.
Match the color and pattern of the scarf to your outfit.

, A hat works for just about any length of hair. It works especially well for hair that is too short to pull back into fancy braids or ponytails. Simply pick out a hat that matches your outfit, and pop it on. You can also wear a hat with other hair styles as well, such as low ponytails or braids.

You do not need to condition, but it may help eliminate any tangles.
Rinse your hair until no residual bubbles or soap are present in the run-off. The water flowing from your scalp should be clean and clear.
Hair that is dirty may need to be washed twice.;
, Do not dry entirely, but instead, allow your hair to remain damp. This will make it more manageable.









A spray bottle filled with water can be used to moisten the hair as it dries.

, This will catch any drips and will also keep the hair from falling down your shirt as you trim. It will also make cleaning-up afterward easier.









A towel or tarp can also be placed on the ground to catch the hair as it falls.

, Be sure to remove any tangles or knots.









It may help to re-moisten your hair.

, Using a fine or large tooth comb, begin at your forehead and end at the base of your neck. Once your hair is slicked back it will be easier to make clean, perfectly straight parts.









Clean parts are crucial to making proper sections of your hair.

, Starting immediately behind your left ear, draw the comb across the top of the scalp using the tip or edge of the comb. Stop when you reach the same position behind your right ear.









Everything in front of the part will be considered the front section. Hold the comb at an angle like you would a knife.
Depending on your own hair type and thickness, you may want to use a larger-tooth comb.

, Remember, a clean part is the key to getting even sections, which will result in a more even trim.








, Use ties or bands to form pony tails that draw the hair away from the back of your head.









Clips will work better for shorter hair.

, Placing the tip of the comb at approximately the same position you did for the first part, draw a line around the back of your scalp that is parallel to the ground. End just behind your opposite ear.









Hair above this part is considered the top, while the hair that falls below is referred to as the bottom., Use ties or clips as needed.









Do not section the bottom.

, Be sure to select hair from the bottom section and on one-side of the scalp or the other, but not the middle. This will be your guide cut.








In this case, your freehand will be the hand that you will not be using to hold the sheers or scissors.
You will be doing this repeatedly, so be sure to maintain consistency with each pinch.

, Be sure to work-out any knots or tangles and repeat as necessary.








It might help to re-moisten your hair.
Depending on your hair type, a brush might work better to remove knots and tangles.

, This time, as you run the comb the length of your hair follow it with your pinched fingers.Leave approximately a quarter-inch of a gap between your fingers and the comb and be sure to maintain a consistent pinch.









Pinch too loosely and the hair will not sit right and will result in an uneven trim.
Pinch too tightly and it will be difficult and painful to slide your fingers down your hair.
Do not use a brush for this step.

, If you have managed to hold your fingers properly throughout the comb--and the slide--you will be able to see uneven growth at the ends.









Practice this over-and-over and be sure to maintain consistent motions.
The more consistent you can be with this, the more consistent your trim will be.

, Using clean, sharp, salon quality scissors or sheers, even out the ends of your hair by making a cut that is parallel to your pinched fingers.









The amount of hair trimmed is up to you.
Standing in front of a mirror helps when you are trimming your own hair. It can, however, be quite difficult getting used to working with your mirror image.

, This portion should be immediately next to the portion of hair that you just worked with and should include about 25-percent of the hair that you just trimmed.









Once this portion is combed straight, you should be able to see a sharp difference between the hair that has been trimmed and the hair that has not.

, Make sure to use the exact same scissor-pinch motion.









You should be able to see a sharp contrast between trimmed and non-trimmed hairs.

, Extend the straight-edge line you created with your guide cut by trimming the overgrown hairs.









Take a few deep breaths to steady your hand if needed.

, Repeat steps one through five as needed.








, Once you have completed the bottom-section of your hair, you can now move on to the top, and later, the front. Repeat steps one through five for each portion of hair, in each section until you are finished.

Ask your stylist to re perm your hair at a later date or give you a new haircut.,
Apply a canola oil treatment.,
Make a coconut oil mask.,
Trim the ends of your permed hair or the fishtail.",How to Rid Yourself of a Bad Perm," A deep conditioner will hydrate your permed hair, decrease frizziness, and make the perm look a bit better., If you’re looking to try to restyle the perm by straightening it, it’s important to first deep condition your hair really well before applying any more heat to your hair. Do this the day before you plan to straighten your hair. You should also condition your hair every day to restore moisture and reclose the all important cuticle layer of your hair.Wet your hair and towel dry it. Then, apply the waving lotion (or perming solution) to the wet hair and comb through it using a wide tooth comb. Do this over a tub or sink.
Have a friend assist you if your hair is too long or you may miss any spots. You want to be sure your hair is completely saturated with the waving lotion.
Continue combing your hair with the waving lotion for 10 minutes. You should start to notice the curls have relaxed and the hair hangs straight. If this isn’t happening, continue combing your hair with waving lotion for another 5 minutes until the curls relax.
Rinse the waving lotion from your hair using warm water for at least 3 minutes to ensure you get all the lotion out of your hair.
Once rinsed, use a towel to gently blot water from your hair, but do not rub the hair with the towel as this will create more frizz.
Apply the neutralizer to your hair and comb it through the exact same way you did with the waving lotion, for up to 5 minutes.
Rinse the neutralizer from your hair with warm water for 5 minutes. Finish rinsing with cool water, as the cool water helps to close the cuticle layer. Apply deep conditioner to your hair to prevent tangles.
Use a clean towel to gently blot away any excess water, avoid rubbing your hair to dry it. Allow your hair to finish drying naturally or use a blow dryer with a diffuser at the lowest heat setting. Use a vented brush to control the hair and keep it smooth.

, Do not get your hair re permed until at least several weeks after the first perm, as you do not want to damage your hair any further.Your stylist may be able to come up with another, more practical solution: a new, shorter hair cut. A major hair cut could be the only want to really solve the bad perm, as it allows you to remove the damaged hair completely., Using this treatment should loosen the perm to make it more manageable to re style, but you may need to repeat the treatment for a few weeks to really see results if your perm is acting stubborn and will not relax after one treatment.Gather together your materials, including a bottle of canola oil, a roll of plastic wrap, a towel, a gentle shampoo, a deep conditioner, a blow dryer with a diffuser, and styling shears.
Place your head over a garbage can, a sink or a tub, and apply enough canola oil to thoroughly soak your hair from root to tip.
Wrap your head with the plastic wrap or with a plastic bag. Then, wrap the plastic with a towel so it will retain head and prevent any oil from dripping off your hair.
Leave the oil in your hair for 1-2 hours. Then, rinse your hair completely in the shower. Use the gentle shampoo to loosen the oil from your hair.
Make sure you also lather your hair with conditioner and let it sit for at least 2 minutes, then rinse and repeat until all the oil is gone.
Follow this regime for at least a week.

, Coconut oil is one of the only oils that will penetrate the hair shaft, as opposed to just coat it. So it will effectively moisturize, condition, and repair damaged hair from the inside out.Melt 1 cup of organic virgin coconut oil. You can use a microwave (but be sure to put the coconut oil in a microwave safe bowl) or you are melt the oil on a stovetop by placing the oil in a jar and then in a pot filled halfway with water. Heat the pot on the stovetop until the oil melts in the jar.
Add ½ teaspoon of essential oils that are good for dry, damaged hair, like Bay, Cedarwood, Chamomile, Clary Sage, Eucalyptus, Frankincense, Lavender, Lemon, Myrrh, Rose, Sage, Sandalwood, and Tea Tree.
Use your fingers to melt several tablespoons of the infused coconut oil and then apply it to your dry hair. Comb it through.
Wrap your head in a towel or a shower cap. Leave the oil in for at least 1-2 hours.
Wash the oil out with shampoo and conditioner.

, Many bad perms are the result of improper application of the perm rod. If you have extremely straight or coarse hair, your hair may not wind around the rod properly. This can then lead to fishtails at the ends of your hair. But you can fix the fishtail with a little persistence and a pair of styling shears.When trimming the end of the fishtail, only make the cut on the straight part of the hair. You do not want the cut to interfere with the curl pattern at all.
Cut your fishtailed ends three days after the perm to prevent any further damage to your hair.Minor trimming can be done at home on your own or your stylist could also trim the fishtailed ends for you.

When you're ready to restore your hair, it'll be very difficult to do so unless you stop all treatments and let your hair return to its natural state. If you're used to relying on treatments to make your hair look the way you want it to, you may want to choose a few treatments that are the most important to you and stop using all of the rest. Here's what to avoid:


Chemical hair dyes, either professional or from a box. If you love dyeing your hair, try a natural dye such as tea, which might actually help to restore your hair instead of damaging it.
Bleaching your hair is never good for it. Stripping out the color in your hair does a lot of damage to the shaft, and can cause your hair to get brittle and break.
Chemical straightening or curling, like a Brazilian blowout, relaxers, or a permanent. The chemicals that force straight hair to be curly or curly hair to be straight and sleek do a lot of damage to your hair.;
, Hair is a fragile material that needs to be handled with care, especially when it's wet. Wet hair stretches and breaks easily, so it's important to be gentle when you're washing and toweling your hair dry. Think of your hair as though it's a silk dress or a fine wool sweater. You wouldn't roughly scrub it, wring it out rub it dry with a towel, right? Just like special fabrics, your hair should be handled with care.


When you wash your hair, massage your scalp with your fingertips and gently pull the shampoo through your hair, rather than rubbing it vigorously. Do the same with conditioner.
Let your hair drip dry for a few moments before gently squeezing out the excess water. Use a towel to pat your hair dry.

, The scalp produces a natural oil called sebum that protects the hair from drying out. When you wash your hair too often, you wash away this oil before it has the chance to travel down the length of your hair and provide protection. Washing your hair just a few times a week will help your hair stay shiny and healthy.


When you first stop washing your hair every day, your scalp will overproduce sebum, since it's used to your routine of washing it away every 24 hours. After a week or so things will balance out and your hair will no longer look greasy right away. If you have oily hair or skin, this process can take up to three or four months.
If you're concerned about your roots looking greasy on the days in between washings, use dry shampoo to clean things up. You can buy a bottle of dry shampoo or making your own by simply mixing 1 tablespoon of cornstarch and 1/2 tablespoon of baking soda. Sprinkle it onto the greasy areas, let it sit for five minutes, then comb it out.

, This is a difficult rule to follow for people who are used to using hair dryers and other heat styling tools to create the perfect look every day. When your goal is to restore your hair to good health, using heat is like taking a step backward, every time. Start letting your hair air dry, and try to embrace your natural look to give your hair the chance to heal.


Try putting in your styling products or combing your hair before you let it air dry. You can even shape it into the desired look before it dries to help with styling it.
If you feel you really must use heat styling tools, use them on a low setting, and save it for special occasions. You can purchase a thermal protector, which often comes as a cream or spray, to apply to your hair before you use heat.
Since your hair might take awhile to be completely restored, it may not look the way you want it to at first. You might be tempted to iron out those frizzy curls or bring some life to limp, dry locks. It's worth it to hold out until your hair is healthy; you'll see the texture improve immensely if you're patient.

, Brushing with a plastic-bristled brush is very damaging to hair, especially when you try to brush through tangles. You end up pulling out hairs and breaking them off mid-shaft. To detangle hair, use a wide-toothed comb instead of a brush. Gently work it through your hair, starting near the tips and gradually working up toward the roots until you're able to move the comb through your hair without catching on a tangle.


It's especially important not to brush your hair when it's wet, since your hair is so much more fragile wet than it is dry. If you use a brush on wet hair you'll end up with breakage and frayed ends.

, Certain styles pull on the hair and cause it to fray or break. Hair extensions and weaves are particularly bad for the hair. Whether they're sewn in or glued to your hair, they inevitable result in damage (and in worst-case scenarios, bald spots). When you're working to restore your hair to health, it's best to completely avoid styles that are hard on the hair.

, Shampoo is designed to cleanse your hair, and conditioner to keep it hydrated, supple and shiny. When you condition your hair, place a dime or quarter-sized amount of conditioner in your palms. apply it at the ends of your hair, and use your fingers to work it up the length of your hair towards your roots. Focus on making sure the tips get special treatment, since they dry out much more quickly than your roots. Rinse your hair thoroughly when you're finished.


Don't use more conditioner than you need to coat your hair lightly. Too much will weigh your hair down and make it look greasy. If your ends are extremely dry, you can add a little more to that area, however.
For an extra glossy finish, rinse your hair using the coldest water you can stand. This will cause your hair shaft to lay flat and appear smoother and shinier than if you use hot water.

, Deep conditioning treatments are designed to penetrate your hair to keep it hydrated all week long. Apply a tablespoon or so of deep conditioner to your hair and comb it through. Start about one inch from the roots and work it down to the tips. Then pile your hair on top of your head and secure it with a clip, and cover it with a shower cap. Wait at least an hour before shampooing it out of your hair.


You can buy deep conditioning treatments from the store, or simply use a household item like coconut oil, almond oil or olive oil.
Don't deep condition more than once a week, since doing it too often can actually damage your hair.

, On days when your hair looks limp, dull, or frizzy, a hair mask can restore its nice texture and shine. Apply a hair mask after you wet your hair in the shower, and shampoo it out at the end of your shower. Here are common household items that do wonders for damaged hair:


For dull hair: use a tablespoon of honey or one egg white
For frizzy hair: use one blended banana or avocado
For dry hair: use a tablespoon of milk or yogurt
For combination hair: use a combination of any of the above ingredients

, After your hair is dry, hair oil or serum serves to keep it from frizzing and protect it from the elements. Look for an anti-frizz serum or combination hair oil, and use your fingers to comb just a few drops through your hair. If you don't want to buy a special serum, use a little of one of the following oils:


Argan oil
Moroccan oil
Jojoba oil
Egg oil

, While most brushes are damaging to hair, boar bristle brushes are the one exception. The brushes are made with natural fibers that closely emulate the texture of human hair. They are designed to pull sebum from the roots of your hair to the tips, so that the full length of your hair receives the nourishing benefits of your scalp's natural oils.


First use a wide-tooth comb to detangle your hair, then brush your hair from roots to tips with a boar bristle brush. Your hair will be smooth and shiny when you're finished.
Plastic brushes do not provide this benefit.

, Massage promotes good circulation in the scalp, which helps your hair grown in healthy and strong. Make a habit of massaging your scalp every day. Place your fingers on your scalp and rub it using a gentle circular motion. This has the added benefit of helping to reduce stress and calm headaches.


Oil massages are even more helpful. Use coconut oil, almond oil, jojoba oil or olive oil to gently massage your head in the shower, then shampoo your hair when you're finished.
Some essential oils are said to help with hair growth. Try massaging with tea tree oil, egg oil, lavender or cedar wood oil.

, Ingredients in your shampoo and conditioner may be making your hair damage worse instead of better. Switch to all-natural shampoos and conditioners that nourish your hair instead of harshly cleansing it and weighing it down with unnecessary chemicals. Here's what to look out for:


Get a sulfate-free shampoo. Sulfates are harsh cleansers used in everything from dish soap to laundry detergent, and they're too hard on damaged hair. Look for shampoos that say ""sulfate-free"" and are made with natural cleansers.
Get a silicone-free conditioner. Silicons are added to conditioner because they make hair look shiny and smooth after the first few applications. However, over time they build up in your hair and cause it to look weighed-down and dull.

, Your daily habits can really impact the health of your hair. If you aren't eating a nutritious diet or getting enough water, your hair will definitely show it. Make a commitment to being healthy inside and out by doing the following:


Eat plenty of hair-healthy foods that contain protein, omega-3 fatty acids, and iron. Try mixing starches and proteins for the best effect. Salmon, sardines, avocados, nuts, and flaxseeds are all excellent for promoting healthy hair growth.
Stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water. When you're dehydrated, your hair can end up getting dry and brittle.
Avoid smoking cigarettes. Smoke damage can make hair look dull and dried out.

, Just like environmental factors like the sun or extremely cold temperatures can affect your skin health, they can affect your hair health, too. Protect your hair with a hat or a bandana when you're outside for long periods of time.


Protect yourself from pool chemicals, too. Wear a swim cap instead of submerging your hair in chlorine.
Even air pollution can affect your hair. If you often walk or bike near traffic, protect your hair until you get to your destination.
Wear your hair in protective styles like rolls and braids so that it becomes less tangled and is exposed less to the elements.

, As new, healthy hair grows in, get regular trims to cut away the old, damaged hair. Getting rid of split ends will give you a fresh appearance, and over time you'll be able to see a big difference.

"

Get a trim.,
Stop using heat.,
Stop dying or processing your hair.",How to Repair Damaged Hair1," Be careful about this. Hair stylists are the cause of most hair damage. You must use hair scissors that are right for your hair. If your hair has a straw-like texture with split ends, the first thing way to restore its health is to get a trim. Cutting your hair will immediately make it look fresher and restore its body.


To check if your stylist is using extra sharp scissors, get them to cut into a wet tissue. Inspect the cut - if you see torn tissue fibers, find another stylist.
Cut off as much as you dare. Hair is more damaged toward the tips, since that part of the hair has had more time to be affected by heat, chlorine, and other sources of hair damage.
Ask the stylist not to blow dry your hair or use any styling products. These will further damage unhealthy hair.;
, Now that your hair is freshly cut, treat it very gently until its health is restored.You may only use heat if you use heat protective spray.That means blow dryers, curling irons, or straightening irons.


Air drying your hair is less damaging than using a blow dryer. Let your hair exist in its most natural state.
If you must straighten or curl your hair, use a more gentle method, like rollers or hair wrapping, to achieve the look you want.

, Bleaching the color from your hair, then adding chemicals to dye it another color is extremely damaging. Bleaching or dying hair can lead to hair breakage, hair loss, and bald patches.


Permanent curling or straightening are also damaging and should be avoided.
Deep conditioning treatments meant to restore your hair's moisture may actually contain chemicals that are bad for your hair.
Straighteners and Hairdryers infused with Keratin and Argon oils will help keep hair healthy. Remington have some hair styling tools that will help maintain healthy hair without compromising results.

Purchase an epilator.,
Cleanse your face.,
Trim any long sideburn hairs.,
Run the epilator up your sideburn.,
Tweeze any stray hairs.",How to Remove Sideburns (For Girls)1," An epilator has multiple, mechanical arms that will tweeze many hairs out all at once. It can be quite painful, but it is effective. Be sure to choose one designed for removing facial hair. Facial epilators are a little smaller than the ones designed for body hair removal, but their size makes them more precise so you will have more control as you remove your hair.An epilator is ideal if you can stand some discomfort and want quick, long-lasting results.
Some epilators can be used in the shower, and wet, softened hair is a little easier to remove, which can reduce the pain.
If you are concerned about the pain, take an over the counter pain killer before using the epilator.;
, Use a gentle face wash to remove any dirt, oil, or makeup that may be on your face. It’s also a good idea to pull your hair back into a ponytail and use an elastic or fabric hair band to secure all the shorter, ""baby"" hairs off your face. Let the hair of your sideburns remain isolated on the other side of the headband., A good face epilator will remove the peach fuzz, as well as the coarser hair around your temple, but it will be a little easier for you to manage if your hair is short. Use a small pair of scissors to trim your hair to the recommended 0.5 millimeter length., With the epilator turned on, you want to glide it over your sideburn in the opposite direction of hair growth. Try not to get too close to the hairline, or you may accidentally remove hair beyond the sideburn. Keep in mind that if the line where you removed your sideburn is too severe, it may look unnatural too.Don't push into your skin or move the epilator too fast. Instead, use gentle, upward strokes until you have removed the majority of the hair.
Your skin may be a little red and swollen, even into the next day, so it's best not to use the epilator right before a big event.

, The epilator may not remove all of the sideburn hair, especially those close to your hairline. You can use clean tweezers to carefully remove any hairs that bother you. However, you may decide to leave some untouched so you maintain a natural shape. The effects of epilating can last from a few weeks to a month. Don't forget to clean the machine once you're done. Remove the head from your epilator and use a small brush to sweep out the hair. It’s also a good idea to clean the “blades” with alcohol.

Prepare the vinegar rinse.,
Consider adding some essential oils to your vinegar.,
Wash your hair with some shampoo.,
Pour the vinegar solution over your hair.,
Massage your scalp.,
Consider rinsing your hair with cool water.",How to Remove Hair Build up Naturally1," Putting vinegar in your hair may sound strange, but the vinegar helps remove build-up. It also balances the pH of your hair, smooths down the cuticles, and leaves your hair feeling soft and silky. Keep in mind, however, that this rinse is not recommended for color-treated hair, as it may cause the hair dye to fade or run. Here is what you will need to make this rinse:1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 milliliters) of vinegar
1 cup (240 milliliters) of cool water
A cup, mug, or bottle to hold the rinse;
, Pour the water and vinegar into a cup, mug, or bottle. You can use white vinegar or apple cider vinegar. Stir the vinegar and water with a spoon to combine the ingredients. If you are using a bottle, you can simply close the bottle and shake it.


If you have longer or very thick hair, then double the amount: 2 to 4 tablespoons of vinegar and 2 cups (450 milliliters) of water.

, Instead of using plain vinegar, you can add 5 to 10 drops of essential oil to 1 cup (225 milliliters) of vinegar.Shake the vinegar to mix the oil in, then use this vinegar in your rinse (1 to 2 tablespoons of infused vinegar per cup/225 milliliters of water) instead of the regular vinegar. Do not use this infused vinegar undiluted in your hair. Not only do essential oils help mask the strong odor of vinegar, but they can also be beneficial for your hair. Here are some essential oils that you can use, depending on your hair type:If you have dry hair, you can use any of the following oils: lavender, myrrh, and peppermint.
If you have normal hair, you can use any of the following oils: chamomile, clary sage, and lavender.
If you have oily hair, you can use and of the following oils: basil, lavender, lemongrass, lemon, patchouli, rosemary, tea tree, and ylang ylang.

, Take your favorite shampoo and wash your hair as you normally would. You are doing this in order to remove most of the dirt and oils. You may also follow up with some conditioner, although the vinegar rinse will be enough to make your hair look smooth and shiny.

, Tilt your head back and close your eyes tightly. Pour the vinegar-water over your head, so that it runs from your hair line, down your hair, and to the ends. Do not let the vinegar-water get into your eyes. It will sting and burn a lot.

Treat your hair with oil.",How to Repair Damaged Hair2," Shampoo and conditioner made with natural oils and herbs will repair your hair. Shop in a health food store for natural products made with ingredients that restore moisture to dry, damaged hair.


Avoid shampoos and conditioner made with sodium laurel or laureth sulfates. These are industrial cleaning agents in many soaps and shampoos; they strip hair of its natural protective oils.
When you begin using natural shampoo and conditioner, your hair may look slightly oily. That's because your body has grown used to overproducing the oils necessary to maintain healthy hair. Ride it out. After a few weeks your body will be used to producing the right amount of oil again.

Don't wash your hair too often.,
Wash your hair with lukewarm or cool water.,
Wear a swim cap in the pool.,
Stay in good general health.",How to Repair Damaged Hair3," Washing your hair every day dries it out, since it doesn't give your scalp the chance to produce the oils your hair needs to stay healthy. Try washing it two or three times a week instead.


Style your hair in an updo or with a hat on the last day before you wash it.
Use dry shampoo or a little baking soda around your roots and bangs to absorb your hair's oil.

, Hot water damages hair, but cool or cold water causes the hair shafts to lie flat, giving your hair a shiny, glossy appearance.

, Has a stylist ever asked you if you're a swimmer? Chlorine causes damage that builds up over time. Always wear a cap when you go swimming.


If you go swimming without a cap, make sure to wash out the chlorine with a good natural shampoo.
Don't sit in the sun after swimming without a cap, because the sun's rays will compound the damage done by chlorine. Wash it out before you sunbathe.

, Like other parts of your body, hair is affected by what you eat and drink. Get plenty of water, vitamins and essential nutrients.


Omega-3 fatty acids are good for hair and skin. Eat salmon, walnuts, flax seeds, and other sources of this beneficial fatty acid.

Buy a waxing kit specifically for facial hair.,
Pull your hair back.,
Wash your face.,
Trim long sideburn hair.,
Heat the wax.,
Apply the wax to your sideburn.,
Place a cloth strip over the wax.,
Remove the strip.,
Apply a soothing treatment.,
Tweeze any stray hairs.",How to Remove Sideburns (For Girls)2," The skin on your face is more delicate than the rest of your body, so make sure the box specifically says the kit is safe to use on your face.If you don't want to deal with the messy wax, look for roll-on wax or kits that come with pre-waxed strips.Most home waxing kits are microwavable so you can easily heat them up in your kitchen.

, The last thing you want is to get wax in the rest of your hair, so make sure it is entirely off your face. Gather it back in a ponytail, and use an elastic or fabric headband to secure all of the hair behind your hairline. Remember to pin back your bangs, too. The only hair that should be free from the headband is the hair you plan to remove.If you don't have a headband, you can use bobby pins to secure your hair.

, Make sure you have removed all of your makeup, and cleansed your skin of oil, dirt, and other debris. Waxing can leave your skin prone to bacteria, so it’s important that the skin around your sideburns is completely clean.If you have sensitive or oily skin, apply a dusting of talc or baby powder to the area where you will be waxing.
Don't wax if you've used a prescription retinoid or over-the-counter retinol in the last 10 days, or the waxing may rip your skin off along with your hair.
Wait to wax if your skin is sunburned, peeling, or broken.

, For the most effective results, your hair must be the right length prior to waxing. Typically, you want it to be 1/4- to 1/2-inch long. Use a pair of small scissors to trim your sideburns until all of the hair is the appropriate length. Keep in mind that if there are any hairs shorter than 1/4-inch, the wax likely won't remove them., Make sure to follow the heating directions on the kit carefully. It’s especially important not to overheat the wax because you may burn yourself. You can test a little on the inside of your wrist to make sure the temperature is correct. The skin there is thin and should be a good gauge as to whether or not the wax is too hot to use on your face., Most waxing kits come with an applicator that you can use to carefully trace along the hairline. You should apply the wax in the same direction as hair growth. Try to cover the roots of the hair that you want to remove so you can be sure to get rid of all of it. Keep in mind that you can’t wax the same area twice without causing major irritation to your skin.To make it easier for the wax to capture the individual hairs, place your free hand on your cheekbone, and pull your skin taut and away from your temple as you apply.

, Make sure the wax is still warm, and wait approximately 10 seconds. Use your fingers to stroke along the length of the cloth to ensure that it attaches to the wax., For the best results, pull your skin taut with one hand and use the other hand to rip the cloth diagonally upwards, against the direction of hair growth. If you do not pull the skin tight, you may bruise your face. Pulling against in the opposite direction of growth will keep hairs from breaking during the process., The skin around your sideburns will be red and possibly swollen after waxing, so it can help to press a paper towel dampened with a mixture of one part skim milk and one part cold water for 10 minutes. The lactic acid in the milk will help soothe your skin. You can apply the compress every few hours. Instead of the milk-water mixture, you can also use a hydrating salve, an over-the-counter hydrocortisone cream, or aloe vera gel.
Make sure to avoid using anything harsh, such as alpha hydroxy acid, retinol, or benzoyl peroxide, for at least a day while your skin recovers.
Be sure to apply sunscreen to the area around your sideburns because freshly waxed skin is more sensitive to the sun.

, Because you can’t wax the area again, use a pair of clean tweezers to gently remove any hair that has been left behind. If there is still wax left on your skin, a moisturizing product such as baby oil can help clean up the area. You shouldn’t have to wax your sideburns again for two to six weeks."

Choose a hair removal (or depilatory) cream.,
Test the cream on the inside of your wrist.,
Pull your hair back.,
Apply a thick layer of cream to your sideburns.,
Allow the cream to sit.,
Wipe away the cream.",How to Remove Sideburns (For Girls)3," These products use chemicals to dissolve the proteins in your hair, causing the hair to loosen from the follicle. The most important consideration when selecting a cream is your skin's sensitivity. Opt for a formula made specifically for facial hair removal, which contains vitamin E or aloe.Depilatories come in creams, gels, roll-ons, and aerosols. Roll-ons and aerosols make less of a mess, but you can get a nice, thick layer of product with a cream.
If you have sensitive skin, talk to a dermatologist about the best hair removal cream options for you.

, To avoid an allergic reaction, apply a small amount of cream to your skin, wait the prescribed amount of time on the packaging, and then wipe it off. Wait at least 24 hours to make sure you don't have an adverse reaction to the cream -- the chemicals can be harsh, as your skin contains the same proteins the chemicals attack in your hair.Your wrist is a good spot to test the cream because the skin is thin and delicate, just like the skin on your face.

, A thick, fabric headband makes a good barrier to your hairline so you don't accidentally remove more hair than you mean to. Make sure your sideburns are free and not pulled back with the rest of your hair so you can target them with the cream.


Check the area around your sideburns to make sure you don't have an open cut, scrape, burn, or peeling skin. The depilatory may irritate or cause chemical burns on damaged skin.
Make sure you have removed all your makeup and your skin is clean before you apply the cream.

, Spread it over the hair in a dabbing motion but do not rub or massage it into your skin. Do both sides of your face at the same time, and wash your hands thoroughly afterwards.The cream may have a strong, almost sulfur-like scent, which is normal. If you’re sensitive to smells, choose a product that’s scent-free.

, Read the instructions carefully to see how long you should wait; in most cases, it’s five to ten minutes. Don't go beyond the recommended time, though, or you may get a nasty burn. Many creams recommend checking after five minutes to see if the hair is loose enough to come out.A slight tingling sensation is normal, but if the skin begins to burn, immediately remove the cream and wash the area with cool water and a gentle soap.

, Use a warm, wet cotton pad or washcloth to gently remove it, and the hair should wipe away with it. You may have to make a few passes with the pad or cloth to remove all of the hair.Be sure you remove all traces of the cream so it doesn't continue reacting to with your skin.
It should take about a week for the hair to start growing back. In the meantime, your skin should be smooth and free of ingrown hairs.Moisturize your skin afterward. Most kits come with a soothing lotion that you can apply after using the depilatory.

, This procedure uses heat to kill the hair follicle during the first stage of growth. The resulting hair loss is permanent, but because your hair is not all in this first stage of growth at the same time, it may require multiple laser treatments to get rid of your sideburns. In most cases, it takes between two and eight treatments to permanently remove the hair.This procedure only works on people with contrasting hair and skin colors, which means a relatively light-skinned person with dark hair. The follicle won't absorb the heat from the laser if you have dark skin or fair hair.Make sure to do extensive research before choosing a facility for laser hair removal treatment. A laser can cause permanent damage if used incorrectly, so choose a dermatologist or plastic surgeon to perform the procedure, as they have the most training.If a nurse or aesthetician is performing the procedure, make sure a doctor is on-site, overseeing their work.
Ask how many machines are on the premises. The more options available, the more likely you will get the most efficient treatment., With electrolysis, a tiny probe is used to kill the hair follicle with a current of electricity. The hair is then tweezed and usually does not grow back. As with lasering, the hair must be at a certain stage of growth for this to work, so multiple visits are necessary. In some cases, it may take up to 20 treatments.Electrolysis will work on any hair color or skin color.
It is very important to find an experienced and reputable specialist to perform your electrolysis. Poor work can result in infection, scarring, and discoloration of the skin.
Electrolysis, when performed properly, has proven to be a safe and permanent solution for hair removal.

Consider the needs of your workplace, how much time you have to style your hair, and how much effort you are willing to put in to your daily look.


Regardless of the hairstyle you choose, it should work with your personality. You'll need to be comfortable with your new style, so don't pick a style that doesn't match your own personal tastes. If your stylist recommends a hairstyle that you don't feel comfortable with, politely tell them how you feel and find something else.;
, It helps if you can go to a stylist that you're already familiar with, but if you need to find a new stylist, ask friends or coworkers for recommendations. Take photos of hairstyles you like and ask the stylist if the look would work with your facial shape.


Remember what kind of a cut you get, so that you can remind the stylist at future appointments or ask for something slightly different. If you like the cut, be sure to tip well.
You should also ask your stylist for maintenance and styling tips. They'll be able to point you in the right direction for what products to use and how often to get trims.

, When you're deciding where to place your part, think about your face shape and your natural part. If you have a round face, don't part your hair in the middle - it will emphasize the roundness. If you have a sharp jaw and high cheekbones, a part that's far to one side will highlight these qualities. In general, a part that's a few inches off-center works well for most people. Experiment to see what you like best.


You can use your fingers or a comb to part your hair. Keep in mind that finger-combing will result in a wavier, more natural look, while using a fine-toothed comb will make your hairstyle more sleek and structured.

, Unless you're spiking your hair out in every possible direction, you'll notice that most hairstyles have one primary direction in which the hair is combed. You can comb it forward, back, up, to the side, or straight down. Experiment with a few different ways and see what works best for you.


Note that most men only style and comb the top portion of their hair, unless their hair is on the long side of medium or longer. The back and sides of most men's haircuts are short enough that they don't require much day-to-day styling.

, Unfortunately, most of us need more than water and a comb to style our hair. Start off with less expensive brands while you're experimenting with different types of products. When you find something you like (such as hair clay), then you can try to find the right brand for you. Here are a few possible products you can purchase, as well as the sort of look they'll help you achieve:



Serums or creams. These can help you tame fly-aways or de-frizz curls without making your hair stiff and immovable.

Mousse. Use hair mousse to add volume and shine to your hair, with minimal hold. For best results, apply to wet hair and allow your hair to dry.

Gel. Unlike pomade, gel contains alcohol that dries out hair and makes for a stiffer hold. For the strongest hold, apply gel to wet hair.

Pomade, hair wax, or hair clay. Use these products to mold your hair into difficult-to-achieve shapes, such as pompadours or curls (for naturally straight hair). Be aware that it can take several washes to remove these products, so apply them lightly. A pea-sized amount should be plenty if you have short, medium or thin hair. Use pomade or hair wax for a shiny, wet look; use hair clay for a matte, natural tone.

Hair glue. Ever wonder how some people get their mohawks to stand straight up? They're probably using some variation of hair glue, which provides the strongest possible hold. Be wary of product build-up, however, and wash your hair thoroughly between applications.

, Depending on the product and hairstyle, you may want to apply the styling product before you comb your hair. If you're worried about your hair drooping or losing its structure throughout the day, mist it with hairspray as soon as you're finished styling. You can choose a product with light or strong hold (just remember that ""strong hold"" means ""more alcohol,"" which can make your hair look more brittle).


Be sure to keep the hairspray at least six inches away from your hair when spraying it. Avoid spraying too much or your hair might clump together and look hard.
Hair wax is also a simple way to set your hairstyle. Just rub a little bit of wax between your fingers until it softens and then pinch it between strands of hair to work it in.

, Why are you styling your hair? Are you going to Prom? Meeting your girlfriend's parents? Just want cool hair? Make the look match the situation.


Keep in mind that formal events call for more traditional hairstyles. Your cousin may not want you to wear a high Mohawk to her wedding.
It may be best to choose a style that is close to your everyday style for an important event; this will help you feel more comfortable during the event.

, If you started using cheap products for your daily style, you may want to consider springing for better quality products for your special occasion. Cheap products are more likely to cause build-up or undesired effects such as making your hair look either too dry or too oily.


Be sure to use the products a couple of times before the special occasion so that you know how your hair reacts to the product.

, If you are going to a formal event, such as prom or a wedding (as a guest or a member of the wedding party), you may want to ask someone for styling help for the event. A professional stylist, a parent, or even your date may be able to offer suggestions for what would look nice on you.

, The most important aspect of your special-event hairstyle is that it should look like you spent time trying to make your hair look perfect.Your part should be made with a comb so that it looks sharp.
You should use product to keep the hair where you intend for it to be.
A quality hair product that adds a bit of shine or a wet look often works for events.

, If the even that you are attending is going to last more than an hour or two, you may need to refresh your hair to keep it looking neat. This can be as simple as keeping a small comb in your inside jacket pocket, wetting it in the men’s room, and running it through your hair. This will likely re-activate your styling product (particularly hair gel) and can help you make it to the end of the event still looking snazzy.

, It's generally understood that not every hairstyle will look good on everyone. This largely has to do with facial shape and features. A useful way to find your facial shape is to stand in front of a mirror and mark the outline of your face (not including your hair or ears) using a bar of soap or makeup pencil. You should be able to see a definitive shape.

, Once you have determined your face shape, try to find a hairstyle that suits the shape. This may require patience, as you may find that you need to grow your hair longer in order to style it appropriately. Here are suggestions for styles based on your face shape:



Oval face: Choose almost any hairstyle, but bangs or fringe will make your face appear rounder.Square face: Choose a softer style around your hairline. Short, tight hairstyles will play up your sharp features. Avoid parting your hair in the center.Oblong face: Choose a balanced style. Short sides and a long top will make your face look even longer. Keeping some hair styled onto your face can help balance your facial length.

Round face: Avoid sharp bangs or lots of hair swept onto the face.Diamond-shaped face: You may want to choose longer hairstyles. Avoid sharp haircuts near the ears and straight hair.Heart-shaped face: Choose longer hair. Facial hair, such as a beard, mustache, or goatee, will also help balance the lower part of your face.Triangular face: Choose a style that adds width and volume at the top.Keeping your hair wavy or curly is a good way to add the volume.

, Is your hair wavy, straight, textured, or curly? Is it fine, medium, or thick? Certain hairstyles will work better with your hair's natural tendencies and can make styling easier.

, While some of these styles work with any hair texture, most work best with a specific hair type. Evaluate what your hair naturally tends to do and find a hairstyle that complements those tendencies.


If you have straight hair of any consistency, consider choosing the Prohibition High-and-Tight, let it grow out (as long as it isn't fine), flow and comb it, or crop it.

The Prohibition High-and-Tight features very short sides while fading hair shorter into your nape and sideburns. The top should be a little longer, about an inch and a half. To style, use a gel to keep the top combed into place.Don't choose this look if you have wavy or curly hair.
To let your hair grow out for a messy look, simply let your hair grow past your shoulders. Styling is simple, just towel dry your hair and apply a little texture cream.The flow and comb starts with a square cut, but is longer on the sides and the top. Apply a mousse to your wet hair, then comb the hair back.Avoid this if you have curly hair.
Cropped hair is essentially cut short evenly across the sides and the top. You don't really need styling products with this low-maintenance cut.If you have curly or wavy hair, consider choosing a pompadour, let it grow out, or crop it.

The pompadour is simply a classic haircut. The blended cut should be done to a ratio of 2 to 1, top to sides. This basically means that you should leave the sides shorter than the top, but not drastically shorter. Style with a pomade and comb the top into place.Avoid this look if you have very fine, straight, or thin hair.

Cropped hair is essentially cut short evenly across the sides and the top. You don't really need styling products with this low-maintenance cut.If you have a receding hairline, just keep your hair short. If you're feeling adventurous, you could shave everything off and possibly grow a beard or goatee.

, There is no hard and fast rule about hairstyle. While these suggestions may help, you should ultimately find a style that makes you feel comfortable and like yourself. Don’t be afraid to try out different styles every month or so until you find one that you really like.

, The average length of classic sideburns is the middle point of your ear, but this can be adjusted according to your facial features and head shape. Whatever length you choose, the sideburns should match your hairstyle. So, if you have short hair, the sideburns should be kept short and well trimmed. Sideburns can be longer and thicker with a longer, looser hairstyle.Longer sideburns can actually make your face look narrower, while sideburns that are shorter than mid-ear length can have the opposite effect. Typically, shorter sideburns work well with longer faces, while longer sideburns can elongate shorter faces."

Use a shampoo that fits your hair color and texture, and use conditioner, when you do wash your hair. Maybe you need creams or sprays if your hair’s too messy.
In fact, it can actually be easier to style “dirty” hair that hasn’t been washed for a couple days. It will hold curl better. Brush your hair from bottom to top so there are no knots in it before you style it.;
, If your hair is curly or has split ends, it probably needs moisture. Look for products with moisturizing ingredients like natural oils and avoid products with alcohol.


Invest in some healing oil or hair masks to keep your hair healthy as you grow, cut, or dye your hair to reach the desired style. Instead of a conditioner, you could put a natural oil in your hair such as coconut oil or argan oil. Use it mid-lengths and down to your tips for shine and health. If your hair is thin or lacks volume, look for products with biotin, collagen or keratin in them as these products help build hair’s thickness and keep it strong. You can also put conditioner in your hair, and then put your hair in a shower cap, and sleep with the cap on. When you take the cap off, just rinse your hair like you normally would.

, There’s almost nothing more damaging to hair than over-styling it with heat products like blow dryers, electric curlers or curling irons. No style will look good on fried hair.


Air dry the hair as much as possible to keep it healthy. If you must blow dry it, use a diffuser. This is a product that attaches to the end of a blow dryer to lessen the damage from the heat.
Use a heat protectant spray to protect your hair. Spray heat protectant on every part of the hair you want to curl. Don’t hold it too close to your head or your hair may become damp from the liquids, and you won’t be able to curl it.

, If your hair is limp or doesn’t have a good cut, it’s not going to hold a style well. So it’s worth it to go to a salon every six weeks to get those split ends trimmed off. While you’re there, ask your hairdresser which brush will be best for your hair type. There are many different shapes and bristle types that all have different effects on your hair. When starting to style the hair, be sure not to brush it too much. Brushing can cause frizz or even damage hair. Instead, try to use a wide tooth comb. They tend to be easier on the hair. Layered cuts will bring out natural curl. If you’re looking for straight hair, wear your hair longer. Be aware that shorter cuts can be tough with very curly hair. If you’re a man, you can’t expect gel to fix everything. You need a decent haircut. For women, with long hair, this is especially true if you want your hair to look styled and not stringy.

, There are people who are trained in styling hair. Why try to figure it out yourself? Consult someone who’s an expert. If you can’t afford to – go online. The Internet is a great place to find tutorials for every kind of hairstyle imaginable.


Get help from a hairdresser or stylist. These are professionals who will style your hair and explain to you how to do it on your own. Ask your local salon whether they have hair stylists who will give you lessons on styling your hair.
If you need your hair styled for a big event such as a prom or a wedding, consider having your hair done professionally. If that’s not an option, practice before the big day so you have a feel for how it’s done.
Check out You Tube tutorials or websites. Just go to You Tube and search for the hairstyle you want. There are many how-to videos that will walk you through how to get a certain look.

, Think about all of the hairstyles you admire, and gather photos of them. Narrow these down to three styles you would really love to try, while matching them to styles that look good for your face shape and work with your lifestyle (longer hair takes more care).


Do you appreciate highlights or unnatural colors? Do you prefer a certain length? What color do you want? Single out celebrities with hair that’s wavy like yours or who have a face as round as yours as this will allow you to preview how the style will look on you.
Get feedback. Ask your friends, hairdresser, and family members about their opinions on your style ideas. It is your hair and your style, but they may offer up ideas you hadn’t thought of or suggestions for keeping your style appropriate. Mix it up. Try not to fall into the rut of always wearing your hair up or always wearing your hair down.

, Knowing the thickness, length texture, and growth rate of your hair can help you determine which styles are practical. Above shoulder length hair is usually considered short, and medium hair is generally at your shoulder to a bit down your back. Long is anything below that.


You should be able to tell your hair thickness just by looking and feeling it, but there are basically 2 hair thickness categories – fine or thick. Do you have straight, curly or wavy hair naturally?
If you have short hair, then you can do tight curls, cute crimps, and adorable accessorizing. For medium hair, you can do braids, and curls/waves/crimps/straightening, buns, ponytails. For long hair, you can do pretty much anything.

, Trying to copy every single new hair style fad out there is not the best idea. You need to pick a style that suits your personality and circumstance. There are many styles you could choose from, including braids, waves, short, permanent, dreadlocks, half shaved, designed or highlights.


First of all, know yourself. Look into the mirror and ask what kind of person you want to be. Always select your dress first too. Consider your work circumstances. Does the style match the work environment?
It’s often a good idea to work with what you have naturally to accentuate your beauty. Straightening curly hair or curling straight hair every day can damage your hair, and it’s a lot of work.

, Every style isn't going to look good on every face. That's the bottom line. So you need to figure out what looks best with your own shape. 








To determine your face shape, look in the mirror, and draw an outline of your face on the mirror with lipstick. Then, look at the shape and decide what shape it looks most like. Heart-shaped faces, for example, don’t work as well with short hair but do look good with the hair pulled back. If you have a square face, you want to stick to cuts that highlight your cheekbones, and soften your chin, like layers starting from the bottom of your ears down to your shoulders.
If your face is particularly bell shaped, but the top half is smaller, then you want to avoid bangs and short haircuts. If your ears are particularly big, you might want to consider growing your hair out long. If you have a large forehead, some bangs on your face or a side parting are a good idea. Oval faces can go with pretty much any hairstyle but if you have stronger features, like a rectangle or diamond face shape, you may want softer lines to soften your look.
A tight ponytail or slicked-back style might not be a good idea if you're insecure about your forehead or face shape. Bangs can be ideal to shape a face, whether straight or slanted. A bob line can elongate your neck. A bun can be very sophisticated, along with other up-dos. A ponytail can be carefree, fun and young.

, It’s a good idea to test out styles you like before you go for a more permanent option, so you can take some photos and see how they look.


For example, try a curling iron a few times before getting a permanent. You could even put on a wig to see how you look with a color or a look.
Use temporary hair dye before going to the salon, and try bang clip ins or hair extensions before taking scissors to your hair or growing it out.
You can find many free websites online that will allow you to upload a photo of yourself and try different hairstyles on it, to test out how they look. Consider the type of message you want people to get when they look at you. A good natural look says you’re easy going. If you want to look like a rebel, you can use color for effect or even shave part of your hair.

, Some examples of hair shaping products are hair wax or mousse. To make your hair more manageable use products such as curl control or de frizzing serums for curly hair, volumizers for thin hair, or hair spray.









Dry shampoo is your best friend. Use it for volume and texture or as a cover up for oily hair or roots if it matches your colored hair.
Buy good products, not the cheapest thing you can find in a grocery store. The difference will be in the finish, the feel, and the smell. Don’t put too much product in because that can lead to the hair appearing oily. Focus on the strands of the hair, rather than the top of the head. Try to distribute the product evenly by dividing the hair into sections.
Try hair accessories. Hair bands look really good with short hair! Use a chunky headband to hide 2nd-day grease or unruly bangs. You could also use a clip or ribbon to dress up a ponytail or bun.

, People – guys and girls – both like hair they can run their fingers through. So you want soft touchable hair that is not too crispy or greasy. Use the right products, and use them minimally.









Use a high-quality wax. The best way to style your hair is to use a good quality wax - take a small amount and heat slightly by rubbing your palms together. Then, make sure you get it in all of your hair before styling into position.
For men, to create a look that is bit spiky or chaotic consider using a wax or gel that won’t harden your hair and make it look more natural. If you’re a man, squirt some on your hands, spread it around, apply it all over your hair, then work it in with an upward motion, as if you are trying to send your hair to the center of your head. The spikes form on their own from you pushing the hair up. Work in the wax like a setter, and fluff it up. , If your hair already has a little natural wave to it, a great way to style it is to simply bring out and enhance that already existing curl. For more beachy curls, try working a sea-salt spray into your hair after misting it over. This creates great texture, and a natural soft wave. 








After you get out of the shower with freshly shampooed hair, dry the hair and apply mousse. Be sure not to use too much. Flip your head over and apply the mousse upside down and scrunch, scrunch, scrunch.
Then let hair dry naturally for 30 minutes to an hour. Finish up with a blow dryer on low speed and cool air. If your hair is heavy and doesn't hold curl well, after the blow drying, scrunch and tease the roots while your hair is upside down.
Apply hairspray. Blow dry the hairspray, low speed, cool temperature. Flip your hair over and enjoy!!

, There are different kinds of heat you can use – a flat iron, a curling iron, or Velcro or electric rollers. Sometimes you do need to apply heat to get some curls. 








To flat iron, apply heat protectant. If you have thick hair, separate your hair into two layers and do each individually. Don’t grab more than an inch of hair, and be careful not to burn yourself.
To use a round curling iron, use heat protectant. Alternate directions of curl or have all of them go the same way (inwards or outwards). Make sure all your hair is swept back over your shoulders, and resting on your back. As you make each curl, you should move them to the front of your shoulders to keep them separated from the rest of your hair. If you have long hair, you should be taking about one-inch sections and winding them around the curler neatly, without overlapping.
Never curl wet hair with a hot curler, as it’s extremely damaging to the hair. Next, split your hair into sections. Depending on how thick your hair is, you may need anywhere from 2 to 6 sections. Leave a section of the hair down at a time, and pin the rest of it on top of your head. The shorter your hair, the bigger sections you can take. If you would like springier curls, leave it for 10-12 seconds. For more wavy or loose curls, leave it for 8 to 10 sections. These are just approximations, as everyone’s hair is different.

, These are quick options that give you hair a little more style and class. They are also pretty easy to do.









When braiding, split the hair into three sections, and put the left over the middle, pull tight, put the right over the middle, pull tight, put the left over the middle, pull tight, etc. until you can’t anymore. To create a quick and easy bun, you will need 2 ponytail holders, a bobby pin, and a brush. Make one ponytail, and then grab your hair and twist it like a twister. Then, take the other ponytail holder and wrap it around the bun, and then clip the bobby pin in the middle. , A simple style for thin hair is leaving the hair down, taking the two front pieces, and tying them in the back. Adding a flower crown gives the style a very indie-hippie feel. Curling the hair in this style looks nice if heat protectant is accessible.


A simple style for thick hair is a half up, half down look. It’s achievable by putting half of the hair up in a ponytail, and leaving the rest down. If there are bangs, then leaving them down can give out cute vibes.
A simple style for curly or wavy hair is the up-under ponytail. All it consists of is picking up half of the hair, putting it up, and then making another ponytail under it. This makes the hair appear longer and fuller. Adding a bandanna or headband piece fancies the style up.

, Although you should watch the amount of heat you regularly direct toward your hair, there are times you might want to turn to a blow dryer to give your hair more volume. 








When blow drying your hair, add about a palm full of volumizing mousse and work this into the roots of your hair all over, and then bring it to the roots, scrunching it up as you go. Then, blow dry your hair upside down for more volume, continuously scrunching your ends to the roots as you blow dry.
Add a bit of hairspray to the roots while upside down to keep the volume you just created throughout the day. Try a tangle teaser for an easier brush and added shine. Finish with some hair oil to add shine and dimension to your hair.
For girls with straight hair who want wavy hair, shower, shampoo and condition as usual. Towel dry hair so that it is damp, and then put tt in a bun at the top of your head. Go to sleep and you should wake up with nice volume.
For girls with wavy frizzy hair. Keep a dehumidifier in your room, and keep it cold. Shower at least 2 hours prior to when you plan on sleeping so that your hair can be completely dry when you go to sleep.

, Drape this section of braids down and across your forehead. Continue wrapping it around until it reaches the back of your head.


Drape this section of hair across the opposite side of your forehead. In other words, if you took a section of hair from the left side of your head, drape it around to the right side of your head.

Keep the entire large braid positioned over the front of your shoulder. Do not let it fall back behind your shoulder.

, A tightly braided ponytail may not need to be secured, but if it feels loose, you can secure the ends with an elastic hair band.


After finishing this step, the style should be complete.

Keep the ponytail loose and hold it together with a large hair elastic.
Center the ponytail over the top of your head.

, Divide the braids in your ponytail into three separate sections. One should fall over the front of your face while the other two fall over either side of your head.


Note that the section of braids at the front of your face should be about half the size of the side sections. Both side sections should be roughly the same thickness, however.

, Take both side sections and fold them toward the back of your head. The ends of these two sections should meet at the back.


The bow shape should start to form as you fold.
Each section will look like a half-loop positioned on either side of the top of your head.
Once you bring the ends together, hold both ends in place with one hand.

, Using your free hand, flip the front section of braids up and back. It should cross over the top of your head and fall to the back.


As you flip this front section back, it should cross over the folded side sections and their ends.
This flipped front section forms the center of your bow.

, Tuck the ends of your center section beneath the secured side loops.


Work carefully to avoid unraveling the bow.
Once the ends of this center section are beneath the loops of the bow, carefully push them toward the center of the bow.

, If any braids fell out of the side loops as you worked, use your fingers to carefully tuck them in and out of sight.

Starting at the edge of the crown, direct the hair straight up and toward the center of your head. The hair at the top front should meet in a point aligned to the middle of the crown.
As your progress toward the back of the crown, make this peak less dramatic.
The hair at the sides and back of your don't need much styling. Depending on personal preference, you can let them remain flat or subtly push them toward the crown.

Wash or wet your hair before rolling it.,
Roll sections of hair.Begin at the front of your hair and work backward, rolling small sections at a time.,
Allow the rollers to dry.,
Remove the rollers and style your hair.",How to Style Short Hair for Girls1," You may want to practice using them before it's time to style your hair. Looking into a mirror, try winding your hair around a curler and securing it with a hair pin. Some types of rollers slip out of short hair, so you'll want to experiment with securing them.;
, Apply a styling product such as mousse, styling spray or curling cream. Particularly if you're not using heat, hair must begin wet in order to set it with rollers. If you're using hot rollers, you may still want to wet your hair and apply mousse or another styling product before drying it.

, Roll sections measuring about 1 inch each, just enough hair to wind around the middle of the curler.


Some hair may be too short to roll. In that case, you can still add a curl to the tip of your hair by wrapping just the end around part of the roller.
Instead of using rollers, you can also twist strands of wet hair with your fingers. Once those twists dry, they can be unwound, resulting in gorgeous spiral curls.

, You can either blow dry your rolled hair or allow it to air dry. Make sure the hair is completely dry before you remove the rollers.


If you are curling your hair with hot rollers, make sure the rollers are completely cold before removing them.

Spray your hair with a detangler.,
Pull your hair back into a ponytail.,
Secure your ponytail.,
Twist the ponytail into a bun.,

, Twist the ponytail in one direction, starting at the base of the ponytail and continuing down to the ends.When you get to the ends of the ponytail, continue twisting. The ponytail will start to twist around itself. Following the natural twist, wrap the ponytail around the hair tie to create a twisted bun.

, When you’re finished wrapping the ponytail and have a twisted bun, hold the ends of your hair in place. Secure the ends of the ponytail with a bobby pin. Push a bobby pin over the ends and through, to the center of the bun.You may want to add a few more bobby pins around the bun for extra hold.

, Gently spray the top of your hair with hairspray to keep everything in place and tame flyaway hairs.Softly run your hands over your hair to smooth your hair back.


Consider spraying behind your head to keep any shorter back airs from falling out of your bun.

Make a ponytail at the nape of your neck.,
Braid your ponytail into a three-part braid.,
Wrap your braid around itself to create a bun.,
Decorate your with bun.",How to Style Waist Length Hair1," Brush your hair well. Collect it all in one hand at the nape of your neck and use your other hand to wrap a hair rubber band around it as many times as necessary to keep your hair in a snug ponytail.


Elastic rubber bands covered in fabric, with no metal to snag your hair are recommended to keep your hair healthy and avoid breaking, tangling and damaging your hair.You can also try a silicone snappy before brushing your hair hair into a ponytail to allow it to slide more safely through the rubber band.;
, Separate the ponytail into three even parts. Cross left over center, then right over center as far down the ponytail as you can until you are running out of hair to work with. At this point, move the ponytail holder down to the bottom of the braid to fasten.








You will need to add several wraps of the ponytail holder to secure this section , which will be thinner than the top of the braid.
Keep your braid tight as you go along. If some hair is escaping the braid along the way, remove the braid up to that section to collect the hair back in, then continue down the length of the ponytail.

, Starting at the top of the braid, twist and wrap the braid over itself. Continue wrapping along the outside of the last turn as opposed to laying the braid on top of itself to create a nice bun.









Push the end of the braid under the bun to hide the rubber band and unbraided tip. Secure this end with a bobby pin by pushing it through the end and into the secured hair along the scalp. The grooved side of the bobby pin should be facing toward your scalp.Secure loose portions of the bun to your scalp with bobby pins until you get the shape you desire and it feels secure.

, Use decorative hair accessories, flowers, or even antique hat pins. Push them into your braid in various places to add a little color, sparkle or character.








You could also accessorize with headbands and head scarves wrapped around the top of your head or the bun.
Try braiding ribbon as you did your braid, then wrapping the ribbon around the bun and tying it into place. This can add color and a little extra security to hold your bun in place, or wrap around any little “fly-aways” which are escaping the braid.

Get the right cut.,
Pick your part.,
Experiment with accessories.,
Trim your hair regularly.",How to Style Shoulder Length Hair1," Before you style, you need to get the cut that's right for you. Straight bangs pair very well with shoulder-length hair, but sideswept and bangs-free cuts also look great. Use your own personal preference to decide which cut is right for you.


While shoulder-length hair can be great on anyone, people with fine-to-medium hair will pull off this look the most effortlessly. For these hair types, a simple trim is often all that's needed to create a shoulder-length cut.
Thicker, curly hair will need to be cut in layers to avoid being wide at the bottom.;
, No matter your hair length, you should part your hair with your face shape in mind for the most flattering hairstyle.


Side parts are best for round, square, and diamond faces.
For a person with a heart-shaped face and shoulder-length hair, a center part is the most flattering.
Any type of part can flatter an oval face.Just because a certain type of part may look best doesn't mean you have to wear your hair that way. Feel free to experiment with different styles.
Pushing your hair to one side, or the opposite side you usually have it, can spice things up. Try a dramatic side part above the outer edge of one eyebrow, or do a more subtle side part an inch or two away from center.
Because the roots are used to your hair being positioned one way, switching will give your hair a little extra volume. For that same reason, though, it may take a while to ""train"" a new part to stay in place. To train a new part quickly, blow dry freshly-styled hair., Because shoulder-length hair tends to have more body than other hair lengths, it can support a greater number of accessories. It's long enough to put up in a hair tie while short enough for heavy clips not to flatten.


Slide on some flashy hair clips or pins to either hold your style together or simply decorate your 'do.
When wearing a headband, you can choose to tease out your hair to showcase its volume or flatten it down for a sleek look. Either will work for shoulder-length hair., How you define ""regularly"" will depend on how fast your hair grows. Shoulder-length hair can go longer without a trim compared to shorter styles. However, it should still be cut at least every 4-8 weeks to maintain a neat cut and to avoid breakage."

, Once the hair dries, place a small amount of styling mud in your palm, then rub your hands together until it spreads. Work the mud into your hair from end to root.









If you have fine hair, consider using pomade. If you have notably coarse hair, you may want to use wax.

, Flatten the sides backward using a comb, then add any desired detail to the top of your head using a comb, as well.









Avoid pinching out sections of the hair. The hair at your crown should move in the same general direction, so piecing out certain sections could ruin the overall look.

, Use your palms to flatten the hair at the sides and back of your head while simultaneously directing the hair backward.









Start with the hair at the sides of your head and next to your face. Push it back, then continue moving your hands back to help guide the rest of the sides backward, too.
When you reach the back of the hair, direct it downward so that it flows naturally with the sides.

, Allow the hair to dry naturally instead of using a hair dryer.


If you used a strong enough hair product, the style should remain secure without additional work. Check on it periodically as it dries, however, and touch up any wayward locks while they're still damp.

Part the hair to one side.,
Guide the locks sideways while drying.,
Paste the pieces in place.",How to Style Short Hair (Men)4," Squeeze a small amount of styling cream into the palm of your hand, then rub your hands together to spread it. Smooth the cream evenly over the entire head of hair.

, Draw a part into one side of your hair using a standard comb.


Position the part to the edge of the crown. It can rest on either the right or left side.

, Set a blow dryer to low speed and begin drying your hair. As you operate the dryer, use the fingers of your free hand to position your locks.









Starting at the part, work the hair at the top of your head in the direction opposite the part. Continue over the entire crown and toward the side of your head.
Guide the hair at the other side of your part in the opposite direction, pushing the sides straight down.

, Use a comb to push the hair at the sides of your head back and away from your face.









For the lower half of each side, focus on directing the hair back.
For the upper half of each side, start directing the hair upward and toward the top of your head. If the hair at your sides is long enough to reach the top of your head, you should direct it so that it does.

, Brush or comb the product through your hair, concentrating on the ends. The heavier the serum, the straighter it will keep your hair.If your hair is only slightly curly, you may be able to straighten it with mousse and a straightening comb alone. Skip the hair dryer, and instead allow your hair to air dry with the serum distributed through it.

, A flat iron allows you to straighten every curl, regardless how short. Isolate 1- to 2-inch sections of dry hair. Clamp the flat iron around each section at your scalp, then slowly drag it downward to the ends of your hair. Repeat for each section of hair.

, Because curly hair tends to frizz after heat is applied, you should complete your straight style by applying a pea-sized amount of pomade wax to your locks. The pomade not only adds weight to your hair, but it also seals out moisture that could frizz your straight style.

Spray dry shampoo or texture spray on your bobby pins so they are less likely to slip out of your hair.
Remember that bobby pins should be used with the wavy side facing your scalp since the ridges are there to grip your hair and lock everything in place., Brush your bangs, or the hair closest to your face, out towards the ceiling and pull them back on the top of your head, leaving a little poof. Just tease the section of hair from temple to temple, and then push it against where you normally part your hair to increase lift.Secure the bangs with bobby pins or a barrette.

, Once you've created and pinned a poof with your bangs, you can create a messy but stylish updo with the rest of your hair.

Insert the pins into your hair and rotate them the opposite direction of your hair twist in order to hide the pin.To achieve a tighter style and hide you pins, just point the open end of the pin against the direction that your hair is pulled. Then rotate the pin so the open end is now facing the same direction as the hair, and push it in toward your head to secure it.The pins will not only pull your hair tighter but also be unnoticeable beneath your tresses.

, If you have enough length, pull your hair into a very small ""deer tail"" at the back. Secure it in place with a large clip or several bobby pins underneath it.

, If you don't have enough hair to braid it, try twisting it instead. Simply remove the fringe off your face by gradually winding small sections of it. Pin the coiled strands in place with bobby pins., Part your hair to one side, then brush the shorter half behind your ear before carefully securing it with bobby pins. Add volume to the opposite side by backcombing your roots with a comb and applying hairspray to set the style in place.

Then pull back a section from the top on each side of your center part to create two side parts extending to the backs of both your ears. Clip these two side sections of hair so they stay out of the way., With the section of your hair (the section in the middle of the back of your head that you have not clipped up yet), create two even ponytails a little bit above the nape of your neck. Tie these ponytails very close together in the middle of your head, so you can’t see the part separating them.Use small, thin, elastic hair ties to tie these ponytails.

, Twist each ponytail one at a time, twisting from the base of the ponytail down to the ends. When you get to the end of the ponytail, continue twisting. The ponytail will start to twist and wrap around itself. Wrap the ponytail around its base and tuck the ends into the elastic hair tie.Twist and wrap the other ponytail around its base and secure it, so you have two, small buns right next to each other.

, Unclip the two side sections of your hair, and twist back one section at a time, starting from your forehead. Continue to twist the hair back towards the two small buns. Lay the twisted side section over the top of the two buns, and wrap it underneath if your hair is long enough.Twist the other side section of your hair, and again, lay that section over the top of the two buns, overlapping the first twisted side section.

If you have fine and soft hair, spray a little bit of shine spray all over. If your hair is a bit thicker, wavy, and coarse, add in a small amount of cream or gel., Pull all of your hair back so it lays behind your shoulders and separate your hair into four equal sections: one section on each side and two equal sections in the back.It may be easier to remember the braiding pattern if you number the strands of hair 1, 2, 3, 4 from the left.

, With your four sections of hair separated, take your right hand and grab the second section of hair from the left, section 2. Cross it all the way over to the right, over the other two sections of hair, sections 3 and 4. Keep holding that section of hair, section 2, over to the right.


Take the remaining two sections on the left side of your head, sections 3 and 1, and twist them so section 3 twists over section 1, and section 3 is the new leftmost section of hair.
Mirror and repeat this process from the right side of your head: Take the second section of hair from the right, section 4, and cross it over the two left side sections of hair, sections 3 and 1. Keep holding section 4 all the way over to the left.

You will want strips about 3 times the length of your hair and 3 inches (7.6 cm) wide.Curling your hair with a flannel rag instead of heat is a great way to maintain the health of your hair and prevent damage to your long locks.
Cut as many strips as you would like to have as curlers in your hair. More curlers will make tighter curls, while using more hair in each curl will make the curls looser.

, Once you decide how many curls you would like to put in your hair, separate your hair into even sections to ensure the curls will match. Hold these sections in place with a hair clip., Styling lotion will give you a decent hold, without making your hair stiff. Rub some lotion between your palms, then pull it through your section of hair until it is slightly damp, but not wet., Place the flannel strip at the top of this section of hair, leaving about six inches of excess flannel at the top. Hold the top of the section of hair and the rag in one hand like the top of a ponytail with a rag running alongside it. Wrap the hair around the rag until you reach an inch and a half of hair left to twist.Be sure that you are wrapping the hair around the rag and not taking the rag around the hair. Wrapping the rag around the hair at this point will give you straight hair rather than curls.
To get more spiral to your curls, twist the section of hair in one direction as you wrap it around the rag.
Once you have completed wrapping the hair around the rag, you should not see the rag under the hair. The wraps of hair should be close enough that the rag is not visible between each wrap.

, Wrap the rag around the remaining end of this section of hair. Once you have reached the bottom of your hair, start working your way back up. Now you will be wrapping your rag around the coils of hair to hold them in place.Once you have wrapped the rag all the way back to the top, tie it securely in a knot with the 6 inches (15.2 cm) of flannel you left at the top when you began.

, Repeat this process with each section of hair, wrapping the hair around the rag, then the rag around the hair and tying it off. Keep your sections of hair as even as possible in order to have consistent curls., This could be the hardest part, but if you have grown your hair this long, you probably have the patience to wait it out. It is best to begin this entire process at least 24 hours before you want your style to be complete. At the very least, create your curls early in the evening, then sleep on them.


Wrapped hair takes a long time to dry. The more hair you used in each section, the longer it will take to dry.
If you need to speed up the drying time, you can sit under a bonnet hair dryer for an hour to finish off the process.

, Once your hair is dry, untie the flannel from the top section of your curl. Gently unwrap the rag from the outside of the curl. If the hair was wrapped perfectly around the rag, you should be able to pull the rag straight down and out of the center of the curl.If the rag does not pull easily out of the curl, gently unwrap the curl until you can pull the rag through.

, Once you remove your rags, you should have a head full of tight spiral curls. There are several ways you can separate and style them to get different looks.Brush your curls out with a bristle brush for a smooth, wavy, old-school Hollywood look.
Separate the spirals into multiple spirals using your fingers to twist each section into several different curls.
Flip your head upside-down and tussle it with your fingers for a messy-chic style.

, Choose a hairspray with natural ingredients and no harsh chemicals. Go for a light or medium-hold spray which allows some movement and bounce in your curls."

Separate the top half of your hair from the bottom half.,
Create a loop using a half ponytail.,
Pull the sides of the loop to secure your half pony tail and give it a nice shape.,
Try two half ponytails for variety.",How to Style Waist Length Hair3," Using your fingers, gather the top half of your hair. Place both index fingers at your temples, then run them upward, toward the crown of your head until they meet at the top. Gather this hair together in one hand.


Avoid running your fingers directly across the back of your head from the temples. This will create an uneven split, putting most of your hair in the ponytail and only leaving a small portion on the bottom.

, Wrap a rubber band around the hair you have gathered near the crown of your head. Wrap the rubber band until you feel it is secure. On the final wrap, pull most of the ponytail through, but leave the end in the rubber band, holding it in a large loop.

, Grab the hair closest to the rubber band between your thumb and forefinger. Using equal pressure on both sides, gently pull outward, putting pressure on the rubber band and forcing it closer to your scalp.


You should feel the gathered hair tightening toward your scalp.
Pull the hair in your half ponytail outward to give it more volume and shape.
If some of your hair falls out of the rubber band, you will need to take the ponytail out and wrap it all again with the rubber band.

, Wrapping the top half of your hair into a loop leaves the bottom half free and long. Get the rest of your hair out of the way or mix up the style by repeating the half ponytail with the bottom half of your hair giving you two loops in the back, one above the other.


Start the bottom ponytail underneath the top loop to hide the rubber band and create a stacked effect.
Consider decorating with stylish hair pins between the two loops.

Gather your hair into a ponytail at the nape of your neck.,
Pull your ponytail through the center of your hair between your scalp and the rubber band.,
Tuck the ends underneath the rolls to finish off the look.",How to Style Waist Length Hair4," Brush your hair well and secure it with a rubber band at the nape of your neck. Leave this pony tail loose and have some slack between your scalp and the rubber band.

, Run both hands down the back of your head to find the center of your hair where it meets the rubber band. Separate the hair here with your fingers, creating a hole large enough to fit your pony tail. Fold your ponytail underneath the rubber band and through the hole. Grab the ponytail with the thumb and forefinger of you other hand to pull the entire ponytail up through the hole. Fold it back over the rubber band, which should now be folded under a roll of hair.


Repeat this two or three times, making a hole and pulling the ponytail through until you have rolls running down both sides of your head.

, After you have created several inches of rolls on the sides of your head, fold your remaining hair under and tuck the ends into the center near your rubber band. Pin the ends securely to the scalp, creating a loosely folded bun in the back.

Hold your bun in place with chopsticks.,
Decorate with a second chopstick.,
Separate the rest of your hair into quarters.,
Braid each quarter.",How to Style Waist Length Hair5," Run your fingers from your temple to the crown of your head to gather the top half of your hair. Wrap a rubber band around this portion of hair to create a ponytail to work with.

, Start at the base of your ponytail and twist the hair in one direction. Take this rolled section around the rubber band in a circle. Continue layering circles around the outside of the last roll until you have reached the end of your ponytail and created a nice bun.


Tuck the end of the ponytail under the the bun to hide the loose ends.

, Hold the bun with one hand. With the other hand, push a chopstick into the side of he bun at the center. Angle the chopstick down toward the scalp, then back up into the bun to gather more hair and back down toward the scalp as you push the chopstick horizontally through the bun. Continue weaving the chopstick through the bun until it comes out the other side and holds the bun securely in place.

, One chopstick is enough to hold the bun securely in place, but you can use a second chopstick for the look. Insert the other chopstick at a 45 degree angle to the horizontal one, pushing it from the top corner of the bun and out the other side.


Now that the top half is done, you can leave your hair like that if you like, or move on to braiding the loose section.

, Run your fingers through the center of your loose hair to separate it into halves. Secure one half with a rubber band to get it out of the way, then split the other half into two even sections. Secure these with rubber bands and remove the one on the other half. Separate this half into two even sections. Secure one with a rubber band.


The loose quarter will be the first you work with.

, Separate a quarter of your hair into 3 even sections. Braid right over center, then left over center until your are left with about 4 inches (10.2 cm) at the end. Tie the braid in place with a rubber band and continue this process with the other 3 quarters.


Drape the braids in front of your shoulders, two on each side.

Longer styles can actually accentuate thinning hair. Trim hair on a regular basis to keep it from getting too long.

, This style is best for men with thicker hair on the sides and back and thinning hair in front or on top. A textured crop uses uneven layers to blend thinning hair with thicker hair to make thinner spots less noticeable.

Make sure your hair is completely dry.,
Preheat your iron.,
Wrap a section of hair loosely around your curling iron.,
Hold the strand straight as it cools down.,
Move on to the next strand.,
Finish up with a texturizing spray.",How to Style Shoulder Length Hair2," Using a styling iron on wet hair can seriously damage it. If you wash your hair daily, shampoo and condition it before you begin. Add a heat-protecting product before blow-drying.If your hair is naturally wavy or has loose curls, then it's already in perfect shape for a shoulder-length cut. Instead of heat styling, simply spritz in a little texturizing spray.
If your hair is naturally very curly, you can still style it into waves. However, you will likely need to straighten your hair first.

, For boho waves, you can use any type of curling wand. However, specialty waving wands may be easier to work with.Be sure to have a heat-resistant or ""thermal"" glove on hand to keep from burning your skin as you style.

, With one hand, separate out a one-to-two inch section of hair. Wrap it around your styling iron, leaving at least an inch of unwrapped hair at the tip. Shoulder-length hair only needs to be wrapped two or three times around a medium curling wand.

, Release the section from your iron after 10 to 15 seconds.With your gloved hand, hold the tip of the section out away from your head. It may seem counterintuitive to straighten your freshly-curled locks back out, but this will give them the relaxed, effortless boho look.

, Take a second section of hair and curl it just like you did the first. Repeat this process until all of your hair is in waves, moving from one side of your head to the other.


Don't worry about making your strands the same size, as a little unevenness will give your hair a more natural look.
Likewise, don't wrap each section around your wand in exactly the same way. Alternate directions when winding and start at slightly different lengths., Texturizing sprays are a relatively new type of product specifically designed to create a dry look without leaving behind residue. Spray a light dusting on your hair to mimic tousled, sea breeze-kissed texture. Afterwards, give your locks a quick finger comb, and your perfect boho curls are done."

Put your hair back into a basic ponytail.,
Make an opening through your hair above the hair tie.,
Flip your ponytail around and draw it into the opening.,
Flip your ponytail around a second time.",How to Style Shoulder Length Hair3," Use an elastic hair tie to hold it in place. Any type of simple ponytail will work, and placement is entirely up to you. High, mid, low, side, and center ponytails can all be made into a Gibson tuck.



Gibson tucks, also known as Gibson girl buns, are great for shoulder-length hair, as only a short length of hair is necessary to create a complicated-looking updo.
With practice, a Gibson bun takes only a few minutes to do. It's a great alternative to a plain ponytail for days where you want your hair out of the way but don't want to spend a lot of time styling., Using your fingers, create a hole wide enough for your ponytail to fit through directly above the hair tie holding it in place. Be careful not to undo your ponytail or loosen it too much. Keep it open with your thumb and index finger while moving on to the next step., Take the tip of your ponytail in your free hand and flip it around towards your head. Gently pull it through the opening you made. You may need to twist your ponytail into a spiral before flipping it to move through the hole more easily. Once it's through, tug it downward so that the free end resembles a shorter version of your original ponytail., Without creating a new hole, flip the ponytail back around. Tuck the tip and any loose hair into the pocket formed by the first loop around. Finish the bun by securing it in place with a few bobby pins.


You can spice up this look by leaving one or two loose strands while you make your initial ponytail. Work these strands into thin braids and tuck their ends into the pocket of your finished bun."

Don't go out in the cold with wet hair.,
Swap out your cotton towel.,
Avoid brushing wet hair.,
Be careful with hair ties.",How to Style Wet Hair6," If it's very cold outside, wet hair can actually freeze, which can cause breakage. To avoid this, make sure to get your hair reasonably dry before going out when it's below freezing., If you're accustomed to wrapping your hair in a cotton towel, you may be causing damage to your hair without even knowing it. Try swapping out your towel for a microfiber one, which will be much gentler on wet hair.Gently patting your hair with the towel instead of wrapping it will also help prevent damage.

, Hair is at its weakest and most vulnerable when it is wet, so avoid using your regular brush to detangle wet strands. Instead, separate your strands with your fingers, or if necessary, with a wide-toothed comb. This will cause much less damage to your hair., Tying your hair back with hair ties can also cause damage if you're not careful. Be sure to choose the right kind of hair ties and try to keep your hair bands a little loose, especially when your hair is wet.Never use rubber bands to tie back your hair, as these can cause a lot of damage.Always use seamless ponytail holders to avoid snagging your hair.
You put a lot of stress on certain sections of your hair when you tie it up in the same style frequently. Try switching up your style frequently to avoid damage.
Hair ties cause even more damage to hair when it is very wet. Ideally, you should not use hair ties until your hair has dried at least somewhat. Tying up damp hair is fine. If you don't have time to dry your hair at all, you may want to consider using clips and bobby pins to hold your hair back instead of elastic ties.

, Apply a smoothing serum to your hair from the roots to the tips. You can use a product especially made for straightening hair or simply an anti-frizz serum or gel., The straight, sleek style looks best when your hair is parted on one side or the other, rather than straight down the middle. Use a comb to part your hair smooth it down in the correct direction., Use a blow dryer and a round brush to blow your hair dry and smooth. Use the brush to pick your hair up at the roots, then run the brush through your hair as you dry it. Continue until all of your hair is completely dry.

Don't hold the hair dryer too close to your head, or your hair may frizz up and look less straight and sleek than you want it to.
Don't use a diffuser, since this tool prevents air from flowing over your hair in a direct stream, resulting in waves, not straight hair.

, Heat up and iron and use it to touch up areas that you weren't able to completely straighten with the blow dryer. Concentrate on the tips of your hair., This style looks pretty when the bangs are swept to the side opposite from the part.

Tame bed head with a topknot.",How to Style Poofy Hair," Check your shampoo for sodium laureth/lauryl sulfate or ammonium laureth/lauryl sulfate, especially if your hair is naturally curly. These ingredients dry out the hair terribly, making your hair puffier and bigger. If you can’t find any shampoos that don’t have these ingredients, look for shampoo bars, which are sulfate-free., Silicone-based ingredients build up on the hair, and only drying sulfates remove them. Any ingredient that ends the suffixes -cone or -xane is a silicone. Some common ones are dimethicone, cyclomethicone, and amodimethicone. However, amodimethicone is a lot easier to remove than some others.

, Don’t go by names alone. Many shampoos and conditioners that are marketed to combat frizz contain sulfates. Opt for moisturizing ingredients. Some good choices include:Aloe vera
Grape extract
Avocado oil
Olive extract
Shea butter
Basil
Hibiscus

, Always use conditioner after using shampoo. Follow the ingredients on the bottle. Some conditioners are formulated to be left in the hair, while others should be rinsed out after a few minutes. Good moisturizing ingredients include:Macadamia oil
Jojoba oil
Coconut oil
Argan oil

, Apply a deep-conditioning hair mask once a week. Look for oil-infused masks to fight frizz. This is especially important if you live in a hot and/or humid climate, since heat has significant drying effects on the hair.Look for hydrating ingredients such as:


Shea butter
Glycerine
Proteins
Fatty acids
Any kind of natural oil, such as coconut oil, lavender oil, or jojoba oil

, Have a skilled hairdresser do this. Thinning tools should only be used on the ends of your hair to prevent excess weight at the bottom.Your hair dresser should only use thinning shears on dry hair or a razor on wet hair. If they deviate from this rule, they’ll damage your hair and actually cause more frizz than you originally had., Poofy hair should be at least shoulder-length to weigh down the frizz. Layers prevent your hair from belling out at the bottom. Make sure your layers start between your chin and your lip. From there, they should angle to the back of your head., Do this about every eight weeks. Regular trimmings will remove any split ends, which make your hair look even frizzier. If your hair tends to dry in the winter months (or in the summer if you live in an arid climate), get your hair trimmed more often, about every six weeks., Do this while your hair is still wet. You could even do it while you’re in the shower. Combing or brushing dry hair will only worsen the frizz.









Combing a spray-on detangler through your hair helps to remove stubborn tangles. You can buy many different brands in department stores or from your hairdresser. Just remember to avoid sulfates.

, Choose the formula that’s right for your hair. If you have coarse or thick hair, look for a serum with Argan, Amla, Camellia, and







, If your hair is straight or wavy, set your hair dryer on a medium setting without any attachments (“rough drying”) until it’s about 80 percent dry. If your hair is very curly, rough-dry until your hair about 70 percent dry. Add a nozzle or diffuser to complete the drying cycle.








Consider buying a high-voltage ionic blow dryer. This will help to tame stubborn frizz as you dry your hair.

, Too much heat can damage your hair and make your frizz worse! Let your hair air dry whenever possible. Use a soft-textured towel to blot (not rub) the excess water out of your hair. This will reduce the amount of time it will take for your hair to dry completely.Avoid touching your hair while it’s drying. Touching it will make it frizzy. Plus, it will make your hair expand.

, Choose a ceramic flat iron. It’s less expensive than titanium and other coatings. Even better, it flattens your hair at a lower heat, which is better at taming frizz. Most ceramic flat irons use ionizing technology, which seals your hair cuticles and actually neutralizes poofy hair.







, Flip your head upside down. Collect your hair at the top of your head, and tie it in a ponytail. Twist your hair into a loop, and pin it in place at the top of your head. This will keep wild fly-away hair under control.

Blow dry your hair.,
Use a texturizing spray.,
Style your hair with pomade.",How to Style Short Hair2," Shampoo and condition your hair as usual to prepare it for the wavy, tousled look. Use products that add body and volume to your hair, rather than shampoo and conditioner designed for straightening hair. Pat the moisture from your hair with a towel when you're finished., For this look, it's best if you use a diffuser. This device diffuses the flow of hot air so that it preserves your hair's natural curls and waves. If you don't have a diffuser, use a the lowest heat setting on your hair dryer to thoroughly dry your hair., Salt-based sprays work well for this purpose - they give layers of hair a ""piecey,"" textured look. If you don't have texturizing spray, you can make your own by mixing salt and water. Spray it all over your hair and use your fingers to scrunch the tips., Rub a small amount of pomade between your hands, then run your hands through your hair. Smooth the top of your hair forward from back to front, then sweep your bangs to one side of the other. Smooth it down in the back and on the sides."

If you want to spruce up your roots, use dry shampoo instead of wetting your hair., Squirt some extra-strength gel onto your hand and run it up the section of hair from the roots to the tips. Hold it in place for a moment to make sure it stays spiked., Grab a section of hair at a time and apply the gel in the same way. Make the spikes even, or alternate smaller spikes with larger ones. Continue until you've made as many spikes as you desire., For extra hold, spray the spikes with some hair spray before you go about your day. Wearing a headband could also help to hold them in place."

Start with dry, unwashed hair.,
Comb your hair back.,
Spray it with hairspray.",How to Style Short Hair4," Since this style requires holding your hair in place against its natural grain, you'll want to start with hair that has a little natural oil distributed throughout to help hold it in place. Otherwise, your hair will want to flop forward., Use a comb to comb it away from your face and straight toward the back of your head. Then insert the comb at the roots and lift your hair from your head without pulling the comb through. This adds a little volume to the slicked back style.

For a super slicked look, skip the volume-adding technique and simply comb your hair back as close to your scalp as possible.
For a less severe look, part your hair on one side and slick it around the front and then back, rather than combing straight back from the forehead.

, Use maximum-hold spray to hold the style in place. Be sure to apply plenty to the sides, front, and top of your hair, the part that will tend to move out of place after a few hours.

Consider wearing a headband to keep your hair from coming forward if yours tends to come loose from hairspray.
You can also pin your bangs back with barrettes to keep the slicked back style in place.

Divide your hair into two sections.
Twist one side tight and hold it in place with a clip and repeat on next side.
Being careful not to let go of the two strands of hair, pull together and tie into ponytail.
When you have done that, you should have a slight gap or hole between the twists just at the top of the elastic. Pull rest of the ponytail into the gap and pin in place.

,

Take two sections on each side of your head before your ears reach.
Brush one side back and plait or twist (depending which suits you) and clip in place.
Repeat on both sides.
Tie at the back of your head. The higher the better to create the princess crown look.

Clips can give your hair dimension and style. Try pulling your hair back and adding butterfly or flower shaped clips.
Bows and ribbons can make your hair look shiny and pretty especially if it is a large bow at the back of your hair.
Headbands can be so pretty on short hair and make your hair look fuller if pulled all the way back. Also ones with flowers, bows, and so on on them can add height to the headband.

Wear headbands. In Gossip Girl, Blair Waldorf has a signature look: headbands. An athlete's alternative to headbands are headwraps - slip one around your head and tie your hair in a ponytail.






Wear barrettes. Mix and match different colors to keep it interesting and accentuate your girliness.;
, Adding ribbons can bring a personal touch, and can even gain you a signature look. Make sure that the ponytail goes well with your face shape.

, Do this if your hair is naturally wavy and/or to break up the monotony of wearing it straight. Apply some frizz serum or a little mousse to your hair if it's frizzing up. If you use too much product, however, you'll lose the natural look that is characteristic of a preppy ‘do.

, These should be loose and low under your ears. Tie them with either ribbons that match your outfit or everyday elastics.

, This is a good look for bad hair days. If you feel your outfit is looking a little bland or your hair is being unruly, apply braids liberally. Don't do this if your hair is cut into layers; hair strands sticking out of your braids makes it look more messed up than preppy.

, This is a classic and never goes out of style. Avoid wearing it too high on the head, as this look is not flattering on everyone.

, This adds a bit of a boho-chic look to your preppy style.

, Wear loose or in tight spiral curls for special occasions.

Take your hair's texture into account.,
Consider your hair's level of oiliness.,
Think about the occasion.",How to Style Long Hair1," While any type of hair can be made into most styles with enough products and techniques, your natural hair type will determine how easy a style is to create and maintain.


If your hair is naturally straight and fine, it can be difficult to keep long hair looking volumized. You will need to invest in a curling iron if you want to add some waves or curls to your look.
If your hair is curly or frizzy but you want your hair to fall straight and look longer, you will have to straighten it using a flat iron or chemical relaxers.
If you are considering box braids, keep in mind that your hair's thickness will likewise determine the type of braid that works best. Thick hair can be much more difficult to braid into small strands. Likewise, thinner hair can be damaged if made into too-thick braids.;
, If your hair is very dry, this can be remedied with hair oils and other hair treatments. However, hair that is naturally very oily must be washed more often to look clean and stay hygienic. If you have oily hair, consider avoiding hairstyles that can come apart with frequent washings, such as box braids and dreadlocks., A major aspect of choosing a hairstyle is what you will be doing while wearing that style.


Long hair can be difficult for athletes to keep. If you have long hair and are about to engage in sports, wear a style that will keep your hair out of your face and prevent it from hindering your movements. Good choices are tied-back ponytails, secure buns, and braids.While most long hair styles are appropriate for women to wear in formal or business occasions, long hair for men can be more difficult to pull off. You will most likely need to tie your hair back in some way, either as a simple ponytail or as the currently trendy ""man bun."""

, This works mainly with the layered hairstyles that just don't look good when left untouched. Figure out what works for you face shape and length. This works best with straight hair. Basically, there is not a single 'rule' when it comes to styling your hair with edge. It all depends on you, but for basic layers this works well. Starting with the hair framing your face, take small sections of hair, and close the iron onto the hair about two thirds down, and with a swift motion, sweep and flip the iron so you have a flippy piece of hair framing your face. Do the same on both sides. After this, use the same technique, except varying how much hair you take and how far down you start the flip. This works well on the sides of the head, the back can simply be left or flipped slightly. The closer to the bottom the hair is flipped, the edgier.

However, don't wrap too far up from your base or your bun will not be stable. Keep wrapping your hair until the entire length is coiled into a bun. Finish by wrapping the tip under a coil or back through the hair tie if you can still reach it.

Get her to sit down in front of you.,
Brush out any tangles.",How to Style a Little Girl's Hair1," Before you style your little girl's hair, it's a good idea to have the necessary equipment and accessories ready and easily at hand.

You may also need things like a flat iron, curling tongs or hair dryer.;
, Little girls don't always enjoy having their hair done and their impatient wiggling can make it difficult to do their hair right.


Therefore, it is a good idea to have her sit in front of you -- on either a high stool or a cushion on the floor (if you're also sitting) -- and give her something to look at while you're working, such as a cartoon, a book or a Nintendo.
Hopefully she'll be so engrossed in whatever she's doing that she'll sit still and forget to complain when you pull her hair!

Crimp, curl or straighten her hair.,
Twist the front sections of hair back.,
Try bantu knot curls.",How to Style a Little Girl's Hair2," Even if you're not doing elaborate braids or involved up-dos, it's nice to put at least a bit of effort into making your little girl's hair look nice. You can do this quickly and easily using styling tools like flat irons, curling tongs and crimping irons.



Flat iron: If your little girl tends to have curly, wavy or frizzy hair, straightening it with a flat iron can totally transform her appearance (for special occasions). In addition, it is often a good idea to straighten her hair before you attempt certain up-styles or braids, as sleek, straightened hair can be easier to work with. Make sure to use a generous amount of heat protection spray before you start and remember to work in small section. You can find more detailed instructions on flat ironing hair.

Curl: Little girls look so pretty with curls in their hair. You can go for tight, ringlet-y curls, soft pretty waves or just a simple flick if the ends, all with the help of a curling iron. You can find more information on how to use one here. If you prefer not to use heat, you can try scrunching her hair with a little mousse or making rag roller curlers.

Crimp: A third option is to crimp her hair -- this is more interesting than plain, straight hair and a little funkier than curled hair. You can buy a crimping iron online or at beauty supply stores quite cheaply. The process itself is very easy -- you simply clamp the iron over a section of hair and hold it for 10-20 seconds before releasing. If you don't want to use heat, you can achieve a similar crimped effect by putting mini braids in her hair while it's wet (8 to 12 total), then taking them out once it's dry.

, A cute and easy way to add a bit of interest to your little girl's hair is to twist back the front sections and secure them with a cute barrette or alligator clip.


To do this style, part her hair down the middle or slightly off center -- whichever you prefer. Then take a small front section of hair from one side and twist it towards her head. Secure with a barrette, then repeat on opposite side. And you're done!
You could also try doing double twist backs, where you twist two sections of hair on each side of her head. A variation on this is to twist both pieces towards her head, then wrap both of the twisted sections around each other, in the opposite direction. This creates a pretty effect.
Instead of twisting, you could make a simple braid on either side of her face, then pull them back and secure with a barrette.

, Bantu knot curls are a fun way of curling your little girls hair. These curls are looser and more natural-looking than curls made with a curling iron or hair curlers.


Starting with damp hair, divide the hair into even, precise sections. The number of sections will depend on how thick your little girl's hair is and how tight you want the curls to be -- the smaller the sections, the curlier hair will be.
Work a significant amount of styling gel, mousse or pomade into each section of hair, then start twisting from the roots. Keep twisting until you reach the tips, then give the hair an extra few turns -- it should start to coil in on itself.
Once the hair had started to coil, wrap the rest of the twisted hair around itself and pin to the scalp using some bobby pins. The hair should form a little knot or funnel-shape.
Repeat this process until there is a bantu knot in each individual section of hair. If you do it neatly enough, the bantu knots can make a cute hairstyle on their own! But if you want curls, leave the knots in until your hair is completely dry (you have to allow the hair to dry naturally, you can't use a hairdryer for this).
When the hair is dry, remove the bobby pins and gently untwist the knots. Apply a little light pomade or leave-in conditioner to your hands and finger-comb the curls, gently working them into the desired style. Do not use a hairbrush or her hair will look frizzy instead of curly."

Do a ballerina bun.,
Do pigtails.,
Do a pin curl crown.,
Do zig-zag ponytails.,
Do a bow-shaped bun.",How to Style a Little Girl's Hair3," A classic ponytail is a quick, easy hairstyle for little girls. However, ponytails can be a little boring, so here are some tips on how to jazz them up:



Cover the hair tie: Cover up the hair tie by taking a strand of hair from underneath the ponytail and wrapping it around the hair tie. Secure with a couple of bobby pins.

Do a quiff: Before you put her hair into a ponytail, separate a section from above her forehead (where her bangs would be). Put the hair into a sleek ponytail, leaving this front section free. Lift the front section and start teasing it at the back, until you have a lot of volume. Then twist the ends and pin them on top of the head with some bobby pins. She now has a cute quiff hairstyle.

Add accessories: Rather than do anything with the ponytail itself, you should think about adding some accessories like ribbons, hair bows and fake or fresh flowers to the hairstyle. You can make adorable homemade hair bows for fraction of the store price using just a little ribbon and hot glue.

, A ballerina bun is a pretty, elegant hairstyle which looks great for parties and events but will also keep your little girl's hair out of her face if she's dancing, skating or playing sports.

Use a comb to tease the hair (backcomb) to give it volume. Twist the backcombed hair and wrap it around the base of the ponytail to form a bun on top of the head. Use bobby pins to secure the base of the bun to her head. Spritz the bun with some hairspray to smooth any fly-aways.Alternatively, you can use a doughnut-shaped bun foundation (available in beauty supply stores) to make a perfect bun. Simply slip the ponytail through the center of the ring, then spread the hair evenly around the bun foundation and secure with an elastic. Tuck in any loose ends and secure with bobby pins. Spritz with hairspray to smooth any fly-aways.

Split hair straight down the middle and divide the hair into two equal sections. Now decide what kind of look you want to achieve with the pigtails.
The first thing to think about it placement -- do you want high pigtails on top of her head? Low pigtails with her hair streaming over her shoulders? Do you want them at the back of her head (where they can't be seen from the front) or at the sides (where they can clearly be seen)?
Then you need to think about what style you want. Do you want to braid them, fishtail them, leave them loose or curl them? You can also dress up the pigtails by adding some pretty ribbons or bows.

, This upstyle makes a very pretty hairdo for special occasions and events -- it would look perfect on a little flower girl!


Brush out the hair and make an off-center parting on whichever side of her head you prefer. Make another parting from one ear to the other. Scoop up all of the hair in front of one ear and make a low ponytail with a small elastic. Do the same on the other side.
Divide the remaining hair into a number of low ponytails, all around the head. The exact number of ponytails will depend on how much hair your little girl has -- but it will usually be somewhere between four and eight.
Starting on one side of her head, take the first ponytail and spritz it with water or hair spray until it's sleek and easy to manage. Wrap the hair around your first two fingers a couple of times, ensuring that the ends point towards the back.
Remove your fingers from the center and use some bobby pins to pin the curl flat against her head, directly above the next ponytail. You are essential making a pincurl.
Do the same thing with all of the ponytails around her head. Don't worry if the bobby pins are a little obvious, you'll be covering most of them up later.
When you get to the last pincurl, pin it backwards towards the previous pincurl rather than pinning it forwards. You may need to readjust the spacing a little bit to make it fit.
When all of the pin curls are in place, spray each one individually with hairspray. Then, take a flower pin or bow and place it in the center of each pin curl. This adds extra flair and helps to cover up the bobby pins. You could even use fresh flowers if you like!, This hairstyle makes a funky alternative to regular ponytail pigtails. It looks cool but also keeps the hair out of her face!


Divide the hair into six sections at the back of the head: two at the top, two in the middle and two at the bottom. Use colored hair ties to put the top two sections of hair into ponytail pigtails.
Cross the two pigtails over each other and join the hair from the pigtails with the two middle sections of hair. Make another two ponytail pigtails with this hair, using more colored hair ties.
Cross the middle pigtails over one another then join the hair with the two bottom sections of hair. Make two final ponytail pigtails with colored hair ties.
Use a comb to make the partitions between the sections as straight and neat as possible. The more even and symmetrical the hair is, the better it will look., A bow-shaped bun is an adorable Lady Gaga-inspired hairstyle perfect for crazy hair days or playing dress-up.


Start tying your little girl's hair into a high ponytail. After the last twist, don't pull the ponytail all the way through the hair tie. Pull the hair about halfway through so there is a loop of hair sticking above the ponytail. The ends of the hair should be spilling out underneath.
Use your fingers to evenly divide the loop of hair at the top of the ponytail into two parts. These two parts will form the loops of the bow.
Grab the loose hair underneath and brush it and spritz it with water or hair gel to get it sleek and smooth. Pull it up between the two loops of hair to form the center of the bow.
Divide this center piece in half. Take one half and wrap it underneath one side of the bow, securing with bobby pins when you reach the back. Tuck any remaining loose hair into the center of the bow loop, then secure the bottom of the loop with a bobby pin.
Do the same with the other half of hair on the other side of the bow. Use your fingers to fluff out both sides of the bow and make the loops look nice and full. Use some hair spray to flatten any flyaway hairs and help the bow hold its shape."

Run a comb from your forehead to your crown.,
Slick back the sides.,
Continue back-combing to create the shape you want.",How to Slick Your Hair Back1," The slicked-back look stays in place better when you start with damp hair. The hair will finish drying in a slicked position, helping it stay in place all day long. Shampoo your hair and towel it dry to begin.





;
, Use your fingers to apply a liberal amount of strong-hold pomade to your hair, focusing on the top and sides. Pomade is the classic product used to create this look. A strong-hold pomade is essential to keep your hair slicked back until you wash it out.









Pomade was classically oil-based. Oil-based pomade creates the classic sheen and hold that made the slicked look popular. However, oil is difficult to wash out, so you may want to look for a strong-hold pomade that does not list oil as a main ingredient.
Gel is a good alternative if your hair isn't too thick. Gel typically results in a dryer hold and may take on a slightly crunchy texture. This works best with finer, lighter hair types, since it may not be strong enough to hold heavier hair in place.

, Use a fine-toothed barber comb and slick your hair straight back from your forehead to the crown of your head. The classic slick does not include a part, so just run the comb straight back. Do this several times so that the top or your hair lies flat in straight pattern from front to back.








, Place the comb at your right temple and run it to the back of your head. Now do the same on the left side. The hair on the sides of your head should flow in a slicked pattern from front to back.








, In most cases, six or seven comb-throughs, or ""slicks,"" should be enough to create this quick style. You want to style your hair in as few slicks as possible to keep the pomade evenly distributed in your hair. If you handle it too much, it may begin to look messy.

Use a dime sized amount of gel, wax, or pomade.,

Use hair gel for a wet look.,
Go for hair wax for a matte look.,
Apply pomade for a slick, styled look.,
Try hair mousse for more volume.,
Look for hair products with protection and hold.",How to Spike Your Hair," It is important to start with clean hair that is free of any product. Start by washing your hair with a quality shampoo and conditioner. Look for a shampoo that is made for your hair type. If you have thick hair, avoid using too much conditioner as you do not want your hair to be too slick to hold on to any product.If you have curly hair, you should opt for shampoo and conditioner that does not contain heavy ingredients, like coconut oil, as this will make your hair curlier and more difficult to spike.;
, Once you get out of the shower, you should towel dry your hair until it is dry but still slightly damp. It is easier to style your hair in spikes if it is slightly damp to the touch.








Some hair experts recommend blow drying your hair after a shower, especially if you have longer strands of hair on the top of your head. Once your hair is completely dry, you can then style it into spikes. However, this option may not be ideal if you have dry hair or thick hair, as blow drying it can make it more difficult to work with.

, If you have curly short hair, you may need to remove tangles or knots before it can be spiked. Gently run the comb through your hair so there are no knots. You can also use a hairbrush to do this. Make sure your hair is still slightly damp when you comb or brush it.Combing your hair will also reduce any frizziness and make it easier to style your hair into spikes.

, When you are using hair products, it’s always best to start with a small amount and add more as you go. Begin with a dime sized amount of the hair gel, wax, or pomade, placing it in the palm of your hand.








You should then warm up the gel, wax, or pomade by rubbing it between your hands. Make sure you get the product on your fingers as you will be using your fingers to run the product through your hair.

, You should then apply the gel, wax, or pomade to the front section of your hair, coating your hair fully. Use your fingers to run the product from the roots of your hair to the tips in a combing motion. Do this two to three times until spikes form in the front section of your hair.








You can also use hair mousse if you feel your hair is too thin and limp. Only apply a very small amount of hair mousse to your hands and run it through the front section of your hair in an upward motion.
If you want more uniform spikes, you can use a comb to brush your hair upward. Do this while the gel or wax is still wet in your hair so the uniform spikes stay in place., Once you have achieved the spiked hair look, you should check it out in a mirror. You may want to twist a few of the spikes with your fingers for a more messy look. You can also smooth down the sides of your hair slightly with your fingers for a more clean, spiked look.









If you are worried about your hair staying in place, you may decide to use hairspray to finish off your look. Make sure you use hairspray that will not make your hair appear stiff, as you do not want your spikes to appear crunchy or greasy.

, You can touch up your spiked hair look throughout the day by using a small amount of gel, wax, or pomade on your locks. You may need to dampen your hair with water to touch it up. Always run the product upward through the front section of your hair and use a little at a time.








, Hair gel is ideal if you are going for a wet, spiked look. It will give your hair sheen and make it appear wet when it is in spikes. You can find hair gel at your local drugstore or online.








Hair gel is good for hair that tends to get dry and frizzy. Adding sheen to your dry hair can help it appear healthier and more styled.
Hair gel may not be ideal if you have oily hair or hair that get oily during the hot weather months. You may decide to use a hair wax instead, as it will not make you hair look too greasy.

, Hair wax is good if you are trying to avoid the wet look and go for a more matte, spiked style. You can find hair wax at your local drugstore or online.








This product is ideal for individuals with naturally oily or thick hair who do not want to end up looking greasy. Hair wax is also often used for individuals who have longer hair on the top of their head that they want to style.

, Pomade will give your hair shine and luster, as it is usually wax-based. It provides excellent hold and can be re-shaped throughout the day. Pomade can be found online as well as at your local drugstore.








Use pomade on wet hair for less hold and more shine, and on dry hair for more hold and less shine.

, You can also use hair mousse if you are looking to add some volume and definition to your spiked hair look. If your hair lacks natural volume, you may get hair mousse to give your hair a little extra weight and texture.








Hair mousse is also great for people with curly hair as it also helps to define your curls and prevents frizziness.

, No matter what you choose, you should check the label to ensure the product will protect your hair and provide long lasting hold. Using a product with good hold will ensure your spiked hair stays spiky and fresh throughout the day.


Some products boost a 24 hour hold, lasting for up to a day.Other products may advertise protection and hold for your hair. You may want to compare and contrast several hair products before choosing the right one for you.

Do a French braid.,
Do a side fishtail braid.,
Do a Rapunzel twist ponytail.,
Do braided flowers.,
Do a braided headband.",How to Style a Little Girl's Hair4," A French braid is a classic hairstyle which is very quick and easy once you get the hang of it. It is perfect for school mornings as it looks pretty but will also keep your little girl's hair looking neat and tidy throughout the day.


Take a section of hair from the top center of her head, just above the forehead. Divide it into three evenly-sized strands, just as you would with a normal braid.
Hold two sections in your right hand and one section in your left hand. Cross the section in your left hand into the center of the other two, then cross the outside section in your right hand into the center of the other two -- just as you would with a normal braid.
Continue braiding in this fashion, but before you cross over each strand grab a new piece of hair from the loose hair on same side of your head and join it with the strand that's crossing over.
The smaller the strands, the more intricate your French braids will be. Keep incorporating new hair until all of the hair has been picked up, then finish with a normal braid and tie with an elastic.

Variation: Make a neat center parting them braid the hair on either side of the parting to create pigtail French braids.

, The fishtail braid is easier to master than the French braid, but still looks intricate and beautiful.


Sweep your little girl's hair to the side of her head and tie a low ponytail with a small elastic. Divide the hair in two.
Take a thin strand of hair from the outside of the left section. Bring it over the left section and under the right section, combining it with the hair in the right section.
Next take a thin strand of hair from the outside of the right section. Bring it over the right section and under the left section, combining it with the hair in the left section.
Continue doing this for as long as possible. When you reach the thin hair at the bottom of the ponytail, you may need to switch to a normal braid.
You can make the strands as small or as large as you like -- using thinner strands will take longer, but will result in a more intricate-looking braid. Try to keep the strands of hair as evenly sized as possible, as this will make the finished braid look neater.
Tie the end with a small elastic. You can leave the braid as it is, or you can carefully cut the elastic at the top of the hair for a looser braid.

Variation: Once you've mastered the fishtail technique, you can try doing a French fishtail braid. This starts out like a regular French braid, but turns into a fishtail braid once all of the hair has been picked up.

, This simple hairstyle looks adorable on little girls with very long hair -- it will make them feel like beautiful princesses!


Pull hair into a high, tight ponytail on the back of the head. Divide the hair into two halves. Do a basic braid in one half, securing with a small elastic.
Twist the other half, then wrap the braided hair around the twisted hair. secure at the end with a small elastic.Variation: Wrap a bow around the top of the ponytail for added princess-factor!

, This cute hairstyle involves twisting a braid around itself to make a flower shape. The braided flower makes a nice alternative to hair bows and plastic flowers.


Pull hair into a nice tight ponytail, either at the back or side of the head. Separate a section of hair from the top of the ponytail and do a basic braid all the way to the end, securing with a small elastic.
Start twisting the braid around itself, making sure to keep the braid flat so the pattern is visible. After each rotation, discretely secure the braid with a bobby bin.
When you get to the unbraided section at the end, twist the air and tuck it beneath the finished flower, securing with a bobby pin.

Variation: Leave the hair loose, then do three of these braided flowers in a row along the back of her head or in a cluster above one of her ears., This is a pretty hairstyle you can do on little girls with long hair. It looks like a braided headband going across the top of her head.


Part hair down the middle then make a second parting from ear to ear, so the hair is split into four sections.
Take a small section of hair from behind the ear on the right side of her head. Do a basic braid all the way down to the end, then secure with a small elastic.
Pull the braid over the top of the head and secure with a couple of bobby pins behind the left ear (or slightly higher, if necessary). Make sure it is secured nice and tight, so the braid doesn't slide off the top of her head.
Take the loose front section of hair on the right side of her head and twist it inwards (towards her head). Pull it to the back of her head so it covers the starting point of the braid. Clip to temporarily secure.
Do the same on the left side of her head to cover the end of the braid and the bobby pins. Remove the clip and tie the two twisted sections together with a small elastic. Cover the elastic with a pretty hair bow or flower clip.

Variation: You can also make a double braided headband by doing a second braid starting on the left side of her head and pulling it towards the right."

, Use a fine-toothed barber comb to comb your hair back from your forehead to the crown of your head. Just comb each section once. For this style, you want the roots to maintain some volume, rather than lying completely flat.

Buy supplies.,
Choose to have a friend help or plan to do it yourself.,
Set up your bathroom barbershop.,
Trim your hair to 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm).",How to Shave Your Head1," If possible, invest in high quality shaving supplies. Good supplies will result in a closer shave and fewer nicks and scratches. You'll be saving money on shampoo and conditioner, so make up for it with the following items:


Electric clippers. You'll use clippers to trim your hair to the shortest length possible before shaving with a razor. Good clippers can save you a lot of time, and they make shaving with a razor more effective. Good brands include Andis or Wahl.
A razor. Buy a high quality razor for this purpose; a cheap one could leave you with a lot of nicks if you aren't careful. Some companies make razors designed specifically for shaving heads.
Shaving cream or oil. Lubricating your head well is key to achieving a good shave. You can use a cream or oil meant for shaving faces or legs, or buy a kind specifically for your head. Just make sure it has good moisturizing properties.
Aftershave. Again, use the aftershave meant for the face or legs, or choose one specially designed for shaved heads.;
, There are pros and cons to both approaches. Consider the following when you're planning your head-shaving experience:


A friend can make sure the back of your head and other areas that are hard to see get shaved cleanly.
If you like the shaved look and want to keep it indefinitely, it's not practical to have a friend help out every time. The sooner you start practicing shaving your own head, the better you'll be at achieving a great shave yourself.

, Drape a sheet or tarp over the floor and make sure the drain in your sink is covered. Shaving your head can get messy, especially if you're starting with long hair. Try to set up two or three mirrors in the bathroom, positioned so that you can see all sides of your head as you shave.

, The final step in preparing to shave is getting rid of your long hair so it doesn't get tangled up in your razor. Set your electric clippers to the shortest setting and use them to evenly trim all of the hair on your head to 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm).

Use a hairdryer.",How to Scrunch Your Hair Overnight," The method of scrunching your hair is similar to crumpling up a piece of paper. Pick up individual sections of hair, squeeze the strands between your fingers, and crumple the ends of the strand up toward your roots. This crunching method will create curls, bends, and volume in your hair. Use this method when applying your styling products.


Flip your head upside while scrunching your hair to create more volume. You'll still scrunch your hair upwards, from ends to roots.;
, Volumizing mousse is an ideal styling product for scrunching your hair, as it is lightweight, provides hold, is easy to control, and gives your hair tons of volume. Spray a golf ball sized amount of mousse onto your palm, rub your hands together, apply the mousse from ends to the roots or your hair, and scrunch your hair upwards towards your roots., If your hair tends to get frizzy as it dries, you may want to add some curl cream or serum to your hair. You'll want apply to product to evenly damp hair. Pour a quarter sized amount of curl cream or serum onto your palm, rub your hands together, and gently scrunch the hair from ends to roots.


If you do not have frizzy hair, avoid adding curl creams or serums, as they might weigh your hair down., Some hair types do not hold curl very well. Using a hairspray or gel to provide extra hold is recommended if you fall into this category. Apply all other hair products before your final layer of hairspray or gel.Hairspray should be sprayed on your hair right before you scrunch it into your overnight undo.
Gel should be scrunched into your hair after you've applied all other styling products. Pour a quarter sized amount of gel onto your palm, rub your hands together, and scrunch it into your hair.
Keep in mind, it is okay to add a variety of styling products to your hair. Layering products is alright as long as you use them in small amounts. Using large amounts of multiple products can weight down your hair, not giving you the desired look., This is the easiest method of scrunching your hair overnight, as it only requires a hair tie (or a few hair ties if you have thick hair or layers). Scrunching your hair into a bun overnight will allow it to develop curl and volume.


If you choose to do one bun, pull your hair back as if you were putting your hair in a ponytail, or flip your hair upside down and scrunch your hair into a bun. The messier the bun, the more volume and curl, so don't smooth out any bumps. Scrunch your hair together so that it can be tied into a messy bun with your hair tie.
If you choose to do multiple buns, start by dividing your hair into sections. Take each section, and scrunch them into individual buns. Don't worry about even parts or sections, just be sure to get all of your hair into one of the sectioned buns.
Do not leave any pieces of hair out of your bun(s). If you have bangs, loosely pin them back to give them some volume.

, Plopping your hair is basically scrunching all of your hair against your head and holding it in place with a shirt or scarf. If you do not know how to plop your hair, see How to Plop Your Hair. With this method, your hair will be scrunching in place all night long.

, Using hair clips to hold your scrunched hair in place creates a very natural look. Scrunch your hair against the top of your head, and use large hair clips to keep it in place. Depending on how much hair you have, this may take 1-4 hair clips.


It might be uncomfortable to sleep with your hair in hair clips, so keep that in mind when you're putting your hair up. Try to get your all of your hair scrunched to the top of your head so that the hair clips don't hurt your head when you lay down., After letting your hair scrunch overnight, it's time to take it down. Gently remove your bun(s) or plop and let it fall naturally into place. It'll most likely look messy, so you'll have to do some styling to get your desired look.

, Gently use your fingers to comb through any big knots or messy areas, but try to avoid combing completely. Be careful not to pull too hard on your hair, as you don't want it to lose curl or volume.

, Finish your hair with hairspray, anti-frizz products, or a shine spray. Do not use any heavy products, such as creams or pomades, as they will weight down your hair.


The best way to do this is by flipping over your head upside-down, putting your chosen product in your palms, and scrunching your hair upward, from the ends to the scalp.
If you are using a hairspray, flip your head upside-down, and then spray.

, Find a shampoo and conditioner that work best for your hair type. For the best results with hair scrunching, use volumizing shampoo and conditioner.


As you condition, do not apply the product heavily to your roots. Putting conditioner on your roots can weight your hair down, resulting in less volume. Apply conditioner to the ends of your hair to keep it healthy and moisturized.
Rinse the conditioner out of your hair with cool water. After you washed your hair in warm water, it's beneficial to rinse with cold water before getting out of the shower. Rinsing with cold water will give your hair more shine, lock in moisture, and help define curls., It's best to not wash your hair everyday. Washing your hair every day can strip away natural oils that keep your hair and scalp healthy. It's recommend to wash your hair no more than every other day.


Some hair types need to be washed more than others. If you have very thin and oily hair, you may need to wash your hair more. Try using only shampoo with some washes, and save conditioning for every other hair wash.
If you have dry hair, wash your hair less. This will allow your natural oils to moisturize your hair. Try conditioning your hair every time you wash, and only using shampoo every other time.

, Us a cotton T-shirt or microfiber towel to dry your wet hair. Instead of rigorously rubbing your hair, use a blotting technique. To blot your hair dry, take one small section of your hair at a time and press firmly to absorb the excess water. Using a towel to dry your hair can create frizz and knots, which is why it's best to use a softer, less textured material. When scrunching your hair, you'll want it to be damp, not dripping wet., If you brush your hair while it is wet, the waves you're looking for will not be defined. Instead, use your fingers or a wide tooth comb to detangle your hair. It's perfectly fine if there are a few tangles or loose knots left in your hair; this will add to the texture you're trying to create by scrunching your hair.


Using a hairbrush on wet hair can result in hair breakage. Your hair is most fragile when wet, and brushing it can potentially stretch it and cause it to break. Always use your fingers or a comb on wet hair, even when you're not scrunching your hair., This step is not always necessary, but is recommended if your hair takes a long time to dry. If you typically have thin or fine hair, you won't need to blow dry your hair at all. If you have thicker hair, you may need to blow dry your hair to speed up the drying process. Do not completely dry your hair, but do not leave it dripping wet. You'll want your hair to be nice and damp when you apply product and put your hair up overnight."

Use a dread wax.,
Maintain the new dreads.",How to Start Dreads with Long Hair2," Divide your hair into even sections. Section your hair according to the size you’d like the lock to be. Begin to section your hair into squares. Secure each part with a rubber band when you are finished sectioning.One to two inches (2 ½ to 5 cm) for each square is usually a good size.

, Using a comb, begin to twist each section clockwise. Snag and twist the hairs once you reach the end of the section. Continue this process until you have twisted every section of your hair., Wax each section to hold the twists. You can do this when you are completely finished twisting, but it is better to do it as you finish each section. Use a thicker wax that does not contain petroleum to begin with.You can use rubber bands at the roots and ends for the first couple of weeks.
Thicker wax is best to begin with because it holds the shape of the locks better than a thinner wax.

, Twist your hair into shape regularly to help the locks form and keep the shape. You can use a thinner wax once the dreadlocks begin to mature. A thinner wax is used more for fragrance and shine than holding the locks into place."

Do you want to cut you hair short? Or do you want to add layers? What about a face-framing cut? Do some research and print out reference pictures; look for models who have a hair texture similar to your own., A carving comb typically looks like a rat-tail comb, except that it has a razor inside the blades. You can typically get them with wide teeth on one side, and fine teeth on the other., You can wash your hair with shampoo and conditioner first, if you want to, but your hair needs to be wet while you cut it. If you cut it while it is dry, you will risk damaging it. This is important for all hair types, especially curly., Use the handle of a rat-tail comb to divide your hair in half horizontally at your temples. Gather all of the hair from the upper section, twist it out of the way, and secure it with a clip.

If you want more layers, section off the top half or two-thirds of your hair instead.

, You can use the razor-less part of your comb to do this, or a rat-tail comb. Pull it out in front of you, past your face. Give your hand a twist so that you are holding the strand vertically; this will make it easier to cut., Pinch the strand between your forefinger and middle finger. Slide your fingers down the length of the strand, stopping where you want to cut it. Keep your fingers at a slight angle., Use short, quick strokes while moving downward. Slide your fingers down the length of your hair while you cut. This will not only keep you from nicking them, but it will also help create the angle.If you have curly hair, be sure to cut with the curl rather than against it., Work your way from one side to the back, then repeat on the other. Always pull the strands of hair in front of face and measure then against the already-cut strands.Stop when you get to the crown., Once you have finished the bottom layers, unclip the hair at the top of your head. Gather everything from your crown-forward, and comb it over your forehead, so that it falls in front of your face., Work one section at a time, from left to right. Cut into the hair where you want it to end using short, downward strokes. Make the sides longer than the center so that you have a slight, upward curve., Check your hair at the front of your face, and make sure that the left side matches up with the right. Take a glance in a three-way mirror and check out the back of your hair. Use the carving comb to make any necessary adjustments.

If you don't have a three-way mirror, stand with your back to your mirror, and hold another mirror up in front of you.

, Once you are happy with the cut, comb your hair back and gently shake it to dislodge any cut strands. Apply your usual styling product, then blow dry your hair using a round brush for extra movement."

Section your hair into small squares.,
Backcomb the hair in each square.,
Repeat for each square.,
Fasten each dread with two rubber bands.,
Apply a dread wax.",How to Start Dreads1," You’ll need a friend to help with this method: they should use their hands or a comb to part your hair into multiple small squares. It’s up to you how many squares your friend makes. Each square will become a single dreadlock, and smaller squares make thinner dreads. Generally, 1- or 2-inch (2.5 or 5 cm) squares are preferable.Backcombing works to create dreads on hair that is already at least 3 inches (7.6 cm) long. If your hair is less than three inches, plan to grow your hair before starting dreads, or use another method to create the hairstyle.;
, The individual dreading your hair should firmly grasp the segment of hair contained within each square. Using a dread comb, firmly comb the hair back towards your head, starting with the hair about 1 inch (2.5 cm) from your scalp. As the hair begins to build up towards the roots, your friend can move farther from your scalp until they backcomb the entire strand of hair.You can buy a dread comb through major online retailers, or through a local hair salon. They may also be available for purchase at your local drug store, department store, or WalMart.

, This is a time consuming process: you’ll need to wait while your friend backcombs the section of hair in each square on your head (there could be as many as 30). As they backcomb all of your hair, they can also roll the hair of each dread back and forth between their fingers. This will help pack the hair in each dread as tightly as possible.Be aware that you’ll lose length when you create dreads by backcombing. Plan to lose at least 1/3 or 1/2 of your hair length: if you start dreads in 6-inch (15-cm) hair, the finished dreads may only be 3 inches (7.6 cm) long., Once each dreadlock has been completely backcombed, secure the end of the dread with a small rubber band. You or your friend can secure another small rubber band around the root of each dread (as close to your scalp as possible) in order to prevent the base of the dread from loosening or unraveling.Any variety of rubber band will work: check an office supply store and purchase the smallest, thinnest set of rubber bands available.

, After each dread has been fully backcombed and has rubber bands at the tip and base, it’s time to wax the dreads. Have your friend liberally apply a dread wax to each of your new locks. This will help restrain loose ends on each dread, and will help the hair form proper dreadlocks quickly. For safety reasons, it’s best if the wax you use does not contain petroleum.You’ll probably be able to purchase dread wax at the same location you bought the dread comb. Look in online retailers—including online hair salons—drug stores, beauty parlors, or large department stores.
Even after having been waxed, it will take dreads 3–4 months to reach maturity. During that time, wash the dreads once a week."

Divide each square into two or three strands.,
Coat each strand with dread cream or wax.,
Twist each strand counterclockwise, and then twist pairs together clockwise.,
Give the strands time to mature into dreadlocks.",How to Start Dreads2," As with the backcombing method, you’ll first need to part your hair into multiple small square sections. Once the squares are made, divide the hair from each square into two sections (you can also make three sections, although that requires more complex twisting).You can separate the sections using small hair clips or rubber bands.


Twists are an effective way to begin dreadlocks in longer hair, or hair that is highly textured. However, this method will also work if your hair is relatively short: as little as 4 inches (10 cm) will suffice.While twists are an effective way to start dreads in black hair, they do not work well in Caucasian hair., This thick gel-like substance will help the large strands of hair cohere, and will encourage the dreadlocks to form more quickly. Before you start twisting the strands, make sure that each is fully covered with a thin layer of dread cream.Additional cream provides no added benefit, so you don’t need to slather each strand.


You can purchase dread cream or wax at a local hair or beauty salon, online through large retailers, or at a local drug store or department store.

, At this point you’re ready to twist the strands. Begin by taking each strand of hair: twist it three or four turns counterclockwise. Once you’ve twisted a set of two strands (from the same square of hair), you can twist the strands together. Pass one strand clockwise over the other two or three times. This will form a large natural hair spiral.Once the two strands of hair have been twisted together, secure the lock together, at both the tip and the base, using a hair clip or rubber band. Due to the different directions that the strands have been twisted, the sections of hair will begin to lock together and form dreadlocks.

, The strand twist method of forming dreadlocks takes time: the strands can take anywhere from 6 months to 2 years to blend together and give the appearance of a single, solid dreadlock.During this time you should wash the dreadlocks no more than once or twice a week.


As the locks mature, it’s important to keep them tightly rolled. If dreadlocks begin to unravel at the ends, re-roll the dread (using a comb or your hands) so that the strands stay tightly woven.
As new hair grows, you should avoid re-doing the strand twists, as this will lengthen the time needed for dreadlocks to form. You can dread new hair by twisting the individual hairs into the already existing woven strands.

Grow your hair until it’s about 10 inches (25.5 cm) long.,
Wash your hair.,
Let your hair tangle.",How to Start Dreads3," This method of forming dreadlocks does not work with shorter hair. Your hair will need to have substantial length in order to form natural dreadlocks. This process also takes time: it can take at least three years for naturally made dreadlocks to form.Natural dreadlocks will only form for individuals with curly, natural, black hair. Individuals with Caucasian or Asian hair will need to use another method—or visit a hair salon—in order to obtain dreadlocks.

, In order for your hair to form natural dreadlocks, it should first be clean. While various rumors may imply that hair needs to be unwashed—or even deliberately soiled—in order for dreads to form, this is untrue. Your hair makes its own oils, which are necessary for healthy hair, but too much of these oils will prevent hair from forming dreadlocks.Once you start naturally growing dreadlocks, you should take a two-week break from washing your hair, to avoid breaking the locks apart. After this two-week period, begin regularly washing your hair again, once or twice a week.

, This is the central step to forming natural dreadlocks: you’ll need to resist the temptation to brush or comb your hair, and let your hair naturally bind itself together. It’s difficult to predict the growth form of natural dreadlocks; unlike other methods, you will not be able to guide or control the shape of your dreadlocks.It’s possible to make minor adjustments to naturally formed dreads, however. For example, if your hair develops a thin dreadlock, you can combine this into a larger dread using rubber bands and dread cream."

Cut the hair in a circular path around the head.",How to Point Cut Hair1," For the best results, wash and rinse the hair before you begin to cut it. While the hair is still wet, comb through it to release tangles and remove loose hair.


The point cut can be performed with dry hair, but wet hair stands up better and is easier to cut.;
, Hold the scissors in your dominant hand and the styling comb in your non-dominant hand. Comb the hair upward away from the head. When there are about two inches (5 cm) of hair in the comb, pinch the hair between your forefinger and middle finger.Start at the crown of the head, then work around the head in a circle.
If you hold a section of hair that is longer than two inches (5 cm) in your fingers, it will begin to flop over and you can’t point cut it effectively. If there is less than that much, you won’t be creating the desired texture.

, For a traditional cut, you’d hold the scissors parallel to your fingers. For a point cut, angle the scissors downward, perpendicular to your fingers. For the basic point cut, the scissors should be pointing straight down toward your fingers.The idea behind the point cut is to create texture and remove bulk, rather than removing length. This is why the scissors are held straight up and down.

, Cut less than 1 inch (2.5 cm) deep into the hair you’re holding. Move the scissors sideways one scissors-width (about ⅛ in or .3 cm) and cut again. Repeat this process as you move down the line of the hair. The final result will create a look of peaks and valleys in the hair.For the standard point cut, don’t cut more than an inch (2.5 cm) of hair in this way or the hair will begin to look too jagged.

, As mentioned above, start cutting at the crown of the head. Continue cutting on top of the head staying on half of the head and working toward the front. Then work from the front of the head back toward the crown where you started.

Repeat steps one through three.",How to Razor Cut Your Own Hair," A razor comb is typically divided into three sections. The end of the comb contains a regular comb. The front of the comb is divided into two different sides: the small-toothed side and the wide-toothed side. The wide-toothed side can be used to create choppy layers. The small-toothed side is great for thinning hair and creating a more subtle look.If you are a beginner, start out using the small-toothed side first. Once you are comfortable using this side, then try the other side.
Visit your local beauty supply store to purchase a razor comb and razors. Razors are usually sold separately.;
, Use a brush to comb through your hair until it is smooth and all of the tangles are removed. If you are a beginner, it is recommended that you start with dry hair. This way you can see how much hair you are removing and if it is too much or too little., Use clips or ponytail holders to divide your hair into a top, middle and bottom section. The top section should be composed of the hair from the top of your head to the parietal ridge. The middle section should be composed of the hair from your temples to your occipital bone. The bottom section should be composed of the hair at the nape of your neck.The parietal ridge is the bony halo or ridge along the upper part of your head.
The occipital bone is the protrusion at the base of your skull.

, Split it down the middle into two sections. Bring both sections forward over your shoulder so you can see your hair., Starting on the right or left side, isolate a chunk of hair. The chunk of hair should be about .4 to .5 inches (10 to 12 mm) thick in diameter. Hold the section of hair straight out from the side of your head. Make sure to hold it taut., Starting two to three inches away from the root of your hair, position the comb at a 45 degree angle relative to hair your. Using light pressure, gently move the razor in short, choppy motions from the middle down to the ends of your hair.Make sure the razor is not at a 90 degree (perpendicular) or 180 degree (flat) angle relative to your hair.

, As you razor your hair, the cut hair will accumulate. Use the comb to remove any loose hair.Repeat steps two through four on the rest of the bottom section.

, Once you are finished with the bottom section, use a ponytail holder to isolate it. Then let down the hair in the middle section. Repeat steps one through four on the middle section of your hair.When you are razor cutting the middle section, try to avoid cutting the baby hairs around your temples.
Once you are done cutting the middle section, don’t forget to isolate it with a ponytail holder so you can razor cut the top of your hair.

, Let down the top section of your hair. Divide the top section down the middle into two sides. Working from the back, isolate a section of hair. The section of hair should be about 3 inches (9 mm) thick in diameter., Position the blade two to three inches (or more) from the root of your hair. Place the razor at a 45 degree angle relative to your hair., Using very light pressure, move the razor in short, choppy motions from the middle down to the ends of your hair. Since the hair at the top of your head is the most visible, make sure to use very light pressure and work slowly. Remember, you can always go back and remove more hair if it isn't enough.Make sure to use the comb to remove the loose hair as you cut.

Hold the scissors at a lower angle.,
Cut the hair deeper than one inch (2.5 cm).,
Cut the lowest layer of layered hair.",How to Point Cut Hair2," Create a deeper texture in the hair by lowering the handle end of the scissors. The farther you lower the scissors from their vertical position, the more hair you’ll cut. Do not not lower the scissors past a 45 degree angle, or you are not really performing a point cut anymore.Holding the scissors at 45 degrees will give you a choppy, layered look.

, Point cutting should usually not take off more than 1 inch (2.5 cm) of hair. However, if you want to create an exaggerated effect, cut deeper into the hair when you have it pinched between your fingers. Cut between one and two inches (2.5 cm to 5 cm), but don’t cut more than two inches with this technique.


Always make sure the person whose hair you are cutting is aware that you are going to be taking off more hair.

, With the hair hanging straight down, gather a two inch section between and below your fingers. Rather than sticking up, as in the technique for short hair, the hair hangs toward the floor. Point the scissors upward toward the hair and perform the point cut as before.Cutting the lowest layer of hair in this way keeps the bottom layer from looking like a straight line.

Determine the shape of your face.,
Consider your facial features.,
Think about the look you're trying to achieve.,
Start with freshly washed hair.,
Use a pin-tail comb to draw your chosen parting.,
Use your fingers to guide the rest of the hair into place.,
Use some bobby pins to hold the parting.,
Spritz with hair spray.,
Repeat everyday until your hair settles naturally into your chosen parting.",How to Part Your Hair," When deciding on the right type of parting for your hair, you should take the shape of your face into consideration.


Some partings will flatter certain face shapes more than others, so take a long look in the mirror and try to decide whether your face is round, square, oval or heart-shaped.
Try a middle parting if you have a heart-shaped face. A middle-parting can help to elongate your face (as people with heart-shaped faces tend to be wider around the cheeks), but only if your hair is long. If you have short-hair, you should go for a slight side parting as the hair will cover some of your forehead and thin out your face.
Try a deep side parting if you have a round or square-shaped face. For people with round-shaped faces, a deep side parting will help to balance and elongate the features. For people with square shaped faces, this parting will help to soften sharp angles around the forehead and jawline.
Experiment if you have an oval-shaped face. People with oval-shaped faces can pretty much get away with any style, so experiment with middle partings, side partings, diagonal partings and even zigzag partings!;
, Not only the shape of your face can have an influence on the type of parting that works best for you, your facial features themselves also have a role to play.


One side of a person's face is usually more pronounced or stronger than the other, so this is the side of your face you want to put your parting on.
To figure out which side of your face is stronger than the other, stand in front of a mirror and hold a sheet of paper in front of your face, first on one side, then the other. The side of your face which has more upturned features (there should always be one) is the stronger side.
Another way to decide where your parting should go is to look at your nose. If it points off slightly in one direction (most of our noses do) then the parting should go on the opposite side in order to restore symmetry to the face.However, you should also think about which side of your face you prefer. If you believe that one side of your face is your ""best side"" then that is the side you should expose when choosing a side for your parting.

, The final thing you need to consider when deciding on a hair parting is whether there's a certain look or style that you're trying to achieve. Certain partings work best with specific styles.


Middle partings look great paired with long hair styled into beachy waves, for a cool boho-chic look. They can also look fantastic with sleek bobs for a simple, yet sophisticated 'do.
Side partings look great for effortless, just-out-of bed styles. However, a deep side parting adds retro glamour to your hair and looks equally good paired with big curls or a classy up-do.
A zigzag parting is your best friend if your hair is lying a little flat, as it immediately adds volume to hair. It's also a great way of covering up your roots if your hair color is in need of a touch up, and adds a bit of life and fun to any hairstyle.

, Start by shampooing and conditioning your hair, then comb it until you have no tangles.









Dry your hair until its completely dry (unless you have very thin/straight hair, in which case it can be slightly damp).
Brush through again to ensure there are no knots or tangles, as this will make parting the hair a lot easier.

, A pin-tail comb is the best instrument to part your hair with, as its pointed end helps you to be very precise. If you don't have a pin-tail comb, any fine-toothed comb will do (or even your fingers if you're opting for a messy-style parting).









Hold the comb perpendicular to your scalp, then use the pointed end to draw a line through your hair, running backwards from your forehead.
If you want a symmetrical middle parting, draw a line from the center of the bridge of your nose. If you want a side parting, draw a line from the arch of your eyebrow on whatever side you choose.
If you want a zig-zag parting, first do a normal middle parting, then use the point of the comb to make a ""zig"" on one side of the line. Use your fingers to guide the hair into place, then draw a ""zag"" going in the opposite direction. Continue in this fashion, smoothing the hair into place after each ""zig"" or ""zag"".

, Before you lift the comb from your scalp, use the fingers on your free hand to guide the hair onto the correct side of the parting.








, As this is a new parting, you may find it difficult to get your hair to lie flat.









If this is the case, you can use some bobby pins to hold your parting in place until your hair lies flat.
If you have some time before you need to go anywhere, put a beanie hat on and wear it around the house for a while. This will train your new parting to stay right where you want it!

, As an extra precaution, spritz your hair with a light misting of hairspray (holding the can at least 12 inches away from your head). Then use your hands to smooth your hair into place.








, If you're happy with your new parting, keep parting your hair in the exact same place every day. Remember to use all of the tricks outlined above to encourage your hair to lie flat. Eventually it will just fall naturally into place.

If you only want curly hair a few days a week, try hot rollers or a curling iron instead; if you want curly, wavy, or hair with body every day, a perm is the way to go.;
, It is critical to know what type of hair you have and what condition your hair is in. This is an important first step in determining the kind of perm to get and mitigating adverse effects like hair loss and breakage.


Resistant hair, resistant gray hair, Asian hair, hair with low elasticity, fine hair, and coarse or strong hair are usually best treated with an alkaline perm.
Healthy hair with good elasticity, tinted hair, damaged hair, highlighted hair, or fragile hair are permed with a milder acid perm.
If you have hair that has been extensively color treated or damaged, or if you have typical African-American hair, it's probably best to visit a salon. Find a stylist who specializes in working with hair like yours to minimize damage.

, It'll be more difficult (though not impossible) to cut your hair after you have a perm, so trim up any split ends beforehand.


Decide what to do with your bangs (optional). If you have bangs, try to have a plan for them before you perm. Be aware that permed bangs can look particularly fluffy; if this isn't the look you want, you might want to wait a month or two for them to grow out before you get a perm. If you do decide to go with a perm while you have bangs, ask yourself: Are you going to keep them straight? Are you going to perm them?

, If you get it all the way to the roots, remember that new hair that isn't permed will be visible.

, It's possible to perm your hair at home, and it's a bit less expensive that way. However, if you go to a stylist, you can trust that he or she has probably done several perms, and will remedy any mistakes for free. Consider these points:


If you're attempting a subtle perm, visit a stylist. You might accidentally over-process your hair on your own.
If your hair is significantly damaged or has been extensively color treated, it's probably best to book an appointment at a salon. Damaged hair will react differently to a perm than healthy hair will, and a trained stylist will know how to bridge the difference.
If your hair is already a bit wavy or kinky, try to find a stylist who specializes in working with such hair. He or she will be able to ensure that you come out with a smooth permed look, instead of having curls with intermittent kinks.
If you have fairly healthy hair with plenty of elasticity, you've done an at-home perm before, or you're generally an expert at doing your own hair, you can probably get away with perming your hair at home.

, Do you want small, tight curls? Or maybe you want larger, bouncy curls? Whatever it is, get a good idea of what you expect before you set out to perm your hair.


Understand that your hair will be tighter when it first comes out of the curlers than it will be for the duration of your perm. The curls will ""fall"" a bit as time goes on. It might be a good idea, then, to perm your hair just a little more tightly than you want it.

, A perm can take anywhere from 2 to 4 hours to accomplish. After that, you'll have to let the perm ""set"" for 24 hours, which means no washing or styling your hair, and no pulling it back. Additionally, you won't be able to wash your hair until 48 hours after the perm. Make sure your schedule can accommodate these limits.

Permed hair needs a great deal of attention and care.",How to Perm Your Hair2," It can be difficult to work with the hair at the back of your head, and you'll be working within some time constraints. Having a friend to help you speed along the process and make sure the rollers are tight can ease your mind.

, These can usually be found at supermarkets, pharmacies, or beauty supply stores.

, If you've having someone help you, make sure he or she reads the instructions as well. Pay particular attention to any time limits.

,, Use a rich protein conditioning treatment (one might have come with the kit you purchased). You should NEVER condition your hair before a perm as the perm solution won't get into the hair properly will not set properly.


Do not wrap your hair in towel turban when you get out of the shower. The added friction can knot and damage vulnerable wet hair. Instead, carefully pat your hair with a towel until it's more damp than wet.
If you must comb your hair again, carefully and gently comb with a wide-tooth comb, working tangles out as you move from the ends toward the scalp.

, Perm chemicals are not designed for use on the skin. Always wear gloves that will resist the chemicals (usually any kind of plastic glove will work).

, Don't forget your ears! Outline the entire crown of your head with the jelly. This will keep any of the chemicals from dripping down your skin.

, Underneath the towel, wear clothing that you wouldn't be heartbroken to lose, such as an old T-shirt and sweatpants.

, Use non-metallic clips to hold back the sections you're not working with at the moment. You can also use any hair clips 

, There are many kinds of rods available to produce a variety of different kinds of perm.


When wrapping the hair, start and the top and wrap down.
Put on perm paper on the back of hair and front and roll hair on to rods.
Avoid bunching or clumping your hair around the rods.
The tightness of the curl depends on the size of the rod. The tightness of the wrap and how long the perm solution stays in the hair.
For the most natural-looking curls, use a straight or cylindrical rod. This allows you to wrap your hair around the rod at the same width from top to bottom.
Unless you are very confident in your abilities, avoid the home use of spiral or concave rods.

, Begin at the scalp, as that gives it longer to work in that area. Carefully massage the perm solution into all of your hair.

, Leave the perm solution in for the amount of time needed for your desired effect.

, It is vital to get rid of all of the solution.

, The neutralizing solution begins the process of re-forming the broken proteins in your hair.

, Hold your head upside down and shake it gently. Be sure not to let the towel damage your new curls as it will take up to 24 hours for your perm to set. Do not comb your hair while perm is in, only massage or blot.

, Learning to care for your perm is an important step in any hair regimen.

Communicate exactly what you want.,
Plan to spend up to 4 hours at the salon.,
If the smell becomes unbearable, ask your stylist for a wet washcloth.,
Evaluate your style when the process is over.",How to Perm Your Hair3," During the consultation with your stylist before your perm, tell him or her exactly what you expect from the process. Outline how you usually style your hair, how big you want the curls to be, and which products you tend to use.


Know that a perm that results in larger, looser curls is sometimes referred to as a body wave. If this is what you want, use that term to communicate it to your stylist.

, If you think you'll get bored, grab a few magazines from the reception area, or bring a paperback book that you won't mind losing if it gets chemicals dripped onto it.

, The chemicals used to perm hair can smell noxious, and might irritate your nose. If this begins to happen, request a damp washcloth and hold it over your nose and mouth, breathing through it.


If the chemicals start irritating your eyes, keep them closed. It won't last forever.

, Keep in mind that your curls will be a little tighter immediately after the perm than they will be in a few days. If you're unhappy with any aspect of the style, tell your stylist your concerns before you leave the salon. He or she can make plans to address any lapses as soon as possible.

Start by brushing out your hair.,
Tame the frizz using serum (optional).,
Pull your hair back into a tight ponytail.,
Hold all of your hair by the bottom and twist your hair into one giant twist.,
Wrap the twisted ponytail around the base, where the ponytail is.,
Add bobby pins or wrap another bobble around it.,
Spray your hair with some water to calm down the fly-aways (just a dab of conditioner can do just fine for dry hair too).,
Tug on the sides.,
Optionally, you can add a headband.",How to Put Frizzy Hair Into a Bun," Make sure it has all, or mostly all, of the knots out. A good tactic for this is to start at the bottom and work your way up, gently brushing through. A messy bun is easier to achieve if your hair has not been washed for a day or two, but if conditioning makes it easier to get the knots out, you can do that also.;
, Instead of wetting your hair, a better option would be using frizz serums and frizz tamer sprays that are sold at mostly every hair care Isle. Use personal preference to find which one suits you best and then apply on your hair, remember, a little goes a long way!

, However high up you want you bun to be, that's where you should put the ponytail. Don't worry about it being beat, we will create the messy style later. A messy bun is usually styled at the middle of your head, but it depends on your taste.

, Make sure the twist is tightly coiled, it will loosen up soon. Don't worry about any flyaways, the bun is meant to be messy.

, Wrap it as tight as you can again, it will come loose when you let go so do not worry.

, Bobby pins are often the best choice as they are not visible, but still hold your hair together. Use as many pins as you need to secure the bun. It is better if the pins are the colour of your hair if you don't want then to be seen, but again, it doesn't matter. Make sure you don't put too much in so the bun is tight and neat, but just enough to secure the bun.

, Try using dry conditioner or an anti-frizz hairspray. This will take any flyaways that stick out of your bun.

, Now look at the whole style. From the sides, gently pull at your hair and let some curls loose so the ponytail looks mildly messy. Don't pull too much out, it will not look nice and may even loosen your bun out.

, In the event that your hair gets very frizzy and starts falling apart, a headband will keep it looking neat until you can fix it.

Consider dying your hair a new color.,

Purchase dye.,
Gather your materials.,
Set up your area.,
Part hair into sections.,
Brush the dye onto your hair.,

Wash out the dye.",How to Make Your Hair Punk1," Punk hair is often identified by loud or unnatural colors, such as blue, green, red, pink or black, among others. You definitely don't have to dye your hair to make it punk; some punks choose to keep their hair as unkempt as possible, and that includes eschewing hair dye. However, a new color can add another anti-mainstream facet to your overall look.;
, Colored hair can be high maintenance. In addition to pulling off the initial dye job, you might need to do touch-ups. Further, most bright-colored dyes are semi-permanent, meaning that they will eventually fade out after a certain number of washes. To mitigate this effect, you might want to invest in a shampoo and conditioner specifically formulated to protect colored hair, as well as setting up a schedule in which you only wash your hair once or twice a week.

, Usually punk style thrives on a do-it-yourself attitude, and this includes hair cuts and colors. However, if this is your first time dying your hair, you might consider going to a professional colorist at your local salon. Once you see how the process is done, it will be easier to dye your hair yourself.

, You'll be able to find a wide range of colors at a beauty supply store. If there isn't one close to your house, try ordering online. Note that if you already have brown to black hair and you want to dye it a bright color, you'll need to use bleach first. Purchase a bleach kit at the same time as your dye, and bleach your hair first by following the instructions. (To minimize damage to your hair, wait a few days after bleaching to add the next color.) While you're ordering your dye, purchase a cheap dye brush to make the process go faster.


Beware of cheap colored dyes. Some beauty supply stores sell small aerosol dyes for special occasions, such as green for St. Patrick's day. This can be a good way to try out your intended color, but don't buy these products for a long-term dye - they wash out quickly and wreak havoc on your hair.

, To dye your hair, you'll need hair dye, a small glass or metal bowl, a comb, rubber or latex gloves, an old T-shirt, petroleum jelly and a hand mirror. Strips of aluminum foil are optional if you're planning on adding streaks or highlights.

, Work in front of the bathroom mirror and assemble your tools on the counter. Put on the old T-shirt, and wipe the petroleum jelly on your skin near your hairline (this will keep the dye from getting onto your skin and staining it.). Err on the side of using too much jelly over too little. Then, put on your rubber gloves and squeeze the dye into the bowl.

, This step is especially important if you're doing highlights or streaks.

, Dip the dye brush into the hair color. Grab a section of hair and, starting at your roots, brush the dye onto it in strokes until you reach the end of the hair. Repeat on all the parts of hair you wish to dye. Check your work with the hand mirror.


If you're doing streaks or highlights, use foils. Tear a strip of aluminium foil that's slightly wider than the section of hair you wish to dye. Clip any hair above the lock so that it's out of the way, and pull the hair so that's at a 90-degree angle from your head. Put the foil strip underneath, then bring the hair back down. Brush on the dye with the hair over the foil, then fold up the foil - first in half, then by closing the sides with small folds. Repeat as necessary. Start streaks or highlights at the top of your head and work down and back.
If you're doing an all-over dye job for the first time, ask a friend to help you. He or she can check for pieces that you've missed and help you reach the back of your head.

, This can range from 20 minutes to an hour or two. Try to err on the side of washing too early - you can always add more dye later, but growing back any hair you might fry off will take significantly longer.

, Stand under a cold shower until the water runs clear. Dry hair with an old towel and allow it to air dry. Subsequently wash your hair in water that is as cold as you can stand - the dye will last longer.


If you get dye on your skin, go at it with a baby wipe that contains alcohol. You could also use conditioner or nail polish remover but those require a lot more scrubbing.

Consider your options.,
Purchase hair cutting shears (optional).,
Buy an electric razor (optional).,
Trim split ends before touching up hair color.",How to Make Your Hair Punk2," You can cut your hair yourself, or you can visit a stylist. Additionally, you can model your haircut after someone else's style, or freehand it in the moment. Decide what works best for you.

, The scissors hair stylists use are sharper and easier to handle than regular scissors. If you're undertaking a complicated haircut, purchase a pair of shears at your local beauty supply store.

, Many punk hairstyles feature a shaved portion of the head. If you're planning on shaving part of your hair off, and you plan to maintain the style over a long period, buy a decent electric shaver. Find a setting you like and touch up your hair every week or two.


An electric shaver is also a convenient way to trim fuzzy neck hairs that might be visible when you put your hair in a mohawk. Keeping your hairline clean will make sure the attention stays on your hairstyle.

, If you're going to re-do your color and you notice your ends looking a little ragged, trim them. Damaged hair will absorb more dye and can be a significantly different color than you intended.

Go high- or low-maintenance.,
Know how to style a mohawk.",How to Make Your Hair Punk3," Punk hairstyles can run the gamut from carefully constructed liberty spikes to dreadlocks. Evaluate how much time you're willing to invest in doing your hair every day, and style accordingly. Browse the internet for some styles that might interest you.

, A mohawk is an iconic punk style. Here's how to make one.


Blow dry hair with a paddle brush. Hang your head upside down, and blast hair with a blow dyer on high heat.
Apply fixative. Rub the necessary amount of gel, glue, gelatin, hair wax or other fixative on your hands. With your head still upside down, put your hands together with your hair in the middle and pull downward to create spikes.
Use a flat iron. Go over your mohawk with a thin flat iron, head still upside down. Move in slow strokes. The gel might sizzle on the heat, but your hair won't actually burn if you keep moving the flat iron.
Apply hairspray. Buy the strongest possible hairspray you can (check the bottle for a ""hold"" number) and use it liberally on your mohawk. For extra hold, flat iron again, then spray one last time.

"
"
Have your hair buzzed down to a ""zero"" with clippers.,
Shave your head down smooth.,
Get your head soaked with Hot, but not boiling water.,
Apply shaving gel or foam & make sure you apply it liberally all over your scalp.,

After the shave, make sure that you rinse your head with cold water.,
Apply post-shave balm / moisturiser.,
The next step is maintenance: To keep your head smooth, it is advisable to shave your head every day just as you would normally shave your face every day.

,
Finally, for your initial head shave it would be advisable to have a barber or hairdresser do the deed.",How to Obtain the Bald Look for Men," It would be best to get a barber to do this initially, however, if you feel confident enough you can do this yourself if you have a set of hair clippers at home.;
, Make sure that you have a good quality razor (ie: Gillette Mach III or similar) with a clean, sharp blade. Decent shave gel or foam. A hand-held mirror (this helps you to see the back of your head when shaving). A clean towel. After-shave balm or moisturiser.

, Let the water absorb a little on the scalp.

, Leave the foam on my head for a minute or so before shaving. I find that this helps quite a bit when it comes to the shave.

, Do not press too hard on the blade, but allow the razor to ""glide"" on your scalp. If you really want to, you can do a second shave in the opposite direction, called ""against the grain"", which produces a much smoother result, but remember to re-apply shave gel or foam.

, This action helps open up the pores in your scalp & also helps to soothe the skin after the shave.

, This soothes & protects the scalp.

,, You will love the whole experience, guaranteed.

Let your own hair be a guide.,
Clean your hair using shampoo.,
Apply conditioner.,
Gently comb through your hair.,
Blow dry your hair halfway.,
Back-comb or tease the hair in the middle of your head.,
Keep teasing until you have some poof.,
Lift your hair with your hands and apply hairspray.,
Lay your hair back over the poofy area, if desired.",How to Make Your Hair Poofy," Depending on your hair's natural oiliness, curliness, and other factors, you'll need to tweak the basic ""poofing"" process slightly to make sure it works right for you. While the essential process should be the same, pay attention to the way your own hair behaves and tweak the process accordingly.


If you have very thin hair, you'll probably need to use a considerable amount of hairspray or other product to get your hair to stay up. If your hair is a lot thicker, you should use less product and tease your hair more.
If you have oily hair, most people will need to wash more frequently 4-5 times per week, to make it more poofy. Some people, however, tend to get a little more body the less frequently hair is washed.;
, You want your hair to be nice and clean when you attempt to poof it up. Massage a pea-sized amount of shampoo into your scalp and hair follicles, then rinse thoroughly with lukewarm water.


Get to know your own body and wash your hair as frequently as it needs it. In general, you want to wash slightly less. 3-4 times per week should be enough for most people.
Avoid washing in excessively hot water, which can dry your hair out and leave it stringy.

, Hair conditioner is used to leave your hair feeling smooth, and it can also help to give your hair some body, without tangling it up. If you want to emphasize your hair's natural body, use hair conditioner every time you wash it.


Rinse out conditioner thoroughly, running water through a couple of times to make sure it's all gone. If you don't, excess conditioner can make your hair feel greasy and lank after you wash it.

, Tangles might make your hair look a little bigger, but not in a good way. When your hair is still wet, run a comb through it a couple times. Make sure all of the knots, tangles, and snarls are carefully combed through before proceeding to the poofing process.








, You can also then put your hair in a bun. Letting you hair dry out in a bun can be one of the best ways of adding a little body naturally, just by letting it dry. Use a hair dryer to get your hair dry enough to work with, then put it up in a tight bun on top of your head. When your hair is dry, remove it. You should have some curl and some body to work with.








, The most reliable way of giving your hair body and poofiness is to back-comb, or ""tease"" your hair out. To do this, you want to comb up a portion of hair from the middle of the top of your head, and hold it up straight. Take your comb and pull it through down toward your scalp, the reverse of how you'd normally comb when your hair lays flat.









If your hair isn't long enough to back-comb, you can still tease it. Use a comb, pick, or a brush and use short, frequent combing strokes through the hair to tease it out.
Don't do this with all you hair, just the hair in the direction you want to make look poofy. If you want more body on the sides, tease out the hair on the sides of your head. If you want more body on the top, tease out the hair on top and leave the front and sides alone.

, How long it takes to get your hair poofy will depend on your style of hair. Keep working until it starts to get some body and some frizz. At first, it may look quite frizzy and unsightly, but you can learn to style the hair to maintain this body without looking all ratty.








, Now, your hair should be a little poofier, and you can get it to stay in place using a strong-holding hairspray. Use your comb to bring your hair up, or just grab it with your hands. Hold it out from your head as much as possible and hit it with some spray.









Again, use less spray if you have especially thick hair. You won't need to use much and it might just weigh your hair down.

, To make your hairstyle poofy, comb your bangs, sides, or other hairs you left straight over the poofy area, and style your hair normally. If you poofed up in the middle, comb your bangs back over the top of your head, so those hairs will rest over the teased-out hair, obscuring them, but emphasizing the bounce. This is how you get big hair.

A small list of common Goth subcultures is as follows:



Vampire Goth: Obsessed, or at the very least, deeply attracted by vampires. Perhaps a fan of Anne Rice or Lestat. Vampire goths usually love anything and everything to do with vampires, from stories and outfits to fantasies and movies.

Romantic Goth: Romantic Goths lust after the dark, sensual side of the culture; and are lovers of poetry and classic literature. Most commonly they are found wearing Victorian or medieval inspired clothing – lace, velvet and corsets.

Cyber Goth: Cyber Goths love bright neon colours, worship today's technology and easily recognized with their goggles, crazy pony falls and rave inspired outfits. Cyber goths usually listen to dance music, especially futurepop/EBM and hard dance.
Cabaret Goth: Cabaret goths are also easily recognized by their attractively extravagant style – think corsets, garters and black suits. Cabaret goths are experts at combining class with over the top extravagance. Commonly found listening to Siouxsie & The Banshees, Voltaire, Tiger Lilies and the Sex Gang Children, to name just a few.

Deathrockers: Caught somewhere in between the stages of Punk and Goth. They are often seen with their torn fishnet stockings, their many band badges and fantastically extravagant hair. They commonly listen to 80s Goth Rock, as well as Horror punk and Psychobilly.;
, You will find that many Goth types share the same styles of hair. The more sensual styles, such as the Romantic goth and Cabaret goth, usually favor longer, darker hair. More hardcore or punk inspired styles, such as Deathrockers and Cyber goths, usually have brighter, more extravagant hair. Other styles, such as vampire goths, can fall anywhere in between. If it helps, try looking up the styles yourself on the internet, as well as pictures and online shopping sites, to see some inspiring hair styles.

, After doing some research and looking at different styles, decide on the haircut you want. If you're a girl, or a guy with long hair, you may choose to cut it short. Some good short styles would be straight and sleek, with bangs. You can also go for more over the top cuts, such as spikes on top with a long side fringe, a Mohawk, or something else crazy. However, you don’t have to cut your hair if you don't want to. Many styles, such as romantic goths and vampire goths, have very long hair.

, Frizzy hair generally doesn’t work well for these styles. However, loose, romantic waves, maddening curls and spikes or pin straight are all perfect. Get a quality straightener, so you can both straighten and curl your hair. Since you've already gotten the cut you want, it shouldn't be hard to figure out what you want.



Sleek, shining straight hair is perfect on romantic goths, vampire goths, cabaret goths, fetish goths, Victorian goths and mopey goths. It usually works well on any sensual style.
Rich waves or loose curls work on most of the above styles as well, particularly romantic goths, vampire goths and cabaret goths.
Crazy straight spikes or frizzy curls are good on deathrockers and sometimes cyber goths.

Crimped hair works for hippie goths or medieval goths.

Curly hair works on most romantic, sensual styles.

, There are plenty of anti frizz shampoos and straightening balms you can get your hands on. Try massaging hair oil or olive oil into your hair after washing and drying it, as it prevents frizz and gives it a sleek shine. Use gel to help you with spikes. Braid your hair for crimped curls.

, If you’re looking for a simple coloring, just get your hair dyed a dark color. The standard rich, dark black works with almost any style and will go with any color streaks. However, if you're opting for the cyber goth or deathrocker look, you may want a crazy bright color, like bright pink, blue, purple or green. Spend some time thinking what would be the best option for your hair style, and keep in mind that:


Black works well for sensual styles, such as cabaret goths, romantic goths, and usually vampire goths. It will work relatively well with any style, though if you’re a cyber goth or anything else that demands color, you may be in danger of looking a little plain.

Purple and Blue are both good colors for many styles, such as vampire goths, perky goths and deathrockers. Usually any deep, dark color will do.

Bright neon colors are perfect for more hardcore, crazy styles, those which are similar to cyber goth or deathrocker. If you're looking for this style, almost any bright color will work – try light pink, blue, lavender, orange/red and green.
Plain solid colors, like a dark hazel brown or rich blonde will work for fetish goths, as color isn't completely essential. They will also work perfectly for medieval goths.

, Any natural color – blonde, brown, black, even red/orange – can work with a style when you master the proper techniques.

, These will complete your hair coloring and help you define your style further. If you have black hair (dyed or natural), then you’re lucky, as you can choose almost any color. The colors that work best are generally deep, dark blue, violet and green, for romantic goths, vampire goths and perhaps cabaret goths. Bright colors, such as bright pink, orange, red and neon green will be perfect for cyber goths, and will work well for deathrockers and more crazy styles. Remember:


Black works with almost any color, but try to find an attractive match, such as a deep dark color or something bright and contrasting.

Subtle highlights or almost identical colored streaks give a hint of color, and work well for cabaret goths, and fetish goths, or if you don't want to draw too much attention to your hair.
If you've already dyed your hair a bright color, it may be best to just leave it.
Similarly, if your hair is your natural color or black, you can easily leave it.

, There are plenty to choose from. If you're a cyber goth, vampire goth or romantic goth, hair falls will work well – choose a color the way you would have with the step above. Purchase colored clips, headbands, bows, ribbons and ties to your liking. Fashion your own accessories from ties, bow ties, scraps of velvet or lace, or by painting old bobby pins. If you keep your eyes open, you could get a whole wardrobe full of hair accessories by simply recycling old objects.

, You may be comfortable with just leaving your hair loose, which is fine. Or you may want another style. If you already have a complete cut, such as a very short cut, a Mohawk or an extreme color, chances are, your hair will be fine just out. But if your hair is a plain color or has plenty of options, then explore. Some good styles include:


Two pony tails: Work well for Perky Goths and Cyber Goths, and also very well if you have hair with streaks, highlights or falls.

Ponytail: A simple ponytail with an eye-catching fringe works well when teamed up with ribbons, bows, and the like. Massive ponytails on top of your head work extremely well for Cyber Goths.
Pinned to the side: Pin your hair to one side with an attractive – or hideous – bow, tie, ribbon, etc.

, If you’ve gone to all this trouble to achieve the perfect look, then don’t lose it. Wash your hair a suitable amount of times a week – once or twice for dry hair, more frequently for greasy hair – and master the skill of straightening/curling, de-frizzing, spiking, etc. Use quality shampoos, conditioners, oils, sprays, balms and gels – don’t try to get away with dirt cheap rubbish. Keep a healthy diet – eggs, milk and plenty of vitamins – to help your hair shine.

Visual kei hair is mostly hair that stands out a lot, sometimes to extremes.",How to Make Your Hair Into a Visual Kei Style," If there is a certain hairstyle you want, and it's a hairstyle that someone (most likely a j-rocker) already has, print out or draw a picture of the hairstyle.;
, You need to know what it's going to look like from ALL ANGLES, and you need to know what goes where.

, If you're going to dye your hair, make sure you get the right kind for your hair type. If you have extensions, make sure that however you're going to put them in, that you've got what you need. If you're going to cut your hair, make sure that you have good scissors, hair buzzers, whatever. Just make sure everything is there.

, Drape something around your neck, like a towel, or a plastic bag, and tie it off with something in the front. Have a few different brushes around (2-3), and a comb. If you're layering your hair, make sure that you separate parts of your hair, and make them different lengths. Use the comb, so that when you go to cut, you brush whatever part of hair you're cutting (using the comb) right down to the spot you want it cut, and steadying it with your hand, you should cut it there. Do this with ANY part of your hair that you wish to cut, if you want the strands to evenly go together.

, Okay, so now you have your hairstyle, but possibly, you'd like to color it. If you want the exact same color of hair of the person who's hair you used to base your style from, then try to get that or those colors. Make sure that you've also separated your hair where you want to add in different colors. Follow the dyeing instructions. This would also be the time to put in your extensions. Make sure you have them the right length that you want them, and if you want to dye your extensions, dye them the same time (or beforehand) that you dye the rest of your hair. Make sure that you know how you want to put in your extensions.

,, Your hair shouldn't look boring or dull when you're done. It should be bright, stylish, and unique. But to get there, you may need a little help. Don't be afraid to make your hair look messy by using hair glue and hairspray. Be sure to make it stand straight up by making the strands into spikes, and hair spraying them to make them stay in place. Spiky hair is essential to the v.k. look. If you have trouble getting your hair to stand up, using the comb, you can use a technique called ratting. Pull the strand outwards that you'd like to spike, and using the comb at the bottom, brush up and down in quick strokes, making the hair messy and more voluminous. Repeat this a few times until you get your hair as messy as desired (this adds a better base to make the hair stand up). When you've finished ratting the strand, spike the end with either some hair glue or hair wax, and hold the hair up straight and high, and spray it with hairspray to keep it in place.

, Unclip and comb the top section—evenly distribute the hair on each side. Start at the center back of the head. Without pulling on the hair, hold a one inch section just above the point at which you would like to cut—use the previously cut hair as your guide. Use your shears to cut straight across the one inch section.Repeat this process until you have finished cutting the hair remaining in the top section.

Try a ponytail.,
Make it neat or messy.,
Set it high or low.,
Move it to the side.,
Leave some pieces out.,
Add a bump.,
Hide the elastic.,
Do a half ponytail.,
Split into pigtails.",How to Make Cute Everyday Hairstyles1," All but the shortest haircuts can fit into a ponytail, and there are several different ways to make it look your own. Here are some options.;
, For a sleek look, hold your hair about where you want it with one hand. With the other, carefully comb hair back into your hand, starting at your hairline and going all the way around your head. For a more tousled look, hang your hair upside down and muss it, using some light hairspray or a root lifter. Fasten without smoothing hair out.








, Put your ponytail on the top of your head, at the nape of your neck, or somewhere in between.








, Try positioning the ponytail just behind your ear, or make the shift more subtle by positioning it just a few inches to the right or left. Whatever you do, make sure it looks intentional - you don't want people to think you just couldn't get the ponytail straight.








, If you have layers, bangs (fringe) or just want a less structured look, choose a few pieces at the top or side of your face to leave out of your ponytail. These can be curled, straightened, or just left as they are.

, For a trendy mod look, make the top of your hair ""bump"" up before it goes back into the ponytail. Backcomb your hair where you want it to have some lift, and set with hairspray. You can also add a cute headband to a bump, placing it about a half-inch away from your hairline.








, If you have long hair and a few bobby pins, you can mask the elastic used to fasten your ponytail. Pull a long, medium-width strand out of the bottom of the ponytail, near the center. Wrap it once around the base of the ponytail, over the elastic, and slip a bobby pin into it when it's back at the bottom. Wrap again, or as many times as you need to, and secure at the bottom again.








, Grab the hair around the top of your head, leaving the bottom portion loose. Fasten with an elastic or barrette. This will keep your hair out of your face while maintaining a long, soft look.








, Make your one ponytail into two ponytails, also known as pigtails. Be careful, though - while a ponytail is something women of all ages wear, pigtails are typically seen as being for teenage girls and younger, or costume occasions.

Put your hair up.,
Use elastics or bobby pins.,
Make it neat or messy.,
Do it high or low.,
Wear it to the side.,
Leave some pieces out.,
Make a braided (plaited) bun.",How to Make Cute Everyday Hairstyles2," You don't have to reserve putting your hair into a bun for special occasions. Here are some ways to wear it in everyday manner.

, After you've put your hair into a ponytail, twisted it, and wrapped it around the base, you can fasten your bun with another non-rubber elastic (or two), or some bobby pins. Bobby pins offer a little more control, where elastics can make the base of the bun look smaller. Do whatever works best for you.








, A very neat, structured bun is usually referred to as a ballet bun, because it's favored by classical dancers. To do this, comb hair thoroughly, make tight twists, and use hairspray. You can also do a messier look, twisting and pinning your hair in a more haphazard way. A messy bun works well on curly or wavy hair.








, As with ponytails, a bun can be worn high on your head, at the nape of your neck, or at any intermediate point.

, If you choose to do a side bun, keep it low and positioned just behind your ear - a high side bun creates an awkward profile.








, If you have layers, bangs (fringe) or just want a less structured look, choose a few pieces at the top or side of your face to leave out of your bun. These can be curled, straightened, or just left as they are.

, Tie your hair back in a ponytail. Braid or plait it. Secure it from the bottom. Twirl it around the beginning of your braid or plait into a bun position. Secure with bobby pins or clutch.

Braid your hair.,
Do a basic braid.,
French braid your hair.,
Learn to fishtail braid.,
Do a halo braid.,
Do a side braid.",How to Make Cute Everyday Hairstyles3," There are a variety of methods for braiding your hair. Once you learn them, you can incorporate them into your hairstyle in big or small ways. Here are some basic ideas.

, When you're first learning how to braid, start with a stable base such as a ponytail, half ponytail or pigtails. Separate three sections, and braid accordingly. Fasten at the end with a non-rubber elastic. When you've mastered the technique, try starting with hair loose for a messy, less-structured look.









Do a lot of tiny braids with the strands at the front of your head, directly above your face. Layer them back and forth over your usual part, for instance, moving the first braid so that it falls to the right, the second so that it falls to the left, and so on. Then pull your hair back into a low ponytail or bun.

, A French braid builds off the techniques of a basic braid, and includes the hair closer to your scalp.









Try a full French braid, or split into two French braids.
Alternatively, you can part your hair into two sections, French braid until you get to the back of your head, and gather both sections into a loose ponytail.

, A fishtail braid looks complicated, but it's easy to do once you get the hang of it. Start with a stable base, such as a ponytail, for a neater look; for a messy feel, start with hair loose at the nape of the neck. A fishtail braid that's braided a bit to the side and worn over one shoulder is a trendy look.









Try a chunky fishtail. Most fishtails require small pieces of hair to be pulled to the opposite sides. That type of fishtail can be very time consuming for people with thick to medium hair. Instead of small pieces, take big chunky pieces. It will take much less time, and still look cute and unique.

, This only works on longer hair; it looks sophisticated and yet it's very easy to do.









Take a section from the side of your hair.
Pin up the sections you don't need.
Start braiding a normal braid.
After finishing that braid, bring it up to the top of your hair and over the other side.
Pin it with a bobby pin.
Do the same thing on the other side.
Finished. Spray with hairspray if wished but it should stay in place without it.

, Brush your hair out so that it is smooth and free of tangles. Scoop all your hair to one side of your head and begin braiding. Once you get to the end of your braid, tie it off with an elastic.








"

Wear your hair down.,
Do it straight.,
Wear it curly.,
Get wavy hair.,
Make cute no-heat waves.",How to Make Cute Everyday Hairstyles4," Having your hair loose is a classic way to wear it, and prevents a lot of the damage that comes from keeping it in elastics all day, every day. Here are some ways to get started.

, To straighten your hair, you can dry it with a blowdryer and a round brush, or flat-iron dry hair. Some people with stubborn hair blow dry first, then finish with the flat iron. Either way, make sure you use a product that helps protect your hair from the heat.








, Use a curling iron, curling wand or crimping iron to add curl to dry hair. Again, use a heat-protecting product on your hair.









To curl your hair without heat, start with damp or wet hair the night before. Twist small sections into tiny buns, and set with gel, mousse or hairspray. Take down dry hair in the morning and tousle gently. Do not brush out.

, To put some wave in your hair, dry it with a blowdryer and a diffuser attachment, scrunching it close to your scalp.








, The night before, braid damp or wet hair into two or four braids or French braids, depending on the texture you want your hair to be tomorrow. Make sure that your hair is dry or damp. Braid your hair pretty tightly so that you can comb your hair tomorrow without losing the wave. In the morning, take out your braids and tousle gently. Do whatever you want with your bangs. Enjoy!

Check yourself out in the mirror.,
Invest in a good pair of scissors.,
Set up your home barbershop.,
Wash your hair.",How to Layer Cut Your Own Hair1," Since you're cutting your hair at home, take extra time to examine it in the mirror and decide where you want the layers to be. If you want, take a picture of your face, print it out, and mark out where the layers should go. Some people like long, natural-looking layers, while others choose bolder looks with sharper distinctions between the different hair lengths. Take the following factors into consideration:


Your hair texture. Layering tends to add body to hair, especially when some of the layers are short in length. If your hair is already full-bodied or curly, you may want to go for longer layers that don't differ much to frame your face.
Your face shape. Think about what layer length is right for the shape of your face. Longer layers look gorgeous with round or square faces, while shorter layers accent faces that are oval or heart-shaped.
Your style preferences. If you're trying to emulate the look of a certain celebrity or popular hairstyle, figure out how to make it work with your hair. Decide where the layers should fall, how your hair will be parted, and how you'll style it in the end.;
, The most important tool required to make sure your hair turns out looking great - and not like your little sister cut it in your sleep - is a sharp, professional-grade pair of barber scissors, also called shears. Using craft scissors or kitchen scissors will leave you feeling unhappy with the final result. Pick up a pair of good scissors from a beauty store or drugstore.

, Work in a well-lit place with access to a sink and a mirror - probably the bathroom. Have a towel ready to drape over your shoulders, a set of hair clips for holding back sections of your hair, your scissors, and a comb at your disposal. A second mirror you can use to check out the back of your hair is also necessary. You may also need a spray bottle filled with water to keep your hair damp, depending on how fast it dries.

, When you're ready to get started, wash your hair and comb out the tangles with a wide-toothed comb. Towel it dry so that it's damp, but not dripping. You’ll achieve the best results by starting with clean hair."
"
Get synthetic hair.,
Backcomb the hair.,
Seal the dread.,
Thread the dreads.",How to Make Cyber Falls2," Purchase your synthetic hair from a well-respected seller such as Cyberlox or I Kick Shins. Once you have the hair, decide what length you would like your dreads to be. For beginners, it is easiest to start out with the hair folded in half, as once you backcomb you already have a loop at the top, and it will be much more secure to work with.
, Secure the hair to a piece of material that is pulled tight, as you will have to pull on it later. Backcomb the hair several times, separating as you go, until it is knotted thoroughly., Sealing is done by applying heat to your twisted dread to melt the hair into the final dread shape. This can be done with a steamer, a boiling kettle, a saucepan of water, or a standard hair straightener with a damp cloth draped over the dread, which is the preferred method. Using the straightener, start by twisting the fur-ball as tight as you possibly can, starting from the top and working your way to the end. Wet the cloth, and squeeze most of the water out. Place your preheated hair straightener over the dread and hold for 5 seconds. Continue all the way to the end of the dread. Remove the cloth and voila - your first Synthetic dread., Once you have completed your recommended amount of dreads, thread the dreads onto elastic so you can tie it around your ponytails. Usually dread falls come with two sides to be worn over two ponytails. A standard set of dreadfalls is 30 dreads per side for thin hair or those people with an undercut, or 45 dreads per side for those with thicker hair."
"
Buy your materials.,
Fold and sew the crin.,
Add some Rexlace.",How to Make Cyber Falls3," Cyberlox are quite simple, yet the material can be quite expensive. Buy your materials from a respected seller, such as the ones mentioned above., Using a hair tie or piece of elastic, carefully fold your crin over the hair tie/elastic and secure by sewing with a standard needle and thread. Continue this until you have your desired thickness., Cyberlox look best when teamed up with Rexlace, which is attached simply by tying it onto the hairtie/elastic."
"
Add accessories.,
Use ribbons.,
Wear a headband.,
Use clips, combs or barrettes.",How to Make Cute Everyday Hairstyles5," One or two well-chosen accessories can really make your hairstyle stand out. One accessory - two, at most - is sufficient.

, If you're fastening your hair into a ponytail or bun, add a ribbon to the style. You can tie the ribbon over any elastics, effectively disguising them, or use the ribbon alone.

, Headbands can be elaborate or simple, and worn with loose or fastened hair. Experiment and see whether you like the headband to be close to your hairline, or farther back on the crown of your head.


Thick Hair: When you have thick hair in a headband, it tends to spread out over the headband, and look weird. You can fix that by pinning back a puffy section of your hair on either side of your headband.

, These can be used to fasten your hair, or simply for decoration. Make sure the colors or designs don't clash with your outfit or hair color.

Divide your hair into sections.,
Trim the front top box.,
Trim the front right section.,
Trim the front left section.,
Trim the back sections.,
Comb your hair out and examine your layers.",How to Layer Cut Your Own Hair2," Unless you deliberately want an asymmetrical style, you'll want to make sure the layers on either side of your head are the same length. In other words, the layers at your temples should be the same length, the layers behind your ears should be the same length, and so on. To do this, divide them into sections by layer.









Make sure your parts are straight and even.
Make a ""top box section."" Use the comb to create two parts: on on the left side of your head, and one on the right. The top box is the section of hair between the two layers.
Divide the top box into two parts: the first part extends from the crown of your head to your forehead, and the second part extends from the crown of your head to the nape of your neck. Use hair clips to keep the sections in place.
Make right and left front sections. The two front sections start at your temples and end at the top of your ears. Comb the right and left front sections out and hold them up with clips.
Leave the back sections loose. You won't be cutting the longest part of your hair, so leave it down as a guide against which to measure the other layers.

, Unclip the front top box section. Lift your hair at a ninety-degree angle from your head and hold it straight between your forefinger and middle finger. Keeping your hair between your fingers, bring it down in front of your face. Slide your fingers toward the tips of your hair until they are level with the place where you want your shortest layers to start. Trim the length of hair sticking out from between your fingers.









The ninety-degree angle extends the hair straight out from the head, producing a uniformly layered haircut.
It's common to cut the shortest layer just below the earlobe, or right at the jawline. Use the picture you took of yourself as a reference. Alternatively, for longer hair, cut the shortest layer right at the shoulders.
Err on the side of making the layer longer, rather than shorter, than you want it to be. When your hair dries, it will shrink up a little. You can always cut more if you need to.

, Unclip the front right section of hair. Lift your hair with your fingers at a ninety-degree angle from your head. Hold it straight between your forefinger and middle finger. Bring it down the side of your face and slide your fingers toward the tips of your hair until they are level with the place where you want the side layers to be cut. Use the scissors to trim the length of hair extending from your fingers.









Trim at an angle, rather than in a horizontal line, for softer-looking layers.

, Unclip the front left section of hair. Lift your hair with your fingers at a ninety-degree angle from your head. Hold it straight between your forefinger and middle finger. Bring it down the side of your face and slide your fingers toward the tips of your hair until they are level with the place where the right side layer was cut. Use the scissors to trim the length of hair extending from your fingers.








, If you wish, you can also add layers to the sides and back of your hair. Using the second mirror frequently to check your work, lift small sections of hair and trim them with the scissors. The layers in the back sections should be the longest, so avoid cutting them too short; they should be just as long or longer than the other layers.








, Once you've finished cutting, check all of the layers to make sure they fall where you want them to. Cross check your cut by examining the hair vertically and horizontally. If you see uneven layers, carefully trim the hair to make them look even.








"
"
Make a ponytail at the top of your head.,
Slide the elastic down the length of your hair.,
Cut off the end of your hair.,
Remove the elastic and examine your layers.",How to Layer Cut Your Own Hair3," It's easiest to turn your head upside down and use a comb to help you gather it. Use an elastic band to secure the ponytail at the top of your head.









The ponytail should be on the top of your scalp, not the crown of your head. This ensures the layers will be positioned correctly.
Make sure it isn't cocked to one side, since this could result in uneven layers.

, If you want short layers, stop sliding the elastic several inches from the tip of your hair. For longer layers, slide it down until it's about one inch from the end of the ponytail.









Alternatively, slide your fingers down instead of the elastic. This method may be more beneficial to those with longer hair.

, Use the scissors to chop off the section that's sticking out from the ponytail.









If you have thick hair, it may take more than one snip to get through all of the layers. Make sure you cut them all in the exact same place.
Don't cut at an angle, or the layers will look jagged. Make sure you hold the scissors horizontally and cut straight across.

, You will have even, natural-looking layers around your head. Trim individual pieces if you want to alter your look.

Stop straightening your hair.,
Use volumizing shampoo and mousse.,
Curl or perm your hair.,
Blow-dry your hair upside down.,
Incorporate finger waves into your style.",How to Increase Your Height Using Your Hair1," If your natural hair is textured, curly, or wavy, don't straighten it. Embrace your natural lift and make it work for you. Just avoid letting your hair grow out too far horizontally., These products are especially important for fine hair. Volumizing shampoo minimizes the amount of residue left on hair that could weigh it down.Mousse is a styling product that directly gives lift at the roots. Massage mousse into clean, wet hair near the scalp. Blow-dry your moussed hair while pulling a round brush through it to optimize your hair's volume., If your hair is naturally straight, or you just want to add more texture, there are many ways of temporarily curling your hair. Curling can be done relatively easy at home with a curling iron or rollers. A ""permanent wave"" adds wavy texture or curls to even the straightest hair through chemical processing and heat. Perms are fairly difficult to do at home and are best left to professional stylists if you are inexperienced., Tilt your face forward and drape your hair in front of you. Drying in this position will lift your roots from your scalp, giving more volume.


If you have bangs, dry them right-side up before you start. Your bangs are likely much shorter than the rest of your hair and won't have the same weight. If you dry them upside down, they may stick up too much., Finger waves are a subtle, easy way to add volume and texture to short hair. Damp hair is bunched together in multiple hair clamps and allowed to dry to form the ""waves."" Variations use curlers at the hair's tips and mousse for hold and added volume."

Try it out!,
After you used your remedy for awhile, and you see the benefits, you could recommend it to friends or post your success story online!",How to Make a Remedy for Silky Hair," Remember that a remedy is not a shampoo, shiner or conditioner. A remedy is a self-made product (liquid, cream or gas) for a specific purpose. Your purpose would be to make shiny hair. In order to do that, you need ingredients for your remedy. Since this is your own invention, you will choose what ingredients you want or do not want in your formula.;
, The materials you need, will be listed at the bottom of the page, or you can read on here. First, you will need a glass bowl (not used for cooking after!) a new wooden spoon, some plastic wrap and a notebook with a pencil. The notebook will be used for recording any notes while you figure out your formula

, We will not get into details like the ingredients listed behind your shampoo bottle, because those are scientific ingredients that are usually hard to get. First, you must know that you should include natural and organic materials in your formula (like fruit juices). Let's start with some ingredients below:


Olive oil. Olive oil (regular, as extra virgin smells) is great for your hair, because it nourishes your hair, smooths the ends and does not take away the hair`s natural oils. It replenishes the hair especially after a rough winter. If you use olive oil in your remedy, do not include a lot, mix it with warm water and always remember to wash it off later. Not only is olive oil good for the hair, but it is also really great for the skin too. (Some spa`s actually use olive oil to hydrate skin too!)
Coconut oil. Coconut oil has pretty much the same effects as olive oil. Not only that, but it also leaves hair smelling delightful. Natural coconut oil is more preferred, rather than canned coconut oil. Follow the same procedure with coconut oil (use, wash, rinse out with shampoo.)
Egg yolk. Although egg yolk may sound gross on your hair at first, it is actually really good for your hair. It is better on short hair rather than long, because egg yolk is quite thick. The reason it is so good for hair is because it has protein and natural oils as well. Just remember to wash the egg yolk off very thoroughly and do not leave it on for more than 30 minutes.
Rose petal juice. Another remedy for hair that can be used in mixture with other remedies is rose petal juice. This is made by boiling fresh rose petals in hot water, and using the cooled down extract for your hair. If used alone, you can keep the extract on your hair for more than 30 minutes, but you must rinse after.

, Some of the ingredients listed above for hair are natural, soft (not harsh) oily substances. Remember to avoid using acids on your hair (such as lemon acids and acids from most fruit) because they actually strip the hair of its natural oils and shine and burn the hair. It is not good to experiment on your hair with these acids. Instead lean towards using the oils mentioned above and extracts from herbs (like camomile).

, Using the information about oils and acids listed above and after recording down your own remedies or other online information, make a list of what ingredients you would like to use in your remedy. Remember to be sure if those ingredients should be mixed or not. It is not good to mix oils with thick ingredients (like olive oil and egg yolk). Also do not mix oils with substances like water because they will not mix (oil will float on top). A remedy does not mean mixing a bunch of good ingredients. A remedy also means choosing the ingredients and using them separately after following the remedy's procedure. Write down your list of ingredients in your notebook, after making sure they are safe on hair. Do not put unknown chemicals or ingredients in your hair, and do not put any ingredients together that will cause a reaction (like vinegar or baking soda). Read the precautions at the end of this article very carefully.

, After recording the ingredients, it is important to test them out in order to make sure that they are good for your hair. This is your remedy and it should be focused on improving your hair.


Try out each ingredient on your hair using the following steps:

Take a small amount of the ingredient and mix it with the same amount of warm water.
Leave the mixture on your hair for about 10 minutes.
Wash it out with warm water, and use shampoo to rinse it out.
Dry your hair with a towel.

It is important to mix the ingredient with warm water, so if it is not good for your hair, it is not too concentrated. Then do not leave the mixture in your hair for a long period of time, because it may have bad effects (that is the whole point of the test).





,, Remember the remedy does not work right away, but how does your hair look right after. Is it greasy, is it clean or dirty, does it smell bad. Remember not to use more than one remedy every 3 days, because that will damage your hair as it requires you to keep washing your hair over and over. Washing your hair too often is not good for the hair (it takes away the oils).

, After finishing using one remedy on your list (every 3 days) record down the results as soon as you get out of the shower, when you dry your hair, and after 2.3 days, how does your hair seem. If you are not happy with the quality of your hair after this time has passed (your hair got worse) then cross this ingredient off of your list, and move on to the next. Remember to write a short summary of what happened to your hair beside the ingredient on your list. Do this with each and every one of your ingredients. Write something like:


This ingredient was not good (or was good) for my hair. It left my hair greasy (or clean) and very oily (or shiny). After 2 days my hair was worse (or better). I will (not) continue to use this product as part of my remedy.

, After weeks of testing out the effects of all the ingredients on your hair (and writing down a summary of what happened), write a new list with only the ingredients you would like to use in your remedy. These ingredients should be safe to use separately, and safe to use in a mixture. Be sure that these ingredients were good for your hair. If you are unsure about one ingredient, then test it out again. After you are done, write down the new list.

, After making the new list, decide whether you will mix the ingredients for your remedy, or whether you will use them separately. If you decide to mix them, then make sure that it is safe to do so. If you will use them separately, you will make a procedure stating in which order they should be used. Remember to include that after using one ingredient you must wash hair thoroughly and wait at least 3 days before using the next. Be very precise in your instructions. If you are deciding to mix them, you must state all the ingredients on a separate piece of paper and write ``Remember to leave only 30 minutes or less, and wash hair thoroughly after using`. This should be written for all remedies (time period may change though).

, After completing all of the above steps and procedures, you must actually make your remedy. If you are mixing the ingredients, then take an empty bottle (preferably a rinsed, clean, empty shampoo bottle and fill a quarter of it with warm water (do not use only the remedy because it will be too concentrated). Then mix the ingredients of the remedy in a separate bowl and when it is mixed thoroughly, pour it in the shampoo bottle. Close the lid and shake the ingredients, then use immediately. Since most of the ingredients are going to be extracts from food or juices that means they will spoil in a short time after mixing them altogether, so the remedy must be made fresh and used immediately after. Do not store any mix that remains, you must throw it out. If you are using the ingredients separately, you do not need to put them in separate bottles, just keep them in their natural bottles and take them out when needed and apply to hair. Just remember to make a list of instructions in order to remember the order and amount of ingredient for your remedy. In both cases, rinse the remedy out after 20-30 minutes (or less if desired).

, You can use the same bottle over and over for a mixture just make sure you rinse it out thoroughly and change it every 6 months. The label should include your name, the title of the remedy and precautions (like time to leave it in hair and that you must rinse it out and dispose of remaining mixture). Also remember to list the list of ingredients on the side of the bottle. If using ingredients separately, remember to make a procedure list.

, Now that your remedy is done, try it out and make it fresh. Follow the rules and enjoy the shiny hair. You can still use your old shampoo that wasn't really improving your hair with the remedy, which will give you shiny hair (according to your results). Just remember to wait. Shiny hair is not going to come after one use, but if you followed the correct procedures, then your hair will improve in 2 months or so. Remember not to use your remedy too often though.

, Share your remedy with friends or family and pass it around. You will have shiny hair and be proud knowing you created a remedy that works! Now you don`t have to buy an expensive hair product or go to the salon often, for the wrong reasons!

Put your hair into a topknot or bun.,
Tease your hair.,
Go retro with a beehive, bouffant, or pompadour.",How to Increase Your Height Using Your Hair2," There are enough variations of this hairstyle to fit any look, from trendy to conservative. To add height, pick a bun that is more towards the top of your head rather than to the side.Topknots are also increasing in popularity among men with longer hair., Also called backcombing, teasing adds volume by introducing small, controlled tangles to hold hair up. All you need is a fine-tooth comb and a little hairspray.


Teasing too much or too often can cause damage to your hair, especially if it's dry., Not everyone can pull off these ""dated"" looks. However, if you have the right attitude and fashion sense, they may be a good option for adding a few inches to your height. Only wear these styles if you are comfortable with standing out.


A less exaggerated version of these ""pouf"" styles is currently popular. Sometimes called the ""hair bump,"" this style tends to be more subtle while adding substantial lift.

"
"
Separate a four-inch wide section of hair from your crown.,
Backcomb the hair section slightly with a teasing brush to create the base for your bump.,
Take the teased section and loosely twist it a few times, leaving the straight half free and pointing downwards.,
Use hair volumizing inserts to skip the teasing and cut down on style time.",How to Increase Your Height Using Your Hair3," The hair section should be centered so that it is surrounded by more hair on all sides. Lift this section and hold it up vertically. You can either leave your bangs down or include them in the bump by joining them together.

, If you don't have a teasing brush, a fine-tooth comb will do. Run the brush or comb from the middle of the hair two the roots two to three times. The brush should penetrate only the back half of the hair section to maintain a neat look., Push the teased section up slightly and pin it into place with a wide hair clip. If your hair is thick, you may need more than one clip. Once your hair is secure, run your fingers through the straight portion of the hair section to blend it with the rest of your hair., A variety of leave-in hair inserts are available as a shortcut to the hair bump. Just section your hair as in step one, place the insert towards the back of your crown, and layer your hair over the insert. You can also use them to make a bump towards the front of your head using only your bangs instead. The three major types of inserts are:


Velcro: The velcro insert resembles a dome. Place the flat side against the top of your head. The velcro will both hold the insert onto your head and the hair section over top to form the hair bump.Plastic: These crescent-shaped inserts are lined with teeth to hold hair in place. Position the curved part on the crown of your head like a head band. Many popular sets come with multiple sizes for different pouf heights.Foam: Sponge hair rollers take a little more skill to use than other inserts. They must be clipped into place sideways over the crown using bobby pins. Some teasing may be necessary for the draped hair section to hide the insert from view."

",How to Increase Your Height Using Your Hair4," If your hair is long, it can make you look shorter in proportion. If you aren't planning on putting your hair up, keep it cut to shoulder length or shorter.


If you are a man with visibly thinning hair, try shaving it off completely. Studies have found that men with a completely shaved head appear taller than men who are balding., This narrows your appearance, making you seem taller. If you keep your hair very short, as in a typical men's style, buzz your hair on the sides of your head very short and keep the hair on top a little longer. , If your hair is fine and difficult to style, layering adds volume without requiring product for maintenance or altering texture. Long bangs that frame your face also create a lengthening effect.,"

Also, before you go to bed each night, put your hair in a braid especially after a shower ( If you have long hair).",How to Have a Nice Hairstyle When You Are Obese," Some basic things you need are shampoo, conditioner, brush, wide toothed comb, heat protection, and whatever else you think is necessary.


It is important to keep your hair clean and conditioned. This does not mean scrubbing the living daylights out of your hair day in and day out, however. This simply means washing as often as needed. If you can, try to wash your hair every other day. It is okay to wash every night, but this can weaken your hair.
Brush and comb out your hair every day and night. This will keep knots from forming. If you get knots in your hair, however, I suggest a detangling spray or serum. Brush from the bottom of your hair, working your way to the top. When your hair is wet, do not brush it. Instead, comb it out with a wide toothed comb. Dreadlocks and pulled out hair don't always look the best...
Deep condition your hair once a week, but once a week only! When deep conditioning, leave the conditioner in your hair for about two or three minutes, and comb through your hair so you coat every strand with conditioner. Make sure you rinse well.
When using heat appliances, such as flat irons, hair dryers, curlers and crimpers, make sure you apply a heat protection balm or spray to say your hair from nasty heat damage!
Trim your split ends once a month, as this will make you look clean and well kept, plus make your hair a lot healthier.;
, After you mastered the grooming techniques suitable for your hair type, head to the salon. The best way to get a nice haircut is to look at pictures of hairstyles and cut them out and bring them to the salon. Try online and in magazines. Look at some obese celebrities, or just a regular celebrity. Ask your friends and family what they think ever looked best on you...short hair or long hair, if you ever had the liberty of having short hair and long hair.

, Studies show that overweight people with darker hair actually look slimmer. But this is all up to you. There are many dark colors to choose from; black, brown, dark reds, blue, light brown, even dirty blonde. However, if this does not work for you, feel free to have whatever color you want.

, You can use just about anything your heart desires...gel, shine serum, hairspray, wax, curl hydration, straightening gel, mousse, anything. Curly hair and wavy hair tends to look the best, however.

, Pony tails, pig tails, bows, bobby pins, barrettes, headbands...be unique, remember it's your hair and no one else's!

, When you wake up the next morning, you're hair will have very few knots.

Styling hair- First some things to avoid.,
Styling ideas.",How to Hairstyles for Black Children," It is important to determine what type of hair your child has, because black hair comes in different textures just like any other type of hair. Hair Type 1: Straight. Hair Type 2: Wavy when wet hair forms a loosely shaped ‘S’. Furthermore, your texture can range from thin (Type 2a) to somewhat thick (Type 2b) to very thick and coarse (Type 2c). Hair Type 3: Curly hair, this hair has a tighter curl and more of an ‘S’ shape when it dries. The texture is fuller and sometimes frizzy. Type 3b looks more like ringlets or tight corkscrews with the circumference of a crayon. Hair Type 4: Kinky-this hair has a zig zag and/or tightly coiled curl pattern. This type of hair is the most fragile so be delicate when drying, combing, brushing or exposing to heat. This type increases with volume and difficulty combing as the letters increase. with Type 4b will see less of a coil or curl and the hair will bend in sharp angles like the letter ‘Z’.
, Now that you know what you're working with let's talk about the different needs depending on hair type. Straight hair needs to be cleaned often as much as every other day and as little as once a week depending on how thin the hair is and how long it takes the hair to smell bad or look greasy. Curly hair usually requires a moisturizing shampoo and conditioner and may need to be washed (or at least conditioned) daily to retain the curl pattern. I do not recommend combing or brushing outside of the shower or when hair is dry. Combing curly hair when it's wet almost always creates frizz and disrupts the curl pattern. Always use a wide tooth comb and comb hair into style while it is very wet. Most curly hair needs a product to help maintain the definition of the curl. I recommend finding an alcohol free product that is very light so that it does not weigh down the hair. Some with curly hair use too much product and have the wet look long after their hair dries. Letting hair air dry is the most protective way to dry hair while sitting under a dryer at low heat or as a last resort using a diffuser can help maintain the curls without adding frizz. For Kinky hair it is important that hair is cleaned weekly to avoid dirtying the scalp which can lead to delayed growth as well as breakage. it is also important to have any split ends removed every 3 months to avoid breakage. This type of hair is the most picky when it comes to products, heat and pulling. All of these can result in hair loss (by breaking or by being pulled to tight). Most kinky hair needs a perfect balance of moisture, sealant, oil and leave in conditioner. This will take some experimenting with different products but I recommend some of the products below., Using all natural products for all hair types is extremely important as is asking for advice from your hair stylist or from someone at your beauty supply store. It's always easier to find a black hairdresser or supply store owner/employee since they would usually have more experience with black hair care products., Avoid at all costs rubber bands on black hair. They lead to breakage and will damage the child's hair. Instead use fabric covered hair bands or anything that isn't rubber or plastic based. Next, do not use hair styles that excessively pull on the child's head for this reason I would avoid small braids or styles that use beads. I know from experience that this is not good for the hair or scalp especially for the children with Kinky hair. If you'd like to use braids the bigger the better and the looser the better. I know these do not last as long as the tighter smaller braids but your child will thank you in the long run., For straight and curly hair ponytails with non-rubber bands is a quick and beautiful style as is hair down with a headband. Hair parted down the middle at the bangs and then clipped on the sides is a good look too. For kinky hair ponytails is a good choice as long as they are not tugging at the hairline. Multiple ponytails can be productive as long as they ponytails are taken out daily and not slept in. Loose braids redone every morning and taken out at night. Headband with hair out and natural is another good idea. If you braid hair day one, the pattern from the braid can give hair a soft curl that can then make wearing a headband day two a nice option. Google natural twists, for another hair style that works well for kinky hair."

If you like to style your hair with a shine serum or oil, you put some in your hair now.






;
, This step is optional for anyone who likes a little extra volume in their up-dos. Using a rattail comb or a brush, tease the hair around the crown of your head. You can learn about the basics of teasing hair here.









Make sure that you smooth your hair over the teased section so your finished ponytail still looks smooth., Brush back your hair and gather it in your one hand. Then, set the brush down and use your free hand to ensure your hair is smooth and fix any bumps. Then, tie your hair into the ponytail with your hair tie.








Because you’ll be securing your knot with bobby pins later, it’s best to use a thin, less bulky hair tie.
Your ponytail can be low, in the middle of your head, or high. Your hair knot will look very different depending on where you place it on your head, so experiment to figure out which placement you prefer.

, Split your ponytail into two sections, and pull them in opposite directions. This should tighten your hair tie to your head, making sure that your ponytail is secure. It’s best to create your hair knot with a tight ponytail, because you’ll need to secure it to your head. Double check that you’ve gotten all of your hair up into the ponytail., This step is optional, but great for anyone who has layers in their hair or struggles with frizz or flyaways.Apply a bit of product, such as a shine serum or hair gel, to the palm of your hand and run it along your entire ponytail. Make sure that you’ve coated the entire thing with a light layer of product so that it remains smooth and sleek for hours.

, Starting at the base of your ponytail, begin twisting the entire ponytail in one direction. Use both hands to make sure it’s twisted tightly. Continue twisting until you’ve reached the end of your ponytail.







, After you’ve twisted the entire length of your ponytail, you need to begin coiling it around the hair tie at the base of your ponytail. This part may take a bit of practice. Use one hand to hold the end of your twisted ponytail, and use the other one to help form the knot securely against your head. Wrap the twisted ponytail around the base as many times as you’re able to, forming the circular bun.








Make sure to hold your knot firmly after you’ve created it but before it’s secured in place, otherwise you will have to start all over.

, Use your fingers to open the bobby pin, and then slide it into your bun so that it holds the wrapped ponytail against your head. The amount of bobby pins you will need depends on how thick your hair is, but the key is to play it safe. Use as many pins as you need to make your bun feel completely secure and immovable.








, To finish your look, grab your favorite hairspray and mist the knot. This will give it a little bit of extra hold, and also help to manage frizz. You can also spray the rest of your hair in order to keep everything sleek and in place.Hairspray is a must if you are planning on being extremely active while wearing your hair knot. If you’re going dancing, spray away!

, If you’re heading out for the entire day or night, make sure to bring some extra insurance. Throw a few bobby pins in your purse, backpack, or pocket so that if any pesky hairs start poking out of your hair knot, you can use a spare bobby pin to tame them. Nothing ruins the look of a sleek hair knot more than one rogue piece of hair sticking out!


If you’re wearing your hair knot to a casual event, it’s less important to worry about frizz and flyaways. Messy hair knots may even be preferable when you’re trying to keep it casual.

Make sure you know what you're getting yourself into.",How to Maintain White Hair1,"
This isn't something you can just pickup and 'wing'. Bleaching hair has many risks and dangers associated with it. You'll want to minimise these so make sure you get professional quality products made especially for this task. Quality shows with bleach. Many can tell a box blonde from a professional blonde, it's all aesthetic..


If your hair is darker *darker than a medium brown - black* you will need to use 30 vol. or 40 vol. peroxide, 40 isn't recommended especially on the scalp, but if you're going for an ombre or a balayage look 40 is good for getting a nice degree of lift in a short period of time.
If your hair is lighter than light brown use 20 vol.or 30 vol.
You will get away with 10 volume if you're naturally light blonde.;
"
"
Follow the directions on the packaging.,
Make sure you wear gloves.",How to Maintain White Hair2," Do not mix anything into the bleach other than what is instructed with the directions of your bleach.

, All bleach is caustic and can damage your skin leaving your fingers blistered, very sore, dry and discoloured. The bleach used in this process removes melanin so it will leave your fingers white, but the colour of your skin will return as your skin regenerates skin cells.

"
"
Make sure you stock up on suitable shampoo and conditioner.,
Look for 'healthy' shampoos.,
Look out for alcohols in your shampoo.,
Look for deep conditioners, bleaching the hair can be drying and damaging, and leave the hair feeling dehydrated, you want to do everything you can to keep it feeling and looking silky smooth and in best condition.",How to Maintain White Hair3," A good choice for bleached hair is purple shampoo or 'silvering' shampoo. This shampoo contains purple pigment which neutralises and knocks all traces of yellow and brass from the hair. If your hair is orange this shampoo will not work and you will need to bleach your hair further. You will also need a moisturising conditioner and a protein shampoo to use in-between toning with purple shampoo, you want the hair to remain as healthy as possible. Look at the labels!

, Try organic, no sulphates, no parabens, vegan and no silicone products.

, Some are good, but the ones to give a 'miss' are Isopropyl alcohol, Propyl alcohol and Ethanol, alcohols such as these dry out the hair and de-structure it over time from the inside out.

,


Deep conditioners are concentrated conditioners which penetrate further into the hair giving deep nourishment and hydration, oils are also amazing for damaged hair, especially coconut oil. Coconut oil has the ability to penetrate the hair deeply because it has a very small molecular structure allowing it to travel inside the follicle and repair the hair from the inside out, and because of it's high saturated fat content (90% sat. fat) it is very moisturising.

"
"
Put on suitable clothes or use an apron.,
Work in a ventilated room.,
Mix your bleach powder and peroxide in a NON-METALLIC bowl, with a non-metallic tool such as a tint brush or a plastic spoon or spatula


Mix the bleach until it is smooth and creamy, do not apply if there are chunks of powder in the bowl, it has to be smooth for even coverage and results, if it's lumpy your hair will be patchy and uneven.,
Start in the back.,
Stay at least one inch away from the roots.,
Apply the bleach to all of the quadrants in this manner.,
Do not wrap your hair on top of your hair or put it in a bun, let it lay loosely down as it is so that it can oxidise.",How to Maintain White Hair4," Before you begin bleaching make sure you aren't wearing any 'good' clothes.


Wear something you do not mind getting dirty and destroyed, (bleach will lighten your clothing also) and also have an old towel on hand to wipe up any spills or to wipe around your skin if you get any bleach on your hands, neck or face.

,


Bleach has ammonia in it and ammonia is known for its very, very strong scent. Some people are allergic to ammonia and this can cause the eyes to water and puff up and further reactions can happen. If any reaction happens wash off immediately and call a doctor, this is a very serious reaction.

,
Have your hair sectioned in 4 quadrants before you begin.
Part the hair in the middle and separate the back from the front *ear to ear* then you should have 2 equal quadrants in the front going as far as the ear then one section in the back, separate the back into 2 equal quadrants also and clip each of them loosely *Don't bother winding them into buns, you need ease of take-down and need to work as fast as possible, just loosely clip them!

, Take one quadrant and unclip it and starting from the nape of your neck take half an inch sections straight and apply bleach as quickly as possible to the length and ends NOT applying bleach to the roots!

, Do not apply bleach to the roots because the bleach will process much quicker at the root area because your scalp produces heat and the roots will be lighter than the ends if you apply it to the root area first.

, Leave an inch at the root area. Once all of the bleach is applied to the length and ends of the hair, let it process 3 levels then apply the bleach starting again at the nape of the neck to the root area working as quickly as possible to apply to the entire mass of hair.

, This will guarantee even results if you've applied it correctly. Allow the bleach to process for the time needed. Most professional bleaches have a process time of up to 45-60 minutes. Wash off as soon as it is the desired level of blonde. If it isn't the desired level of blonde after the maximum processing time rinse the bleach off of your head, dry and bleach again if the hair is in condition. If not, allow a week or two for the hair to rest then bleach again for the required time.


If hair is the correct shade of blonde *inside of a banana/pale butter* then you are ready to tone.

"
"
Toning can be done with a demi-permanent toner or purple shampoo, depending on what you want the hair to look like.,
Tone the hair every 2nd or 3rd wash. Don't tone every wash because you will end up with colour buildup which will dull your hair colour a lot.",How to Maintain White Hair5," If you're using purple shampoo quickly apply a generous amount to your entire head (or areas bleached) and leave on for 2 minutes and rinse. Many say to leave on for 5 minutes, but often that's too long, so try 2 minutes and if further toning is needed you can re-apply.

, To keep it white you'll need to tone it when yellow and brassy tones emerge.

"
"
Shampoo and condition every 2-3 days.,
Wash your hair with deep conditioners and masks every 2 weeks.,
Leave conditioner(s) on for over 5 minutes!

,
Rinse your hair with cold water, cold water seals the cuticle leaving your hair smooth and very shiny.,
Tone bi-weekly to prevent brassiness or yellowing.

",How to Maintain White Hair6," With bleached hair some people may be able to go an entire week without washing the hair, the longer the better. Wash bleached hair as little as possible to keep it healthy and soft.

, To keep the condition of the hair optimal, use hot oil treatments. These are good for adding moisture if you lack moisture in your bleached hair.

,, This will prevent your hair feeling dry the next day. Try washing conditioner off with cold water for a few weeks then gradually transition to washing your hair with cold water only, you'll get used to it! It may make a big difference in the health of your hair.

,"
"
Avoid excessive washing.",How to Maintain White Hair7," Washing causes it to strip the toner and that makes the hair yellow and brassy


Don't stay in the sun too long, the sun can cause yellowing, so wear a hat if you're outdoors for a long period of time to protect your colour!
Don't smoke if you really want your hair to be snow white, smoke causes MASS brassiness and yellowing...
Try to avoid air pollution, this will dull out the brightness of your hair.
Minimise heat tools.
Chlorine causes extreme yellowing, and can make hair green, so don't swim unless you can 100% protect your hair with a very good hair net/swimming hat.

Get regular cuts and trims.",How to Grow Relaxed Hair," The biggest concern after relaxing is often the level of dryness in your hair. You will need to take steps to add extra moisture to your hair to prevent frizziness and breakage.


Shampoo less frequently. Shampoo is full of chemicals and is drying to hair. When you must shampoo, try using a sulfate free shampoo, as sulfates (a foaming agent) are drying to hair.When picking a shampoo, choose one that is marketed as moisturizing or contains products such as shea or argan oil. If your hair looks oily, try to remember that the natural oils produced by your scalp are moisturizing and healthy.
Don't be shy about using conditioner. Use a large dollop and apply generously, especially to brittle and fragile ends. If time permits, let it sit for five minutes in the shower before rinsing.;
, Scalps are often a neglected area of the body. During relaxing, your scalp will be surrounded by smelly, harsh chemicals. Don't forget to show it some love in order to promote healthy hair growth.


If you are experiencing redness or itchiness, don't scratch. Try applying aloe vera to your scalp. Aloe is known for its cooling and de-itching properties.Simply rinse the gel from your hair after your scalp feels refreshed.
Give your scalp an oil massage. Use a gentle oil such as almond or baby to gently massage your scalp. This will help open and relax pores, and will be calming to your skin.
If you find traditional shampoo unbearable, try using baby shampoo. Extremely gentle and non-drying, baby shampoo is a great option if you find your scalp to be extremely sensitive after relaxing.

, Deep conditioners use specialized proteins such as keratin to penetrate within your hair's pores to add moisture. Proteins also coat split ends, improving the overall appearance of your hair.If on a budget, try a do-it-yourself mask of coconut oil. Gently massage two tablespoons of body temperature coconut oil into your damaged hair and wash with a moisturizing shampoo and conditioner afterwards. If you can't bear the oiliness in the daytime, try sleeping with the oil in and rinsing come morning.
A hair mask containing clay will help heal and moisturize your scalp as well as your hair. If your scalp feels raw, clay's antibacterial properties will help keep it clean and fight infection., Hair is composed of proteins and consuming low amounts can cause dry, brittle hair, or hair loss. Upping your intake will help restore damaged hair after the relaxing process.Most commonly, meat sources such as beef, pork, chicken, and seafood are used as a protein source.


Not a big meat eater? Try eating more dairy. Dairy products such as milk, cheese and yogurt have a high protein content but are also sometimes fortified with vitamin D. Though not enough research has been conducted, some users say vitamin D plays a role in increased hair growth.
More protein doesn't have to mean more meat. Legumes such as beans, peas, and peanuts are a high protein source.
Have protein on the go. There is many breakfast or snack bars available in grocery stores which are protein-based. Bars are a filling way to get your protein on a tight schedule.

, Low iron levels are linked to poor hair growth.Iron is required for your nutrient-rich blood to keep hair roots stimulated. Many vegetables such as spinach, broccoli, and other leafy greens are high in iron.


Be cautious about what you're eating your iron with. Iron uptake can be halted by calcium, so don't expect broccoli with cheese sauce to be efficient for your iron levels.Try eating iron-sources solo, such as spinach salad loaded with fruits and vegetables.

, Vitamin C and E aid in growth of beautiful hair.They also increase the strength of nails, encourage clear skin and strong bones.


Collagen is a major component in hair. Vitamin C aids in collagen production; this means your hair will be smooth and strong when you get more vitamin C.Vitamin C is most commonly associated with oranges, but try snacking on kiwi, blueberries, or strawberries.
Vitamin E can be taken as an oral supplement or applied as a liquid mineral oil. If you want to keep it natural and eat your vitamin E, the most efficient way to eat it is through nuts such as almonds, sunflower seeds, or peanuts., Though evidence is insufficient, it has been observed that biotin promotes healthy hair.Biotin is found naturally in dairy products, meat and fish, though in small amounts.

, After relaxing, it is best to not use heat styling of any kind on your hair. It will amplify the dryness and can cause a large amount of breakage.


After washing your hair and allowing it to air dry till damp, blow dry on the lowest heat setting. Dry for as short of time as possible to prevent excess damage.
If you must speed up drying time, use a soft t-shirt to squeeze moisture out of your hair. The t-shirt will be gentler and more absorbent than your rough towel.
Use a protectant spray if you must use heat tools. A heat spray contains proteins to coat the sheath of the hair and act as a buffer between your hair and heat tools.

, Styles such as braids do not need heat and allow braids one day, and beautiful waves the next. This cuts down on shampooing amounts and allows your hair to regain strength after the first few days of your relaxing.


Satin-covered rollers are a no-heat option. The rollers will lower the amount of frizziness, and the satin will prevent rubbing and tangling.
Whenever using hair elastics, try to use no-damage bands. Many hair elastics are designed for less damage and ripping when used.
Pick up some fashion friendly clips. Barrettes that are smooth with no teeth will prevent your hair from being damaged. Available in an assortment of styles, barrettes can be used to simply pin your hair away from your face or keep it up off your neck in a pony-tail style.

, Split ends are a part of life, no matter how well you care for your hair. After a tough processing like relaxing, already-beat-up ends can be brutalized. Regularly trim your split ends to prevent the damage from travelling up into your hair.


A professional can spot hair damage you might not be able to. Keep a pro on speed dial and get your hair trimmed regularly. Don't be afraid to ask your stylist for tips and suggestions. After all, they are there to help you.

, If you already have a reliable stylist that you know who does surfer hair well, you are in luck. Otherwise you may have to ask friends for recommendations or look up reviews online. When in doubt, ask someone else who already has great Surfer Hair where they got their cut.

, Don't leave anything to doubt. Bring at least one photo of someone who has the Surfer Hair cut that you are looking for. Some people prefer slightly longer Surfer Hair, while others prefer a more de-structured and shaggy look similar to Owen Wilson's. Ideally bring several pictures so that you and the stylist can discuss the characteristics you like in each. , Just in case there is any doubt from the photo, specify to your stylist that you are looking for a ""Surfer Cut"" or a ""Long Shag"". Those are the two terms that are most commonly associated with the cut you need for Surfer Hair.

, It can sometimes be difficult for a hair stylist to get length right. Surfer hair is a textured and de-structured look, so the cut will look slightly shorter than it actually is. This is especially true after you use products that add volume and body. Make sure they don't cut your hair too short, and hew closely to the picture you provided.


You can always ask them to cut more if it is too long. You can't do the reverse. , Do you envision it being long and flowing, or a shorter, messy mop? Even though they've seen a picture, know the cut, and know your preferred length, this detail can help them. If you've already decided what hair products you will be using, you may want to bring this up with them as well.If you want a flowing look, ask them to remove weight as well.If you want extra texture and a softer edge, ask them to point cut your tips as well., Ideally Surfer Hair isn't done with scissors, shears, or a clipper (exceptions exist when clippers are used like a razor). Cutting with a razor gives the hair the movement and separation necessary for a properly deconstructed look.


If they use scissors make sure that they soften or feather the edges., Classic natural surfer hair gets slightly sun bleached, causing natural highlights. You can imitate this look by getting highlights. Don't make the highlights too vibrant though, Ideally, your highlights should be barely noticeable. You want it to emulate natural sun bleaching.

For a curvy look, sleep with braids in your hair overnight.,
Maintain your look.","How to Get Tousled, Sexy Bed Hair1"," If you want a more tousled style but have silky, flat hair: saltwater spray is great for adding more texture to the hair. It will make the hair a bit more coarse so that it's easier to ruffle it up. This should give your hair more ""hold.""


Saltwater spray doesn't impart the same firm grip as hair spray. In general, this makes it look more natural, and makes it easier to brush out.;
, If you tease your hair (i.e. brush ""upwards"" against the strands with a brush, comb or your fingers) you can gain more volume. This can be helpful if you want to, say, add a bit more volume in the base of your hair. Make sure that you are gentle with your hair if you want to tease it. Don't tangle it up too much. Otherwise, you might fray the hair strands., The tighter the braid, the sharper the edges of the locks will be when you take it out. When you wake up, simply take out the braid(s), then separate the locks. Spray in some salt water spray and take the hair in your hand, ""crunching"" it upwards to create some texture and curves. Tease it a bit more if you want to add more volume or create a messier look.One bigger braid will make larger locks, whereas two or more braids create smaller ones.
Separate the locks with a brush for a neater look. Use your hands to keep it looking extra tousled.
Spray with some hair spray if you want the style to stay in place for a long time.

, A tousled look is easy to do touch-ups on during the day. If it ends up looking too neat, simply tease it gently. Then, ruffle and crunch it a bit with your hands. With the texture that's already in your hair, it should be easy to ruffle up.

Finish.","How to Get Tousled, Sexy Bed Hair3"," First, use a volumizing shampoo to add body.

Be careful: scrunching can cause frizz! Use an anti-frizz spray if you find it helps.

, Apply a shine serum, if you want. Apply a small amount onto your hands and work it through your hair. If you need a stronger hold—say, for a dinner or party—don't be afraid to finish off with some hairspray.

Renew the haircut every few weeks.",How to Give Yourself a Fade," Styling will be easier when your hair is full and pliable. Go ahead and clean it with shampoo and conditioner, then straighten it out with a comb. If your hair dries and you find it tough to cut, you can dampen it again by spritzing it with a spray bottle.;
, Cutting your own hair is tricky at first. A handheld mirror can help. Hold it as you work towards the back of your head. It’ll help you see what you’re doing. Afterwards, you can use it to inspect the cuts you made and find any areas that need to be corrected.

, Adjustable electric clippers are your best tool for achieving a fade. Get ones that come with several guards. Attach the guards to your clippers to cut your hair at different lengths. Start at the lowest guard number and switch as you work up your head to achieve the gradual length transition the fade is known for.


Some clippers may also have a bracket setting. When you flip off the setting, the blades cut off about an extra ⅛ an inch (3.2 mm), making it perfect for achieving lengths between those cut by guards.

, The key to a good-looking fade is balance. A fade that starts too high on your head doesn’t work well with longer hair on top. It can resemble an undercut, or make your face look longer. Before you begin, determine how long you’ll leave the hair up top. Don’t cut the hair at the tops of the sides of your head short unless you are going for a short fade.Trimming the top of your head first may help you figure out your balance. Remember, it’s better to cut your hair longer at first because you can always go back and cut it shorter.

, Start with the hair on the crown (top center) of your head. Hold your comb flat and sweep it over your head to pick up hair. Use scissors to cut the hair to the desired length. Continue working until you get to rounded portion of your head. Don’t cut the hair below it., Electric clippers come with adjustable guards. The lowest-numbered guard cuts hair shortest. Use a low guard, such as a #2.The #2 guard will leave hair 1/4th an inch (6 mm) long.
Another way to achieve a fade is to start with higher-numbered guards and create layers from the top down. This may help you if you keep cutting your hair too short.

, Work on the sides and back of your head. Hold the clippers vertically. Press the clippers down and gently sweep them upwards and off your head in a scooping motion. Move slowly and gently from the bottom of your head to avoid taking off too much hair.When you are starting out, you may wish to experiment on one side first. Figure out the cutting motion and length you need to make the hair to correct rough spots.

, The next highest-numbered guard will leave your hair a little longer. Try moving up a size or two. Alternatively, keep the same guard and flip on the bracket setting, if your clippers have the option. The brackets add about ⅛ an inch (3 mm) to the length of each guard.A #4, for instance, will leave your hair ½ an inch (12 mm) long.

, Place your clippers right above your last cut. Cut your hair the same way you did before, using the scooping motion to make short, precise cuts. Do this all the way around your head and to the other side. You’ll see the beginning layers of the fade., Look into a mirror. Often you will see a line distinguishing your two cuts. If your clippers come with a bracket setting, now is a perfect time to use it. Hold the clippers horizontally. Start at one end of your head and gently cut over the line., Switch up another guard size or change the bracket setting. Cut right above the last cut to form another layer. You may have to switch the guards and bracket setting on your clippers multiple times until you reach the top of your head., Hold up a mirror and examine all sides of your head. Look for lines left over from layering. Also, check to see if the hair length on the top of your head is balanced with the length of the fade. Go back over with the clippers to make adjustments, then finish by using trimmers or a razor to reach areas such as your neckline or near your ears.


As you are learning, the haircut may not come out very well at first. You can try to correct it, or you can cut your hair short and wait for it to grow back so you can try again.

, Once you believe you are finished clipping, you can style the hair on the top of your head using gel or another product. This is of course optional and not needed if you chose a short fade.

, Because a fade involves short cuts, hair growth will be noticeable. You’ll see the layers start to disappear as the hair gets longer and messier. Go back and fade your hair again or have a barber trim it.A friend can not only tell you when it’s time for a haircut, but can tell you where you need to make corrections after you cut your hair.

Avoid heat styling your hair.,
Keep your hair down.,
Use non-damaging hair elastics.",How to Grow Your Hair Out for Your Wedding Day2," Though some advise cutting your hair every six weeks or so, getting your hair trimmed so often will prevent significant growth. Instead get a trim every three months or so to cut away split ends but still allow growth., Brushing wet hair, especially with a metal bristle brush, can damage your hair. It can also cause split ends that are prone to breaking which will stunt the growth of your hair. Instead of brushing wet hair, brush your hair when dry with a boar or nylon bristled brush.If you feel the need to brush your hair when wet, use your fingers to detangle your hair and brush with a wide toothed comb.

, Using heat tools like blow dryers, curling irons or flat irons cause frizz and breakage to your hair. Try to cut out heat tools all together, but if you must use them, use a heat protective spray on your hair beforehand.If you don’t want to reduce your use of heat tools all together, at least give your hair a break a few days a week.

, Clips, hair elastics and pins can cause breakage or even pull out your hair, especially if you aren’t gentle when you remove them. To avoid damage, wear your hair down whenever you can., If you don’t often wear your hair down, you can still wear it up as long as you use care. Use hair elastics without any metal parts, and try to vary the position of your ponytail or bun on your head day by day. This stops your style from pulling on the same section of hair so it doesn’t get pulled out or damaged."

Try a dandruff shampoo.,
Try a mild detergent.",How to Get Kool Aid out of Hair1," Even if you wash your hair once every day, it could still take several weeks or even months to get the Kool-Aid out. Try washing your hair a couple of times each day instead. If you wash your hair more frequently, though, you should use normal shampoos or moisturizing formulas to prevent your hair from drying out too much.;
, If you only wash your hair once every day or less, try a clarifying shampoo. These shampoos are formulated to strip your hair of foreign build-up, including hair dyes like Kool-Aid. It will not remove the Kool-Aid immediately, but a clarifying shampoo will help fade it faster. Most importantly, the majority of clarifying shampoos are approved for daily use.

, Anti-dandruff shampoos are similar to clarifying shampoos in the way that they strip the hair of chemicals and possible irritants.

You may need to do this several times, but it should help to fade the dye much faster than normal shampoo.

, Laundry detergent and dish soap can both remove hair dye, including Kool-Aid, but they also have the potential to severely dry out and damage hair, so they should be used sparingly.

Choose a style that suits your face shape.,
Identify your hair texture.,
Match your hair texture with the right style.,
Consider celebrity styles.,
Talk to a professional.,
Preview colors before dyeing.,
Consider your personality.",How to Get an Awesome Hair Style1," There are many reasons a hairstyle might not work for you, but imbalanced head symmetry is one of the main offenders.Use the following descriptions of the main kinds of face shapes to find which closest matches your own:



Oval: this face shape can be identified by its length, which will be roughly 1.5 times longer than the width.Round: shaped faces will have equal width forehead, cheekbones, and jaw, but your features will be softer in general and your jawline rounded.Square: this shape is characterized by equal width in the forehead, cheekbones, and jaw, with sharp, angular features.Heart: sometimes called the ""inverted triangle,"" this face shape generally has a wider forehead and narrows slightly at the jaw. Classically, this style also has a widow's peak.Diamond: these face shapes are most noticeable by the cheekbones, which should be your widest feature.Your jawline and forehead will be about equal in length, though shorter than your cheekbones.;
, Imbalanced symmetry is often created when your hairstyle offsets the natural balance of your head shape. To prevent this, consider the following guidelines for head shapes:



Oval: thanks to the balance and symmetry of this head shape, most styles should work well with this head shape

Round: hairstyles that add length to the face and frame it should look great on this head shape, especially styles that add volume to the crown (top) of the head. Short bobs, blunt cuts, or straight fringe style might be less flattering.

Square: longer hair that softens and frames the edges of your face might be the way to go. Long bangs and layers moving from the jawline up should be considered. Avoid short cuts, as these may accentuate the square shape of your face too much.

Heart: any look that softens the framing of your face, including waves and curls, are typically a good choice for this shape. Be wary of longer styles, especially those that frame your face, or styles that add to the width of the top of your head.

Diamond: bangs can help moderate the angles of this shape, but also blunt, shoulder cuts and longer haircuts with feathery bangs suit this shape. Keep away from excessive layers and volume., The coarseness or fineness of your hair can limit some of your options for hairstyle, but can also open up new possibilities. Hair is usually divided into three categories: fine, medium, and coarse. To figure out your hair texture, wet your hair and pull it away from your scalp. Hair that is:


Thin in width is considered fine.
Neither thin nor thick is medium.
Thick in width is considered coarse., Now that you know the texture of your hair, there are some general pointers you should keep in mind while choosing a style for it. These are not rules, per se, but most of the time:


Fine hair can lack volume, so the use of volumizing products can add an extra dimension to your hairdo. Styles that have only slight graduation, like the bob-cut or the wedge, are good options.
Medium hair is relatively balance and can be thinned with razor cut styles or thickened with blunt cuts that have light graduation.
Coarse hair can appear bulky or heavy. Products that lessen the weight of your hair and slim down the appearance of bulk are useful. Razor cuts, layered cuts, and styles that diminish your hair's thickness are prime options., Celebrities are often forerunners of trends and fashion, and you might find an awesome new haircut that's perfect for you among the Hollywood elite. Look at celebrities that share your face shape and have a similar hair texture. This can remove much of the guesswork from figuring out your new 'do.

, Even if you're planning on changing your hairstyle yourself, consulting a professional stylist can point you in the right direction. Stylists have experience with many different face shapes and hair textures, so with one look, she may have an awesome suggestion.

, Technology can help put you at ease before applying dye to your hair. Some people prefer a different color to their natural shade, but before you buy hair dye, take a picture and use a photo editor to change the color of your hair. This way, if the color you have chosen clashes with your skin tone or doesn't look as awesome as you intended, you'll know beforehand.


Be aware that depending on the darkness of your hair, achieving certain colors may be difficult without a professional., Some hairstyles come with attitude. Ultimately, your preference will determine which style you think is most awesome, but think about the image associated with different hairdos. If you don't want to be confused with a counter-culture punk rocker, a classic Mohawk might not be for you.

Brush your hair into the ponytail shape, secure tightly with a hair tie, and then push on the pony tail to adjust your hair volume.

Make sure you have good tools.A quality blow dryer, flat iron, or curling iron can be the difference between heat damaged hair and your most awesome 'do.,
Guard your hair with heat protectants.,
Use the correct heat settings for irons.,
Blow dry like a pro.,
Flat iron your hair.,
Curl your hair.",How to Get an Awesome Hair Style3," Having the right tools for the job can put the awesome style of your dreams within your reach.

, Before putting any heating tool to your hair, you should use a heat protectant. These products help you avoid unnecessary damage by shielding your hair from some of the negative effects of heat. Heat protecting spray, creams, or serums are available at most beauty supply stores and boutiques. Apply your protectant to your hair before touching the hair with the styling tool., Curling irons and flat irons with only one setting can be too hot and lead to frizz and damage. Look on the package for the temperature settings. Most adjustable tools go from around 175 degrees to 400. 400 degrees is too hot for non-professional use, so avoid using that setting.If your hair is fine or thin, use a much lower temperature setting. If your hair is thick or coarse, you can use a higher temperature setting. Just remember not to go over approximately 350 degrees.Choose flat irons and curling irons that have the proper plates. Plates made of ceramic and tourmaline are better for your hair. Stay away from chrome and gold because these can lead to hair damage.

, Professional blow dryers that have stronger air flow and more power will be more efficient for your styling purposes. These will also help reduce the chances of heat damage while drying.But even with a high-end blow dryer, you should avoid doing this too frequently, as it will eventually damage your hair., If you want straight hair, use a flat iron. You can make use of this tool even if your hair is already straight, if it's only wavy, and can have a marked effect on curly hair. To flat iron your hair, separate it into layers. From the bottom layer, take your hair in segments, working your way from root to tip and from the inside to the outside of your head. Place a small amount of hair into the straightener, press down, and drag your hair through the plates.


Wait until your hair is completely dry to flat iron your hair. Otherwise, you could severely damage it., Soft, romantic curls, big beach waves, or tightly coiled curls look great with just about anything. Use a curling iron for more uniform curls. Larger, loose curls, can be attained through the use of a 1-inch barrel curler. For tighter curls, barrels under 1-inch are preferred.For loose, soft curls, divide your hair into sections. The number of sections will depend on your hair type, with thinner hair having fewer sections than thicker hair. Curl each section with the curling iron, then lightly run your fingers through to loosen them up.
Try curling your hair with a straightener. This gives a slightly different look to your curls, and will add variety to your hairstyles. Separate your hair into sections. Place one section of hair into the straightener, then turn the straightener 180 degrees. Tighter curls can be achieved with a full, 360 degree twist of your straightener. Pull the straightener along the strand to finish the look."

Take a shot at punk chic.,
Weave some style into your look with the woven braid.,
Try the stellar space ace style.,
Go for the faux undercut.",How to Get an Awesome Hair Style4," This style is generally well suited to heart, round, and square shaped faces with medium texture hair or thicker. Apply a light hairspray to your hair to assist with styling, and use a large barrel curling iron to curl your hair from the middle of your hair to the ends.


When you have completed curling, use your fingers to create some separation between your curls.
Keep your fringe straight.
Set the look with a light hold hairspray.

, Take your favorite scarf and place it around the front of your head so that its ends lay at the nape of your neck about ½"" away from your hairline. Now divide your hair into three strands, with the outer two being somewhat smaller than the middle one.


Collect your scarf along with the outer strands of your hair.
Cross your left strand over the middle so that it becomes the new middle section, then cross the right strand over the new middle strand.
Repeat this motion until the braid is complete.
Knot the ends of your scarf to complete the look., Short, fine hair framing an oval, square, or round face should work well with this cut. Use a light volumizing mousse in your dry, ready to style hair, and use a blow dryer and paddle brush to give your hair a sleek appearance.


Create a deep part on the side of your head.
With light hold gel or wax, style the left side of your deep part so that it is smooth.
Move on to the crown of your head and, using your styling product, fluff and spike the back of your hair.

, Make a deep side part in your hair that reaches all the way to the nape of your neck. Clip the side with more hair so that it is out of your way and brush the other side. Now you can tie the shorter side under the longer tightly with an elastic.Free the side with more hair and apply some strong-hold mousse.
Blow dry while using a round brush upward to give your hair dramatic volume.

Speak up if you're disappointed.",How to Get a Haircut You Will Like," The best way to determine if a hair stylist is a good fit for your needs is to talk to clients who’ve worked with him or her. That means asking people with haircuts that you admire for stylist recommendations. If a friend or family member always seems to have a really great cut, ask who styles their hair so you can consult the stylist. You don’t just have to ask people who you know for stylist recommendations. If you see a stranger with a haircut that you really love, ask what salon they go to and which stylist they see.
If you decide to make an appointment with the recommended stylist, make sure to drop the name of the person who referred you. It can help give the stylist an idea of what type of look you prefer.;
, Even if a trusted friend or family member recommends a stylist, it’s a good idea to do a little more research on the stylist to ensure that they are a good fit for you. That’s because your loved one may have a different hair type than yours, and the stylist may not be as skilled at cutting your type of hair. Search Yelp, CitySearch, and other business reviews sites to see what clients have to say about the salon and the stylist.Take an average of the reviews that the stylist or salon that you’re considering, so you can get a pretty good idea of their skill level.
Salons often have Instagram accounts where they post photos of the cuts and styles that are done by their stylists -- and individual stylists may have their own accounts. Check out the photos to see if you like their work.

, Prior to getting your haircut, you may want to check out the salon that you’re considering to see if it you like the vibe without making any major changes to your hair. That’s why booking a blowout at the salon is a good idea. You can check out the facilities and get a feel for the stylists so you’ll know if you be comfortable coming back for a haircut. If possible, ask for the stylist who you’re considering to do your blowout, so they can get a feel for your hair and you can ask about potential hairstyles. Keep in mind that not all stylists do blowouts, though.
If you don’t get a blowout from the stylist who you’re considering, you might ask if you can speak with them before you leave so you can see if you feel comfortable.

, Before you start explaining the things that you want in a haircut, it’s a good idea to describe your hair issue or problems with your stylist. That way, they will know if the haircut you describe will work for you. For example, you might tell her that your last haircut accentuated your hair’s frizziness or didn’t make it look as thick as you’d like.Make sure to discuss the thickness and texture of your hair with the stylist as well, because a style that looks good with fine, straight hair probably isn't the best option for thick, wavy hair.
Point out any cowlicks that are a concern for you because the wrong haircut can make them more obvious.
In addition to talking to the stylist about particular hair issues, you should also mention any concerns about how the cut will look with your face shape. For example, if you have round face, you might explain that you want a style that will help make it appear longer.
Even after you describe your hair concerns, the stylist should touch and study it prior to cutting. You want to be certain that they really understand your hair type and texture before they pick up the scissors.

, Stylists are usually visual, so having a photo of the type of cut that you like can help your stylist understand what you want. Go through some magazines to find pictures of the look that you’re going for. However, it’s important to keep in mind that just because you like the look of a certain style doesn’t mean that it’s the most flattering cut for your hair type and face shape.You don't just have to bring pictures from magazines. If you have a photo of yourself with a past haircut that you really liked, bring that to show the stylist.
Don’t overwhelm your stylist with a bunch of inspiration photos. Three or four is enough for him or her to get an idea of the type of cut that you want.

, Everyone’s point of view differs, so you and your stylist may not have the same idea when it comes to certain generic terms. Instead of saying, “Take off a few inches,” show them specifically how much you want cut by holding your hand up. Don’t just tell your stylist that you want bangs; explain exactly what type of bangs you want, such as blunt cut, wispy, or side-swept. You want to be sure that they understand exactly what you want in your haircut.If there are certain things that you don’t want in haircut, be specific about those as well because knowing what you don’t like is just as important as knowing what you do like. You might say, “I don’t like any harsh lines,” or “I don't want too many layers.”

, You might get a haircut that looks great when you leave the salon, but never looks the same once you wash and style it at home. That’s because you don’t spend the same amount of time styling it as your stylist did at the salon. To ensure that your hair looks great every time you style, tell your stylist how much maintenance you’re willing to put into your hair.For example, If you know you won’t get up 20 minutes early to blow dry your hair with a round brush every day, make sure your stylist knows that.
If you tend to go a long time without getting your haircut, let your stylist know so you don't wind up with a layered cut that will look awkward growing out.

, While you may have a very specific idea for the haircut that you want, it isn’t necessarily the best fit for you just because it looks good on your cousin or your favorite celebrity. Your stylist is trained to know what styles will work with different hair types, so they might tell you that the cut won’t work with your hair. It's normal to be disappointed, but you're better off taking the stylist's word for it than winding up with a style you hate.If you have your heart set on a certain cut that your stylist doesn’t think will work for you, ask them to suggest alternatives. There may be similar looks that will work better with your hair type and texture.

, If you want to ensure that you’re happy with your finished haircut, it’s important to pay attention during the process. That way, you’ll be aware if your stylist starts to do something that you don’t like. It will also keep your head nice and straight, so it’s easier for your stylist to cut accurately.To make sure that you’re pay attention, it’s best not to read a magazine or play with your phone while you’re getting your haircut.

, While you should pay attention to what your stylist it doing, you shouldn’t try to do their job, which means you shouldn’t constantly be questioning what they're doing. Asking those kinds of technical questions can actually distract your stylist, and may affect their performance.It’s okay to make small talk with your stylist as they work, but keep the conversation light so they can stay relaxed.
You shouldn’t be afraid to voice your concerns if you think that your stylist has misunderstood what you want in the cut, though. Just make sure that you’re polite. You might say, “Hang on a second please. How much are you cutting off again?”

, While they are cutting your hair, your stylist may suggest certain products, such as shampoo, conditioner, mousse, and gel, that work best with your new style. Make sure that you pay attention to the recommendations so you can achieve the same look when you’re styling your hair at home.Most salons sell the products that they recommend to clients, so you may want to pick up the items that the stylist suggests while you’re there.
If you want time to think about what products you want to purchase, ask your stylist to write down their suggestions to ensure that you don’t forget the product names.

, If you want to recreate the same look that you leave the salon with, it's important that you understand to maintain it at home. In addition to the products that you should use, be sure to ask your stylist how to style the cut on your own. You may even ask for a walk-through of all the steps, so you're certain that you understand.Remember to inquire about how often you should get a trim too. While it's usually recommended that you cut your hair every four to six weeks, a short cut or a style with layers or bangs may require more frequent touch-ups.

, In some cases, even if you find a stylist that you're comfortable with and discuss all of your hair concerns and habits, you may wind up with a cut that you don't like. Don't be afraid to go back to the stylist and ask for a revision -- most stylists are going to want with you until you're fully satisfied. Be polite and calm as you explain what you don't like about the cut, though.If you're not sure how to tell your stylist that you don't like the style, you might say, ""This isn't really what I thought it would be.""
It's important to point out the specific things you don't like about the cut, so the stylist can correct them. For example, explain that your bangs are too heavy or there aren't enough layers.

, Hair can be a useful canvas uncut but if you want it shorter or longer you might want to try a cut a few months in advance of the actual school opening date to see how you like it.

, Clean hair (But not too clean, maybe washed yesterday evening is good) is an obvious necessity, and any other basic styling products (Gel, mousse, hair lotion or conditioner) are good, plus any accessories you might choose to wear.

, Pull back long hair if you want it styled like that, or dampen a hairbrush and run it through your hair to tame frizzes. A straight part is good for clear skin but it draws attention to your nose and lips, which might not be good on a day where you have a massive zit, for instance. Choose your part according to your face shape, and you can find more about that elsewhere.

, Long, straight hair may need extra maintenance or more shower time, and short hair is, though less work, often a hassle if you want to dress up.

, Dye jobs should be done at a salon, and curling irons ought to be used with care- if at all.

, Your hair says a lot about you, for good or for ill. Long, straight black hair on a normally pale, fair person may give people the impression that you're Goth or depressed, but bottle blonde waves on a small, normal-looking girl looks totally fake. African-American girls can style their hair the same way, with no problems, but very light colored, straight hair may send a message that you're trying to look too preppy. Short haircuts like a bob are often perceived as little-girly, but shorter, more masculine cuts may make people think of you as a tomboy, and that you don't like to comb all your hair!

, If you hair is super thin, you might not look good in a hairstyle that is suited for thicker hair. The rule of thumb is if you pull all your hair back into a ponytail and the distance around the ponytail is the size of a quarter or more--then you have thick hair. If the distance around the ponytail is the size of a dime, then you have thin hair.

, How can you tell if the face shape will work for your shape? Look at the face shape of the person modeling the hairstyle. You must also pay attention to the hair texture.

, Put four notches under your hairline, on both cheeks, and on your chin. You'll need a mirror to assist you with this, of course.

, If it is by a little, look at the shape of your jawline. If it is rounded and you have a wide or narrow hairline, then you have an oval face. If you have a square jaw and a wide hairline, you have a square face, while a narrow hairline is a pear face shape. If you have a pointed jawline with a wide hairline, then you have a heart face shape, while a narrow hairline is a diamond face shape.
If your face is longer than it is wide by a lot, this is your guide on this step. If you have a rounded jawline and a wide or narrow hairline, you have an oblong face shape. If your jaw is square with a wide hairline, your face is rectangular, while a narrow hairline is a pear face shape. If your jawline is pointed with a wide hairline, then your face is triangle shaped while a narrow hairline is a diamond face shape.
If your face is not longer than it is wide, this is your guide on this step. If you have a rounded jawline with a wide or narrow hairline, then you have a round face shape. If your jawline is squared with a wide hairline your face is square while a narrow hairline means a pear shaped face. A pointed jawline and a wide hairline makes for a heart shaped face while a narrow hairline makes for a diamond shaped face.

, Along with Zooey Deschanel, Reese Witherspoon, Carey Mulligan and Kate Middleton, you have what it takes to pull off just about any pixie cut. Buzz it, crop it, sweep it to the side or anything else you prefer.

, Round faces tend to have larger foreheads and good angular and soft bangs really help soften that up and even it out.

, Those with long faces need to be cautious when getting the cut done because the wrong pixie can really exaggerate how long your face really is. Oblong faces should stick to the longer pixies, almost to the point of bobs, but you can balance it out with wavy bangs or pull them and slick them to the side.

, Those fortunate to have strong and angular jawlines can define and soften them up with a shaggy, choppy, and effortless pixie to really corner those angles.

, Diamonds can really add volume to the top to create a fuller head shape and cropping up the sides with choppy sideburns can really give gorgeous angles to your jaw and cheekbones.

, Beware of cowlicks and matted down hair from your pillow in the morning. Pixies get dirtier faster because the hair is short and gets covered with oil quicker. But, it is a cleaner and more hygiene-aware hairstyle, since all of the summertime sweat gets absorbed by long hair.

, Confidence is key with this style and you must recognize the strength it takes to really make the big chop. Anyone who is daring enough to brave the modern and flashy pixie cut deserves respect.

Go to the beauty supply store and find a swatch that matches your current color.If you’re having trouble determining your color, you can ask an employee at the beauty supply store to help you.;
, Try to pick a color that matches up with the base of your current hair color. The base means the coolness or warmness of your hair color. With red hair, you are likely to have a red, red-orange, orange, or gold base. It is better to not choose a dramatically lighter color if you’re coloring your hair on your own, but you can pick whatever color you desire.A higher level number means a lighter color.

, The developer helps the color activate. You will need to pick the developer according to how much lighter than your current hair color you want to go. For a color that is the same as your current base, you will need a 10-volume peroxide developer. For a color that is one or two levels lighter, use a 20-volume developer. Pick a 30-volume for three levels lighter, and a 40-volume developer for four levels lighter.Keep in mind that your hair is more susceptible to damage when you choose high level developers.

Flip your hair back over and touch up your hair.",How to Feather Your Hair," A feathered hairstyle is a look that is created with layered hair, with smooth layers that flip out and back looking almost like the overlapping feathers on a bird. The hair is usually parted down the middle and then curled back away from the face. It requires a finely-textured layered hairstyle and can be created from short and smooth hair or long and curly.Feathered hair has a somewhat retro-look, similar to the big, flowy hair styles from the 70's. Farrah Fawcett is the perfect example of feathered hair or the original Charlie's Angels.;
, In order to achieve the best feathering look you'll need layers in your hair, and you probably want to go to a professional to have this done. You can layer your hair yourself if you are good at cutting your hair. But, if you don't have much experience cutting your hair, ask a professional to give you the feathered look. They should know what you mean and be able to give you that look.


You may want to figure out what type of feathered look you want before you get your hair cut. You can have long hair with feathered layers, or you can go very short. Before you go into a salon, decide if you want that long or short look. Try looking at pictures online of feathered hair to help you decide.
Feathered hair from the 70s usually had bangs that were parted down the middle, so if you really want to go for feathered look, have bangs cut in your hair.
You can do this look without layered hair, but layered hair does help create the more feathery look around your face. If you don't want to get your hair cut just to style it, then don't worry about adding layers.

, Before you style your hair, you'll want to wash it so that you can add volume to it and create a part. For a true feathered look, part your hair down the middle, separating your bangs in the middle and parting them to the sides. If that is too much for you, you can part your hair as usual.

, If your hair is naturally wavy, after you wash it, you can let it air dry or you can blow dry it with a diffuser. If your hair lacks body, apply volumizing mousse or spray. Before you dry it. If your hair is naturally straight, apply some curling mousse and volumizing mousse to add body and wave to your hair.Make sure as you blow dry your hair that you are maintaining the middle part you have created. To achieve the best volume and prepare your hair for the feathered look, use a round brush and pull the hair your surrounding your face through the brush. Have the brush pull your hair away from your face, so that the hair around your face is curled or smoothed backwards.

, After you have dried your hair, you'll want to spray it with a heat protectant, because the majority of this hair style is based on using a curling iron. Spray the heat protectant throughout your hair, coating it evenly. This will keep your hair from being damaged by the heat from the curling iron., Divide your hair into four sections, separating it down the middle, and then making two sections out of the parted sections. Usually you would separate your hair by layers, but because the curls at the front of your head will be bigger than those at the back, it's best to separate hair by the type of curl you are going to create.


Basically, draw a part down the middle of your hair, from the top of your forehead to the hairline on your neck. Separate those two sections, pushing your hair in front of your shoulders so that it doesn't accidentally overlap. Then, divide each section in half, and use a clip to pin each back section. After you have clipped back your hair, you should just have your two front sections of hair down by your face. After you have finished each front section, unclip the back sections of hair and let them fall behind your shoulders. Try to keep your front sections that are already curled in front of your shoulders so that you don't accidentally grab some of those curls and try to curl them again.
You can separate your hair by layers if you want, but it isn't necessary. Separating it into 4 sections may be easier, and it will keep you from having Shirley Temple curls. You want to avoid these because you don't want tight ringlets -- you want loose waves.

, Using a one inch curling iron, start at the front of your hair, and curl half an inch to one inch sections of hair. Make sure you start on the bottom layer of your hair so that it won't get lost underneath the top layer. Curl your hair two inches or so away from your head so that you end up with loose curls towards the end of your hair.

, With the feathered look, you want the most volume around your face. So, when you curl your hair, don't wrap your hair in the curling iron towards your face. Take the curling iron and start by wrapping your hair away from your face, towards the rest of your hair.Basically, take a strand of hair, and put the curling iron behind it. When you look in the mirror your hair should be in front of the curling iron. Then, wrap your hair over the top of the curling iron. This will be wrapping your hair away from your face, which will help create that feathered, voluminous look.
You don't want these curls to be ringlets, but you do want them to last a while, so if you need to hold the curling iron on your hair for more than a few seconds, you can do so. You will brush out the curls later so it is okay if they are bouncy.
If you have short hair you may have to start farther up with your curls, only one inch or so away from your head.

, Once you curl the front sections of your hair, move on to curl the back sections. These sections will have bigger looser waves, so take one inch sections or more of your hair and curl them, starting again at the bottom layer. The back of your hair shouldn't be very curly -- you'll want to end up with loose waves once you are done curling your hair.

, You don't want your bangs to be ringlets, so take a large chunk of your hair (two inches or so) and curl upwards, wrapping your bangs over the top of the curling iron. You can curl them before they are separated or you can curl them after they have been parted.


With your bangs, you will want to start near your hairline since your hair is shorter. However, make sure you are curling your hair away from your face. If you wrap your hair in the wrong direction around your curling iron, your hair will loose that feathered look and will just look like ringlets around your face.

, Once you have curled all of your hair, spritz hairspray throughout your hair. You don't want to spray too much, as this will make the curls hard and give them a crunchy feel, but you want to spray enough so that your hairstyle is maintained throughout the day.

, After you have sprayed your hair, flip your hair forward and run your fingers through the curls your have created. This is the step that will create the loose waves and volume in your hair. You can shake your head if you need to loosen some of the curls.Don't worry about brushing too many of the curls out. The feathered hair look doesn't rely on curls, except for those that frame your face. Curling your hair just helps to give it volume and texture.

, Your hair might look a little crazy once you flip it back over, so you might need to touch it up. Use your hands to smooth out any fly aways in your hair. You can also reposition your curls by twisting them back with your finger. Make sure you separate your bangs so that you have bangs that frame both sides of your face. Then, admire your look!

Maintain your blowout.",How to Do a Blowout Hairstyle1," Achieving the perfect blowout requires clean hair, so the first step is to wash your hair with a good quality shampoo that's suited to your hair type.


For example, if you have flat, limp hair opt for a volumizing shampoo or if you have very dry, frizzy hair go for a moisturizing shampoo.
Rinse out the shampoo, then apply conditioner to the ends and mid-lengths of the hair. Don't apply conditioner to your roots as this can weigh your hair down and leave your blowout looking flat.
Rinse out the conditioner with a blast of cold water to lock in extra shine.;
, Trying to blow-dry dripping wet hair is a bad idea, as it will take forever and expose your hair to unnecessary heat damage.


So once you're out of the shower you should blot the excess moisture from your hair using a clean, dry towel.
Never rub your hair with the towel as this can be very damaging to the hair and will cause it to frizz.

, The next key step in achieving a smooth, sleek blowout is to apply some good styling product to the hair, while it's still damp. The type of styling product that works best for you will depend on your hair type.









For example, if you have very straight hair which tends to lie flat against your scalp, a volumizing mist applied to the roots and lengths of the hair can work wonders. If you have dry, frizzy hair, a smoothing serum or cream will keep hair looking sleek. Never apply serums or creams to the roots as this will weigh the hair down.
If possible, apply a styling product with added heat protection properties, as this will help to prevent hair damage during the blowout.

, Turn your hairdryer to the medium heat setting (the high setting is usually too hot for anything but extremely thick, coarse hair) and begin to roughly dry your hair, using only your fingers. This will speed up the blowout and prevent excess pulling with the hairbrush.









As you dry, make sure to point the nozzle of the hair dryer towards the floor, rather than upwards, as this will encourage the hair cuticle to lie flat, thus minimizing frizz and maximizing shine.Concentrate on drying the roots of the hair at this point, as it will be difficult to get close to the hair nearest the scalp when you start using the hairbrush.
Stop rough drying when your hair is about 75% dry.

, When you have finished rough drying, brush out your hair to remove any knots or tangles. Start at the ends and work your way up, as this causes the least damage.









When hair is detangled, begin dividing it into sections. How many sections you need will depend on the thickness of your hair.
Some people will only need two sections, while others will need as many as eight. Use a clip or hair tie to secure each section.

, Divide each section of hair into 2 inch (5.1 cm)-wide pieces and begin blowdrying with a mixed-bristle round brush (which smooths and straightens).









Pull the brush through each 2 inch (5.1 cm) piece of hair, following the brush with the hairdryer and remembering to keep the nozzle pointed downwards. The key to a perfect blowout is to keep the hair pulled as taut as possible as you dry.When you get to the tips, your can either turn the brush outwards to get flicked out ends, turn it inwards to get curled-in ends, or pull it straight out from the head for poker straight hair. Blow dry each piece three times from roots to ends.
Begin your blowout at the front sections of hair as these are the parts that people will see first and are therefore the most important. If you start at the bottom and wait until the end to dry the front sections, your arms will be tired by the time you reach them and you won't do as good a job., Once the section you are working on is completely dry, you can move onto the next. Remember to work from the front to back and from top to bottom.









When you have completed a section of hair, your can either leave it hanging loose, or you can roll it into a loose curl and secure it with a clip.
If you want to add extra volume, try wrapping each completed section of hair around a large velcro roller. This will add body to the hair as it cools and sets., Once the final section of hair is completely dry, remove all of the clips or rollers, shake out your hair and give it a final blast using the cold setting on your hairdryer.









If you spot any remaining frizzy or kinky bits, you can cheat a little by running over them with a straightening iron. Just don't use the iron on your whole head, as this will affect volume.
Finally, spritz or squirt some shine serum into your hands and rake your fingers through your hair. This is better than applying the product directly to the hair, as it distributes it more evenly.

, A blowout hairstyle can last for several days if you learn how to maintain it properly.









Use dry shampoo to eliminate any greasiness and add volume and texture to your hair on the days following your blowout.
Use a thick, plastic shower cap to prevent steam from frizzing up your hair in the shower.
At night, loosely twist and pin your hair into sections and wrap a silk scarf around your head to avoid the friction that causes tangles and frizz. Alternatively, try sleeping on a silk or satin pillowcase.

As the result, this hairstyle may cause the wearer to look like they've been electrocuted! , To achieve a blowout haircut, you will need the proper equipment. This includes a hair clipper with at least 5 hair guards, a t-liner outliner, a pair of hair shears, hair combs and some hair gel.

, Using the t-liner, create the first guideline on the back of the neck and the beginning of the sideburns. The length of the hair in this guideline varies according to personal preference, but it will usually be somewhere between 0 levels and 1 levels.

, Next grab your number four guard with the clippers closed and create a second guideline which extends about 2.5 inches (6.4 cm) above the original guideline. This will help you to see how much room you have to work with.

, Using a number 3 clipper guard, start blending the first and second guidelines together, using an outward motion.

, To avoid having your blowout look like a mushroom cut, use a clipper over comb technique to cut the hair next to the guidelines. This helps to soften the blowout by creating a taper effect.

, Once you have finished tapering the back of the neck and the sideburns, use the hair shears to cut the hair on top of the head and above the ears to the desired length. It can be as long or short as you wish.

, Once you have finished with the shears and are happy with your blowout haircut, use some hair gel to spike the hair on top of your head to give it a neater, more polished look.

Trim the flat top every few weeks.",How to Do a Flat Top," Talk with the person whose hair you're cutting and decide how long the top and sides should be. This information can help you decide which clipper blades to purchase (see Step 3).


Do they want it thicker around the sides, or do they want skin showing around the head?
How much hair do they want to leave on top?;
, Three major brands are Oster, Wahl, and Andis.

, Blades come with specific length settings. For example, the Oster ""000"" blade cuts hair to 1/4 inch. In general, 1/4- to 3/8-inch attachments are good choices for standard flat tops.


For flat tops with very close sides where the skin shows, select the smallest-length blade (e.g., an Oster 0000 for very close, 1/8-inch sides).
Although clippers come with detachable plastic length guards, these are not as effective at producing smooth, even results in one go as the steel blades., Work in small sections, making your way towards the back of the head.


Use a blade-on-skin technique to cut vertical sections around the sides and back. To perform this technique, comb a small section of the hair downwards, rest the clipper attachment against the skin starting at the bottom of your section (the blade part should point upwards), and move up in a vertical line.When cutting the sides, be sure you follow an imaginary vertical line up to the sky - do not follow the curve of the head. When the head starts to curve towards the crown, just continue moving your clippers upwards into the air., Although the flat top is a square haircut, the back needs to be slightly blended into the top for a balanced effect.


""Round off"" means instead of working in an absolutely vertical line all the way to the top (as you would at the sides), move your clippers to follow the curve of the head just slightly at the beginning of the crown.

, Use the same technique on the left side as you did on the right, i.e., moving straight upwards in a vertical line.

,


Start at the back of the crown and, holding your comb parallel to the floor, lift a small section of hair upwards to the desired length.
Use clippers to raze away excess hair sticking out of the comb. Hold the clippers so they are parallel to the comb.
Work your way, section by section, to the forehead. Use small sections to avoid clipper lines.
Make sure every section is as long as the previous one.
Comb the hair back from the forehead and repeat the top-cutting process for a clean, even finish., Cut off all long hairs or areas that need touching up with scissors.

,


Hold the t-trimmer with the blade against the skin, and then pull the clipper away at the same angle.
Start at the bottom and work upwards gradually - working downwards may cause irritation., Apply a little product and comb the top upwards with a brush or comb.


Blowdrying the hair upwards can also help add volume and shape.Dab the forehead afterwards with a towel to make sure there's no product left over on the skin.

, The long hair on top is likely to grow out quickly, requiring regular maintenance to keep it looking fresh.

Move the two side sections to the front of your shoulders so they don’t get in the way whilst you’re doing the bun as you don’t need them yet.

, You may need to put it in a ponytail first, to help you to form a bun. Don’t have the bun sitting right on top of the head as it will affect the length of the plaits. Make sure the bun is positioned horizontal to the top of the ears.

Make sure that the braid is very tight to your head so that it won’t come undone while you play.


French braiding your hair is the same as normal braiding, except instead of braiding straight down, you add a section of hair every time you cross over the center.

Go a little farther than you normally do.,
Line it up.,
Try both sides.,
Use a comb for a straight part.,
Flip your hair for a more natural part.,
Let your hair fall across your face.",How to Do a Deep Side Part1," If you normally part your hair on the side, go a little deeper than you normally would. To keep it in place while you work on your hair, you can use a clip on the side with more hair, away from the roots., A deep hair part should line up with the highest point of your eyebrow. Doing so will make the look seem more sophisticated and clean. Just use a comb to help you see where the part should go, starting from the highest point of your eyebrow arch.You can take the part a little further down for an edgier look.

, No one is perfectly symmetrical. Therefore, make sure to try the part out on each side of your head. You may find that one side looks better than the other, or you may find that both look equally good. Either way, you have that information for the future., To get a straight line in your part, use a comb to make the part. Take the corner of the comb and drag it up through your hair in a straight line, then split your hair to either side based on where you drew the line. You may need to go over it again.

, While a straight-line part can look lovely, you can also take a messier approach. After you've dried and styled in your hair, simply flip up your hair from the side you choose. This technique creates a rounded crown of hair on top of your head, as well as the messier part.







, If your face is round, letting the hair come partway across your face. In other words, with a down-do, don't just sweep your hair back or behind your ear. Let it frame your face. Doing so gives your face more definition."

Use it to create more volume.,
Use it to soften certain face shapes.,
Try it on long or short hair.",How to Do a Deep Side Part2," A deep side part naturally gives your hair more volume because you're piling more than half your hair across the top of your head. Therefore, if you're looking for a large and luscious look, a deep side part is a good call., Some stylists think that a deep side part works especially well with certain face shapes. For instance, it works well with a round face because it helps elongate your face. Also, a side part that doesn't go too far will work well with a square face. Nonetheless, nearly every one can wear a side part., The deep side part works with most hair lengths. Therefore, if you've thought this look wouldn't be right for you, try it to see how it looks. You may be surprised how good it looks on your hair length.However, keep in mind that you want volume on top of your head with long hair but less volume with short hair. Too much volume on top on short hair can make you look off-balance.
Also, with short hair, adjust your part according to your layers. If you have lots of short layers up near your face, don't make your part as deep.

Try alternating curls.,
Straighten your hair before you finish your look.,
Create a look with extra volume.,
Try an edgy twist.,
Don't forget to use a product.",How to Do a Deep Side Part3," One look you can do with a deep side part is to alternate curls. Using a medium to large curling iron, curl the first small section of hair towards your face. With the next section, curl away from your face. That creates a nice wave with your curls., Another option is to straighten your hair. A deep side part works equally well with curly or straight hair. After you've figured out where your part will be, use a straightening iron to smooth out your hair in small sections. You might want to use a protective spray beforehand to keep your hair from being damaged., Start with volumizing spray while your hair is still wet, but concentrate it on the roots. Use a blow dryer to dry off your hair, but as you do, lift up your hair from the roots, so it dries a bit lifted. Make sure to part your hair as it gets close to being dry, then use the blow dryer to dry it into place.You're creating more texture up top so it doesn't look like you just combed your hair over.

, Another option is to twist or pull part of your hair back. On the side with less hair, pull back most of the hair. You can now twist it or just leave it straight. Pin it in place at the nape of your neck with bobby pins.Try criss-crossing the bobby pins to help them stay in place., When you're parting your hair deeply, you may need to use a hair product to help keep it in place. You can lightly spray your hair with hair spray, for instance, or use a lightweight styling gel. Either way, adding a little product will help keep your hairdo looking nice all day or night.

, To keep it in place, use two bobby pins and put them in an ""X"" shape on the hair at the nape of your neck.

,, Use both of your hands for complete control.

, To do this, cross the strand closest to your face under the next strand and over the middle strand. Then, take the strand furthest from your face and cross it under the strand next to it and over the middle strand. This is one normal stitch of a five-strand braid.

, Cross it under its neighbor and over the middle strand. Repeat this with the other side. Make sure to add loose hair on that side too.

, This means that all your hair is to the side and incorporated into the braid. You can either put it into a side pony or continue by braiding a normal five-strand braid (as instructed above) to the bottom of your hair. Tie off with an elastic.

, The trick to making the Dutch five-strand look beautiful is to gently tug on the outer edges of the braid. This fluffs out the braid and makes your hair look much thicker. This technique is known as ""pancaking"" the braid. Do this along both edges all the way down the braid.

, Add a blast of hairspray if desired. Now you're done!

Wash your hair at least twice a week.,
Wash your hair with lukewarm water.,
Apply a small amount of shampoo to the palms of your hand and massage it into your hair.,
Let your hair air-dry.",How to Manage Thick Hair1," If your hair is especially unmanageable, wash it every other day. When left unwashed, thick hair can build up grease and grime, and it can tangle wildly out of control. Use shampoo and conditioner, but not every day. Shampoo helps keep your hair from getting too greasy, and conditioner helps tame it so that it doesn't grow too wild.


Be careful not to wash your hair every day. If you overuse shampoo and conditioner—particularly products with nutrient-leaching acids and chemicals—you will wash out the essential oils that keep your hair naturally sleek and grease-free. Furthermore, drying your hair can take a lot of time and eat into a busy schedule.;
, Warm water will relax your hair follicles, making your hair softer and easier to handle. Avoid hot water, which can actually damage your hair.

, After you add the shampoo, add some conditioner to your hair and scalp and let it dry for at least 30 minutes. This will make your hair soft and manageable. It will also allow the conditioner to soak in your hair and scalp.


Don't condition your whole head. Only put conditioner from the middle to the ends of your hair—conditioning the top of your head could bring back the greasy look.

, Blow-dryers can actually damage your hair with excessive heat, and towel-drying may only serve to tangle your hair further. If you do use a blow-dryer, make sure to use it on a low-heat setting. Too much heat could dry out your hair and undo all of the conditioning.

Plait your hair before bed.",How to Manage Thick Hair2," Don't use a coarse brush like boar bristle—stiff brushes may damage your hair or even tear it out.

, When you shower, directly after conditioning, run a brush/comb through your hair repeatedly until it feels like silk.

, Your hair may feel perfect already, but brush it again to remove even the tiniest of tangles. It will be easier to deal with it now than in the morning. 30 minutes after you shower, comb your hair with a wide-toothed comb. Work through the ends, then the middle, and then the scalp. This will help you de-tangle the hair.

, Get into the habit of running your hands through your locks to check for knots. Find the tangles before they get out of hand, and you may not have to deal with thick, twisted hair later on. Run your fingers through a knot to open it up.


Consider carrying a small comb or brush with you in a bag or purse. You can use this to keep your hair in check throughout the day and brush out knots as soon as they appear.

, When you sleep, your hair rubs against the pillowcase, and thick hair tends to twist into knots. If you weave your hair or put it up overnight, you will be much less likely to develop knots and tangles while you sleep. It is much easier to brush and go in the morning if your hair is sleek and tangle-free.

Cut your hair short.,
Use hair-thinning shears to remove some of the bulk from your hair.,
Take fish oil supplements to keep your hair sleek and healthy.,
Use oils and hair masks to soften and moisturize your hair.,
Try sleeping with vinegar in your hair to make it shinier.",How to Manage Thick Hair3," Short hair is much easier to deal with. It is also less likely to develop split ends, which add extra bulk and frizz to hair. Look at pictures of short hairstyles and try to find something that captures your fancy.

, Thinning shears cut some strands short, but leave others long so that your hairstyle does not look significantly shorter. Ask a hairdresser to thin out your hair when he/she gives you a trim, or buy your own shears to do it yourself. You can find thinning scissors anywhere that sells hairdressing equipment—try beauty-product stores and pharmacies.


Consider getting layers cut into your hair, or try layering your hair yourself. Layers may make your hair feel much brighter, and they may bring out some natural volume—especially if you have curly hair.
If your hair is thick and curly, consider straightening your locks with a hair straightener. You can do this yourself or ask a hairdresser to help out. Your hair may feel even thinner and lighter if it's straight.

, Look for a quality omega-3 fish oil at a health-food or herbal remedy store. Fish oil helps prevent dandruff, buildup, and grease, and it even keeps your skin looking healthy. Take it as the packaging recommends—usually about a tablespoon a day

, Rub oils directly into your hair for a natural conditioner. Consider using argan oil, avocado oil, jojoba oil, tea tree oil, almond oil, and even olive oil. Many natural hair products contain at least a few of these ingredients, but you can also apply the pure oils on their own.


Try deep-conditioning your hair with a hot oil treatment once a month. This will help your hair stay smooth and tangle-free for longer periods of time.

, Combine equal increments of white vinegar and warm water, and put the mixture into your hair every night. Wrap your hair in aluminum foil and a scarf when you sleep. In the morning, wash the vinegar out with shampoo and conditioner. Do this for three weeks in a row, and your hair should look as shiny as ever.

Use volumizing conditioner on fine, flat hair.If you have straight, silky hair with no frizzing problems, you want a conditioner that’s going to add some much-needed texture to hair that might otherwise seem to just hang from your head.,
Look for light-weight moisturizing conditioner if you have wavy hair.,
Moisturize thick, curly hair with a deep-hydrating conditioner.The curlier the hair, the dryer it gets.,
Protect the intense curl in African American hair with a deep-hydrating conditioner or oil-based products.",How to Pick a Hair Conditioner for Your Hair Type1," Volumizing conditioner is lighter than a regular formula, and doesn’t add extra weight to hair when used regularly.


People with fine, flat hair should never use smoothing conditioners; these heavy products will make your hair hang even more flatly.;
, Wavy hair can be hard to work with — in humid weather it can frizz out of control, and in dry weather it can grow limp. The more curl there is in a strand of hair, the dryer the end of the strand gets, because it’s hard for the natural oils from the scalp to wind their way down a curled strand than a straight one. Although wavy hair doesn’t tend to be as dry as curly hair, you still need a moisturizing conditioner to stand in for those oils that aren’t making their way down to the tips of your hair.


However, since wavy hair can still flatten out throughout the course of the day or in dry weather, you want to avoid moisturizing conditioners that will weigh down your hair.
Look for products marketed specifically to wavy hair, rather than curly hair.

, If you have thick, curly hair, odds are that without a deep-hydrating conditioner to make up for the lack of oils making their way from the scalp to the tip of the strand, you’ll have dry, dull hair with a tendency to frizz.


Look for conditioners labeled as “deep hydrating” or for curly hair specifically.
You should also consider using a leave-in conditioning mask on a weekly or bi-weekly basis. These conditioners are meant to be left in your hair for 10-15 minutes, then washed out like regular conditioner. With regular use, you should see a significant change in the way your curls hold together rather than frizzing away.
You should also purchase leave-in conditioner in spray form. You can spray this product onto your hair when it’s either dry or wet to keep it soft and hydrated.

, African American hair is sometimes described as “kinky” due to the intensity of its curl. However, with the right conditioning products, even the curliest hair can be shiny and healthy. In the grocery store, look for the section of the beauty aisle geared specifically toward African American hair products; they’re designed to boost moisture in a way products for non-black hair usually can’t compare.


Products with shea butter or various types of oils — from coconut oil to the more expensive Moroccan argan oil — are a good bet.
Though this is unrelated to conditioners, you shouldn’t shampoo your hair regularly. Shampoo every 7-10 days — every 14 days at the minimum.Over-shampooing will strip the hair of natural oils, causing even more dryness and counteracting the positive benefits of your conditioning routine.

Use color-safe or color-depositing conditioner if you dye your hair.,
Skip conditioner altogether or use volumizing products on oily, limp hair.,
Use hydrating conditioner on slightly-to-moderately dry hair.,

Look for “relaxed” conditioners or leave-in masks for relaxed hair.Many African American women choose to have their hair “relaxed,” or chemically straightened.,
Treat dandruff with light, fragrance-free conditioners.",How to Pick a Hair Conditioner for Your Hair Type2," As time passes after your initial dye application, you’ll notice that the dye in your hair will get washed away by your showers. To keep the color vibrant for as long as possible, you’ll want to choose an appropriate conditioner.


It’s the water, not the conditioner, that washes the dye from your hair when you shower.
However, color-safe conditioners seal hair cuticles, allowing your hair to hold onto the dye for a longer period of time.Look for packaging that advertises products as “color safe,” “color extend,” “color care,” or “sulfate-free.”
Color-depositing conditioners actually deposits a small amount of color each time it’s applied in the shower, not only maintaining the richness of the original color, but also hiding the roots that emerge as your hair grows out for a period of time.Make sure to choose a shade of color-depositing conditioner that matches your dyed color.

, If your hair is oily, then adding moisture back into your strands after shampooing isn’t really your concern. However, if skipping conditioner altogether makes you uncomfortable, stay away from products advertised as “hydrating” or “moisturizing,” as they will only make your hair greasier and flatter.


Look for products styled as “volumizing,” “light,” “strengthening,” or “balancing.”

, If your hair isn’t severely brittle or damaged, but feels a little on the dry side, switch to a product that advertises as “hydrating,” “moisturizing,” “balancing,” or, if you have wavy or curly hair, “curly.”

, For this kind of hair, you’ll need to use more intensive formulas. Hair often becomes “damaged” and dried out by prolonged exposure to heat from regular styling, but heat damage is not the only reason for extremely dry hair. Your hair may be unhealthily dry simply your scalp has trouble producing enough oil to distribute throughout the strands. Either way, conditioners that advertise themselves as treatments for “damaged” hair will be effective on hair that’s dry both because of heat exposure and natural causes.


In addition to your daily conditioner, you should also purchase a deep conditioning mask and use it at least once a week.
Coconut oil is also an effective weekly treatment for extremely dry hair.

, While the process may yield the smooth results you want, it can also dry out your hair. To fight that problem, you should avoid over-washing your hair — no more than twice a week. When you do wash your hair, you should use either a deep-conditioning leave-in mask instead of regular daily-use shampoo, or conditioners specially formulated for relaxed hair.


Relaxed conditioners can be found in the “African American” section of the beauty aisle or online.When using leave-in masks, remember to let the product soak into your hair for at least 10-15 minutes before rinsing it out, or else it won’t have time to hydrate your hair effectively.

, Dandruff is a scalp issue, not a hair issue; the skin on your scalp grows and dies at a faster rate than in people without dandruff, leaving an embarrassing flaky white residue in your hair and on your shoulders.The shampoo you choose will have more of an effect on your dandruff than your conditioner, but there are still many products on the market geared toward treating this condition.


Look for lighter conditioners rather than high-moisturizing or oil-heavy ones that can contribute to the problem on your scalp.Hair products with heavy fragrances often irritate the scalp, which leads to more itching, and more evidence of your dandruff on your clothes. Avoid heavily perfumed conditioners.

This helps fight frizz during the air drying process. If you have fine hair, put some oil onto any dry ends.;
, You can start the drying process before you even step out of the shower. Gently squeeze the excess water from your hair. After you squeeze as much water out of your hair as you can, take your fingers and comb through the strands. Fluff your hair so the strands separate. This helps your hair dry faster.Try not to get your hair wet again after you rinse your hair. Pin it up as you finish your shower, or keep it out of the spray. This decreases the water in your hair.

, After you get out of the shower, flip your head upside-down. Shake your head around for a few minutes. Use your fingers to lift the roots to speed up the drying time.Shaking your hair gets air flowing between the strands. This helps it dry faster than letting the strands stick together.

Squeeze the hair in the towel for a few seconds. Release and move on to the next section. Go over your hair and blot again as many times as needed.


Use a different section of towel each time you dry a new section. This ensures you are not placing water back onto your hair.
Don't rub your hair too vigorously with the towel. You can cause damage to the cuticle even with a microfiber towel.Instead of a towel, try using a soft cotton shirt or a pillowcase. The cotton will absorb the moisture and protect your hair. You can also try blotting with paper towels. This helps reduce frizz., While drying your hair, focus on the roots instead of the ends. The ends will dry faster than your roots. To make your hair dry faster, remove as much water from the roots as possible.Blot or gently squeeze the roots multiple times with your towel. Use a smaller towel to get closer to the roots as a large towel will not work.
Fluff the roots of your hair continuously. Turn your head upside down and run your fingers through the roots. You want to get as much airflow to the roots as possible to make it dry faster.

, Hair experts say you should never use a brush on wet hair. Instead, untangle your hair using a wide-tooth comb.This helps keep frizz down and reduces damage done to your wet hair.


After combing, make sure to use your fingers to separate the hair strands or shake your head. Keep the strands loose to promote airflow.
Add hair care products either before or after you comb your hair. Your hair needs products in it so you can style it when it is dry. Depending on what you want, try curling lotion, anti-frizz serum, or sea-salt spray.
Use the comb to set your part. Then try not to touch with your hands. This can lead to frizz., After blotting all the water and loosening the strands, let your hair air dry. The time it will take to dry completely will depend on the thickness of your hair, how much water you removed, and the weather.


If it is taking a long time to dry, flip your head upside down every few minutes. This gives the air access to more surfaces of your hair, allowing for a faster drying time.
Another option is to run your fingers or a comb through your hair every 10-15 minutes.

Check in about 10-15 minutes, and your hair should be on its way to being dry.Make sure to remove excess water before putting it up in the turban. Gently squeeze the water from the strands, then blot the excess moisture from your hair. Then wrap it in the turban.
Instead of buying a special turban, just wrap your hair in a microfiber towel.

, Plopping is a great way to air dry curly hair. Start by applying product to your hair. Wrap a soft cotton t-shirt around your head. Instead of wrapping the shirt like a turban on top of your hair, twist the shirt so it curls around your ears. Each side will look like sausage rolls. Secure the ends at the base of your neck.Keep the towel on your hair for 20-30 minutes before removing.
Make sure to remove excess water and blot your hair before twisting it in the t-shirt.

, A microfiber brush is a brush that has microfiber bristles. These sponges soak up extra moisture in your hair. Keep running the brush through your hair to help remove water.

After just a week or so, you should notice a positive change in the texture of your hair.When you do shampoo, use only as much product as you need. A dime-or quarter sized amount is fine. Your hair shouldn't be dripping with soap.
If your roots start to look oily between washes, touch them up with dry shampoo. After a few weeks of washing less, it'll take longer and longer for your roots to need a touch-up. Realize that overuse of dry shampoo can dry out your hair and may damage it.

, You've probably heard that using a hair dryer wreaks havoc on hair, especially if it's already damaged. Put down the hair dryer and let your hair air dry naturally. Get down with your natural hair texture; if you learn to love it and leave it alone, it will start getting less frizzy and dry.


Avoid heat styling tools, too. Use curling and straightening irons very sparingly, if at all.
If you do feel the need to use a hair dryer, use the coolest setting that works for your hair, typically finer textures should use lower temperatures. When finished, set the style with the cool shot.

, Brushes with plastic bristles drag through your hair, violently pulling out the tangles and causing rips and breaks to occur. A wide-tooth comb is a better tool for gently detangling hair without causing damage. Start by working through the tips of your hair, then move up a few inches at a time until your hair is detangled from tips to roots., Dyeing, bleaching, perming and chemical straightening are anathema to healthy hair. There's no healthy way to permanently change your hair color or texture, so it's best to stop these practices altogether.


If you really want to dye your hair, try a subtle tea or henna dye to brighten or deepen your color.
It's fine to use methods for straightening and curling your hair without using heat.

, A good deep conditioner can restore your hair's vitality. It'll bring out the best in your hair's natural texture, whether it's smooth and silky or curly and bouncy. You can use a store-bought deep conditioner according to the manufacturer's instructions, or make your own deep conditioner treatment by doing the following:Dampen your hair.
Apply one to two tablespoons of coconut oil or olive oil. Comb it through your hair to distribute it evenly.
Put on a shower cap or cover your head in plastic wrap.
Let it sit for at least an hour or overnight.
Shampoo your hair as normal. It may take two or more washes to rinse out the excess oil.

, Hair masks are made from natural ingredients you probably have in your kitchen. They condition your hair and give it just the boost you're looking for. Apply a hair mask in the shower, after wetting your hair. Let it sit for five minutes before you shampoo it. Here are a few great masks to try:


For frizzy hair: use one whisked egg
For dry hair: use 2 tablespoons whole milk or yogurt
For imbalanced hair: use 2 tablespoons honey
For dull hair: use a mixture of 1 tablespoon white vinegar and 1 tablespoon water

, A finishing oil is similar to a leave-in conditioner, but it won't leave your hair weighed down or dull. To apply, rub a dime-sized amount between your palms. Use your fingers to distribute it evenly through your hair, focusing on the roots. Here are a few oils to choose from:


Coconut oil (use on very dry hair)
Argan oil
Jojoba oil
Almond oil
Olive oil

, This special type of brush is used to pull natural oils from the roots down to the tips of your hair. The oil acts as a wonderful conditioner. If your hair is damaged, it's the only type of brush that's safe to use. Boar bristles are natural fibers that closely resemble the texture of human hair. Here's how to use one:


Several hours (or the night before) you plan to shampoo, brush your hair from roots to tips. Press the brush against your scalp and pull down gently.
Brush each section of your hair several times to distribute the oils.
Shampoo your hair as normal.

, Typical ingredients in most commercial shampoo, conditioner and styling products are damaging to hair. When you're trying to restore your hair to good health, it's worth switching to all-natural products you know won't cause further damage. Check the labels of your products and avoid those with the following ingredients:Sulfates: Commonly found in shampoo; they strip your hair of natural oils.
Silicones: Commonly found in conditioner; they build up in your hair and make it look dull.
Alcohol: Commonly found in hairspray, gel and other products: it dries out your hair.

, Massaging the scalp improves blood circulation in the area, which promotes the growth of healthy new hair. Get in the habit of massaging your head every time you're in the shower. Using the tips of your fingers, massage your scalp in small circular motions, making sure to cover every spot.


For a nourishing massage, dip your fingers in almond, jojoba, olive or coconut oil before starting.
Tea tree oil is said to promote hair growth; try diluting five drops in one tablespoon of olive oil, then massage it into your scalp.

, The food you eat has a big impact on your hair. If you're not getting enough vitamins and nutrients, your hair will look unhealthy and dull or can become brittle. The best way to avoid a deficiency is to eat a varied diet that includes protein, fruits, grains, vegetables, and a healthy amount of fat. Also realize that broad malnutrition that affects your hair can be caused by crash diets, or eating disorders like anorexia and bulimia.Omega 3 fatty acids, found in salmon, sardines, flax seeds, and avocados
Protein, found in meat, fish, eggs, beans and tofu
Other foods to try include clams/oysters, peanuts, peppers, Greek yogurt, papaya and other fruits high in vitamin C like citrus.
If you suspect you have a vitamin or mineral deficiency that is causing problems with your hair, consider if your diet contains enough iron, zinc, biotin and vitamin B12 (B12 must be supplemented if you are vegetarian) and talk to a doctor about your concerns. , Dehydration is another common culprit when it comes to dry, damaged hair. Be sure you drink plenty of water during the day. When you feel thirsty, reach for pure water instead of coffee or soda, which can act as diuretics and dehydrate you.


Alcohol can dehydrate the body fast. When you have an alcoholic drink, follow with a large glass of water.
Try carrying a water bottle along during the day so you're never without water.

, Hair is easily damaged by the sun, extremely cold air, and air pollution. Wear hats designed to protect you from these environmental factors that can make your hair less healthy. You should also wear a swim cap if you go swimming in a pool, to protect your hair from chlorine. Also, many thermal protectants and products designed for color treated hair can protect from sun and have an SPF rating. These be used to help with damage even if you don't use heat or dye your hair.

, Getting regular trims will freshen your hair and let you start replacing damaged locks with healthy new ones. Aim to get a trim every 6-8 weeks, whether your hair is long or short. Even if you just get half an inch trimmed off, it'll freshen your look every time.


At the salon, you might want to tell your stylist that you're only using natural products.
Avoid having the stylist blow out or straighten your hair while you're trying to restore it to good health.

Washing your hair too soon after you color it can rinse some of the dye out so your hair color fades more quickly. For the best results, avoid washing your hair for at least 24 hours after you dye it.If you feel the need to clean your hair after dying it, just rinse it with cool water and scrub your scalp gently with your fingertips.;
, Shampooing your hair every day can not only strip away its natural oils but the color as well. Keep your color fresh by washing every other day, every third day, or even just once a week if your scalp isn’t naturally very oily.If your hair looks dirty, greasy, or limp between washes, use a dry shampoo designed specifically for color-treated hair to soak up excess oil at the roots and add volume.

, When you do wash your hair, it’s important to use the right product. Opt for a shampoo designed specifically for color-treated hair to avoid stripping the color. The formula should be sulfate-free and contain silicones, which help preserve the color by sealing the cuticle.








You may want to use a color-depositing shampoo for color treated hair. Not only does it work to prevent the dye from fading, it actually contains color that it leaves behind on the hair after you wash to freshen your color in between dye treatments., When you wash your hair, avoid applying the shampoo all over your locks. Instead, concentrate the product at your roots, where your hair is the oiliest, and build up a lather.








Once you’ve created a lather at your roots, you can work some of the suds down the length of your hair just before you rinse it out to make sure that it’s all clean.

, Hot water opens your cuticles and may allow color to wash out and cold water closes them. Conditioner, as the last step in the washing process, should be rinsed with cool water so that you can clean and condition your hair and then close the cuticle as fast as possible to minimize color loss.








Don’t rinse your shampoo out with cool water, because then you'll close the cuticle before you've gotten the chance to apply the conditioner, making conditioning your hair purposeless.

, While using cool water to rinse your hair can prolong your color, there may still be minerals in it that strip the dye from your hair. Consider adding a filter to your showerhead to remove minerals such as lime and iron so they don’t ruin your color.A shower filter can also remove chlorine, heavy metals, and soap buildup that may fade your color.
If you already have a filter attached to your sink, consider washing your hair in the sink instead.

, Just as you should use a shampoo for color-treated hair, it’s important to use a conditioner designed to preserve color. Chemical treatments such as coloring can dry out your hair, making it more porous and more likely for the color to leach out. A conditioner for color-treated hair seals the cuticle and helps deliver moisture.Make sure to condition your hair every time that you wash it to ensure that it is properly hydrated.

, For color-treated hair, a basic conditioner isn’t always enough. Using a deep conditioner once a week after you shampoo can help moisturize your hair so it stays soft and shiny. It will also help keep your hair color from fading.








It's best to use a deep conditioner for color-treated hair. They're designed to prevent your hair color from fading or becoming brassy.
Apply your deep conditioner from the roots down to the ends if you have thick or coarse hair.
Apply your deep conditioner from mid-strand down to the ends if your hair is fine, thin, or oily.
To receive the full benefits, allow the deep conditioner to sit on your hair for at least 10 minutes.
Sitting under a heated dryer or putting a shower cap over your hair while the mask is on can help generate heat that allows it to penetrate your hair more effectively.

, Even with regular use of conditioner for color-treated hair and a deep conditioner, your hair may get dry from time to time. Hair oils can help moisturize both dry and wet hair to help preserve the color. Jojoba oil is the best option because it most closely resembles natural hair oils.When applying, keep in mind that a little oil goes a long way.

To apply the oil to wet hair, squeeze a small amount onto your palm, rub it between both hands, and carefully smooth it over your hair from the ears down. Use your fingers or a comb to work it through all of your hair.
To apply the oil to dry hair, squeeze a pea-size amount onto the tips of your fingers and smooth it just over the ends of your hair.
You can substitute coconut oil, argan oil, marula oil, and avocado oil for the jojoba oil if you prefer.

, You may love the way your hair looks when you use your curling iron, flat iron, or blow dryer, but heated styling tools can damage color-treated hair by drying it out further. Try to limit your use of heated styling tools to once or twice a week to keep your color fresh.When you do heat style, always apply a heat protectant product first. It will coat your hair so the heat doesn’t dry out your hair too much.
Spray heat protectants are best for thin or fine hair, while a cream or lotion heat protectant works best for thick, coarse, or curly hair.
When using a heated styling tool, use the lowest heat setting possible to achieve your desired results.

, Just as the sun can damage your skin, it can be harmful to color-treated hair. The UV rays can actually fade your color, so if you’re going to spend time outside, use a protective SPF spray on your hair. Pay special attention to the crown of your hair, which usually receives the most sun.








If you’re going to be outside for a prolonged period, wear a wide-brimmed hat to cover your hair for extra protection.

, The chlorine in pool water and salt in ocean water can be very drying, which means color-treated hair can fade when you go swimming. To protect your hair, spray it with a leave-in conditioner before taking a dip. Not only will it moisturize your hair, it will also help prevent your hair from absorbing as much water.If you don’t have leave-in conditioner with you and want to go swimming, wet your hair with fresh water first. When your hair is already wet, it won’t absorb as much pool or ocean water.

, Between coloring treatments, using an at-home glaze treatment (also called gloss treatment) can help freshen the look of your hair. The glaze coats your hair to add extra shine and sometimes color that can help revive faded hair. The results typically last for 1 to 2 weeks, so you can use a glaze once or twice between coloring sessions.You can purchase hair glaze treatments at drugstores and beauty supply stores.
Most glazes are simply washed into your hair. Apply it after you’ve shampooed and conditioned your hair and allow it to sit for several minutes before rinsing it out.

, If your roots are becoming too obvious between coloring sessions, a touch-up kit can help. They’re like regular at-home color treatment, but contain a targeted brush that allow you to apply the color to precise sections of hair at the roots.If you’re unsure which root touch-up kit to purchase, ask your colorist to help you choose the right one.

, If you’re not ready to commit to permanent color with a root touch-up kit, hair mascara is an ideal solution. Like regular mascara, it’s a colored liquid that comes with a small brush so you can apply it directly at the roots. Best of all, it easily washes out with shampoo.Hair mascara tends to work best on darker hair colors.

Let the stylist know the specifics of your concerns--where you feel your hair looks thin, how you would like it to look, and what, if any, are you style limits.
It sounds obvious, but ask your stylist not to thin out your hair, as it will only make hair look thinner and flatter.;
, A hair cut designed to make your hair look fuller can go a long way towards helping you create the illusion of full-bodied hair.


Shorter hair styles lend themselves more to fuller hair. The longer hair gets, the heavier and flatter it becomes.
Cutting layers into your hair is a great strategy to make it appear thicker.
Don’t fall into the mullet trap. Mullets are friends to no one.
Ditch the part. Look for styles that allow you to comb hair back rather than parting it to one side--it will help hide thinness.

, Monotone hair color contributes to a flatter, thinner appearance, so to add thickness, choose a hair color that includes varying shades and dimension.


Choose a shade of hair color that will flatter your natural skin tone; otherwise, a harsh color may emphasize rather than minimize thin hair.Highlights and lowlights can also add dimension, and thus a fuller look, to your hair.Bleaching hair will also cause the strands to expand, making your hair appear thicker., If you have extra scratch to spend, you can invest in professional hair extensions. It seems to work for celebrities.


Remember, though, that you want volume, not length. If the extensions will only give you additional length, they won’t help disguise thinning hair., This is perhaps the most drastic option, but if you’re facing serious and progressive hair thinning, it may also be the best option.


Be sure to do your research before committing to either at-home or professional hair enhancement. For more information on surgical procedures, see the American Hair Loss Association’s website; for more on at-home medical interventions like Rogaine, go to The International Society of Hair Restoration Society’s site.

, Shampoos designed to thicken your hair’s appearance typically do so with ingredients that plump up your hair’s roots. Good Housekeeping has this ranked listing of available thickening shampoos.


Two-in-one shampoos tend to be ideal because they tend not to weigh hair down.Don’t wash your hair everyday. Washing everyday will strip your hair of natural oils that help it stay healthy and full., Conditioners that are “hydrating” or “smoothing” or otherwise intensive will weigh hair down.


Be sure to rinse all of the conditioner out of your hair after applying so that the residue won’t weigh hair down.

, A good blowdrying strategy can go a long way in enhancing your hair's fullness; the wrong technique, on the other hand, can exacerbate your problem.


If you blow dry your hair, begin by flipping your hair over and dry until most of the dampness is gone. Then flip your hair back over and blow dry the rest of your hair in sections using a round brush.
Using a diffuser can also help boost your hair’s volume., The aim of flat irons is to straighten and flatten hair strands, the opposite of the look you're trying to achieve. And because they use extreme heat applied directly to hair, they can damage hair, leaving it drier and brittle--again, the opposite of what you want if you have thin hair.If you absolutely must flat-iron, don’t iron ends straight down. Instead, turn them in ever so slightly for fuller hair., Look for volumizing or thickening hair products. Volumizing mousse, hairspray, and texturizers can help your hair look thicker and fuller.


Volumizing powder is relatively new to the scene and can help hair look fuller by fluffing it up at the roots.You can also find hair-loss concealers in many beauty supply stores.

, Before going to bed, apply volumizing mousse to your wet hair. By the morning you’ll have texturized hair that may appear fuller.If you have long hair, braid the damp, moussed hair before going to bed for textured waves in the morning.

, There are a number of rumored natural products that can help thicken hair, but the most consistently cited is aloe vera, which is believed to help seal in natural moisture and promote hair growth.To use aloe vera, apply an aloe vera gel (available at most drug stores) to your scalp, let it sit for 30 to 60 minutes, then shampoo as usual.

, Another of the most frequently recommended options, castor oil contains fatty acids, vitamin E, and ricinoleic acid, which are believed to nurture your hair and scalp.To use, apply several tablespoons of castor oil to your scalp and massage in. Be sure to choose an oil that is hexane-free.

, Apple cider vinegar is believed to both balance your scalp’s pH and provide it with beneficial nutrients.


As a bonus, because the vinegar will remove residue from your hair, it can also boost volume and soften hair.After washing your hair, pour about 1/2 cup of apple cider vinegar over your hair and then rinse.

, There are several vitamin supplements believed to help enhance hair growth. For more information, start with this list from WebMD.


Unfortunately, there isn’t yet a strong body of scientific evidence to support the effectiveness of vitamins for hair loss, so remember that it may not be realistic to expect a miracle solution.

Buy flax seeds.,
Boil 1/4 cup flax seeds and 1 cup water.,
Turn down the heat.,
Cook the liquid down.,
Strain gel.,
Add other ingredients.,
Store the gel.",How to Make Hair Gel1," Flax seeds produce a gel that works wonderfully on curly, coarse or frizzy hair.It adds shine and tames flyaways. Flax seeds are available at most grocery stores and health food stores. Make sure you get raw, unflavored flax seeds that have not been toasted or flavored with spices.;
, Place both items in a small saucepan and heat them on the stove over medium high heat until the water comes to a rolling boil.

, Once the water and seeds have come to a boil, turn down the heat until the water slows to a simmer. Stir the mixture with a wooden spoon and let it cook for 10 minutes. The seeds will start producing a gel.

, Continue cooking and stirring the liquid until the water has cooked down and reached the consistency of a gel. Keep cooking until it has the same consistency as aloe or a store-bought hair gel.


If your hair is extremely curly, you may find it easier to apply a looser gel. Take the gel off of the heat while it's still a little runny, so it will be easier to smooth through your hair.
If your hair is not curly, let the gel thicken as much as you want. It will provide a stiffer hold if you let it get thick.

, Pour the gel through cheesecloth into a bowl, or straight into the container you want to use to store it. If the gel is thick, you may have to squeeze it a bit to help it through the cloth. Continue straining until you've gotten as much of the gel through the cloth as you can, then throw away the cloth and the seeds.


Use a new pair of pantyhose if you don't have cheesecloth on hand.

, You can customize the gel to your preferences by adding a few drops of essential oil, aloe, or a moisturizing ingredient like liquid vitamin E. Stir the extra ingredients well so that they're distributed throughout the gel.

, Place the gel in a glass container with a lid and keep it in the refrigerator. It will keep for several weeks. Use on dry hair or smooth it through wet hair after a shower.

, Unflavored gelatin can be found in most grocery stores on the baking aisle. Resist the temptation to use flavored gelatin; the sugars and dyes in flavored gelatin aren't good for your hair.

, Drop 2 to 3 drops of essential oil into the jar to create a fragrant gel. Essential oils can be found in many health food, hobby and specialty stores. Don't add too much essential oil, since these substances are strong; a little goes a long way.


Essential oils are highly concentrated liquids that have been derived naturally from the stems, flowers and roots of plants. They contain the purest essence of plants and can benefit the condition of skin, hair and organs.
Essential oils that provide the most benefit to hair health are lavender, coconut, rosemary and tea tree oils. You do not have to limit your options to only these oils for this hair gel recipe. You can also choose an oil that has a fragrance that is pleasing you.

, Make sure the gelatin is completely dissolved and the oil gets distributed throughout the liquid.

, If you leave it uncovered it may get contaminated with food particles or other debris, or pick up the smells from the food in your refrigerator. Keep it fresh by covering it with a lid.

, Put the covered jar in the refrigerator and allow the gel set for 3 to 5 hours. Within that time it will begin to take on a solid form, like jello.


Your hair gel will be ready to use after it has set. Check the consistency before using. It should be similar to that of store-bought hair gel.
Use the same amount of this hair gel as you would any store-bought variety. The amount you need will vary according to the length and thickness of your hair.

, If you let it sit out of the refrigerator, it will turn back into liquid.

, Shampoo does remove oil from your hair. However, using shampoo every day strips your hair of natural oils, and if often produces extra oil to compensate. Try shampooing every other day and note the results after 1-2 weeks., Most hair products trap oil near your scalp, causing build-up that results in oily, greasy hair.

Excessive brushing, however, can cause your hair to produce more oil, so limit yourself to 1-2 daily.

, Hot showers, blow-dryers and excessive sunlight all tell your body to produce more oil to protect your hair. Whenever possible, take cold showers and use the cool setting on your blow-dryers to prevent your hair from building up new oils.

Then don a hat on top of that.If you don’t have a silk scarf, opt for a hat made of cotton instead of wool or acrylics, since cotton’s less conducive to static electricity., If you have long hair, refrain from wearing turtlenecks, which may help your hair knot up in back. Avoid the need to brush your hair more than you really have to. Because the cold air and low humidity of winter dries out your hair, over-brushing can damage your brittle hair, so preempt the need by ditching the turtleneck., When you’re washing your clothes, make sure you use this to reduce the chance of static electricity building up in your hair. Be sure to use it when washing hats as well any clothes that you’ll be pulling over your head.Definitely use it if those clothes are made of wool or acrylics."

Slick it back.",How to Look Good While Growing out a Short Haircut1," If you have strands of hair that are too short to pull up but too long to let hang, try pinning them back. Bobby pins will more often than not be your constant companion in the weeks and months it takes to grow out a short haircut. Here's a quick guide for those a little out of practice:


Make a deep part on one side of your forehead just above the center of one of your eyes. Then sweep that portion of hair to the side, using pins to hold it back. Then set with hairspray.
Grab the portion at the front of your hair that's starting to fall over your forehead. Twist the section once or twice, then pin flat at the top of your head. The slight twist will add a bit of volume to the front of the section.
Once the top of your hair is long enough to pull back, pin up the shorter sections underneath for a cleaner ponytail look.;
, These products can help tame your hair when it's prone to looking wild and unruly. Test out a few different products to find one you like - if you're on a budget, ask your friends what they use and whether you could try a bit. If what you're using makes your hair look stiffer than you'd like, try adding a bit of water to the product before applying it.For a matte look, go for the wax or the pomade. Use only about a pea-sized glob of the product and work it through your hair beginning where the hair meets your scalp. Style how you'd like.
For a glossy or wet look, reach for the gel. Again, use a small glob and work through your hair beginning at the base. If your style allows it, comb your hair to make sure there are no gel clumps left over.
Mousse will be helpful for those with curls or anyone looking for added volume. For curls, use a palm-sized amount and work it through the bottom 2/3 of your hair (so not near your scalp), then flip your head and do the same to the underside. For volume, have a glob of mousse in one hand and then use a comb to apply it to your hair, starting at the roots., If you've got the tools at hand, try curling your hair for some added bounce to your hair-do. Curling is a neat trick to shorten hair that's in an awkward period between not short enough and not long enough. Alternatively, if your hair is curly or wavy you can straighten your hair for added length to get the style you desire.

, Leave the sides and back hanging down with the front in a small bun. An easy fix for those looking to get the hair out of their face, or for those frightened of bangs. If your hair in the front isn’t quite long enough for a bun, don’t fret, a small mini-ponytail is perfectly acceptable as well., A simple fix for those who’d like to avoid complications as their hair grows out. A blunt cut will rid your hair of the layering which can become awkward as short hair grows out. A blunt cut is equally useful for those hoping to regrow their hair evenly, as it keeps all sides at roughly the same length.

, If one feature of your growing cut is a mess of runaway hairs, try reaching for the gel and slicking the whole mess back. Use a comb to avoid getting any clumps of gel left behind in your hair. Depending on how long your hair is, you can flare the length out to the side or keep it running straight down in line with your neck.

Play up your makeup.,
Strengthen your wardrobe.,
Accessorize your hair.,
Keep the color uniform.",How to Look Good While Growing out a Short Haircut2," Draw attention away from your hair by making your face look more arresting. Do a bold, smoky eye, or wear a bright lipstick. (Remember, though: choose either a bold lip or a bold eye - doing both is too much). Extra-girly makeup can help you feel feminine and attractive while your hair is transitioning.

, Undoubtedly you already own eye-catching and attractive clothing, so really try to “wow” with your clothing while your haircut remains in the awkward stage. When shopping look for bright colors and provocative patterns; nothing distracts from a poor hair-do like an outfit that works.


Non-hair accessories are desirable here as well. Necklaces and earrings especially (being so close to your head) are excellent style tools to draw the eye away from your hair.

, Now’s the time to replenish your stock of hairbands, attention-grabbing hair clips, or anything else you can think to adorn your hair with. Take this time to be creative with the idea; try putting flowers in your hair, or think about wearing a hat even though you’ve never thought of yourself as a “hat person.”, Having a mix of colors or high/lowlights will draw attention to the ways in which your growing cut appears awkward. Unfortunately different colors will highlight the ways in which your layers might be growing lopsided, or make those runaway strands more visible. Having your hair all one color serves to disguise these potential flaws."

Get regular trims.,
Avoid heat damage.,
Coordinate your growth.,
Be patient.",How to Look Good While Growing out a Short Haircut3," It might seem counter-intuitive to cut your hair while you're trying to grow it out, but it will help your hair look good while it grows. Visit your stylist every 6 to 8 weeks and ask him or her to trim only as much as you need to keep the ends healthy.

, If possible, lay off on blow-drying, straightening or curling your hair when you can. If you must style your hair this way, purchase a good heat protection agent (ask your stylist for suggested brands). Also do your best to rinse your hair with not-so-hot water (it doesn't have to be freezing), and try to brush/comb it as little as possible while still wet after a shower., The general wisdom is that you ought to grow out the front of your hair first while keeping the back short. Talk to your hair stylist about it for added input. With long hair in the front, there are usually many more styles to choose from. Unless you have your heart set on transitioning right back into shoulder- or arm-length hair, go for a trimmed back for access to more styles.


Consider extensions if you just can't stand to manage your growing hair any longer, have them added if you can afford it. More than a few celebrities have gone this route after having to trim down their hair for a role., Unfortunately, there's no way to make your hair grow out overnight. View your hair as a work in progress, and turn your attention to what you can do with it now instead of what you can't.

Avoid washing your hair every day.,
Turn down the temperature.,
Re-consider what shampoo and conditioner you should be using.,
Use shampoo.,
Rub conditioner on the ends of your hair.,
Try deep conditioning your hair.,
Wash your hairbrush regularly.,
Let your hair air dry.",How to Look After Your Hair1," Try to wash your hair every two to three days, rather than every day. When you over-wash your hair, the water and products you use can strip away the natural oils produced by your scalp; these oils help to keep your hair healthy. When these oil are stripped away, your hair can become brittle and may begin to over-produce oils, which could make your hair very greasy.


When you decrease how often you wash your hair, your hair will feel cleaner for longer after you do wash it.;
, Taking a very hot shower can cause heat damage to your hair, much like using a blow dryer can. To avoid this, try turning the heat down to a lukewarm temperature while you wash your hair.


In particular, use cooler water when rinsing out shampoo and conditioner, as heat can counteract the nourishment the conditioner has just given your hair. Cool water can also help to make your hair look shinier.

, Many drugstore products contain chemicals such as sulphates which actually cause more damage to your hair. Also make sure that your conditioner doesn't include silicon which can clog up the pores that produce natural oils and dry out your hair. Look for natural products that contain less harmful substances.


Finding out what products work best for your hair is generally a trial and error experience. If you feel like a certain product is making your hair look flat or dull, try a different product. Keep your hair type in mind when considering products (if you don’t know what your hair type is, see the last section of this article).
Ask your hairdresser for their recommendations for your hair type.

, Shampoo helps to get your hair clean and free of dirt and built up oils. To use shampoo properly, try applying a small amount of the product to the top of your head and scalp. Lather the shampoo and work it into your hair with your fingers. Try to avoid rubbing your hair harshly, as this could cause damage.


You can also try applying shampoo to your hair by putting some shampoo onto your fingertips. Use your fingers to comb the shampoo into your hair, rather than rubbing your head vigorously.
Purchase dandruff shampoo if you have dandruff.

, When applying conditioner, try to only apply it to the longest parts of your hair, rather than directly on to your scalp; if you put conditioner on your scalp, it can make your hair very greasy. Work the conditioner into your hair with your fingers, leave it on your hair for a few moments, and then rinse it out.


You do not necessarily need to use conditioner every time you wash your hair, particularly if you are prone to oily hair, but it can help to protect your hair against split ends.

, While you do not need to use conditioner every time you wash your hair, you may find that your hair becomes more healthy if you deep condition your hair once a week. To deep condition your hair:


Lather conditioner along the length of your hair. Let the conditioner soak into your hair for 10 to 15 minutes before you rinse it out. Once it has been rinsed out, use your shampoo and conditioner as you would during a regular shower. When washing the conditioner out for the second time, use your hands to smooth down your hair, rather than rubbing your hair to get the conditioner out. Blast your hair with very cold water once the conditioner has been washed out.

, Along with washing your hair regularly, you should also wash your brush regularly. When your hair is oily, that oil can get on to your hairbrush. When you brush your hair, that oil can then get spread through your hair.


Wash your brush with warm water and soap.

, Try to avoid towel drying your hair, or using a blow dryer. When you rub your hair with a towel, or wrap your hair up in a towel while it is still wet, the towel can actually rub against your hair and cause split ends.


Instead, use an old t-shirt or a pillowcase to dry your hair off. These fabrics are softer than towels and are less likely to do damage to your hair.

Give your stylist a second chance.,
Don't let yourself feel guilty.,
Trust your own judgment.,
Get a second opinion.,
Realize that you don't even have to tell them you are leaving.,
Be honest.",How to Leave Your Hairdresser," Be specific about what you want done at the beginning of the appointment. If you still don't like it, explain to your stylist what it is that you want and what she/he is not doing. If you want a certain look bring pictures from a magazine. Most hair stylists are cool about adjusting their work to meet customer specifications. If the stylist acts like a total prima donna about it, then she/he is making it all the more easy for you to leave.;
, It is, after all, your money and your hair. The beauty industry is about making the customer feel better about his/herself.

, You're the one who has to look at yourself in the mirror everyday. If the advice your hairdresser gives you doesn't work, don't let him/her change your mind.

, See what another hairdresser thinks of your hair. Some of them will consult with you.

, You could just start going to another salon and be polite to them if you ever see each other again in public.

, If you are friends with the person, let them know what you like about them, but that you think it's better to go with someone else.

Use dry conditioner to avoid washing your hair very often.,
Try using natural oil to moisturize your hair.,
Use natural powders to nourish your hair.,
Pick out the right brush for your type of hair.,
Do not brush your hair while it's wet.,
Cut back on how often you brush your hair.,
Use hair ties that won’t damage your hair.",How to Look After Your Hair2," When your hair begins to look greasy, but you don’t want to wash it yet, you can add some dry conditioner to help your hair look clean.

, If many store bought products leave your hair feeling greasy, some natural products may help to give your hair an added glow without the grease. Like with shampoos and conditions, finding out which oils work best for you will most likely be a process of trial and error. To use these natural oils, apply a half a tablespoon of the oil to your hair after you have washed your hair. The oil will dry but will help your hair to retain moisture. The most common oils used to moisturize hair include:


Coconut oil.
Almond oil.
Avocado oil.
Aloe vera.
Moroccan oil.

, There are some natural powders that you can also use to give your hair a boost. These natural powers help to soften and nourish your hair. To apply these powers, rub a small amount of the powder into your scalp and hair. Common powders include:


Mustard powder.
Ginger powder.
Whole wheat flour and ground clover mixed with a little bit of water.

, Consider your hair type when you are selecting your brush or comb. You should also consider the challenges you face with your hair.


Boar hair brushes work well on thick, long hair and help to achieve a smooth, shiny blown out look.
Nylon hair brushes work well on medium hair and help to detangle even the wildest of manes.
Plastic brushes are all-purpose brushes that work on every type of hair, but particularly work well for very thick hair.
Small-toothed combs work well for short, thin hair.
Wide-toothed combed work well for short, thick hair.

, Wait until your hair has nearly dried before using a brush or comb to detangle knots. Hair is at it's weakest when wet, and therefore is more susceptible to damage.


Some people with curly hair maintain that they don’t wash their hair at all. If you have curly hair that gets frizzy, consider brushing your hair less often.

, Brushing your hair multiple times a day can actually make your hair look greasier. Instead, try to brush your hair once in the morning and once at night.


Try combing your hair with your fingers if it gets very tangled.

, Hair ties can break hair and cause split ends. If you put your hair up a lot, try to find hair ties that do not break hair or cause knots. You should also wear your hair in loose ponytails, rather than wrapping your hair up very tightly, as doing this can cause more damage.

Avoid heated tools if your hair is damaged.,
Use a round hairbrush.,

Use different hair bands to style your hair without actually styling it.",How to Look After Your Hair3," While your should try to avoid using heating tools as much as possible, you should purchase quality tools for the days where you want to straighten, curl, or blow dry your hair. Cheaper models often cause more damage to your hair because they are made with less high-quality parts.

, Before you use your heating tool, including blow dryers, straighteners and curlers, apply some heat protectant to your hair to lessen the amount of damage. Wait until your hair is roughly 50% dry, and then spray the heat protection on to your hair. You can then comb the protectant through your hair gently, either using your fingers or a wide-toothed comb.


Dry your hair on medium or low-heat for an added amount of protection.
Don't use silicone based products before using heating tools. They can fuse to your hair and suck the moisture out of it. Wait until you've finished styling, and then you may apply things such as frizz serums.

, These nozzles keep the heat trained on one part of your hair, which can increase the amount of damage that is done. Instead, simply point the hairdryer downwards to achieve the same effect as a nozzle.

, If you have damaged hair, swear off heated tools entirely until your hair is healthy again. These tools can cause serious damage to already dry or broken hair.


Instead, use the following steps to straighten or curl your hair without a straightener or curler.

, Round boars hair brushes work well when trying to smooth and straighten out your hair without a straightener. These large round brushes can help to make your hair look sleek.


On the other hand, using a small, straight boars hairbrush may give your hair more of a curl if you use the brush to flip up the ends of your hair.

, When your hair is still a little damp, twist it up into a bun and secure it with bobby pins (if necessary). Leave your bun up for an hour or so and then take it down. Once you have taken the bun out, your hair should look naturally wavy or curly.


You can also braid your hair to give it a natural curl. Braid your hair when it is very slightly damp before you go to bed. In the morning, take the braid out and your hair should look naturally wavy.

, To avoid using curlers and straighteners, you can use different hair accessories to make your hair look stylish. Try things like:


Ribbons.
Bobbles.
Hair bands that go across your head.
Clip-in flowers.

You should also try to avoid pulling or picking at split ends, as doing this will only make the situation worse.

, If you are prone to split ends, get your hair trimmed often to keep it looking healthy. Try to get your hair cut every three months, and consider getting it trimmed every six weeks.


If you have severely damaged hair, consider getting a very thorough cut. This means that all of the dead hair should be cut away, which may leave you with a short hair cut.

, Try to avoid dying your hair too often, as dye can really dry out and damage your hair. Hair dye contains main harsh chemicals that can leave your hair dry and broken.


If you want to continue to dye your hair, wait until your roots grow out a bit before dying your hair again.

, By choosing the correct foods, you can increase hair growth and repair and prevent hair loss. If you do not get enough nutrients each day, your hair will most likely become thin.


Make sure you are eating enough protein. Hair is made of protein, so eating plenty of meat and eggs etc will give your body what it needs to grow and repair your hair.
Look for foods containing Omega 3 fatty acids and other essential fatty acids. This includes oily fish, (eg. salmon, tuna and mackerel), and almonds.
Vitamins B6 and B12 do plenty of good for your hair.

, Healthy hair needs to be hydrated, so make sure you drink plenty of water to give it the hydration it needs. This will also help to hydrate your skin and nails, as well as making you feel healthier.

, Pollution, smoke and smoking all dry out your hair. To stop your hair from getting damaged by these things:


Don't stand around with people who are smoking.
Limit the amount that you smoke.
Don't let people smoke in your home.
Avoid heavily polluted areas.

, If you are often out in the hot sun, then protect your hair by wearing a hat or bandanna; doing this can also help to protect your skin from getting burnt.


If you don’t like wearing hats, apply products that can protect your hair from the sun, such as protective leave-in conditioner, or watered down sunscreen.
Try to avoid using products that contain alcohol if you are going to be out in the sun, as these can damage your hair even more.

, When you go swimming, protect your hair from harsh chemicals such as chlorine. Use a spray leave-in conditioner before going swimming to minimize the amount of chlorine that your hair can absorb. For maximum protection from the chlorine you can either avoid getting your hair wet, or wear a swimming cap.


If your hair gets damaged by chlorine, try mixing a small amount of vinegar into your shampoo to help restore your hair’s natural strength, or you can add about 1 teaspoon of olive oil into your leave in conditioner (if you have one) since olive oil helps strengthen hair.

When you are finished in the shower, the last thing you should do is rinse your hair with cold water. Hot water is damaging to your hair and creates dryness and frizz. ;
, Comb your hair with a wide tooth comb when it is wet. Don’t brush your hair when it is dry because it will only increase breakage and straw texture. Dry your hair by wrapping it in a T-shirt, instead of a towel.

Before you go outside in the sun wear a hat or get a SPF spray that is for hair. As much as you might love your hot tools they are only damaging your hair more. Give yourself a break from the hot tools and let your air dry naturally or put it in a braid or bun.
If you absolutely must use hot tools only use them occasionally. The most important thing is to not leave the hot tool on one spot of hair for too long, keep it moving. Try not to dye your hair while you are fixing the texture because it could damage your hair further. "

3 (curly): Hair is curly with an S shape and holds a definite curl pattern even when unstyled.4 (coily): Hair is tightly coiled or kinky, often with a definite Z pattern.It can be stretched out and will return to its curled shape when released.

2A: Hair is wavy, resembling the letter S, and is coarse.

2B: Hair is often frizzy with a definite wave.

2C: Hair is very frizzy with thick waves, and is the coarsest of this category.

3A: Curls are about the same diameter as sidewalk chalk, or pretty loose curls.

3B: Curls are about the same diameter as a sharpie, or medium-sized curls.

3C: Curls are about the same diameter as a pencil, or corkscrew curls.

4A: Curls are very tight, about the same diameter as a needle.

4B: Curls resemble a zigzag pattern, looking like the letter Z.

4C: There might not be a curl pattern to this hair type.

, The LOIS system compares a strand of your hair to the letters L, O, I and S.Take a single strand and hold it up with one hand. Compare your hair to the shapes of the letters L, O, I and S.



L: Your strand looks like the letter L, with right angles, bends and folds.

O: Your strand resembles the letter O or spirals into several Os.

I: Your strand is straight with little to no curves or waves, resembling the letter I.

S: Your strand is wavy and curves back and forth like the letter S.

Combination: Your strand might have a combination of two or more of these letters. If this is the case, check a few more strands of hair from all over your head to see if one of the letters is more dominant.

Make sure your ends match up.,
Trim your layers (optional).,
Double-check your hair when it's dry.",How to Cut Your Own Hair1," The first step in cutting your hair at home is to invest in the right tools. You will need a sharp pair of hair cutting scissors (not just any old scissors you have lying around at home) and a fine-toothed comb.


Hair cutting scissors are easily available at beauty supply stores - you can find them pretty cheaply, somewhere in the $25 to $50 range. If you don't want to buy a hair cutting scissors, a fabric scissors will do - just make sure it's really sharp.
Using dull scissors is a bad idea as you will find it harder to cut your hair and may end up giving yourself split ends - which defeats the purpose of giving yourself a haircut in the first place!;
, Wet hair is much easier to cut than dry hair, so make sure to shampoo and condition your hair before you start snipping.


Fully comb out your hair once you get out of the shower - your hair needs be as sleek and tangle free as possible.Use a leave-in conditioner if your hair tends to be frizzy or fly-away.
If your hair is quite long or thick, there's a good chance that sections of your hair might start to dry before you get around to cutting them. To tackle this, fill a spray bottle with water and a little conditioner. Then you can dampen your hair whenever you need to!

, Depending on how thick your hair is, expect to work in several sections as you cut, starting with the bottom-most layer and working up.


Use elastic hair ties or crocodile clips to divide hair into sections. Just make sure the sectioned hair isn't left to hang loose - otherwise it could get in the way of your scissors.
Once you've finished with the bottom layer of hair, you can start releasing the other sections as you go.

, If you just want to give your hair a small trim to get rid of your damaged ends, you will first need to inspect your hair to find out how much hair will need to be cut.


Take a look at the ends of your hair. If they seem scraggly or unruly, or you can see the split hairs, they're probably damaged and need to be cut.
Expect to trim about 0.25 inch (6 mm) above where the damage stops. This will keep your hair in good condition.

, For an accurate cut, grab a section of hair between the index and middle fingers of your non-dominant hand.


Drag your fingers down your hair, until you reach a point slightly above where you want to cut your hair. Make sure the hair isn't knotted or twisted between your fingers - it must lie perfectly flat.
Your hair will look shorter when it's dry, so be conservative when you're measuring how much to cut. This is particularly important for people with curly hair.
Remember - you can always go back and cut it shorter afterwards, but you can't undo it if you cut too much off on the first go.

, When you're ready to start cutting, hold the scissors just below your fingers, in a parallel fashion. Try to keep a reasonable tension on the hair between your fingers.


Trim slowly, letting the cut hair fall away as your fingers (and the strand they're holding) remain stable and in the same position.
If you want a blunt end to your hair, just cut straight across and leave it at that. But if you want a softer finish, hold the scissors vertically (perpendicular to your fingers) and cut directly into the hair, until no sharp angles remain. This will give the ends of your hair a more feathery look., After you've finished trimming one layer of your hair, make sure the ends match up. Grab a section on each side of your face with your hands, using your thumbs and forefingers.


Pull your fingers down the hair at exactly the same pace. Whichever hand runs out of hair first was holding a shorter strand.
Trim accordingly to match up. Re-check the length until you're satisfied, then move on to the next layer of hair.

, Working with layers, especially if you have very thick or curly hair, is best left to the professionals. However, If you absolutely need a quick trim on the layers framing your face, use the following technique:


Grab as much of the ends of each layer of hair between your fingers as possible, then trim as little hair as possible, holding the scissors at a slightly downward angle.
In other words, trim your hair following the angle from your jaw on that side of your face to the shoulder on the same side.
Use the softening technique described above to even out the ends of the hair, then match the layers on each side of your face to make sure they're the same length.

, After your hair has dried (in the way that you usually do it, whether that's air-drying or blow drying), check your cut for any glaring inconsistencies.


Use a handheld mirror to check the hair at the back of your head or, better yet, ask a trusted friend to check it for you.
If you find any unevenness, take your scissors one more time and, very carefully, attempt to even it out, cutting as little hair as possible."

Gather materials.,
Start with wet hair.,
Start with the top of your head.,
Cut the back and sides.,
Use scissors to blend the two hair lengths.",How to Cut Your Own Hair2," Most extra-short haircuts are achieved with an electric razor and a pair of scissors. Make sure you have the guard you want for the razor (which will determine how much of your hair it cuts off) and sharp scissors.

, You can wash it, or simply dampen it with a spray bottle before you start. Wet hair is easier to cut, and makes cleanup a breeze.

, For a traditional men's cut, the hair on the top of your head should be slightly longer than it is on the sides and back.


Start an inch or two (2.5-5 cm) above your ear, and follow that line around the back of your head the other ear, moving the razor in a straight-up motion as you cut.
Then, starting at your forehead, trim the top of your hair by moving the razor back over the natural curve of your head.
Catch any spots you missed between these two areas.

, Put the shorter guard on your razor. Start with your sideburns, moving the razor in an upwards motion. Cut just as far as the point where you started using the longer guard.


On the back of your head, start the razor at your neck and move upward, again stopping where you cut with the longer guard.
Don't worry about the difference in length for now - that's where the scissors come in.

, Using the index and middle fingers of your non-dominant hand, grab a section of longer hair that's just above where you switched guards.


With the scissors, carefully trim the hair until the two different lengths blend into each other.
Do this all the way around your head until the two sections look well-blended and the there is no obvious difference between the two lengths.
Have a friend double-check the back of your head, or use a hand mirror in front of a larger mirror to check it yourself.
If the ""long"" part of your hair on top is shorter than finger-width, then skip using your index and middle fingers to pull out sections.

, Make a conservative estimate of where you want your bangs to fall. Remember, you can always trim more, but growing back the hair that you didn't mean to cut takes a lot longer.

, Secure non-fringe hair so that it's away from your face and out of the danger zone. If necessary, use a comb to part your bangs away from the rest of your hair.

, Splash a bit of water on the hair, or use a spray bottle. They'll cut more easily wet, and you can do a touch-up once they dry.

, Grab a section of hair between the index and middle fingers of your non-dominant hand. Drag your fingers down so that they're resting just above where you want to make a cut.

, Put your scissors close to your fingers (so that they're almost parallel) and cut slowly. Your fingers (and the hair they're holding) should remain stable as the trimmed hair falls away.

, If you want your bangs to be the same length all the way across, make sure they match up.


On each side, grab a strand between the thumb and forefinger of each hand. Pull your fingers down slowly and at the same pace.
If one hand runs out of hair before the other, you need to trim a bit to match up the sides.
Do this until you're satisfied that the lengths are even.

, If you want your bangs to sweep to the side, comb them in the direction that you want them to go.


Tip your head forward slightly, so that your bangs fall away from your face. Put your scissors in the direction you want your bangs to run.
Starting near the part, position the scissors where you want the shortest part of your bangs. For side swept bangs, they'll get a bit longer as you go on. Because of this, angle your scissors slightly downward.
Make short, small cuts across your bangs. The lengths should be a bit choppy, but not overly so. Aim to cut sections that are about 0.5 inch (12 mm) wide.
When your bangs dry, touch them up. Ruffle the hair a bit, and see if you're happy with where it falls. Make more trims if necessary.

Prepare your hair for cutting.",How to Cut Your Own Long Hair1," You should be able to find these in your local drugstore or beauty supply store. They will range in price from $10 to $15 (USD).

, Knowing what sort of haircut you want before you get started will keep you focused and less likely to make mistakes.


To decide on a style, browse celebrity pictures online; flip through hairstyle magazines (available in magazine racks at most drugstores and bookshops); play with your hair in the mirror to see what it looks like at different lengths; print out photos of yourself and sketch different hairstyles on to your face.
There are some phone apps and websites that will let you try on different hairstyles over a photograph of yourself.
It’s important not to be rash with your decision. If you decide that you want to go from very long to very short hair, give yourself at least a few days to think about it before you decide to do it. You may find that you’re just feeling unhappy, and once that passes, you might miss your long hair.
If you're planning on making a significant change to your hairstyle, you might want to consult a professional to make sure that it goes exactly right. You can always trim your hair at home.

, Many professionals recommend cutting your hair wet, as it is easier to manage and control.Some professionals also recommend cutting hair dry, as it allows you to see the effects of the cut right away and adjust for any quirks such as cowlicks or curls.If you cut your hair while it’s wet, cut it at least a few inches longer than you want it, as it will shrink up and look shorter once it is dry. (Some people have reported that their hair shrinks up to 4 inches from wet to dry.)
Dry cuts are more likely to produce uneven hair.Cutting hair dry requires very sharp sheers. Cutting dry hair will dull the blade edge very quickly, which pushes ends instead of cutting them, leading to uneven lines.
Most professionals cut the hair while it is wet and refine it once the hair is dry. Doing this will let you produce better looking results while giving you a chance to fix minor errors.

, If you’re cutting your hair wet, shampoo and condition it, remove excess water by wrapping your hair in a towel and squeezing it, then comb your damp hair straight. If you want to dry cut your hair, wash and dry it, part it where you would normally part it, then get it as close as possible to how you would normally wear it.

, Do this while holding your head in a neutral position — not tilted to one side or the other, or too far back or forward.








, Divide your hair into the following sections: bangs, top-front (left and right), top-back (left and right), sides (left and right), and one section at the nape of your neck. Twirl each section around your finger before clipping it up and out of the way. Leave the section at the nape of your neck out; this is the one you will start with, as cutting your hair from back to front is easier than front to back.









If you have thick hair, you may need to further divide these sections, particularly at the top-front and top-back of your head, and the nape of your neck.

, You’ll need to hold the scissors differently depending on what type of haircut you want.


If you want a blunt (straight across) cut, you’ll need to hold your scissors horizontally as you cut straight across your hair.
If you want a softer, more natural and layered look, you’ll need to turn your scissors at a 45-degree angle and cut upward into your hair, making small diagonal cuts.
For a more wispy edge (like for bangs), first cut your hair to the desired length, then, making an almost vertical angle with your scissors, cut upward in one quick motion into your hair. Only do a few of these per section of hair, otherwise it will look too wispy and sparse.

, Bring the hair in front of your shoulders. Comb the section out. Take firm hold of it between your pointer and middle fingers (as if those two fingers are a pair of scissors cutting your strand of hair), and comb through the section again. Pulling the hair taut, slide your fingers down the section until they are just above where you want to cut, then use your scissors to cut just beneath your fingers.

, Once you are happy with the section at the nape of your neck, let down the top-back right section of your hair and cut that. Then let down the top-back left section of your hair and cut it so that it’s even with the top-back right and nape sections.









Work from back to front, section to section, until all of your hair is even.
Don’t forget to comb out each section before you cut it.
If your sections begin to dry out before you get to them, give them a quick spritz of water before combing them out and cutting.

, Once you’ve finished cutting all of your hair evenly to one length, you can add layers. For a more natural look, you might choose to cut small sections of hair at random.









When creating layers on longer hair, it is important to create varying mid-length layers for a professional, graduated look.

, Shampoo, condition, and rinse your hair. Then dry it with a towel or a blow-dryer — whichever you prefer.

, Once your hair is clean and dry, have another look at it to make sure everything is even and that any layers you’ve introduced are well-blended.









You might find more uneven bits as time goes on. Don’t get upset — just fix them as you find them.

, Going too light – especially bleaching – can wash your complexion out and make you look tired and pale. Bleaching can also over-process your hair, which is damaging and causes your strands to become dry and brittle. Avoid bleaching and dyeing your hair all-over blonde.

Instead, ask your stylist to create a darker base and then add golden highlights throughout.
Avoid ashy and platinum cool tones. Opt for warm-colored highlights.

, This is true for your bangs and the rest of your hair, too. You can appear more youthful if you create a loose style with tousled waves. Don’t do anything that makes your hair look stiff or sculpted. Too-perfect hairstyles can age you, as well.

Rumple your style up a little to loosen it and soften your appearance.
Tease your hair lightly at the crown to get it a bit of volume and movement.

, They can also damage your hair, and that breakage can lead to thinning hair and a receding hairline. If you want to wear one of these styles, make sure to keep it loose and natural-looking. Pull a few face-framing wisps out of the style to soften it further.

Avoid exaggerated styles and creating extreme volume, which unfortunately can make you look older.
Keep it natural-looking by going easy on the hairspray and teasing."

Some hairstyles and hair lengths look better on certain face shapes. Choosing a haircut based on your face shape can help you avoid drawing attention to the wrong aspects of your face. A haircut that complements your face shape minimizes your negative attributes while emphasizing your beauty., Oval faces are about one and a half times longer than they are wide, and the forehead and the jaw are the same width. Oval shaped faces can wear just about any hairstyle.If you have an oval face, try a collarbone length bob with side swept bangs.
A bang can add some extra style to an oval face. A sweeping side bang or a blunt bang both work well with this shape.Go for longer hair with beach waves and a center part.

, A round face is circular with the widest point at the cheeks and ears, though the length and width are almost the same.Diagonal lines and asymmetry will flatter round faces the most. Avoid going too short or too long.


For longer styles, try hair that hits your collarbone or shoulders. This helps slim the face.Or try longer hair below the shoulder with long layers.The long layers help keep volume away from your face and help weigh down curls so they're not bunching at your face.
Women with round faces should avoid chin-length hair as it only amplifies the roundness. If you have your heart set on a bob, try wearing the bob in a messy style or have the layers in the front longer and then let it get shorter as you go towards the nape.Alternatively, you might consider an a-line bob with a side part that falls below the chin.
Avoid blunt, straight cut bangs. Instead, go for wispy, side swept bangs instead or bangs with a diagonal cut., Square faces have strong jawlines and equally strong hairlines. Short or medium-length hair go well with square faces, especially with waves or roundness around the face. Long straight tresses can also draw attention away from a square face. Wispy side-bangs will soften the shape.


Shag styles and light feathery layers around the shoulders help soften the squareness.Side parts are often best for square faces as they help soften your face. Center parts, in comparison, tend to emphasize the geometry of your face.
Avoid heavy, straight bangs with a square face.

, A heart shaped face is wide at the temples and narrows to a very delicate chin. Chin-length or longer styles add width to the jaw-line. Uniform layers and curls below the ears help balance out the thin chin. Styles that emphasize the upper-face should be avoided.


Sweeping or heavy bangs also look great with heart shaped faces.Try deep side parts to emphasize your eyes.If you want a pixie cut, go for choppy layers to balance the narrow chin while downplaying the wide forehead.

, Your face shape isn't the only factor that can influence your hair. Your body type also can determine how you cut your hair and what length looks good on you.


For slim, straight bodies, go for medium to long hair with bangs and layers. Pixie cuts may also look great. Avoid hair that's too straight. Volume helps downplay the slimness.
For curvy, full figured bodies, avoid short hair as this can make you look heavier. Also avoid overly long hair since that also can make you look heavy. Go for medium-length hair. Adding volume to your hair can also help.For petite bodies, go for proportions. Short crops can help flatter your shape, but avoid cuts that are too long.
For tall, athletic bodies, anything works on your frame. Experiment with hairstyles to find the right one for you., When choosing a hairstyle, think about your eyes, nose, mouth, chin, and brows as well. Try to find a style that will help flatter your features.

If you have a prominent nose, for example, you may want to choose bangs, simple lines, and/or a short, blunt cut.
If you want to make a small mouth look larger, choose a short blunt style such as an angled bob.
If you have a high forehead, consider using bangs to conceal part of it. If your forehead is small, choose a style that will bring hair away from your face., Is your hair naturally curly or straight? Is it thick or thin? The texture of your hair influences the way you wear and style it. If you have curly hair, make sure you want a curly short style, otherwise you may end up spending too much time trying to straighten it. Curly hair also shrinks as it dries, so you may need to cut it longer for a short style.If you have thick hair, make sure your stylist layers it enough so that you don't end up with triangular mushroom hair. Thick, frizzy hair may also not look good when it's short because it can be prone to even more frizz. It may require more care to keep it looking good if you cut it short.

, Some hairstyles require more maintenance than others. Some short styles require you to wash and style it with styling tools every day. If your hair is curly but you want to wear it short and straight, you have to factor in that extra hair styling time into your morning ritual. Decide if you have the time or interest in maintaining a short style.


Short hair eliminates the option to throw your hair into a braid, a ponytail, or a bun on a bad day. Decide if you are ready to give up that bad hair day or lazy day option.Shorter styles also require more trips to the stylist to maintain. You might have to see them every 6 weeks to shape up your hair., Long hair pulls more on curls, making them more relaxed. With shorter hair, your curls will be tighter. If you curl your hair and have a specific curl in mind, think about the kinds of curls you want before you cut. Keep in mind that heat styling tools, such as curling irons and straighteners, are more difficult to use on short styles.

, Your hair requires different styling tools depending on the length. Shorter hair needs thinner curling iron barrels and smaller straighteners than longer hair., As you decide whether you would like to cut your hair or not, think about going slowly. Cut a few inches off and see how you like it. If you are hesitant, avoid drastic haircuts to begin with. Adding layers or bangs can change your look dramatically while maintaining the length of your hair. You can always cut more hair off if you find that you like your shorter tresses.


If you make a drastic haircut and hate it, remember that it will grow back. It just won't be overnight. If you're still contemplating, keep this in mind. Even if you do make a mistake, your hair will eventually grow back out. Just make sure you are prepared to deal with a bad, short style while it grows out.

, Honestly determine why you are interested in cutting your hair. The reason for your style change should be to look attractive and to feel good about yourself.


If time and convenience rest in your mind, put them aside for the time being. During the summer, many women think that shorter hair means cooler and less hassle. While short hair can be cooler, maintenance on short hair can be more labor intensive than long hair.
If you've seen other girls look good with medium-length or short hair, what makes you think it'd suit you? Have you had it in the past, but believe you could make it look better on you now? Have you had a short haircut before that you hated?If you didn't like short hair on yourself before, you probably won't like it now either.

, Your appearance tells people a lot about your personality. Do you want long soft, romantic curls? A cute, chic bob? A fun, perky pixie cut? Decide what cut would match your personality, lifestyle, and wardrobe choices. For dramatic cuts, like pixies or a shaved head, think about attitude. If you can confidently rock a shaved head or mohawk, go for it.Keep in mind your job. Do you have a job that will care if you go with something drastic, like a shaved head or mohawk? Embrace your individuality and personality regardless of your age and career, but keep in mind certain workplaces have stricter rules for employee appearance than others.

, Some people believe that dramatically changing their hair after life changing events, like a breakup, a death, or sickness, can liberate them. While this is true, many hair mistakes have been made because of emotional haircuts. Cutting your hair is a huge change, so make sure you are deciding to cut your hair for the right reasons.

, Major hair changes need to be thought out completely, not decided on a whim. Make the right hair decision for yourself, not because you saw a celebrity with a cute hairstyle, because all your friends are doing it, or because you're having a bad hair day.

, Your stylist is your hair's best friend. They can help you decide on the right style for your face shape and features. They also can tell if you are emotionally and mentally ready for a haircut. If you are not quite ready to chop it all off, they can help you find an alternate hairstyle that will give you the change you are craving without leaving you with a short hairstyle you will hate.

Get a good haircut.,
Handle your hair gently.,
Wash your hair only as often as needed.,
Don't use heat styling tools on your hair.,
Don't play with your hair.,
Treat your hair.,
Wear protective hairstyles.,
Cover your hair at night.",How to Grow Your Hair1," Before you can begin to grow your hair, it needs to be in tip-top condition. It may sound counter-intuitive, but in order to grow your hair the best thing you can do is cut it. A good trim of about a 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) to an inch will get rid of any dry or split ends and prepare your hair for maximum growth.


Sometimes people have trouble growing their hair, not because it doesn't grow fast enough, but because their hair is dry and damaged, breaking off at the bottom before it gets the chance to reach a certain length.
When this happens, the only solution is to cut off the dry, damaged ends and start afresh. And this time round, you can take care of hair a little better.;
, If you are rough with your hair, you will cause damage and breakage which will appear to slow down the growth of your hair. It is important to be gentle when you brush and style your hair as this alone can do a huge amount to reduce breakage.


Wet hair is more susceptible to damage than dry hair, it is more elastic and more likely to break. Since hair is most fragile when it's wet, you shouldn't rip a brush through it after washing.
To detangle wet hair, you should spray some detangling mist on it, and then use a wide-tooth comb to remove tangles and minimize breakage. Always brush from the ends up, not from the roots down.
Avoid roughly towel drying your hair, as this causes breakage. Instead, try blotting your hair gently with an absorbent towel to remove excess moisture.

, While it is important to keep your hair clean, washing your hair too often can dry it out or weigh it down with product. Most people do not need to wash their hair every day, three to four times a week is usually enough.


The longer, thicker, curlier, and more processed your hair, the longer it can go between washes. If your hair gets oily very quickly and you must wash everyday, use a lightweight or ""everyday"" shampoo, as these contain milder detergents than others.
Use moisturizing shampoos and conditions every time you wash. Avoid using shampoos containing silicones however, as these dry out the hair and cause it to break down faster.

, It's time you knew the truth: styling tools are the enemy of long hair. The intense heat from blow dryers and straighteners will cause irreparable damage, causing the hair to split and break. So put the styling tools away (or ask someone to hide them on you) and let your hair's natural beauty shine.


If you must use styling tools, it is crucial that you apply a heat protection product first, in order to lock in moisture and minimize burning and breakage. Heat protection products come in many forms, including sprays, serums, mousses and creams.
When using a hair dryer, avoid holding the nozzle too close to your hair as this will cause your hair to burn, or turn the air to a cooler setting, if possible. Consider investing in an ionic hair dryer which emits charged particles that can cut drying time in half, thus minimizing heat exposure.

, Style your hair in the morning, then leave it alone for the rest of the day. No twirling, twisting, pulling, combing with your fingers or - God forbid - chewing. Constantly fussing with your hair will only make it dry and cause more breakage and split ends.


If it helps, think of your hair as a piece of fine lace. If you handle it too much, it will wear out and become grubby looking. Like fine lace, your hair needs to be handled gently and carefully at all times, especially when brushing, detangling or styling.

, Caring for your hair on a day-to-day basis is great, but in order to really maximize growth potential you should also treat your hair from time to time. You can fork out for a deep-conditioning treatment at your hairdresser's once every couple of months, or you can buy or make conditioning hair masks to use as home. Protein masks are particularly good for keeping hair strong and healthy. Some home recipes for healthy hair masks are outlined below.



For all hair types: avocado and honey: Cut and scoop out the flesh from a ripened avocado and mix in a tablespoon of organic honey. Apply to hair and allow it to sit for 20 minutes before rinsing it off in the shower.For dry hair: olive oil and egg: Combine three tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil with two eggs and apply the mixture to your hair and let the mixture sit for 20 minutes before rinsing in the shower.For oily hair: apple cider vinegar and lemon: Combine 1/4 cup of apple cider vinegar with the grated peel of an entire lemon and allow it to set for 15 minutes to absorb the excess oil from your scalp, and then rinse in the shower.For flaky scalp: banana, honey and almond: Mash together 1/2 a ripe banana and add two tablespoons of honey and a few drops of almond oil and allow it to set with a shower cap on for 20 minutes before rinsing., Wearing protective hairstyles is another way that you can avoid damaging your hair. Protective hairstyles include French twists, buns or any kind of updo where your hair ends are not exposed to the air. By tucking away the ends of your hair, you are minimizing your hair's exposure to the elements and removing the temptation to play with it.


If you're serious about growing your hair, you should wear these kinds of hairstyles everyday, or as often as possible.
Don't tie your hair too tightly however, as this pulls hair and causes breakage. And avoid using hair ties with metal bands as these can catch in the hair, causing more damage.
You should also protect your hair from harsh UV rays by wearing a hat or head scarf whenever you spend prolonged periods in the sun.

, Wear a protective satin or silk scarf to cover your hair when you go to bed at night. If you don't use either of those, then try sleeping on a satin or silk pillowcase. These will keep your hair from getting tangled and from drying out.


Don't wear your hair in a tight ponytail while sleeping. Instead, try putting your hair in a low, loose plait which will protect your hair and keep it from getting tangled. As an added bonus, your hair will be beautifully wavy when you undo it in the morning.

Massage your scalp.,
Cut back on caffeine, alcohol and smoking.,
Minimize stress.,
Consider hair extensions.,
Have realistic expectations.,
Make sure your slow hair growth is not caused by medical conditions or medications.",How to Grow Your Hair2," Gently massaging your head stimulates blood flow to the scalp, encouraging hair to grow faster. You can do this while shampooing your hair in the shower, or on dry hair before going to bed at night. Brushing your hair and scalp with a firm-bristled brush can also provide the same effect.


To perform the massage, start making small circles with your fingertips, working from your hairline along the arteries in the front, side, and back of the head. Do not press with your fingernails. Work your way towards the top the head, as if drawing a circle.
Aim to massage your scalp for just ten minutes a day, five in your morning shower and five before bed at night. Don't give up after a couple of days, try to make it a part of your daily routine.

, Aside from being bad for your health in general, smoking cigarettes and drinking alcohol and caffeinated drinks can have a detrimental effect on hair growth.


Smoking reduces blood flow to the scalp, causing hair to turn brittle and dull looking. The smoke from cigarettes can also turn graying hair an unwanted yellow hue, while imparting hair with an unpleasant odor.Alcohol can prevent the liver and colon from properly absorbing the nutrients you take in from food. Without certain essential nutrients, like A and B vitamins, hair becomes dull, weak, and may even begin to shed.
Caffeine is dehydrating, and when your body is dehydrated it has a negative impact on the health of skin and hair. If you need your morning coffee to get going everyday, make sure to counteract its dehydrating effects by drinking lots of water.

, Intense physical or emotional stress can cause hair growth to slow or shut down completely. In severe cases, stress can even cause hair loss. As a result, it is important to avoid stress and anxiety for the sake of your hair as well as your overall physical and emotional health.Stress affects hair growth by weakening your immune system and hindering your body's ability to produce healthy hair, skin and nails. When you are stressed, your body uses up any available energy and nutrients for essential functions like walking and talking, leaving none left over for things like healthy hair.
To minimize stress levels, make sure you are getting plenty of sleep, exercising frequently and eating healthily.

, If you want long hair for a particular event or occasion, you may want to consider getting hair extensions, especially if the event is coming up soon. Hair can take a long time to grow, so hair extensions are a good option if you want long hair but haven't got the time or patience to wait.


Hair extensions can be bonded to your own hair by a hair care professional, or you can purchase clip-in extensions that you can easily snap on or off yourself.
If you're worried about looking tacky, don't fret. Hair extensions can be extremely natural looking if you invest in a high quality set made from 100% human hair. These can be a little on the pricey side, however.

, There is no sure-fire way to make your hair grow. You cannot force your hair to grow any faster than its natural rate, all you can do is take good care of it and provide it with the optimal conditions. Except in rare circumstances, hair will grow a maximum of 6–8 inches (15.2–20.3 cm) a year when growing at its optimal rate.


For example, if your have hair that is currently chin length and want it to be below your shoulders, take a ruler and measure the space between where your hair is currently and where you want it to be. If you need 6 more inches to reach below your shoulders, plan on it taking 10-12 months for your hair to grow to your goal length.
The natural growth rate of your hair depends mainly on genetics, which is why everyone's growth rate is different. Growing your hair involves a personal commitment to taking very good care of your hair and a great deal of patience.

, In some cases, slow hair growth or hair loss can be due to an underlying medical condition or prolonged illness, certain prescription medications, substance abuse disorders, eating disorders, genetic or family history, or other serious medical situations. If you think any of these might be the problem, consult a physician immediately.


In many cases, resolving an underlying medical condition can help hair growth return to normal or speed up.
If an underlying medical condition is the problem, certain hair-growth treatments and over-the-counter or prescription medications are available. Always consult your doctor before pursuing any of these options."

Take a supplement.",How to Grow Your Hair3," Besides being rich in protein and vitamin D (both are key to strong hair), salmon contains omega-3 fatty acids, which are essential for healthy hair. About 3% of the hair shaft is made up of omega-3 fatty acids, which are also found in cell membranes in the skin of the scalp, and in the natural oils that keep the scalp and hair hydrated.If salmon doesn't thrill you, you can also get essential fatty acids from fish like herring, sardines, trout, and mackerel, as well as avocado and pumpkin seeds.

, Walnuts are the only type of nut that have a significant amount of omega-3 fatty acids. They're also rich in biotin and vitamin E, which helps protect cells from DNA damage. Walnuts also have copper, a mineral that helps keep your natural hair color rich and lustrous.Try using walnut oil in your salad dressing or stir-fry instead of canola or safflower oil.

, Oysters are rich in zinc, a lack of which can lead to hair loss (even eyelashes), as well as a dry, flaky scalp. Just three ounces of oysters contain almost five times your daily zinc requirement. They also boast a high level of protein.Zinc can also be found in nuts, beef, eggs and fortified cereals and whole grain breads.

, Sweet potatoes are a great source of the antioxidant beta carotene, which your body turns into vitamin A. Vitamin A helps produce and protect the oils that nourish the scalp. A lack of vitamin A can lead to a dry, itchy scalp and problems with dandruff.Carrots, cantaloupe, mangoes, pumpkin, and apricots are all good sources of beta carotene.

, A great source of protein, eggs are loaded with four key minerals: zinc, selenium, sulfur, and iron. Iron is especially important, because it helps cells carry oxygen to the hair follicles, and too little iron can lead to anemia, which is a major cause of hair loss, particularly in women.You can also boost your iron stores by eating animal products, including chicken, fish, pork, and beef.

, Spinach is a super-food containing iron, beta carotene, folate, and vitamin C which combine to help keep hair follicles healthy and scalp oils circulating.If you're not a spinach fan, try eating similarly nutrient-rich dark, leafy vegetables such as broccoli, kale, and Swiss chard.

, Tiny but mighty, these legumes are teeming with protein, iron, zinc, and biotin, making them a great staple for vegetarians, vegans, and meat eaters alike., Greek yogurt is high in hair-friendly protein, vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid -- an ingredient you'll often see on hair care product labels), and vitamin D, which emerging research links with hair follicle health.Other similarly beneficial dairy products include cottage cheese, low-fat cheese, and skim milk.

, Blueberries are a super fruit with numerous health benefits, but it's their high vitamin C content which really helps keep hair in top shape. Vitamin C is critical for boosting circulation to the scalp, supporting the tiny blood vessels that feed the hair follicles. Too little vitamin C in your diet can lead to hair breakage., Nothing beats poultry for providing protein, along with hair-healthy zinc, iron, and B vitamins to keep strands strong and plentiful. Because hair is nearly all protein, foods rich in protein are literally the building blocks for great hair.Lean cuts of beef are another good source of protein.

, Although maintaining a healthy diet is an excellent way to get the vitamins necessary for healthy hair, taking a vitamin supplement can make it easier to ensure that you are getting all of your daily requirements. The top 5 vitamin supplements you should take for healthy hair are biotin, vitamin A, vitamin E, vitamin B5 and Inositol.Remember to check with your health care professional before adding any supplements to your diet.

Limit how often you heat style your hair and use a lower heat setting when you do.,

Protect your hair from the elements, especially the wind and sun.,
Take care of how you brush your hair.",How to Hydrate Hair1," Blow drying, straightening, and curling your hair too often can cause it to become brittle and dry. Using too high of a temperature can also cause damage. If it is not too cold outside, consider letting your hair dry naturally. If you must heat style your hair, use a heat protection spray first.


Consider using ionic hairdryers. They infuse your hair with negatively-charged ions, which help seal moisture into your hair.Use a lower heat setting or temperature on your hairdryer, straightener, or curling iron. It will take longer to get the style you want, but it will be kinder to your hair.
Don't blow dry, straighten, or curl your hair every day. Even with a heat protection spray, too much heat can be damaging. Experiment with different hairstyles, such as natural curls, braids, ponytails, etc.;
, Choose shampoo and conditioner intended for your hair type. In most cases, this will be dry or curly hair; if you have fine, dry hair, however, use shampoo and conditioner meant for fine hair. Look for products that contain aloe vera or apricot kernel oil for extra moisture and hydration.Avoid washing your hair with hot water. Hot water can strip your hair (and skin) of its natural oils and moisture, leaving it feeling dry and dull.Silicones may help make your hair look shiny and smooth, but they can only be removed with sulfates. If you don't remove them properly, they will lead to build-up, which can cause your hair to look limp and dull. Sulfates are harsh, cleaning agents found in many household cleaners. They are great at removing silicones, but they also leave hair feeling brittle and dry., It may sound gross, but washing your hair only twice or thrice a week is actually better for your hair. The more often you wash your hair, the drier it will become. If you must wash your hair every day, consider co-washing. This is where you wash your hair using just conditioner. You wash your hair with shampoo only 2 or 3 times a week.


Take care of how you wash your hair. Use shampoo mostly on your scalp, and conditioner mostly on the ends of your hair.
If you have thick, coarse hair, consider using a regular, rinse-out conditioner first, and then applying a leave-in conditioner after you step out of the shower.If you have mature hair, leave a deep conditioner in your hair (under a plastic shower cap_ overnight. Wash your hair with shampoo and conditioner in the morning as usual., All of these styling techniques use chemicals, which can cause your hair to become brittle and dry over time. While there is little you can do when it comes to doing perms safely, there are a few things you can do to dye, highlight, or relax your hair in a less-damaging way:Consider an ammonia-free hair color. You will likely have to go to a salon to get it professionally done, but it will be much kinder and gentler on your hair. If you have mature hair, use a hydrating/moisturizing hair dye.
Consider getting a balayage done instead of regular highlighting. Balayage highlights your hair only from midway down. Because the roots are left natural, you don't have to do touchups as often. It also looks more natural.
Consider a chemical-free relaxer. It will still be harsh on your hair, so it is best not to do it too often, but it will be gentler than the usual chemical method.

, Both of these can cause your hair to become brittle and dry. If it is a hot, sunny day, spray your hair with a UV protection spray or wear a hat; you can also wear a hat or hood during the winter to keep your hair from drying out. Here are some other things you should keep in mind:Apply a rich, conditioning cream and a swim cap before going swimming. This will keep your hair from drying out in chlorinated water.
Use a rich, moisturizing conditioner during the winter. Add a deep-conditioning treatment once a week to your hair care regime for extra hydration.

, Always brush your hair starting from the ends, and never straight down from the roots. Also, never brush your hair while it is wet, as this can easily rip or tear it. Instead, gently comb your hair out using your fingers or a wide toothed comb. Once your hair is dry, you can brush it out using a wide-toothed comb (recommended for curly hair types) or a natural, boar bristle brush (this will help redistribute your hair's natural oils).If you need to, use a detangling spray or cream to make brushing easier.

If you have very thick or very long hair, you may need to use more oil.
To make the mask even more effective, sit under the hot sun or a dryer. The heat will help your hair absorb the oil better.

Make sure that you get enough protein and vitamins.,
Eat foods that contain essential fatty acids to combat dryness and brittleness.,
Drink around 6 to 8 cups (1.5 to 2 liters) of water each day.",How to Hydrate Hair3," One of the reasons why hair might turn dry is because it is unhealthy. You can restore your hair's strength and shine by eating enough silica, a mineral found in asparagus, bell peppers, cucumbers, potatoes, and other vegetables., Meat is an obvious source of protein, but so are other foods as well, including eggs, yogurt, and beans. Vitamins A, B, C, E, and K are also very important for hair, and are found in fruits, grains, and green, leafy vegetables.In addition to vitamins, make sure that you also get enough of beta-carotene, folic acid, magnesium, and sulfur in your diet.

, Essential fatty acids are mostly found in fish, including: herrings, mackerel, salmon, sardines, and tuna. They are also found in avocadoes, flaxseed, olives, and nuts., Not only is water important to your body's health, but it is also important to your hair's health. If you don't drink enough water, your skin and your hair will be dry."

Because damaged hair is already dry, you don’t want to dehydrate it any further. If you’re used to washing your hair every day, switch to every other day. If you usually wash every other day, switch to every third day.If you hair is greasy between washes, a dry shampoo can help freshen it. Spray the dry shampoo at roots to soak up excess oils and add volume. Be sure to work it through all of your hair to avoid powdery residue on the scalp, though.;
, When you do wash your hair, it’s important to use the right shampoo. Choose a moisturizing formula that won’t dry out damaged hair. Look for a shampoo that contains hydrating ingredients such as argan oil, macadamia nut oil, or shea butter.Make sure that your shampoo is sulfate-free. Sulfates are harsh sudsing agents that can easily strip damaged hair of essential oils.

, If you’re used to washing your hair with hot water, it’s time to switch to a cooler rinse. Hot water can dry out your hair, leaving damaged tresses even more brittle and weak. Instead, rinse your hair with lukewarm or cool water to keep the moisture in.For the final rinse of your hair, it’s best to use cold water. It seals the cuticle so your hair appears smoother and shinier.

, A good conditioner is essential for damaged hair because it helps hydrate your locks. For the best results, choose a strengthening conditioner that will moisturize and help your hair become less brittle. Look for a formula that contains proteins such as keratin, amino acids, and collagen.Your conditioner should also contain natural oils, such as argan oil, coconut oil, avocado oil, and marula oil, that will moisturize your hair.

, Even if you use a traditional conditioner, your damaged hair may not get enough moisture throughout the day. After you finish washing and conditioning your hair, apply a leave-in conditioner to hydrate and coat your strands so they’re protected all day.Cream and lotion leave-in conditioners typically work best for damaged hair.
To apply your leave-in condition, gently dry your hair with a towel. While it’s still damp, use your hands to apply a small amount of the conditioner throughout your hair, paying special attention to the ends.
For short hair, a dime size amount of leave-in conditioner is usually enough. For longer hair, use a quarter or half dollar size amount.

, To ensure that your damaged hair is getting all of the moisture and strengthening ingredients that it needs, it’s important to use a deep conditioner or hair mask regularly. Apply a formula for damaged hair at least once a week to get your locks soft and shiny.If your hair is extremely damaged, use the deep conditioner twice a week.
Some deep conditioners are applied to dry hair, while others should be used on wet hair. Consult the instructions on the packaging to determine how to use yours.
Leave the deep conditioning treatment on for an hour before rinsing it to ensure that it has time to really moisturize and strengthen your hair.
Make the deep conditioner more effective by placing a shower cap or plastic wrap over your hair when you’re wearing the mask. That will generate heat that allows the conditioner to penetrate your hair more easily.

, When your hair is damaged, it’s best to avoid heated styling tools, such as flat irons, curling irons, and blow dryers. Heat can damage even healthy hair because it strips moisture, so it’s especially bad for already damaged locks. Allow your hair to air dry, and only use your curling iron, hot rollers, or flat iron when absolutely necessary.If you have to use a heated styling tool, always apply a heat protectant product first. It will coat your hair so the heat doesn’t strip any of the natural moisture.
For damaged hair, a cream or lotion heat protectant is usually the best option.

, Chemical processes such as coloring or straightening are extremely harsh on your hair. When your hair is already damaged, you don’t want to do anything that will weaken it further so don’t dye, straighten, or perm your locks when they’re in a weakened condition.If you really need to have your hair colored, talk to your stylist about using gentler hair color, such as ammonia-free and demi-permanent formulas.

, Just like the sun can damage your skin, it can weaken your hair. When you have damaged hair, protect it from the sun by using an SPF hair product. They contain UVA and UVB filters that keep the sun from drying out your hair. Spray it on your hair whenever you plan to spend time outside.For periods of prolonged outdoor activity, wear a wide-brimmed hat to cover your hair and keep it shielded from the sun.

, Salt water and chlorinated pool water can be very harsh on damaged hair. If you plan to go swimming, wear a swim cap that will keep your hair protected from the drying effects of the water.If you don’t have a swim cap, wet your hair with a leave-in conditioner or fresh water before you go swimming. That will keep your hair from absorbing too much of the ocean or pool water.

, In most cases, the most damaged part of the hair is the ends. By getting your hair cut every six to eight weeks, you’ll removed the dry, brittle ends so your hair looks healthier overall.You don’t have to cut all of the damaged sections of your hair out at once. By getting a small trim every six weeks, you’ll slowly remove the dry, split ends, and over time, your hair will become healthier.

, Damaged hair is prone to tangles and knots, but working them out with a brush can snag your hair and cause breakage. A wide-tooth comb is a better option for damaged hair because it’s gentler and less likely to pull or tug at it.Your hair is most fragile when it’s wet, so it’s especially important to only use a wide-tooth comb on your hair right after you’ve washed your hair.

, Damaged hair often looks dry and dull. Adding hair oil to your locks can help hydrate them and boost the shine, so your hair looks healthier. You can apply an oil all over your hair when it’s wet, or just work it through the ends when your hair is dry.The best hair oils for damaged hair are argan oil, marula oil, avocado oil, and coconut oil.

Avoid dealing with your hair too much.",How to Go from Relaxed Hair to Natural," The biggest struggle with transitioning your hair is preventing breakage due to damage and dryness. Do what you can to keep your hair hydrated and conditioned by using a conditioner on a daily basis. Every evening before bed, thoroughly incorporate either coconut oil or olive oil into your hair and let is soak for 30 minutes to an hour. This will help replenish your hair with moisture and nutrients that will strengthen the demarcation line (the part of the hair where the transition is occurring).


To keep the shampoo from stripping moisture, try to wash your hair one to three times a week. On shampoo days, apply to the roots only so that you get the oil and debris at the scalp without stripping your strands. Then, condition as per usual.
Consider using a leave-in conditioner for your hair during the day. Apply some to your hair before you style it, paying careful attention to the demarcation line.;
, Deep conditioning treatments take adding moisture to a new level. Although they are typically only used once a month or so, transitioning hair needs extra conditioning and can handle the treatments more frequently. Purchase a deep-conditioning treatment from your local beauty supply store, and apply it to your hair once a week. Alternately, you can also choose to visit a salon and get deep-conditioning treatments regularly.


Follow the bottle instructions for your deep conditioner.
If you’re feeling frugal, another great alternative to a deep conditioner is using a bottle of mayonnaise. Although it sounds (and might smell) a bit unappealing, it can work wonders on adding moisture to your hair. Apply it to your hair once a week for 30 minutes to an hour.
If you decide to have a professional deep condition your hair, try looking for someone who specializes in transitioning hair. They’ll be able to provide you with products and services designed specifically to meet your needs.

, In general, hot tools should be avoided if you’re trying to protect your hair. Using curling irons, flat irons, and blow driers can stress your hair and cause breakage, specifically at the demarcation line. While transitioning your hair, do all that you can to allow it to be as natural as possible. Avoid hot tools, and if necessary, limit their use to only one day a week at most.

, This goes hand in hand with adding moisture to your hair; washing your hair frequently strips your strands of the natural oil that helps to keep it strong. Wash your hair as little as you can, using plenty of conditioner when you do. If you’re able, wash your hair once every 7-8 days so that there is plenty of time for your natural oils to thoroughly coat each strand of hair., Waiting for your hair to grow out is often the most frustrating part of the growing-process. Rather than waiting idly by, you can promote new hair growth by giving yourself frequent scalp massages. Use a bit of oil (coconut, olive, avocado, etc.) warmed slightly to massage your scalp. This will stimulate the hair follicles and help the strands to grow a bit faster. Hot oil massages can be done as frequently as you would like, but should be done at least once a week for the best results., Maintaining your vitamins and minerals is important to general health (in addition to hair health), but taking certain supplements can speed up hair growth and strengthen your hair extra fast. Doctors recommend taking biotin or viviscal - supplements specifically used for hair and nail growth - to increase the speed at which your hair is growing. Additionally, making sure you have enough vitamin D and A will help your hair out as well.


Some studies show that taking a saw palmetto supplement (derived from a small pine tree) can yield faster hair growth than taking nothing at all., Although it may seem like a given, you should be avoiding all relaxers and perms when trying to transition your hair. In addition, stay away from hair dyes and bleach, as these cause significant damage to your hair, causing it to break and become frizzy. Look for all natural alternatives to chemicals you typically use, as these will be much safer on your scalp and strands than harsh chemicals are.

, As it turns out, not all hair products are created equally. With a huge variety on the market, it can be difficult to find products that will work with your hair and your wallet. When transitioning your hair though, it is vital to get transition-friendly hair supplies. Look for sulphate-free conditioning shampoos, as well as other hair treatments advertised specifically for use in transitioning hair. Although these won’t necessarily change the appearance of your hair, they will work hard to prevent further damage and reverse current damage in your locks.


If you go to a salon that specializes in transitioning hair, ask for recommendations in hair products.
If nothing else, find a sulfate-free shampoo. Sulfate (present in most cheap shampoos) causes significant drying of hair strands and it clogs up the pores of the scalp, reducing hair growth.

, It is common for people transitioning their hair to go ahead and do the big chop - that is, cutting off all the relaxed hair, leaving a short amount of new growth near the scalp. This is certainly the best option for creating healthy growth, but not everyone wants their hair to be less than an inch long. If you’re bold enough to try a new look, the big chop is an excellent choice for immediately getting rid of all your relaxed hair, creating an immediate full transition to natural hair.

, Relaxers are permanent, so whatever parts of your hair that have been in contact with a relaxer will never grow back naturally. Therefore, at some point in time your hair must be cut off to above the demarcation line. If you’re not willing to go for the big chop, the next step is to do regular trims of your hair. Start by cutting off a few inches of your hair, and then once a month cut off ¼-½ an inch of hair. Over time you’ll have removed all of the damaged, relaxed hair to above the demarcation line, allowing your natural hair to grow more strongly.

, The first couple inches of new, natural growth can appear strange when juxtaposed next to your relaxed hair. In order to avoid damaging it further with tight styles, use accessories to hide your curly roots. Headbands and head scarves are popular options for hiding your roots while allowing the rest of your hair to show through.

, Although tight cornrows can cause breakage, using loose cornrows, braids, and twists are a great way to add interest to your hair without damaging it. The most manageable transitioning hairstyles are box braids and Senegalese twists. These hairstyles include little to no hair manipulation and they give a lot of hair protection since the extension hair is covering your real hair. Mastering each style can be tricky, so spend some time finding which works best with your hair and personal stylistic preferences. The most important thing is to keep whatever style you use very loose, so as to avoid stressing the strands of hair.Your hair is most fragile at the demarcation line, so be particularly gentle when styling it around this point.

, Many women can vouch for the importance of owning a good hair gel, pomade, or spray; with the right products, you can cover up even the most unsightly of hair styles. Sort through your styling products, and try using them (rather than a tight style with clips or elastic bands) to style your hair. You may like the results better, and it will be safer and more gentle on your fragile hair as well.

, Although it can be tricky not to, the more you touch and style your hair, the more likely it is to break and become frizzy. Try not to brush your hair too often, and avoid styles that put strain on your scalp. If you do brush your hair, start from the bottom and work your way up using a comb (not a brush)."

Determine what look you're going for.,
Get maintenance trims while your hair is still short.,
Make the most of your current haircut.,
Change the way you wash your hair.,
Dry your hair with care.,
Style your hair gently.,
Don't use a lot of chemicals on your hair.,
Eat well and get plenty of water.",How to Grow out Your Hair," As your hair grows out, it's a good idea to have a certain final look in mind.That way, when you get maintenance trims you can have the stylist shape your hair so that it grows a certain way.


If you're going for long layers, you can start early by having your stylist trim certain parts of your hair shorter than others.
Bring in a picture of someone who has the look you want when you go in to get your hair cut. This way you can be sure you and your stylist are on the same page.;
, If your hair is currently above shoulder length, it's a good idea to get maintenance trims every month or so to keep it looking neat. Short hair needs more attention than hair that is past the shoulders.


Be sure to inform your stylist that you're in the process of growing out your hair. If she doesn't know, she might cut off too much and set you back.
Stop getting frequent trims when your hair has grown past your shoulders. At this point your hair should have enough weight to fall nicely around your shoulders without needing to be shaped. Trims every 3 to 4 months will keep your ends healthy, but other than that you can only to wait for it to grow.

, Whether you're still at the pixie cut stage or you just have a few more inches to go before reaching your target hair length, make the most of your waiting game by styling and accessorizing your hair in flattering ways.


Play it up. Is your hair in an awkward in-between stage of growing out? Pretend like this is the way you've always wanted it to look. Blow it out, curl it, or wear it natural - own the hair on your head, no matter how it looks. If you wear it with confidence, people will think it's intentional.
Experiment with headbands, bobby pins, and other fun hair accessories to hold back the shorter pieces of hair you're trying to grow out while looking chic at the same time.Wear a hat. For the days when you wake up and your hair feels all wrong, put on a cute hat to cover it up. Choose a seasonal hat - a cute toboggan during the winter, or a straw hat for the summer.

, Do you wash your hair every day? This can dry it out, since you're washing away natural protective oils that help your hair stay strong and healthy. Washing them out causes your hair to be susceptible to breakage and split ends, which means you'll need more maintenance trims and it'll take much longer to grow your hair to the length you desire. To keep your hair healthy, follow this routine:


Wash your hair about three or four times a week. At first your hair might seem oily, but soon your scalp will produce just enough oil to moisturize your hair without overdoing it.
Wash your hair with the coldest water you can handle. Washing with hot water leads to split ends and frizz, while cold water keeps the hair shaft smooth and healthy.

, The way you dry your hair can also have a big impact on how quickly it grows out. Do you tend to roughly towel dry your hair, brush out the tangles, then blow it dry? This sets your hair up for major breakage. When you're growing it out, ditch that routine and try this:


When you get out of the shower, gently squeeze the excess water from your hair, then pat it dry with a soft towel. Don't rub or massage it; just pat it.
Comb your hair with a wide-toothed comb, which is easier on hair than a brush. Work through tangles gently, so you don't break the hair as you pull through.
Let your hair air dry most days. It's the healthiest way to dry your hair.

, Some days letting your hair air dry just won't do - especially if you're going to a special event and you want it to look well styled. On the days when you want your hair to look sleek and styled, try these alternatives:


Blow your hair using the cold setting. This is a lot less harsh on your hair, but it can still make your hair look smoother than air drying.
Curl your hair without heat. Use the t-shirt method, the sock bun method, or another cool-curling method to curl your hair instead of using a curling iron or hot rollers.

, Now might be a good time to examine the ingredients on your hair product bottles. Commercial shampoos, conditioners, and styling products contain a lot of chemicals that make hair look good in the short term, but dry it out and damage it in the long term. Choosing healthier products will prevent your hair from getting dull and dry while its growing out.


Don't use shampoo that has sulfates. These industrial cleansers are the same chemicals used in dishwashing detergent, and they do a number on your hair. Get shampoo that is labeled ""sulfate-free"" or make your own shampoo.
Don't use conditioner and styling products that contain silicone. These build up in you hair, initially adding shine but eventually making it look dull. They can only be washed out with sulfate-containing shampoo, so it's best to avoid them, too.
Don't get a Brazilian blowout or use other permanent chemical-based treatments.
Don't dye or bleach your hair while you're trying to grow it out.

, Eating a healthy diet and staying hydrated can help your hair grow in thicker and glossier, which is a plus when you're trying to grow it out.


Drink 8 glasses of water a day. Avoid drinking liquids that make you dehydrated.
Get plenty of vitamin B. Found in fruits, vegetables and nuts, this vitamin helps keep hair thick and strong.
Eat lots of protein. This is the building block for hair, so you need a lot of it. Eat meat, fish, legumes, and leafy greens.
Get your omega-3s. These ""good"" fats keep your hair glossy. Eat salmon, olive oil, nuts, and avocados.

Switch to a dry corn starch shampoo.",How to Give Flat Hair Volume1," Conditioner restores hair health with beneficial oils. If you have naturally greasy hair, however, the extra weight of these oils can make your hair limp. Minimize this effect with this approach:


Use a small dollop of conditioner.
Apply conditioner only to to the tips of your hair, not at the roots.
Rinse it out thoroughly.;
, These approaches are not one-size-fits all, so it may takes some experiment. The results can be well worth it if you have naturally oily hair. Here are a few options:


Switch to a volumizing or lightweight conditioner, or a light oil such as jojoba.
If you have healthy hair with no breakage problems, try skipping conditioner completely, or at least every second or third wash.
If you have fine, oily hair, try using conditioner first, then removing it by applying a small amount of shampoo. This strips away most of the heavy conditioner, without entirely removing the benefit.This may work best with a deep conditioner or a special ""pre-shampoo"" product., The effect is most noticeable on fine hair, although it's unlikely to solve the problem on its own. Leave the shampoo in a few minutes before rinsing.

, Some people find they get more volume from a dry, leave-in shampoo. Instead of shampooing while you wash, just apply corn starch to your hair and tousle it in thoroughly.


Mix the corn starch with cocoa powder first if you have dark hair.

, Still leaning forward, blow dry from above, pointing at at the underside of your hair. At the same time, brush from the other side using a round brush. Brush from the roots to the tip, gently pulling your hair in a curve as you move the brush opposite the blow dryer.


You can brush dry hair the same way, without the blow dryer.

, Instead of blow drying, towel-dry or air-dry until your hair is slightly damp. Then ""scrunch"" your hair by cupping a small amount of volumizing mousse onto a section of your hair ends. Lift this section up to your scalp, gently squeezing and ""crumpling."" Repeat with each section of hair and let air dry into a wavy texture.

, Teasing or playing with the hair at the nape of your neck can encourage it to dry in a stiffer volume. For a more pronounced effect (although one that can damage brittle hair), back comb by brushing the ""wrong way,"" from the tips to the roots. Do this with small sections of hair at a time, especially the top layers of hair at the top and sides of your head, so it stands up with a much larger profile.

, Spray your scalp and roots with hairspray to retain the volume longer. If your hair is short, volumizing gel or mousse will work instead.

This works best on thick hair.
Even a front or side fringe can make it easier to add volume. Just blow dry the fringe while wrapping it onto a round brush.

, Put your wet hair into rollers, or section into ponytails and wrap each one into a bun against your head. Leave them there for 3-6 hours or overnight. The resulting waves or curls add a great deal of volume compared to straight hair.


For maximum volume, create large barrel curls, then loosen them with your fingers to create the desired shape.

, If you have relaxed, Afro-textured hair, try switching to a ""texlax"" style. This just means using your relaxer product for a shorter amount of time, or diluting it before use. The result is a semi-relaxed hairstyle that is looser than your natural hair, but still has plenty of texture and volume.

, If you have thin, flat hair, extensions may be the easiest way to add volume and length. Clip-in hair extensions are easy to try out, so there's no need to make a big commitment.

Blot your hair with paper towels.,
Comb through your hair with a fine-toothed comb.",How to Get Vaseline out of Your Hair1," You may have success in removing much of the Vaseline by soaking it up with an absorbent paper towel. Starting off with less product in your hair can make it easier to remove the remaining petroleum jelly--because it is so difficult to get out, you will probably have to repeat your method of choice several times to remove all the petroleum jelly. Soaking some of it up may reduce the number of treatments you have to give your hair.You can use a hand-held hair dryer (or a hood hair dryer if you have access to one) to heat up and liquefy the Vaseline. It may be easier to absorb it with the paper towels in this state.;
, If you have thick globs of Vaseline tangling up your hair, combing it out may remove some of the product.

Consider adding a few drops of coconut oil or hair conditioner to the water. This will help make the tangles even easier to get out.
Avoid using a hairbrush on wet hair. Use a comb instead. Brushing wet hair may cause it to break.;
, Use your fingers to brush some oil through your hair. This will lubricate the hair strands, and make brushing or combing easier. Try using some avocado, coconut, or olive oil.

You can also use jojoba or argan oil. Both are very healthy for hair and can be found in beauty shops.

, Raking a brush through a knot may only cause the knot to tighten and become worse. It may even cause your hair to break. Instead, try pulling the knot apart with your fingers into smaller sections. Do not yank, your hair may break. Be gentle, but no so much that your actions are ineffective. Gently brush or comb each section, starting from the tips.


If you have textured or curly hair, twist or wrap each strand around your finger once you are done brushing. Gently release the strand. This will help re-shape the curl.

, Sectioning your hair off will help make it more manageable. If your hair is very tangled, it may also help make it less overwhelming. Be sure to brush or comb starting from the tips first. Once your brush or comb can pass through your hair without getting stuck, move upwards and continue brushing or combing. Keep doing this until you reach your roots.

, Both of these products will help lubricate your hair, and make it easier for a brush or comb to glide through. You can find both products in a beauty shop or a drug store. If you are having trouble finding the detangler, check the baby and kid shampoo section; you may find it there.

, A tangle teaser, also called ""tangle teezer,"" is a round or oval-shaped pad with short, soft, flexible bristles. You slip it over your hair and run it over your hair while your hair is still wet. It will help gently remove tangles.

, Doing so will get rid of the natural oils in your hair. These natural oils are important, because they help lubricate the hair strands. If you wash your hair every day, your hair will become dry—and dry hair is prone to getting tangled.

, These two chemicals go hand-in-hand. Silicones are plastics that may help your hair appear sleek and smooth, but they can only be washed out with sulfates. Sulfates are very harsh cleaning agents that may leave your hair brittle and dry.Dry hair gets tangled easily, and brittle hair tends to break.


Consider looking for hair products that have some sort of oil or butter in them, such as argan oil, coconut oil, or shea butter. These are natural ingredients that will help moisturize your hair, thus minimizing tangles.

, Flat irons, curling irons, and blow dryers can all damage hair by causing it to dry out completely. Dry hair is brittle, and it tangles easily. If you must heat style your hair, use a spray on a heat-protective spray onto your hair first. This will prevent the flat iron, curling iron, and blow dryer from frying your hair.

, Just because you leave home with tangle-free hair does not mean that your hair will stay that way. Consider carrying some hair oil, hair cream, or leave-in conditioner with you in your purse or backpack. This way, you can apply it to your hair whenever it starts to get tangled.


Try getting the sampler or travel sizes of your favorite hair product. It will be small enough to fit inside your purse or backpack. Since you won't necessarily be using it all the time, it should last you quite a while.

, Protein, vitamins, and healthy fats are important, because they help make your hair strong, and less-likely to break during brushing/detangling. Here are some foods that contain these things:


You can find protein in eggs, fish, and meat.You can also find it in nuts.
You can find Vitamin C in broccoli, citrus, and spinach.
You can find Vitamin B in berries, eggs, fish, and nuts.You can find healthy, unsaturated fats in avocados, nuts and olive oil.

, You can also cover your hair with a hood or scarf. This will help keep it tangle-free until you get back inside.

, It will help keep your hair from getting tangled while you sleep, and prevent the morning bed head. You can wear plain braids or a French braid.

, This will help direct the airflow along the shaft of your hair. It will help the cuticles of your hair lay flat, and prevent snarling.


Consider using a diffuser attachment. This is ideal for curly hair, because it distributes the air flow. You can also rest your curls inside the diffuser so that the hot air will flow around them; this will help keep your hair from tangling while allowing it to dry curly.

, Most deep conditioners can be used instead of regular conditioner. They usually need to be left on for 20 minutes, but it is always best to check the label for more specific times; some deep conditioners only need to be left on for five minutes. To get the most out of your deep conditioner, tuck your hair under a shower cap once you put it on; the shower cap will help trap the heat and make the conditioner more effective.


Deep conditioning will help smooth the hair cuticle. This, in turn, will help prevent tangles.

Treat dandruff.",How to Get Rid of Greasy Hair1," Shampoo certainly removes grease, but it can strip away too much of your hair's protective oil, leaving your hair dry and vulnerable to damage. If you hair breaks easily or quickly develops split ends, you may already be shampooing too often. Find a washing schedule that leaves your hair healthy and soft, so you can address the greasiness without destroying your hair.


You might be able to wash daily if you have very fine hair, live in a humid area, or exercise daily to the point of heavy sweating. For most people, washing once every 2–4 days is recommended. You may need to wash even less often if you have extra-curly African hair, or if you've treated your hair with keratin.Your hair will produce oil at the same rate, no matter how often you shampoo.;
, Find a shampoo intended for oily or greasy hair. The most effective examples tend to include sulfates, which are infamous in some circles for the damage they can cause to skin and hair.Give it a try, but switch to a sulfate-free product if the shampoo irritates your skin or swings your hair too far in the dry, damaged direction.


If you can't find an effective, safe shampoo, you might be able to replace shampoo entirely with one of the home remedies below.
Avoid products that advertise ""added shine,"" which is caused by oily ingredients.

, Dry shampoo is a scented powder that sits in your hair and absorbs grease, without rinsing away all your protective oils. Hold the can at least 6 inches (15 cm) away from your hair, and spray lightly onto the roots and mid-shafts in oily areas. Let sit for two minutes, then massage it into your hair with clean hands. Apply whenever your hair feels greasy, about 1–3 times between washes.Too much dry shampoo can cause white buildup. Apply lightly and to oily areas only (typically the layers of hair nearest to your scalp).
Dry shampoo is available in powder form as well as sprays. Choose this if you are sensitive to fragrance or aerosols.
Baking soda, talcum powder and other powders are also effective for absorbing grease.

, Conditioner is designed to make your hair soft and silky, which is a short step from greasy. Only use it immediately after shampooing, when your hair is at its driest, and stick to a dollop the size of a small coin. Rub it into the ends of your hair only, as your roots are slick enough on their own.


To reduce the amount of conditioner even further, lightly apply a spray-on, leave-in conditioner instead.Surprisingly, a co-wash (using conditioner instead of shampoo) does actually remove some oil, though not as much as shampoo.However, co-washing is mainly beneficial for dry hair. Shampoo is a safer bet for someone with grease issues.

, Unsurprisingly, hair grease and its gel and mousse cousins won't do you any favors in the fight against oil. Stick to light products only, such as texturizing sprays. If you bust out the mousse for a special occasion, be sure to wash it out at the end of the day.

, Clarifying shampoos are extra-powerful products that strip out buildup from hair products. Because these are harsh enough to damage hair, use this once every 2nd to 4th wash.Never use clarifying shampoo on color treated hair, which will likely fade and may be vulnerable to damage.

, Many people with dandruff often think the problem is dry skin. Actually, dandruff can be triggered by an overproduction of sebum, or scalp oil.If you have dandruff, treat it with dandruff shampoo according to label instructions.


There are several types of dandruff shampoo. If your dandruff doesn't decrease after a few uses, switch to one with a different active ingredient, or visit your doctor for a prescription-strength treatment.

The leftover water contains a natural soap, which may strip oils as well as shampoo on some hair.Try it instead of shampoo for a few sessions to see if you can save yourself money and avoid harsh chemicals.

, Find clay sold as a beauty product, and mix in water until it forms a paste. Working in small sections, coat slightly damp hair with the clay.Cover in plastic wrap or a plastic bag, and rinse out after 5–30 minutes.


Try bentonite clay or rhassoul clay., Many people use diluted apple cider vinegar to strip away product buildup, for hair that's too fragile to expose to clarifying shampoo. This works well for some people, and not at all for others.You can go a step further and join the ""no 'poo"" movement, replacing all your washing with this formula:Prepare one bottle of half baking soda, half water. Make a second bottle of half apple cider vinegar and half water.

, Long, greasy hair can be high-maintenance. On the other hand, most of the grease tends to accumulate near the roots, so a haircut may not improve matters. Follow your own preferences and experience with your hair when deciding on the right length.

Use product specifically designed for your kind of hair.,
Try an unscented dryer sheet to control extra static.,
Get an ice cube and run it over your flyaway hair.,
Use a small amount of non-greasy hand- or body-lotion.,
Run your fingers through your hair instead of using a brush if you're prone to flyaways.Less friction equals less static electricity.,
Use a shampoo especially for frizzy hair, and don't forget to condition!,
Use a clarifying shampoo once a month.,
Make your hair more conductive by applying special leave-in products.,
Avoid hair breakage.,
Finished.",How to Get Rid of Flyaway Hair," Flyaway hair is caused by dry hair, too much product build-up, or chemical damage. As hair gets drier, it produces more friction and static electricity. A silicone-based hair serum works for most kinds of hair, keeping it moisturized, shiny and flexible. But if you want to get serious about taming flyaway hairs, you'd consider what kind of hair you have and use product that's specifically designed with your hair in mind:


Hairspray designed to combat flyaways is best for fine to medium hair. A quick spritz should get the job done without sacrificing any naturalness your hair usually has.Lightweight pomades designed to trap moisture is best for thicker hair. The trick with pomades is applying only a little; it goes a long way! Make sure you spread the pomade over your hands and coat evenly before applying to flyaways.;
, That's what dryer sheets are for! you're thinking. Yep! They're excellent at controlling static electricity, and if you don't have any scruples about rubbing your hair with an anti-static sheet, they're very effective at taming flyaways. Perfect for when you're on the fly.

, Okay, so you won't be able to do this once you've gotten to class or the office, but this method works if you're still at home when you get the Medusa hair. Just take an ice cube and run it over any hair that's acting up, i.e. hair that's too dry. Cold water helps your hair retain moisture and help control it.

, The operating term here is non-greasy. As with the dryer sheet, you probably don't associate moisturizing lotion with your hair. But dab a little bit in your hands, spread it out, and work it into your hair, concentrating on the problem areas. Remember that flyaway hair is dry hair, and infusing it with some moisture-trapping lotion can go a long way.


Only do this method if you have medium to thick hair texture.

, Running your fingers through your hair will reduce the amount of friction on your hair, while using a brush can increase it. The more friction and static electricity, the more flyaway hairs.

, A couple things to note about using shampoo and conditioner to control flyaways:



You don't have to shampoo your hair every day. Shampooing every day is a recipe for dried-out hair. Unless you work in a greasy, sweaty, or dirty place — or your hair desperately needs to be cleaned every day — try to only wash it once every two or three days.But when you do shampoo, choose an anti-frizz or moisturizing shampoo. Anti-frizz and moisturizing shampoos are packed with moisturizing agents like aloe vera, essentially providing extra safeguards against dryness. When shampooing, focus most of your energy on cleaning your scalp, not drying out your ends.
Choose a shampoo that is made for your hair type. For example, if you have curly hair, choose a shampoo that is labeled as curly.

Every time you shampoo, condition. Conditioning your hair helps keep it from drying out and breaking into flyaways and split ends. When you condition, focus mainly on your ends.

, If you use many styling products in your hair, the build-up over time can cause flyaways. To combat this, use a clarifying shampoo at least once a month. Be sure to condition your hair afterwards., Look for products that have the words ""quat"" or ""amine"" in them, as they do a better job of conducting electricity than silicone- or alcohol-based products. Products that conduct electricity better mean fewer flyaways.

, Hair with too much breakage can cause flyaways as well. It is easier to prevent hair breakage than treat it. Handle your hair gently. Some ways you can prevent hair breakage include:

Using silk pillow cases
Putting heat tools such as hairdryers and curling irons on low settings
Reducing chemical treatments
Choosing cloth elastic bands

, Remember that taming flyaways is all about keeping moisture locked in your hair. If you shampoo and condition the right way, use the right products, and control any flyaway frizz that crops up with anti-static cheats, you'll be golden.

You can also use a soft t-shirt to wrap your hair. Just like the microfiber towels, the softer material will not create as much friction with your cuticles as a fluffy towel and can leave your hair softer. You can also buy a hair wrap from a department store like Target. These wraps are made of absorbent microfiber and are lighter and easier to wrap on top of your head than a towel. ;
, You do not want your excess water to leak out of your hair wrap, so use your towel to gently squeeze the excess water from your hair. You can flip your hair over and squeeze the water out in sections if you have thick hair, or if you have shorter or thinner hair, you can tilt your head to one side and gently take each half of your hair and press it between the folds of your towel to dry it.


There are gloves you can buy made out of microfiber, and they are designed to dry your hair like a towel. Put them on and squeeze your hair to dry it faster., If you have straight hair, you can use a large tooth comb to detangle your hair and ready it for the wrapping. If you have curly hair, be careful not to over comb your hair with your fingers because you want to retain as much of your curl as you can. If you are trying to get wavy hair, you may want to skip this step, or gently scrunch your hair in sections so that you don’t disturb the clumps of curls in your hair.Your hair is at its weakest when it is wet, so avoid combing out a lot of snarls when it is wet. To help prevent breakage, comb your hair before you take a shower, and it will be easier to detangle before you wrap it up. , Bend over at the waist, and use your hands to brush all of your hair down over the top of your head so that all of your hair is hanging upside down in front of your face.


Pick a spot to bend over where you have room flip your hair over.

, The middle of the towel should sit at the nape of your neck on your back hairline. Adjust the sides of your towel so that both sides have the same amount of fabric hanging on each side. Then bring together the two sides of the towel to the middle point at the front of your hairline, and hold the sides of the towel together firmly. Hold the sides of your towel around your hairline so that the towel applies pressure to your head but is not so tight that it squeezes your head. If your wrap is too tight, it may give you a headache.


Tuck the towel behind your ears. Some people like to put the towel over their ears, but this makes it harder to hear.

, Twist your towel in one direction starting at the base of your head. With one hand, keep your towel in place and with the other hand wrap your hair. Twist the towel around your hair to the end. You want the wrap to be firm but not so tight around your hair that it causes damage.

, Stand upright and flip the wrapped hair to the back of your head. Clip or tuck the end of the wrap into the opening of the towel at the nape of your head to secure it.

, This should be enough time for your towel to wick away all of the excess moisture that it can absorb from your hair.If after an hour your hair is still wet, use another hair towel that is dry to replace the hair wrap until your hair is damp dry.

, Bend at the waist again with your head upside down again, and gently unwrap your hair so that it can let it air dry the rest of the way. Unwrap your hair but leave it loose in the towel so that when you bring your head right side up you don’t have to whip your hair back to get it out of your face. Instead, you can let your hair loose from the towel once your head is back up.

This method is a good alternative if you get headaches from wrapping your hair on your head.

, Put the towel on your head so that it rests on the front of your hairline. The long ends of the towel should dangle past your shoulders. Make sure the towel length is even on both sides before you start wrapping. If the towel isn’t even, it will be more difficult for your wrap to stay at the end.

, Take both sides of your towel and bring them around the nape of your neck so the towel is snug around your head. Tuck your towel behind your ears so that your ears are free of the towel.

No wonder people's skin looks tired in the morning, it's been up all night trying to process all that rubbish and get rid of it all, and you wake up with the skin equivalent of a hangover.;
, The problem is that when it comes to reading the ingredients list, most people don't actually know what any of the words mean. Don't just take everything at face value, because the words 'natural' or 'organic' have been pretty misused and abused. Countless companies are eager to jump on the 'organic' buzzword band-wagon - without the integrity to match. If products have plant source ingredients, they can call it 'organic' even if it's been grown with pesticides. It's difficult to find products that are completely natural. As for 'natural' or 'organic' what do those words really mean now days? In short? If it's not 'certified' organic , then it's not organic or natural. But even though your favorite 'organic' cream contain certified organic ingredients, it doesn't mean the entire product is. Watch out for those companies who only list 'key ingredients' - you're not being shown the whole story. Nasty emulsifiers and preservatives have probably been dropped off the list. If you are not sure about whether the chemicals/ingredients are safe or not, feel free to ask a legal guardian, parent, or even expert for more advice.

, Organic Certification. Australia, the United States, and Canada each have official labels for organic certification. They can be found on personal care products and as well as on food products.

, Research has shown that the average woman who wears face creams and makeup on a daily basis absorbs over 2kg of chemicals through her skin every year. Of the 7000 cosmetic ingredients available to manufacturers, more than 1000 have known harmful effects and a further 900 are potentially cancer-causing.


Parabens (a preservative in most skincare products) have been found in breast cancer tissue and, in a recent study by the Environmental Working Group (a non-profit environmental research organisation in Washington DC), babies treated with common baby lotions, shampoo and powder had a high concentration of phthalates in their urine (chemicals linked to allergies, sex organ deformities and eczema). The umbilical cord blood of 10 babies born in US hospitals in 2004 contained a staggering 287 chemicals - of which 180 are known to cause cancer in humans or animals, 217 are toxic to the brain and nervous system, and 208 cause birth defects or abnormal development in animal tests. That to me is really horrifying.

, When scientist repeated the experiments with a cream lacking several suspect ingredients - including mineral oil and sodium lauryl sulphate - cancer rates dropped.

If you cannot find any ground almonds or oats, you can make your own by grinding them using a blender, coffee grinder, or food processor. Be sure to grind each ingredient separately.

, These ingredients are not vital, but they can make your cleanser feel more luxurious and exfoliating. Herbs and essential oils will also give the cleanser a nice fragrance. Here are some suggestions of what you can add, based on skin type:








If you have oily skin, add: 2 tablespoons of fine sea salt, 2 tablespoons of finely-ground dried peppermint, and 5 drops rosemary essential oil (optional).
If you have dry skin, add 2 tablespoons of powdered milk, 2 tablespoons of finely-ground dried calendula, and 5 drops Roman chamomile essential oil (optional).
If you have combination skin, add 2 tablespoons cornmeal, 2 tablespoons finely-ground dried chamomile, and 5 drops lavender essential oil (optional).

, In order to use this facial cleanser, you will need to add some liquid to it. Here are some suggestions of what you can use for the liquid based on skin type:








If you have oily skin, use lemon juice, rose water, plain water, or witch hazel.
If you have normal skin, use glycerin, honey, rose water, peppermint tea, or plain water.
If you have dry skin, use milk, cream or yogurt.

, Dampen your face with warm water. Measure out two teaspoons of your facial cleanser and add just enough of your liquid to turn it into a paste. You can mix the paste in the palm of your hand using your fingers, or you can mix it in a small bowl using a spoon.

, Use gentle, circular motions, and be sure to avoid the sensitive areas around your eyes. The circular motion will help the ground almond exfoliate your skin.








, Gently massage your face to get rid of any excess cleanser. The cool water will help close an tighten your pores.

, Using a soft, clean towel, gently pat your face dry. Do not rub your skin, or you will risk agitating it.

",How to Wrap Hair," Use a comb to part your hair from the crown of your head to the top of your neck. The crown begins at the upper back of your skull where your head begins to curve downward. Start here and make a straight part down to your neck to split your hair into two parts. Have a friend help or place two mirrors facing each other so that you can see what you’re doing behind your head.;
, Take the brush in your left hand. Place the outer edge of it along your part and on the left half of your hair. Brush the hair toward your left temple, keeping it smooth alongside your hair line. Slide a bobby pin an inch left of the nape of your neck and then again right above your ear. Continue placing bobby pins every 2 inches from here.Incorporate the ends into the right hair section if you have long hair.
If you have curly hair, use your hands instead of a brush to prevent extra frizz.

, Take the brush in your right hand and place the outer side of it on your part with the brush over the right side of your hair. Brush up from here towards the temple gently. Be careful and try not to brush over the bobby pins. Once again, place a bobby pin 2 inches from the nape, again just above your ear, and every 2 inches from there to the ends., Take your head wrap or head scarf and open it completely on a flat surface. Pick up any corner and bring it to the opposite corner, folding it perfectly in half. This will create a triangular shape.

, Grab the two corners of your triangle that have created your fold. Taking one in each hand, lift the folded end of your scarf to your forehead and slide it back to your hairline. Lay the rest of the triangle back over your head.

, Bring the corners of your scarf triangle back to the nape of your neck. Knot these ends over the loose point of your triangle.If long enough, take the ends and wrap them back up to your front hairline. Knot them here again.

, If you have any stray hairs, tuck them into your wrap. If you don’t feel that your wrap is secure, bobby pin it in place. Sleep with your hair wrapped and wake to it frizz, tangle, and break free. Simply remove the wrap, take out the pins, and brush it a little to wear it the next morning.,"

, Thoroughly wet your hair with warm — not hot — water. Very hot water damages hair shafts, causing fly-away hair.

, Pour a quarter-sized amount of shampoo into your hand, rub it between your palms, and then spread it evenly over your scalp. Using more shampoo than that will strip your hair's natural oils, leading to the frizzy hair.

,,,, Rinse the conditioner with warm water, adding a final blast of cold water to seal the cuticles, which makes hair really shine.

, If you can stand it, use cool water. This seals in shine for your hair, and is overall, much healthier.

, Stand directly under the shower head and drench your hair. One of the key reasons for hair damage is because people don't wash out all their shampoo, due to hair that isn't fully wet.

, Get a dime-sized amount of shampoo of your choice, and work it into your scalp first. Then, slather more on the body of your hair; but always focus on the scalp. This will keep people with oily, straight hair from getting dandruff, as the shampoo loosens up dirt and oil on the scalp. When you use conditioner, don't put it on your scalp, use it on the ends and body of your hair, but focus on the ends. Let the conditioner sit for 5 minutes. Rinse thoroughly to ensure there is no residue, which causes oily hair/flaky scalp.

, Like straight hair, use a dime sized amount of shampoo. This time, work it into the roots and body of your hair, but NOT THE ENDS. If you can, let the suds of soap run down and reach your ends in small, foamy amounts. Washing the ends of curly hair directly will dry the hair out dramatically. Condition normally, let sit for 5 minutes. As you wait, get a comb (NOT A BRUSH) and comb the conditioner through your hair. This detangles and moisturizes the hair.

, This, as mentioned earlier, is very healthy and seals in shine for your locks.

An oily scalp should stay away from products that offer moisturizing or hydrating properties, whereas a person with dry scalp should seek them.
For moisturizing shampoo, choose products that offer balancing or volume increasing effects, such as those featuring fewer to no sulfates, such as ammonium laureth sulfate, sodium laureth sulfate and ammonium lauryl sulfate.Those with normal scalps should change up the type of products they use as the condition of their scalp changes throughout the year.;
, Is your hair thin, wavy, or curly and coarse? Much like your scalp, the type of hair you have will affect the shampoos and conditioners that will best keep your hair healthy.Thin hair benefits from products that add volume, and give the hair the appearance of more body. Ingredients to look for include protein, silk protein, panthenol,and witch hazel.Medium or wavy hair benefits from most types of shampoo, depending on how you want your hair to look. Strong, general choices for medium hair includes products that smooth and detangle hair.
Thick, curly, kinky or coarse hair benefits from hydrating and moisturizing products. You may even consider washing your hair with conditioner only, rather than using a drying shampoo.

, Hair that is color-treated can be damaged or dulled by shampoo that is not specifically made for such hair. Shampoos specialized for color-treated hair help fill in the lipid layer that is lost when coloring, keeping your color from fading as easily.


Shampoo for color-treated hair tends to feature ingredients that make it very moisturizing. Keep this in mind if you have an oily scalp, and pair it up with a conditioner that counter balances the moisture., Washing your hair in hot water tends to dry out your hair and scalp, which will cause dandruff and limp hair (especially noticeable in short hair). Instead, turn the water down and give your hair a rinse in cool or tepid water.If you prefer a hot shower, you can turn the heat up after washing your hair first. Alternatively, clean your body with a hot shower, and then turn the temperature down before you wash your hair.

, Squeeze a small amount of shampoo into your palm – the size of a walnut should do, but you may opt for a little more if you have longer hair. Rub the shampoo into your scalp with gentle circular motions for about 30 seconds. Covering the hair with shampoo directly is not necessary with shorter hair.


Lather the shampoo with a little water before applying to your scalp to avoid applying the pure shampoo to the scalp itself., Use the tepid or cool water to rinse the shampoo out of your hair. Once all of the shampoo is out of your hair, squeeze out the excess water. This shouldn’t be terribly difficult with short hair, provided you have enough hair to grab!


Leaving too much water in your hair prior to conditioning prevents your hair from properly soaking up the conditioner's ingredients., Apply your conditioner starting at the ends of your hair and working your way toward the scalp. Apply it evenly throughout your hair, and allow the conditioner to sit in your hair for 1 to 2 minutes.


If your hair is too short to effectively apply conditioner with your fingers, use a wide tooth comb to help apply the conditioner.
Take those few minutes to take care of something else in the shower, like scrubbing your body or shaving., Again, rinse using tepid or cool water. Make sure to remove all of the conditioner from your hair before exiting the shower. Leaving conditioner in your hair can clog hair follicles and create buildup in the scalp.


You may have to spend a few more minutes rinsing the conditioner from your hair if you have thicker or wavy hair.
Leave-in conditioner is an option for thicker or curly hair that does not have to be rinsed out following a shower., How often you should wash your hair depends on the type of hair you have. Review the type of hair you have and how you feel about your hair given your current washing practices to adjust your habits appropriately.


Fine hair typically only needs to be shampooed 3 times a week. Shampooing too much or too little can restrict the hair’s natural “bounce.”
Thick hair shouldn’t be washed more than every other day to help maintain its volume.
Coarse, curly hair doesn’t get as oily as quickly as other hair types, and can go longer without needing a wash. Shampooing twice a week will help you keep those curls., Pat your hair dry with a towel. This shouldn’t take long with short hair. You don’t want to scrub your hair, or you may damage your hair and create cowlicks. Squeeze out the moisture with careful blotting!


Squeeze the excess moisture out of your hair with your hands prior to toweling.
Fold the towel as it becomes moist so that you can apply dry portions to your hair., The proper spray will protect your hair from being damaged by heat, and allow your hair to keep shape after being dried. These come in a variety of styles, including some that further moisturize, so pick a type that suits your hair.


Follow the same rules for choosing a styling spray as you do for choosing a shampoo and conditioner. The spray should be based on the type of hair you have, and the dryness level of your scalp.

, Use a flat brush to pull your hair in every direction. The object is to create a voluminous “lift,” without your hair becoming “poofy.”


Allow straight and wavy hair to air-dry for several minutes after toweling before turning on the blow drier. Curly hair can begin just after air drying.
Separate your hair into sections with clips to make drying faster and more effective. This can give your hair a more polished look as well.
Dry 3- to 4-inch sections of hair at a time to help shape your hair. Use a mixed-bristle brush to help dry the roots as well.
Keep the blow dryer pointed toward the floor to help prevent hair frizz., Use the texturizing spray to tease your hair how you like. This helps avoid a “helmet head” look.


Choose a hairspray strength according to your hair type. Straight hair typically only needs a spray that is low-hold. Hair this is thicker or made into an ""up-do"" will require medium to strong-hold.
If your hair starts to lose its hold during the day, reset the hold by spraying a little water into your hair.Feel free to use your hands to tease your hair for a natural look, or use a comb if you want a sleeker look."

Rinse your hair thoroughly with warm water.,
Condition your hair before you shampoo if you have long hair.,
Gently massage shampoo into the roots of your hair.,
Do not shampoo the ends of your hair if you have longer hair.,
Rinse your hair and squeeze out the excess water.",How to Wash Your Hair1," Your hair will need to be completely soaked before you apply shampoo. Using warm water is important, because the warm water will open the cuticles in your hair. Once your hair is soaked in warm water the hair will start loosing any dirt and build up it has accumulated. Additionally, the warm water will help your hair and scalp absorb the oils in your conditioner. 








Let your hair get completely wet before you apply your shampoo.
Consider using a water filter that will extract any harsh minerals from your water. Your hair will rinse cleaner and feel softer. ;
, This may be new to you, but if your hair falls past your shoulders, the ends of your hair need more conditioning to keep them strong. Apply a nickel sized amount of conditioner to your palms and massage it gently into the ends of your hair. This will protect your ends from splitting and add shine! 







, Measure a quarter sized amount of shampoo into the palm of your hair if you have short or medium length hair. You can double that amount if your hair is longer than your shoulders. Rub between your palms and then softly work the shampoo into the roots of your hair, massaging, not scrubbing, as you go. Also, make sure you shampoo well at the nape of your neck. 








Be gentle, do not scrub your hair and avoid tight circular motions! You do not want to damage or break the cuticles of your hair.

, You need more shampoo at the roots, because that is where the majority of your oil is. You need less shampoo or no shampoo at your tips of your hair, because it is the oldest and driest hair.









If you have product build up, you can shampoo your hair with a purifying shampoo once a week.

, Rinse your hair with warm water until it is free of all shampoo. Run your fingers through your hair to wick the water out of your hair if you have short hair. Gently squeeze the water out of your hair at the midsection and end to prepare for the conditioner if you have longer hair.

Wash the hair.,
Keep the hair wet if cutting with scissors or a razor.,
Work with dry hair under special circumstances.",How to Cut Hair1," In the same way that an artist starts with a fresh canvas before painting, you want to start with clean hair before cutting. Hair that's dirty or full of product will not allow you to see a true finished product when your haircut is completed.


Use a shampoo and conditioner made for the specific hair type. There are products to fit every need--color-treated hair, dry hair, damaged hair, thinning hair, hair that lacks volume oily hair, normal to dry hair, and natural hair—so pick the one that's best based on hair type and needs.
If hair is prone to knots or tangles (such as chemically treated or bleached hair), use a de-tangling conditioner or spray on a de-tangling product. You don't want your comb to get stuck when you run it through hair that has mats or tangles.;
, You can best see how the hair naturally falls when it's wet. Also, it's easier to follow cutting guidelines on wet hair so your cut is more precise.









Note that this is only the case with straight hair. Cutting curly or wavy hair properly when it's wet can be difficult, as the water will cause the hair to temporarily lie flat and straight. Unable to see the normal curls/wave pattern, you may inadvertently cut it improperly; creating uneven texture (you'll end up cutting some curls in half and some completely off, resulting in bits of hair sticking straight out unevenly).
If you are cutting African American hair, then make sure to dry the hair completely before cutting it.Wet hair sticks together, which helps it stay in place while you cut.
Keep a bottle of water with a spray nozzle nearby so that you can dampen the hair if it begins to dry while you are working on it.

, Make sure hair is dry if you plan to use clippers or if you want to carefully thin the hair to make sure you don't remove too much fullness.


Do a dry cut if you're simply trying to remove split ends; they're easier to see when the hair is dry.
If you're pressed for time, a dry cut saves the need for washing and drying.

He may want you to only trim away split ends, but he could also want you to cut everything off. Before you begin to cut, it's important that you ask all of the necessary questions and understand what he would like done with his hair. If you are clear and communicative from the start, you will avoid any potential misunderstandings.


When cutting men's hair, break their head up into 7 parts: the top, left side, right side, back, left sideburn area, right sideburn area and the fringe. That way, they can describe to you how much hair they want taken away from each part.
Make it a dialogue. As you cut the man's hair, continue to ask him for feedback. Give him access to a mirror (wall-mounted or hand-held) where he can review the cut, and periodically ask him whether it's short enough.;
, A man who is losing his hair on the top of his head may love the way Don Draper looks, but may be disappointed when he tries to pull off the same look.


More dramatic hairstyles on men tend to work best when a man has a fuller head of hair.
More conservative hairstyles tend to make the best use of thinning hair.

, It is important not to be in a hurry when cutting hair, especially if you do not have a lot of experience. You also do not want to have any sort of stimulant in your system, nothing that will make your hands unsteady or interrupt your concentration.

, Seat him in a sturdy chair, and make sure you can comfortably reach his head with your hands. Cover his shoulders with a barber’s cape, bed sheet, or towel to keep the hair off of him and to make cleaning up easier. Try fixing the sheet around his neck with a pin or a clip so that it doesn't slip off. Cover his neck with a neck strip, which you can buy at a local beauty supply store.


Make sure to set up on a floor surface that will be easy to clean afterwards. Tile, wood, linoleum, and concrete are all great choices. Carpet—especially thick carpet—will swallow clipped hair and make cleaning up difficult. Bathrooms, kitchens, and patios are good for hair-cutting.
Use a pair of very sharp, high quality shears that are specifically made for cutting hair. Scissors made for cutting paper or fabric will not lead to the results you want to achieve with his hair.

, Dampen his hair by spritzing with a spray bottle. If the hair is too wet to work with, towel it gently dry.

, This should also give you an idea about how and where to cut. Comb hair in the desired style: some men prefer the part on the right side of the head, and other men prefer it down the middle of the head.

, You can use the clippers to trim the back and sides of the head, to tidy up loose bits around the ears, or even to buzz the entire head to a uniform length. Clippers come with blade-guard attachments that determine the length of the hair that gets cut. The longer the attachment, the less hair that gets cut. Many men have a preference on what guard you use, so it’s a good idea to ask him if there’s one that he prefers. Most clipper sets come with six guides. The lower the guide number, the shorter his hair will be:


Use a six to keep a little length.
Use a three or four for a classic cut.
Use a two for a close cut, and a one for a ""buzz cut"".

, Your grip should be strong and steady, but comfortable. You don't need to squeeze or do anything fancy with this clippers; you might hurt someone.

, Hold the clippers against his scalp, and run them through his hair from the nape of his neck to about halfway up his head. Round the clippers up and out to finish that cut. Work around to the sides, always cutting upward and against the direction the hair is growing.









Work your way slowly around the head. Cut carefully around the ears. Leave the top for the scissors.

, To line up the back, the goal is to keep the existing hair line, and take off the strays outside of the hairline. Turn the clippers upside-down and press the blades perpendicular to the head and cut downwards. Be sure to get the rat-tail in the middle. Whoever does the line should have the recipient look down to get a close cut, then look up to preview what it looks like when finished.








, The sides are trickier than the back, but the goal is usually to push the line up and off the ears. Turn the clippers on their side and use the edge of the blade, cutting from the back to the front, going against the grain. Try to tilt the blades at an angle so it fades in.








, Use a spray bottle to lightly spritz the uncut hair. Comb the hair forward and make an imaginary line down the center of his head, as if it were in between his eyes separating the right side from the left side. You can also section the hair with clips if you need to.

, Beginning at the back and working forward along your imaginary line, comb up a half-inch section of hair. Pinch the hair between your index and middle finger, slide your fingers up or down to the length you want. The hair below your fingers will stay on his head; the hair above your fingers will be trimmed away. Snip the hair at an angle, with hair-cutting scissors, so it won’t look blunt or uneven.









Cut perpendicular to the hair direction for a clean cut. For example, if his hair points downwards, towards the back of the neck (vertical), cut horizontally across the back of his head.
Don't cut in one big clip with the whole scissor blade. Use the tips or the scissor blades for cutting in short spurts. If you're nervous, cut just a bit at a time. You can always cut more if you need to.

, You should notice the length difference where you just cut. When cutting a new section of hair, always take part of the just-cut section between your fingers so you can use it as a length guide.








, Cut along another imaginary line. Using the prior cut as your guide, make another ""line"" to either the right or left of your original one. Begin cutting, once again, from the back of the head to the front. Use the already trimmed section as a guide and cut any hairs that stick up past that length. Continue sectioning and cutting the hair from front to back, always taking a bit of the previous section to show you where to cut.








, When you reach the front of his head, comb his bangs down. Ask him how long he wants his bangs to be if you didn’t already during the consultation. Holding the scissors vertically with the tips pointing up, make little snips using the points of the scissors. Cut at an angle for better blending.


Be careful with bangs. The ""golden rule"" is: ""Once you cut it, it's gone."" Always remember that you can cut more off, but you can't add it back, so you must be sure of where you're cutting.
Make sure that the bangs are damp, but take drying into account. Cutting dry hair causes it to fly everywhere, and can fray the ends in some cases. However, curly hair can shrink up to 4 inches (10.2 cm) when it dries. Even straight hair can shrink as much as 1 1⁄2 inches (3.8 cm). If you haven't cut bangs before, err on the side of caution.

, Using the fine-tooth end of the comb, comb upward at the point where the clipper cut meets the scissor cut. Use the scissors to trim the hair that pokes out of the comb, blending away, or ‘fading,’ the harsh line that separates the clipper cut from the scissor cut. This is called the shear-over-comb technique. Work all the way around the head.









As you use the comb, hold it with the teeth pointing straight up, making sure you aren't angling it towards or away from you.

, Using the clippers without an attachment, trim the neck and hair around his ears. Trim his sideburns, stepping back occasionally to look at him head-on and make sure they’re even. Start at the top and work the clippers downward so you don’t clip too high.









If he asks you to trim his beard, you can use the clippers to either shave or clean up the hair below his sideburns. If you are shaving, you can use a razor (for a close shave) or the clippers without any attachment (for a rough shave). If you are cleaning up the beard: ask him how short he'd like it, and choose a clipper attachment accordingly. You can also use scissors to evenly snip away the longest hairs of his beard.

, Look over to make sure that you haven't missed any spots. Carefully touch up any rough areas with scissors or clippers. Let the man see your handiwork in the mirror, and ask for feedback to see whether he likes it. You can always cut more if needed. Make any final touches to the cut.








, Gently towel his hair and neck dry. Consider briefly blow-drying his neck to remove any loose hairs. Add styling products, if the man wants you to.

, Take a minute to sweep all of the loose hair clippings into a small, out-of-the way pile. This is a necessary safety precaution to take because hair can make the floor very slippery. Afterwards, wash your comb/scissors/shaver.


If he isn't wearing shoes, the hair can go through his socks. Sometimes you can get an ingrown hair, where a hair grows the wrong way. This is very painful.
If he is wearing shoes, the hair can stick to the soles of the shoes, and could be dragged around the house.

Look at the head as a whole.",How to Cut Curly Hair," You'll need a good pair of cutting scissors. They should be very sharp, as dull scissors won't give you a good cut. You'll also need hairpins, clips, or hair ties if you want to section off part of your hair, as well as a wide-toothed comb.Only use your hair-cutting shears for cutting hair. If you use them on other things, they will get dull, making it more difficult to cut your hair.Skip razors because they can make curly hair more frizzy.;
, It's easiest to detangle hair when it's a little wet. Use a wide-toothed comb, not a brush or regular comb. Start with the roots, and work your way down, gently pulling out tangles with the comb.If a tangle is being particularly stubborn, see if it need to be cut a bit to help untangle it., While you can wash your hair first, you should work with dry hair when cutting curls. That way, it will be easier to cut just what you want, as the length changes between dry and wet.Some stylists say damp works well, too. Mainly, it means less drying time. Just make sure the curls have mostly scrunched up before you start cutting, so you can get an idea of the shape.Another option is misting dry hair with a light leave-in conditioner, so that you get the best of both worlds., If you're looking for a short bob, start by washing and drying your hair. You may want to add some leave-in conditioner. Comb your hair into a low ponytail at the back of your head. Don't get it too close to your head.Make sure you comb all the loose hairs and get the hair as straight as possible. Once you've got it combed into a ponytail, pull the elastic an inch or two down. Cut your hair straight across below the ponytail holder.
Undo the ponytail. Comb your hair into a high ponytail onto the very top of your head. Once you get it all combed straight, cut across the top, as well, about two inches from the end of your hair.Comb it out, and you're done.

, This method works better in front of a mirror that magnifies. That way, you can really see what you're doing. The goal of search and destroy is to just take off what's damaged.""Dusting"" is lighter than a trim, meaning you don't take as much off.
Work on small, single sections of your hair at a time. Hold them up to the mirror so you can see which ones are damaged.Trim off the ends of curls that are damaged. Once you've got all the damaged ends in a section, move on to the next section.Pin back any area you've already trimmed.

, Start with detangled hair. Twist your hair into small sections. That is, curl the hair around your finger until it exposes the damaged ends. Trim off what you can.








Make sure your hair is dry or just damp before starting this method.You can also do this method with small braids. Your sections should only be about an inch by an inch. Trim off 1/4 of an inch to 1/2 of an inch.Pin or tie back areas you've already trimmed., Another way to find damage is to use your fingers to feel for it. As you run your fingers through your hair, feel for damaged ends. When you find some, trim that bit off.








This method also works best with dry or damp hair.
Once you've done an area, pin it up.

, As your parting it, twist or braid the hair to keep it in the small sections. You can also use small clips if you prefer.Small sections work best for this method, as it makes it easier to work with the hair.Try for about 1-inch by 1-inch sections, though if your hair is thinner, you can go a little bigger., With each section, undo the braid or clip. Comb it out, layering it between your fingers. Stretch it out until it's straight, and you have just the ends extending from your fingertips.Make sure not to use a brush, as that can frizz out the hair. Stick to a wide-toothed comb.

, ""Dusting"" refers to just taking off the damaged ends, while ""trimming"" is cutting off a bit more. Either one is fine. It just depends on the person's preference.With the hair between your fingers, cut off the ends sticking out. Go across in a straight line. The straight line can work here because it's only a very small section of hair., As you go, make sure you pin back the sections that you've already done. You don't want to do the same section twice.You can use bigger hair clips to pull back the hair that's already been trimmed.
You can re-braid or twist sections to keep them out of the way of your cutting., When you're done trimming, undo all the twists. Shake out the hair to make sure you have no major stray hairs sticking out. With curly hair, you won't have perfectly aligned hair, but trim away any obviously thick or long pieces.

, One way you can work on curly hair is having the person lean back. Pull the top layer of hair up into your hand, letting the edges hang out.You can also have the person flip forward instead.The point of this technique is to create instant light layers.

, With the hair in your hand, cut at an angle towards your hand, snipping off the ends. You're not going to get every hair. With curly hair, you don't always need to cut a straight line like you do with straight hair.One method you can use is to comb out a section. Use your fingers to hold the hair, moving out to the ends. Instead of cutting what's held between your fingers, cut on the other side of your hand. Cut at a downward angle, moving towards your fingers, being careful not to cut yourself. This technique helps to create texture., Where the hair looks bulky, pull out individual curls to cut. Cut inward at angle, just as you did when you flipped the hair.Basically, you're just going to keep pulling out curls to trim off the ends a bit until the hair doesn't look so bulky.

, Layers help to give shape to curly hair.Long layers often work well, with the shortest layer starting at chin length and the rest of the layers going down from there.However, you can also go for very short. Just make sure it's at least 2 inches all over the person's head. While you're cutting, shape the hair to follow the shape of the person's head.Others swear by short layers, with the top layer being 5 to 6 inches long. You have to find what works best for each hair type.The flipping technique helps to give natural layers to the hair, so if you're happy with that, you don't need to add any more layers.To add layers, work down through the hair, shortening from the top to the bottom.
However, you can also use clips to work on individual layers at time. Clip up most of the hair to work on the bottom layer. Pull some out for the next part, and work on that layer. Continue until you have as many layers as you want.

, Though the hair flipping helps give the hair layers, it doesn't take care of dead ends on the bottom layer. Go around the bottom, pulling out any hair you see with dead or split ends.Pull the hair through your fingers, and trim off the ends., Once you're done, do a final check. Look for any major stray hairs, and trim away anything that you see that doesn't belong. Make sure to look at the person straight on so you can see where there's a problem, and don't forget to check the back, too."

Evenly spread conditioner into your hair if it is less than 3 inches long.,
Apply conditioner on the midsection and ends of your hair if you have longer hair.,
Leave the conditioner in your hair for 10 minutes after your shower if you have longer hair.,
Rinse your hair with cool water if you have long hair.,
Use a leave in conditioner.",How to Wash Your Hair2," You can use a quarter sized amount of conditioner. You can leave it in for about 2 and a half minutes, and you can use this time to shave or finish showering. If you are using conditioner for normal hair, you can use it every day. 








Rinse your hair well with lukewarm water. If you are getting build up in your hair, it could be due to not rinsing your hair well enough after you condition.

, Rub a quarter sized dollop of conditioner between your hands. Do not worry about applying conditioner to the roots of your hair. Your hair has enough oil at the roots of your hair. 








Clip your hair up, and finish your shower. The longer your hair is being conditioned, the better it will absorb the conditioner. Keep a clip in your shower for repeated use.
You can also use a hair tie to put your hair up, but be careful not to put your hair up tight because you don’t want to damage the cuticles of your hair. Remember, your hair is at its most fragile when it is wet.
You can also use a shower cap to keep your conditioner from rinsing out while you are in the shower.

, If you want to get out of the shower quickly to conserve water or you have extra dry hair, this will give your hair the extra time it needs to absorb the oils in the conditioner. Keep your hair up in a clip or wrap your hair up in a towel to keep it out of your way.








, The cool water will shut the cuticles in your hair and keep the moisture and oils sealed in your hair. You hair will look shinier if you remember to do this step consistently during your shower routine.









Make sure to rinse all of the conditioner out of your hair. If there is still conditioner left in your hair the conditioner will leave your hair looking limp and oily.

, There are leave in conditioners marketed to men as well as women. Leave in conditioner will strengthen hair, and they will make your hair more flexible. After you have showered, apply leave in conditioner to damp hair.









Bed Head, Aveda, and Paul Mitchell have products for leave in conditioner for men.
Some men report that the leave in conditioner makes their hair more manageable if they shampoo every day. "

However, if you have problems with your scalp being too dry or too oily, buy shampoo for oily hair or dandruff shampoo. 







, It is called volumizing shampoo in the woman's section and a thickening shampoo in men's. This shampoo/conditioner will help give your hair more body.









Avoid creamy shampoos/conditioners that will make your hair more oily. You will want a gentle shampoo that you can use daily or every other day.If you have trouble with oily hair, you can apply dry shampoo to your hair between washes. Even guys can and should use dry shampoo, it will help your hair look fresh even when you haven't showered! Dry shampoo is also good because it will add texture and volume if you have fine hair.
You may not need to use conditioner if you have oily hair. Consider using a spray conditioner or a light conditioner with tea tree oil in it to absorb the oil in your hair., If you color or chemically treat your hair, look for wheat and soy extracts or silk amino acids in your shampoo! Men's hair care does not typically offer shampoo and conditioner for this hair type; however, there is no shame in buying woman's shampoo if you want to preserve your color. Look for color protection shampoos, or you can use a gentle baby shampoo that won’t strip your hair. 








Use your conditioner only on the ends of your hair if you have long hair. Your hair already has enough natural oils at the roots that you only need to apply the conditioner to the middle and end of your hair.
Avoid conditioners with silicon that strip hair. You want to preserve the color in your hair. Also do not wash your hair every day as it might strip your hair color as well.

, Good shampoos for coarse, curly hair contain wheat germ oil, macadamia or almond oil, or shea butter. Also you can use shampoos or conditioners with glycerin or silicon to keep your hair well hydrated.









You can also do hot oil treatments regularly to help tame your frizz. Use a deep moisturizing conditioner every time you wash.

, Coconut, argan, grapeseed and avocado oils are all great treatments for dry hair. Use an ultra moisturizing conditioner every time you wash your hair, as well. 








You can also use shampoo made for dry or color treated hair to tame your hair if you have frizzy, dry hair, because they do a great job of moisturizing your hair.

, This is the best method for combatting dandruff. Switch a shampoo with salicylic acid, one with pyrithione zinc, and one with selenium sulfide to effectively fight those pesky flecks. Also rotate in a regular shampoo occasionally, or a moisturizing shampoo if your hair is drying out from the dandruff shampoos. 








If your hair is still flecking, follow up your shampoo with an apple cider vinegar rinse to fight the yeast and bacteria. "

Determine face shape.,
Get detailed instructions for the particular cut you plan to make.,
Familiarize yourself with terminology.",How to Cut Hair2," A hairstyle should work with a person's face shape and complement his or her features.


Oval. An oval face shape is considered to be the one shape that can wear any type of style.
Round. A layered top that provides fullness and height and thinned out hair below the cheekbones all work to lengthen the look of the face and give the illusion of a narrower chin line.
Heart shape. Go for a style that offers more fullness lower on the face and less fullness at the forehead.
Square. The idea here is to soften the face so wispy bangs and wavy styles help to create this effect. It's best to avoid straight lines, straight bangs and straight or flat hair for this face shape.
Oblong. Avoid flat, long straight hair because this will make the face look even longer. Consider a bang, especially a side-swept bang to create the illusion of a shorter forehead for the person with this longer face shape.
Diamond. Choose a cut with lots of layers. Avoid bangs unless you go with a slightly off-center curtain bang., You don't want to ""wing it"" when it comes to creating a hairstyle. Learn as much as you can about how to do a specific type of cut before you attempt it.


Watch online videos. Check YouTube and websites dedicated to hair for videos that depict the steps involved in creating the hairstyle you've chosen. Be sure the person who is doing the demonstration is an experienced stylist.
Page through hair style magazines. Some magazines offer tutorials with photos that will show you how to do your cut.
Check out sites belonging to hair product companies. Companies that produce and/or sell hair products often include ""how-to's"" on their websites. Instagram and Pinterest are also great for inspiration.

, You need to understand some of the specialized terms stylists use when talking about cutting hair so that you can follow instructions more easily.Angle indicates the position of the scissors when cutting; you may be holding them vertically, horizontally, or at 45 degrees.
Elevation refers to which direction the hair is pointing when you're holding it to cut. When the ends point to the floor, that's considered to be zero degrees of elevation. When it's pointing to the side and parallel to the floor, it's at 90 degrees. When hair is held so that the ends point to the ceiling, it is at 180 degrees.
Razoring is a technique used to create wispy layers or to remove volume and thin the hair.
Layering means creating variable lengths of hair through an established cut. The longer layers give the illusion of length and the shorter layers create volume.
Graduation is a style of hair cutting where the hair is cut progressively shorter towards the back to create a curvy shape. A graduated bob is an example of this.

Separate the hair into sections.,
Follow the style instructions.,
Proceed slowly.,
Cross-check your cut.",How to Cut Hair3," Cosmetology courses teach sectioning techniques including four-section, five-section and seven-section parting. This may vary from state to state. To do seven-section parting, divide the scalp into seven sections: top, right side, left side, right crown, left crown, right nape and left nape. Leave a one-half inch band of hair to hang loose around the perimeter of the hairline.Start by making a clean parting line from the point just behind the ears on one side to the matching point on the opposite side. Next, make parting lines on each side of the head just along the parietal ridge to isolate the hair at the top of the head.
Comb the hair smooth toward the center of the section at the top of the head and twist it up into a knot and clip with a butterfly clip to secure it. Do the same on the right and left sides of the head.
Now, create a parting line down the center of the back of the head. Isolate the right and left crown sections by parting the hair in a line from behind the ears to the center parting just created.

These horizontal partings should meet to form a straight horizontal line across the back of the head.
Comb to smooth these sections and twist and secure them as with the previous sections.


The remaining two sections – the left and right nape – are easily secured into separate twists.
After the sections are secured, go back over the head, section by section, and let down a one-half inch strip along the outer edge (aka perimeter or hairline) and re-twist and secure the hair sections.

, In some cases, you will work from the back of the hair to the front; in others you'll start at the front; in still others you'll cut around the perimeter and proceed from there. Each style is different and requires a different plan of attack.

, Keep in mind that a typical salon appointment can be anywhere from a half-hour to an hour-and-a half in length. You're not a professional stylist, so it's going to take you longer to complete your cut. Don't rush it. An uneven style may have to be fixed by a professional and only time can fix a too-short ""do.""








, Take segments of hair from matching positions on each side of the head and bring them up to a central point. They should be even in length with one other. If not, your cut is uneven and you need to fix it.

Understand the purpose behind texturizing.,
Use point cutting.,
Learn about notching.,
Try freehand notching.,
Use slithering.,
Use slicing.,
Try the shears-over-comb technique.,
Cut with a razor.",How to Cut Hair4," Texturizing is thinning out the hair to remove excess bulk. Texturizing scissors, regular scissors and razors can all be used to remove hair.








, Point cutting is typically used on medium-length to longer hairstyles to soften the bluntness of the cut, add texture and interest or remove bulk. It is also good for texturing curly hair.









Comb and lift up a thin segment of hair; hair should be held between the fingers and perpendicular to the scalp.
Point your scissors inward towards the scalp and cut inward at a steep angle to make the ""points"" and create a textured edge.
The width and depth of your points will determine if the effect is subtle or more chunky.
Deep parallel point cutting uses the length of the blade to reduce weight, creating a “layered” look and feel without actually creating layers.

, Notching works the same as point cutting; the difference is that it's used on shorter, straight styles to create a wild or spiky look. This technique may be challenging at first, but it will become easier with time and practice.








, To use this technique, take your scissors and randomly snip away pieces hair to remove bulk and reduce volume. Freehand notching is done further up the hair shaft than notching, which focuses on the hair ends.








, This is a good choice if you want to remove bulk from the ends of long hair.









Hold the hair perpendicular to the scalp and keep your scissors slightly open.
Slide your cutting shears along the length of the hair away from the scalp.

, Slicing adds movement and texture by reducing the weight of the hair. This technique is performed once the haircut is complete and can be done on either wet or dry hair.









Hold your scissors open (cutting freehand) and slide them down the shaft of the hair, slowly opening and closing the blades as you go.
The more you open and close your scissors, the more hair you'll remove.

Warning: Be careful not to close your blades all the way or you will cut off a whole section of hair.



, This particular technique is often used for men's haircuts. It allows you to cut close to the head and create a softer look than you would get using clippers.









Starting at the hairline,lift a section of hair with your comb.
With the lower blade of your scissors parallel to your comb, cut off the hair that sticks past the comb.
Keep the blade of your scissors moving; stopping mid cut will create little nick marks.
Do most of the cutting with the center part of the blades rather than the tips, which can result in choppy, uneven cuts.
After you've cut the first section, lift some of the cut hair along with the next section you want to cut to act as your guide. Don't cut any of the hairs from your previous cut - they are just there to guide you. Work your way around the hair using this technique.

, A razor can be used to eliminate bulk. In some cases, razors are used in place of scissors to complete an entire haircut.









Part hair vertically down the middle and again horizontally about halfway down the back of the head. Pin up the top two halves and leave the bottom one free; this is your starting point.
Use a fine-toothed comb to pull up the hair at about a 45 degree angle and slide the razor (also held at a 45 degree angle) in short, choppy motions down the ends of the hair to the tips.
Work your way up through the back of the head, then along the sides. If the hair is short, it's ok to razor pieces at the top of the head as long as they're covered by more, unrazored hair.
Do not use razoring on fine, wavy or curly hair; you'll end up with hair that's droopy, frizzy or flyaway.

Comb through your hair to remove all the snags and snarls.Fill a spray bottle with warm water. As the hair dries, dampen it with the water from the spray bottle.

, Throughout the haircut, you will use 1 stationary guide to measure against every segment of hair. This will produce shaggy layers at varying lengths throughout your hair.


Section off a small segment of hair at the top of the head. Determine the length of the stationary guide—keep in mind that this will be your shortest layer.
Grasp the stationary guide between the middle and forefinger of your non-dominant hand . Slide the fingers towards the ends while pulling the segment straight up at a 180° angle. Stop your fingers when they have reached the desired length. Trim the excess hair with sharp shears.Instead of cutting off too much hair, start gradually. Trim off 1 to 2 inches of hair from the stationary guide and complete the entire hair cut. If the hair is still too long, take another 1 to 2 inches off of the stationary guide and re-cut your hair., Starting at the front of the head, insert a segment of hair surrounding the stationary guide and the stationary guide between your middle and forefinger. Slide your middle and forefinger towards the ends—pulling the hair at a 180° angle—until they reach the length of the stationary guide. Trim the excess hair. Repeat this process, working from to back down the center of the head., To produce even layers, alternate between cutting segments on the left side and the right side. Insert a segment of hair and the stationary guide between your middle and forefinger. Slide your middle and forefinger towards the ends—pulling the hair at a 180° angle—until they reach the length of the stationary guide. Trim the excess hair.Repeat until all of the hair is cut.

After the hair is washed, towel dry it to remove excess water, and then brush out any knots.Brush from the ends, and work your way up to the root to work out knots. This will prevent damage to the hair and will put less strain on the scalp.;
, For a quality haircut, you will need to be in a well lit area. The girl who is getting the haircut needs to be sitting down straight, preferably in a chair high enough so the stylist does not need to lean down.

, The hair should be combed straight back first, and then parted in the place it normally is. If the hair is worn with a middle part, do that. If the hair has a side part on the left or right side, do that. The hair will typically fall where it is trained to be.Check behind the ears for snarled or stuck hair. All of the hair needs to be combed straight down for a proper cut., The ideal scissors to use would be stylist scissors specifically designed for hair cuts. Dull scissors will not cut the hairs cleanly, and they might create split ends., This will serve as your guide as you make your way towards the sides and front. You will use the back piece as a reference as you are cutting around the sides to keep the trim even.Pull up the back section of hair, and bring the ends through your forefinger and middle finger. You should have about 1/2 inch to two inches sticking out from your fingers. Cut at a 45 degree angle to give the hair a softer, more natural look.The amount of hair you cut depends on how far up the damage goes, but typically it will be about 1/2 inch to two inches. Start by cutting less, and then go back to cut more if desired.
Have the person lean their head forward when cutting the back to help you perform a more even trim., Work your way from your guide piece to the side. When cutting the hair that lays on the shoulder, have the person slightly lean their head to the opposite side. This will bring the hair up to help you cut more evenly., Once you make it to the front of one side, go back to your guide piece in the back, and begin cutting the opposite side. Have the person lean their head to the opposite side you are cutting, and be sure to reference the guide piece the entire time., Once you are finished, come to the front, and bring the hair from both sides between your fingers. Pull them down and flat, and look to see if they are the same length. If one side or piece is longer, go ahead and trim it appropriately., Remember, as the hair dries, it will slightly shorten. If you notice any uneven pieces after the hair is dry, dampen the area, and even it out with scissors.

You can find good cutting shears online or at beauty supply stores. Using good quality shears will make it easier to cut your hair at home.You should look for cutting shears that have a stainless steel blade and a blade that is sharpened. Do not use kitchen shears, household scissors, or gardening shears as they could pull or damage your hair.;
, You can find hair clippers online or at a beauty supply store. Get hair clippers that are electric and good quality, as you are going to be using this tool to cut the bob.A hair razor will also be useful for cutting the bob as it will allow you to shape and trim your hair without having to do any major cutting. Make sure the hair razor is sharp as a dull razor will make it more difficult to use.

, You will also need a hair comb and three hair ties. You can find these products online or in the beauty aisle of your local drugstore. The hair comb is going to help you create even sections of your hair for the cut. The hair ties will keep sections of hair out of the way as you cut.

, If you are getting a friend to cut your hair into a bob, you should discuss the steps for the cut beforehand. You should also confirm the length and style you want for your hair before your friend starts cutting away.


During the cut, you should also communicate with your friend and confirm that they are doing what you want with your hair. You should let your friend know if the style is too long or if it needs to be tweaked so you end up with a bob you like.

, You will need to start with hair that is clean and dry. Use your usual shampoo and conditioner on your hair. Then, allow it to air dry or blow dry it. Having hair that is dry will ensure you do not cut your hair too short, as wet hair can end up drying shorter than it looks.Before you dry your wet hair, you may want to use the hair comb to find your natural part. Finding your natural part is important if you plan to part your hair to one side, rather than do a middle part.
You can find your natural part by running the comb over the front section of your hair so the hair falls to the back of your hair. Then, use your hand to gently push the hair forward. Your hair should fall toward your natural part.
You can also determine your natural part by noting which side of your head you usually part your hair on. You can then keep this in mind when you are cutting your hair so your hair parts as you like it.

, Use the comb to divide your hair into three even sections: one section at the back, and one section on either side of your head. Secure the three sections using hair ties.Make sure the back section sits just above the back of your neck. You will need to be able to gently slide the hair tie up and down your hair at the back so do not tie it too tightly.

, You may need to use a hand mirror to see the back ponytail if you are cutting your hair yourself. Move the back ponytail up or down against your neck, based on the length you would like the bob to be. If you want a shorter bob, move the ponytail further up. For a longer bob, move the ponytail further down. Most bobs are on the shorter side so you may opt for a shorter cut in the back.








Use the cutting shears to cut right underneath the back ponytail. You may need to cut across the top of the back ponytail slowly to ensure you get an even cut, especially if you have thicker hair.
For a more blunt look, you can use the hair clippers to trim any uneven hairs underneath the back ponytail. If you are using the hair clippers on your own hair, take care to hold the clippers steady as you trim off any uneven hairs. Try to get an even cut all the way across the back ponytail so the back section will appear straight and even.

, Release the back ponytail once you are done trimming it. Then, release the side ponytails. You should have a blunt, even cut in the back section and longer side sections. You will then take the hair razor and shape the side sections until they are the length you would like for the bob.If you are going for a more A-line look, you may keep the side sections a bit longer than the back section. Lift up small sections of hair and run the hair razor through the bottom of the hair in an angled, upward motion. This will help to trim and shape the hair so it is at an even angle to the back section of your hair.
For more of a straight bob look, use the hair razor to shape and trim the side sections so they are in line with the back section. Run the hair razor through the bottom part of your hair in an upward motion until it is trimmed to the length of the back section.

, If you would like to add volume to your bob, you may decide to add layers. This is ideal if you have thinner hair, as you may opt for layers so your hair has more body. If you have thicker hair, you may avoid layers so your hair does not appear too puffy or round.


To add layers, use the hair comb to comb out a section of hair on the side of your head, towards the back of your head. Hold the section of hair so the ends are facing upward and use the cutting shears to trim the ends, pointing the scissors down and in as you trim. Do not cut the hair straight across, as this will lead to jagged ends.
Continue to do this on the sides and back of your hair, cutting the ends of the hair with the scissors pointed down and in. This will create layers throughout your hair, giving your bob a more voluminous look.

, As a finishing touch, you should blend the ends of your hair so your bob looks even and polished. Blending the ends will also help to remove any stray pieces of hair that are too long.








Lift up small pieces of hair and run the hair razor on the ends of the hair in a downward, angled motion. This will help to taper the ends and make them appear more blended. Do this around your entire head so the ends are blended.

Put a towel over the boy’s shoulders.,
Choose the clipper number.,
Decide where you want to clip to.,
Start from the bottom of the hairline.,
Continue around the whole head.,
Take the number attachment off of the clippers.",How to Cut Boys' Hair1," As you cut, hair will fall onto his neck and shoulders. These stray hairs can be itchy and messy., Typically, the lower the number, the shorter the haircut. Each number clipper corresponds to the length of hair that will be left after you use the electric clippers. Look on the instructions to your clippers to determine which clipper extension corresponds to which hair length.If the boy has thin or fine hair, you probably do not want to use clippers. Toddlers, unless they have thick, dark hair, probably also should not get a haircut with electric clippers.
If the boy has thick hair or dark hair, clippers are probably a good choice for him.

, Many traditional boys’ haircuts are cut with clippers on the sides and then scissors on top. However, some haircuts use clippers on the entire head. This will be a more uniform look than clipping around the sides and scissoring on the top.


If you plan to use scissors on the top, choose the place where you want to stop clipping. Pick a point where you want the clipper cut to transition into a scissor cut. Right above the occipital bone is a common place.Be consistent about how high on the head you want to stop clipping.
Mark the place where you will stop using the clippers with a washable marker, or just be careful to go to the same height every time.

, Place the clippers at a ninety degree angle from the boy’s head. Clip from the base of the neck straight up. You always cut from the bottom up., Make sure that you’re using smooth, even cuts and are not missing any little strips along the way. Start from the bottom of the head and move upwards, still holding the clippers at a 90 degree angle.

, You can now use the attachment-less clippers to “clean up” the area around the boy’s hair. You can use the clippers now on the stray hairs on his neck and around his ears and sideburns."

",How to Cut Children's Hair,";
, Have your child seated in a chair that is high enough for you to work at eye level, but without a high back that will get in the way of your cutting. Don't sit them in front of the television or computer. You will need for them to keep their head down some of the time and the temptation to look up is too tempting. Instead, position them in front of a mirror if possible. It will help you keep a visual reference to other areas you have already cut and gives small children something to shoot at with the water sprayer or water gun. Choose a well lit area, but I don't recommend working in bright sunlight as the hair will dry out too quickly.

,, If the hair is overly dirty or coated with gel, hairspray or cookies (they are kids, right), shampoo and condition the hair.

,, You can skip this step if you are working with very short hair.

, Try not to stretch the hair while cutting. If possible, cut the hair lying against the skin without holding it as this is the best way to prevent cutting cowlicks too short and creating uneven lines.

, Remember that the visual evenness and balance are more important than holding the hair and searching for small technical deviations.

, Be careful not to cut into your guideline.

, Layering is simply a way of blending from one area of the perimeter outline to the other by elevating the hair up and away from the scalp and cutting away bulk and volume. This is a very simplified explanation and it's worth your while to refer to a book or article with more detailed information.

, Proceed with caution, especially on curly hair.

Sweep up hair.,
Dry the hair.,
Do final trimming.",How to Cut Hair5," Before you begin blow drying, it is a good idea to sweep the hair off the floor first. This will prevent the hair from blowing everywhere., You can't see how a haircut really looks until it's dry and styled. Once the hair is dry, you can see and trim any uneven ends or shorten the length of the bangs or the overall style.









If possible, let the hair dry about 70-80% of the way on its own.
Put your dryer on the coolest setting keeping the dryer about 6-inches away from hair at all times and moving it around continuously.
Despite the bad rep blow drying hair gets, one study found that using a hair-dryer at the right distance and temperature can actually cause less damage than letting hair air-dry. Water causes hair to swell. The longer the hair stays wet and swollen, the more pressure it puts on the delicate proteins keeping hair intact, which can lead to more damage., Cross-check the hair again and fix any unevenness. This is also the time to trim any too-long bangs or remove any extra fullness.

, Pull all of your hair, except for the bottom-most layer, up into a high ponytail. Tie it off, preferably with a scrunchie and not a hair tie. A hair tie is more likely to leave dents in your hair.You can also pile your hair loosely on top of your head and secure it with a claw clip., Choose a curling rod with the narrowest diameter possible. If you can, try to find one that is labeled for corkscrew curls. It should be thinner than your finger., Make sure that you are grabbing a section that is closest to your face. It can be on the right or left side. If you have thick hair, grab a slightly thicker sections; if the section is too thin, your curls may end up frizzy., Don't overlap the hair as you wind it around the rod. Instead, wrap it down the entire length of the rod, like stripes on a candy cane. The rod will get very hot, so be careful not to touch it with your fingers or scalp.If you are worried about burning yourself, consider wearing a pair of protective gloves meant for curling hair.

, Carefully unwind your hair from around the rod. Once your hair is loose enough, slip the rod out, and let the curl hang down naturally., Grab another section right next to the first one that you just curled. Wrap the hair around the rod, wait a few seconds, then unwind it. You can wrap it in the same direction as before, or you can wrap it in the opposite direction for more movement., Once you have finished curling the entire bottom layer of your hair, undo your high ponytail, and let down another layer of hair. Pull the rest of your hair back up into a high ponytail.

The thicker your hair is, the more layers you will need to work in.

, You can continue wrapping the sections of hair around the rod in the same direction, or you can alternate them. If you alternate them, your curls will look more natural and voluminous.

Keep the strands horizontal to your scalp, not vertical.

, This will help make them look more natural. Do not brush or comb your hair, or the curls will turn too fluffy and lose their corkscrew shape.For a more vintage look, part your hair off to the side. Use the handle of a rat-tail comb to create a neat part.

Decide on the length you want your hair to be before it is pinned up., The layers on each side should be the same length, and to help do this, it is important to divide each side into symmetrical sections. The trick is to pull away from the places you want layers by combing each section at an angle down towards the face from the back. Here are the sections you will pin:Pin together the ""top box"" section. Use a comb to make a part on the top left and right side. Use the end of the eyebrows as a guide for how far over the part should be. Divide this section in half. One part will be from the crown of the head to the forehead, and the second part will be from the crown of the head and reach to the middle back section of your head. This hair will be combed forward and be section off in the front. The back of the hair from the middle down will not be layered. It can be left loose or pinned back.Divide the right and left front sections. These sections will start at the temples and end at the ear. Start with the comb at the back of the head, and angle down towards the bottom of the ear., When you cut or trim hair, you will angle the scissors up and at a 45 degree angle, and use the tip of the scissors to cut small pieces at a time. This will create uneven edges that will give the hair a more natural look.As you are cutting, you want to avoid bringing the scissors straight across the bottom. Instead, slightly pull the scissors away after each cut before cutting the next piece.

, Take out the clip from the top front section. Make sure the hair is still damp and completely combed out. Lift the hair so that it is angled between your forefinger and middle finger about 90 degrees from the head. It is important to cut the hair at an angle so it falls more naturally. Slide your fingers toward the ends until they reach the length you want the layer to end. You will cut the hair that is sticking out from your fingers.Cut a little longer than you want the layers to be to allow room for error. Keep in mind that hair shrinks when it dries.Common layers are cut right below the earlobe, or just above the jawline to help frame the face.

, Next, take out the clip from the left section of hair. Brush through the hair, and run your fingers through the section at a 90 degree angle from the head. Hold the hair straight between your forefinger and middle finger, down to the side of the face where you want the layer to end. Trim the length of hair extending from your fingers. Remember to trim at an angle to create a more natural look., Next, take out the clip from the right section of hair. Brush through the hair, and run your fingers through the section at a 90 degree angle from the head. Bring your fingers down to the side of the face where you want the layer to end. Make sure it is even with the side you just cut. Use one hand to pull the layer that was just cut down so you can match up the two sides. When you are ready, cut the hair extending from your fingers., When you are finished with each section, check the length of the layers. Line them up on both sides to see if they are symmetrical. If one side or piece is shorter than the other side, go back and trim it shorter. When you make adjustments, take off small amounts at a time so you don't end up making the hair shorter than desired., Use a round brush as you blow dry to bring out the layers. Twist the brush inward as it dries to bring the shorter layers in with the longer layers. If you notice an area that needs to be cut shorter, remember to get all of the hair damp again before you cut it. If you only dampen one side, you will not be able to properly match up each side because the wet hair will appear longer than it will be once it dries.

Check for symmetry.,
Sweep away cut hair.",How to Cut a Girl's Hair3," Whether you are trimming bangs, or creating bangs for the first time, the front section of hair should be dry and combed out before cutting. Use a comb to section off only the area you wish to cut, and put the rest in a ponytail or clipped out of the way.A common problem when cutting bangs is cutting them too short. This is why bangs are best cut when hair is dry.Cut the bangs longer than you ultimately want them. This way, you can figure out the shape you want, and go back to make adjustments.

, Bangs are not cut straight across. Instead, they curve down towards the temples to help create a frame for the face. However, it depends on the look your are going for., If you are simply trimming bangs, you will bring the comb through underneath the bangs where you want them to end. If you are making new bangs, use the comb to section off the hair you want to cut. Depending on how thick the hair is, bangs usually start right in front of the middle of the crown and angle downward on both sides towards the temples. You can play around with the look you prefer., Hold the scissors vertically at a 45 degree angle, and make a small cut directly below the comb in the center. Work your way toward one side. By starting in the middle, you will have more control over how short the bangs end up. Angle the scissors down when working your way to the edge to create a gradual curve. Once you have one side finished, bring the scissors back to the middle, and cut the other side., Use your finger tips to pull down on the hair between your forefinger and middle finger. See if the bangs are the same length on each side. If they are not even, carefully trim the side that is longer. Cut tiny amounts at a time so you do not accidentally cut the longer side shorter, which may result in bangs that are shorter than you want., Use a makeup brush or blow dryer to get rid of those tiny trims. If the bangs do end up shorter than you were going for, do not worry. Hair grows at a rate of 1/2"" per month on average, and that makes a big difference when it comes to bangs."

Cut the hair straight across, parallel to your fingers.,
Pull back the section of hair right behind the front.,
Cut around the ears.",How to Cut Boys' Hair2," You should start with a small amount. You can always take off more if you still think it’s too long.


A good amount to start with, unless the boy has really long hair, is probably about an 1/8th of an inch. When using scissors you should go slowly and not cut off too much too fast.
Make sure that the hair is dry when you cut it. Cutting wet hair is more challenging, and cutting with dry hair will ensure that you know exactly what it will look like while you’re cutting it.

, This cut determines how long you want the rest of the hair to be. Comb the front most part of the boy’s hair back, about enough to hold between two fingers, with the comb and then transfer the hair to between the index and middle fingers of your nondominant hand.

, Try to make the cut even, but you can always go back later and trim unruly hairs. This should leave the front-most section of the boy’s hair a little bit shorter than the rest.

, Include a little bit of the guide cut to show you how much hair to cut. Continue this process, working back towards the back of the head. Always include a little bit of the cut you just did to guide you.You should be able to make your way all the way to the back of the head with this process.


If you are cutting with scissors on the sides, too, use this same method. Start from the front and move backwards, using your guide cut. However, if you would rather make your guide cut in the back, you can also start in the back and gradually move to the front.Always grab a little bit of the cut you just did in your new cut so that you know how much you should cut off.

, Fold the right ear down (or have him hold it down for you) as you cut around the ear, as if you were tracing it. Repeat on the left side. This is an alternative to using the clippers.

On the boy’s haircut right now, there should be the clipper cut on the bottom and the scissor cut on the top. There will be a line where the clipper cut ends and the scissor cut begins. The middle of your comb should be at this line.

, Transfer the hair from the comb to between your nondominant middle and index fingers. Pull the hair out to where the longest hair is about even with your finger., Extra hair is hair that is beyond your fingers.

Use a brush or comb to help distribute the product and to remove any knots or tangles.This method will work the best on natural or kinky hair, but other hair types can also attempt it.

, This is not absolutely necessary, but it will help make your hair more manageable. You can apply the rollers randomly, or your can apply them in rows. If you will be applying the rollers in neat rows, then gather all of your hair, except for the bottom-most layer, into a bun., Gather the section from the bottom layer of your hair, close to your face. It should be 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) wide., Apply a small amount of holding gel to the strand. Run a comb through the strand while pulling it taut., Wrap the end of your hair around the bottom of the curler a few times to secure it. Next, wind your hair around the curler in a spiral (like a candy cane) all the way to your scalp.Use a hair roller specifically designed for corkscrew curls. If you can't find any, use one with the narrowest diameter possible--about the thickness of a pencil.

, Most hair rollers come with a clip or clasp of some sort. Simply close the clasp over the roller and lock it in place. If yours didn't come with any, you could try securing it with a bobby pin., Work in thin, even sections, one row at a time. Start from the bottom and work your way to the top., Your hair must be completely dry before you move onto the next step, otherwise the curls will come out.If you are in a hurry, you could sit under a hooded dryer for about 20 minutes., Pull off the clasp first, then carefully unwind the roller in the opposite direction you wrapped your hair in. Remove all of the rollers on the bottom layer first, then work your way towards the top of your head., You don't have to do this, but you can if you want to. Twisting the curl in the opposite direction will help fluff it up without creating frizz or distorting its shape. Do not brush or come through the curls, however, or you will get frizz., You do not really need hairspray to set the style, but you can apply a little hair oil to help add moisture and shine. You can make the curls last longer by wrapping a silk scarf around your head when going to sleep."

Do an easy half-up style.,
Try a single side braid.,
Try adding volume to the crown of the head.,
Go for a volumized updo.,
Add scarves, bandanas, and other accessories.",How to Create Cute Hairstyles for Long Thick Hair1," Separate just the top section of your hair and pull it back to secure it at the back of your head, leaving the rest of your voluminous locks to lay loose.Pull back the top of your hair, or small sections from each side, starting at about the level of the tops of your ears. You can use just your fingers, or a comb or pick for straighter sectioning.
Secure the top section of your hair into a small ponytail with a hairband, use a clip, or twist it into a small bun at the back of your head.;
, Use your length and thickness to your advantage to create a loose braid that falls over one shoulder.


Create a typical three-strand braid by sectioning the hair into three pieces. Cross the piece on the right over to the middle so that the middle piece becomes the new right-side piece. Then cross the left piece over to the middle in the same way. Continue in this way, alternating left and right, to the ends of the hair.
Smaller braids can also be done throughout the hair, or go for a full head of braids that will still remain full-looking because of your thick texture.
Experiment with other types of braids in your hair, like French braiding, fishtail, or cornrows., Blow dry and tease hair to create volume at the top of the head for a cute retro look that will also keep hair from looking too weighted down.


Start by blow drying or just brushing back a section of your hair from the very top of your head. Then use a fine rattail comb to tease the section by combing in the opposite direction, toward the roots.
Those with kinky or very curly hair can skip straight to teasing, or simply brush or comb out sections normally to create volume.
Those with straighter thick hair can keep a section toward the front of the crown unteased, then lay that section back over the teased area to create a sleeker look., Pull hair up into a dramatic bun, chignon, or ponytail to create a look that can be both casual and formal.


Create a bun by securing your hair into a ponytail with an elastic, then twist and wrap the length of the hair around the elastic to create a spiral shape and secure with pins. You can also use accessories like a hair donut or even a sock to make sleek rolled buns, or leave it intentionally messy for a casual look.Gently roll your hair as you would with a bun and pin it low on your head for a classic chignon. Tease a section at the crown of the head to show off some more of your impressive volume.Try a sleek ponytail by securing your hair with an elastic high at the crown of your head. Wrap a piece of hair around the elastic and place pins underneath the ponytail to create extra polish and volume., Break up your thick hair beautifully with a colorful or patterned head scarf, a bandana, or fun bow or flower clip.


Try items like hair sticks and bun pins to easily add some interest to thick hair with accessories that can handle even the thickest mane.Wrap a scarf, headband, or folded bandana around your head and knot it at the top for a classic look that also keeps your hair in check when it’s up or down. You can also try using a wrap around a bun if it won’t span the circumference of your entire head.

Get layers.,
Remember to get your hair trimmed regularly.,
Try bangs.,
Go for ombre color or highlights.",How to Create Cute Hairstyles for Long Thick Hair2," Ask for a layered haircut at your next salon appointment to achieve less bulk or greater definition of your curls or waves.


Get layers to frame your face and allow the back of your hair to taper gently. Layers can accentuate volume in long and straight or gently wavy hair.
In naturally coarse, kinky, or curly hair, go for layers to reduce bulk or create overall shape. A long layered look can also complement a narrow face shape.If you’re looking to thin out your thick hair, ask a stylist if they can use thinning shears instead of the typical scissors for your haircut., Trim your hair regularly, even if you want it to remain long or keep growing, as this is key to hair health.


Tight, coarse curls and longer styles of any kind should typically get a trim every 12 weeks (3 months). Trim more often if your hairstyle has a lot of layers that you want to keep in place, or you have a lot of damage from heat treatments, chemical relaxers, or other products.Ask for just a quarter of an inch to be taken off each time you get a trim if you are trying to preserve length and grow out your hair further. Or, make sure a stylist takes off enough to remove split ends or other damage each time.

, Go for blunt, straight bangs or a sideswept style for a great contrast to the length of the rest of your hair.


Thick hair is suited very well to cutting bangs, which will appear fuller and more dimensional. Bangs can also help to reduce the bulk of hair overall.
You can get bangs even without naturally or artificially straight hair. Complement an afro or ringlets with a short fringe at your forehead, or allow side swept wavy bangs to transition into your layered curls.
Remember that bangs typically need to be trimmed more often to maintain their shape and length.

, Add some color at the ends or throughout your hair to create dimensionality and lighten up a heavier style.


Ask for ombre hair color at your next appointment with a hair colorist. The ombre technique uses one or more lighter shades at the ends of your hair, which can help balance length and thickness by making the ends look less heavy.When highlighting hair, make sure to use or ask for color that is only one or two shades lighter than your own, and combine several shades for a more natural and dimensional look."
"
Show off length with straight styles.,
Add volume with teasing and styling.,
Try hair extensions.",How to Create Cute Hairstyles for Long Thick Hair3," Straighten your hair with a straightening iron for a temporary look or with a chemical relaxer for a longer-term treatment. Make your hair look even longer than it does usually with this sleek look, especially if you have very curly or kinky hair.


Make even a curly or wavy ponytail appear longer by creating two ponytails, one right underneath the other at the back of your head for an illusion of extra length.Quickly accentuate the length of hair by creating a straight center part, which instantly appears to narrow and lengthen a hairstyle., Accentuate the volume you already have or create the illusion of more by teasing sections of your hair or parting it on one side.


Try out products meant for volumizing, or tools like curlers or blow dryers, but use them with caution and sparingly, as heat and products will have cumulative negative effects on your hair over time.
Wear your hair up overnight and/or while wet to achieve greater volume when you let it down.Switch up your part from where you normally wear it to get more volume from the roots., Go for extensions in the closest possible shade to your own to add both volume and length to your hair.


Find clip-in, tape, or weave varieties of extensions, depending on how you’ll use them and how permanent they will be.
Try gently teasing the hair above where you apply extensions to help hide them. Also avoid sleeping with wet hair to prevent tangling."

You can achieve this look with a crimping iron with small, narrow plates., This makes it easier to use the waver or crimping iron. Divide your hair in half, and then section and style off one half before the other. Place your hair into small sections that are around one inch (25 mm) each., Use the heat tool on the bottom, back sections first.

Make a deep treatment with eggs.,

Make a deep treatment with oil.,
Use beer in a deep treatment.,
Use avocado in a deep treatment.",How to Get Rid of Dry Hair and Dry Scalp1," Deep treatments are like conditioners on steroids: They help provide a ton of moisture, vibrancy, and body to dry hair. Eggs are high in protein, which is what hair is made out of, so it's only natural that eggs would be an excellent source for deep treatments.


In a bowl, mix two eggs yolks, two teaspoons olive oil, and 1/8 cup of water. Mix until the solution is fully balanced. Depending on how much hair you have, you may want to use more or less.
Apply mixture to hair after shampooing, while hair is still damp, not wet. Let stand for 15 minutes.
Rinse with warm water. (Hot water may give you scrambled eggs!);
, Mayonnaise is made essentially out of eggs and oil, so it's a riff on the deep treatment featured in Step 1. What sets mayonnaise apart is that it contains vinegar. Vinegar will help disinfect any fungus or bacteria that might be using your scalp as a temporary home, causing itching and dryness.


Apply 1/2 cup of mayonnaise to already dry hair. Massage into roots and scalp area and cover with a shower cap or other plastic cover.
Let stand for 15 minutes.
Rinse thoroughly in warm water before shampooing as usual.

, Many people get hot oil treatments at salons and swear by their effectiveness. For this deep treatment, try to seek out virgin coconut oil, although olive oil will also work well.


In a saucepan, warm up oil until it is warm but not too hot to touch. You are going to be applying the oil to your scalp, so keep that in mind.
Take oil off the heat and let cool for 30 seconds just to be sure. Apply to hair in sections, using hair clips if necessary. If you're worried about excessive oiliness, don't rub the oil too much into your scalp.
Wrap your hair in a shower cap or other plastic cover and let stand for at least 30 minutes.
Rinse with warm water briefly and shampoo until oil is no longer pervasive, but not stripped from hair.

, With eggs and oil, beer is a great natural conditioner. It may sound weird, but if you think about it, it's not any weirder than slathering mayonnaise in your hair. Use nicer, full-bodied beer for a better deep treatment. Stay away from conditioning with Coors Light.


Rinse out with shampoo with warm water and condition with beer. Substitute your conditioner for beer and use exactly as you would after shampooing.
Mix two cups beer with two tablespoons apple cider vinegar and apply it to hair after shampooing. Again, use in the same way you would a conditioner.
Mix an eight-ounce bottle of nice, dark beer with a few drops of jojoba oil. Apply to dry hair, let stand for at least 15 minutes, and rinse in warm water, followed by shampoo.

, Avocados are rich in vitamins, minerals, and natural oils, so they round out the last of the deep treatments. People who use avocado as a deep treatment can expect to find their hair soft, glossy, and moisturized after conditioning.


In a blender, food processor, or by hand, mix one ripe avocado, 2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil, and one teaspoon of honey.
Apply to dry hair, mixing into the scalp, and cover with a shower cap for approximately 30 minutes.
Wash in warm water thoroughly. (Avocado is naturally fibrous, so it might take longer than simple oil, egg, or beer deep treatments). Shampoo lightly afterward.

Wash your hair less often.,
Use less shampoo.,
Let it air dry as often as possible.,
Don't use damaging styling techniques.,
Stay away from damaging treatments.",How to Get Rid of Dry Hair1," Many people make the mistake of washing their hair every day. This practice strips your hair of healthy oils that protect it from drying out. While washing your hair is obviously necessary to keep it looking healthy and fresh, see if you can scale back to washing it just once or twice a week. In a few weeks' time, your hair will look and feel less dry and brittle.If you're used to washing your hair more often, it might take a few weeks for your scalp to adjust. For the first few weeks, your scalp might continue overproducing oil. If you can wait it out, you'll find that your body will eventually grow used to your new routine and produce less oil between washes.
To perk up your hair between washes, try using dry shampoo. It's a simple mixture of powder (such as cornstarch or baby powder) and essential oils. While dry shampoo doesn't clean your hair, it does absorb oil and add a pleasant scent that gives your hair the appearance of being freshly washed.;
, Do you tend to use gobs of shampoo in an effort to get your hair clean? It's really not necessary to use more than a dime or quarter-sized amount, depending on your hair length. Extra shampoo can be hard on your hair by washing away the protective oils that keep your hair soft and shiny, rather than dry.A good rule of thumb to follow is that if your hair ends up ""squeaky clean,"" you've used too much shampoo. When your hair dries, it will feel drier than it should.
To avoid using too much shampoo, wet your hair completely before applying shampoo. Rub the shampoo between your palms and work it into your hair from the roots to the tips.

, Using a hair dryer causes your hair to get dry, brittle and frayed. It leads to more split ends and dull-looking hair if you do it too often. Even though you might be tempted to dry your hair with a hair dryer, try giving it a break and letting it air dry at least five days out of the week. If you can go longer without using a hair dryer, even better.When you do use a hair dryer, use a low, warm or cool setting instead of a high, hot setting.
To air dry your hair, pat it dry gently with a towel. Don't roughly rub it dry, or you'll end up with frizz. Comb it out using a wide-toothed comb and apply hair oil or styling cream if desired.

, Put away your curling iron, straightening iron, and any other tools you use to apply heat to your hair. Regularly styling your hair using heating tools causes dryness, breakage, and split ends. Embrace your hair's natural texture instead of taming it with tools.If you want to curl or straighten your hair for a special occasion, be sure to use a heat protectant product on your hair first. Never apply direct heat to unprotected hair.
Try using styling techniques that don't involve heat. For example, you can create beautiful curls using pins or a cut up t-shirt.

, Dyeing, bleaching, and chemically straightening or perming your hair will dry it out. Once your hair has been damaged by a treatment, it's difficult to restore it to life. In most cases you'll have to care for it the best you can until your hair has time to grow back healthy and strong.If you love dyeing your hair, try a henna treatment. Henna dye is a natural alternative to chemical dye. It won't dry out or damage your hair.
If you want to lighten your hair in color, try using honey or chamomile treatments. Do not use lemon juice to lighten your hair, since this can dry it out.
Tight weaves, braids and extensions can also be damaging to hair.

Shampoo a few times a week.,
Use conditioner.,
Avoid towel drying your hair.,
Brush your hair with your fingers.","How to Get Rid of Bushy, Wavy Hair1"," Instead of washing your hair every day, try shampooing every two or three days. Shampooing too often removes the natural oils in your hair and leads to frizz.Try switching shampoos. Look for something with glycerin near the top of the ingredient list. Glycerin protects the hair and moisturizes it from the inside out, both of which can fight frizz.Look for a shampoo that is sulfate free. Sulfates are foaming agents used in a lot of shampoos. While sulfates are not necessarily bad for your hair, some people find them harsh. You might find that a milder shampoo helps keep the frizz down.If you can't bear the thought of dirty hair after a few days without washing, try using a dry shampoo.;
, Each time you wash be sure to apply conditioner. Conditioner protects your hair, keeping it from pulling moisture from the air. For the best results leave it in for at least 5 minutes.Search for a conditioner that has glycerin and other hydrating ingredients in it. Shea butter is common, as is coconut oil.Some conditioners have protein in them, which help tame frizz and add to your hair's shine.On the days you don't shampoo, give your hair a conditioner bath. Conditioners can clean your hair without stripping any natural oils., Roughly towel drying your hair can keep your hair from lying flat, contributing to frizz. Try pressing your hair dry with a microfiber towel.








After pressing the water out of your hair, wrap your hair in a towel. Lean over and let your curls fall into a towel. Wrap the towel around your hair and then pull it up as if it were a turban. Leave your hair like this for at least 20 minutes to add some shape to your curls and keep your hair from frizzing., You may find it better to separate tangles and knots in your hair with your fingers than with a brush. Brushes tend to break your hair and that leads to frizz.








After your shower, add a little conditioner to your fingers as you work your hair.Don't use a comb or styling brush on dry hair. If you need to tend to your hair when it's dry, just wet your hands and start finger-combing."

Use hair-care products to keep your frizz at bay.,
Make sure you are using sulfate-free shampoo and silicone-free conditioner.Sulfates are harsh detergents that strip your hair of the natural oils that help keep it moisturized.One of these oils is sebum, an oil your scalp produces to keep hair moisturized and help hair grow.,
Consider using shampoo made specifically for curly hair.,
Use an after-shower hair product that states it is made specifically for frizzy hair.,
Oil your hair!,
Add two teaspoons of ground mustard seeds to two tablespoons of milk.,
Consider using a flat iron.,
Change out your cotton pillowcase for a satin or silk case.,
Eat a healthy diet with healthy oils and nuts.,
Trim your split ends, or get them trimmed.,
Don't shampoo your hair every day.,
Keep your hair properly moisturized with a deep conditioner.,
Don't touch your hair more than required.,
When washing your hair, never use your nails to scratch the scalp.,
Let your hair air-dry.",How to Fix Frizzy Hair," There are many brands of conditioner, hair spray, shine spray, and heat protector that are designed to prevent your hair from frizzing. It also helps to try hair care products (shampoo, conditioner) that are as natural as possible and don't contain things like sulfates or mineral oil. Some of these products will only de-frizz your hair temporarily, but others will have gradual, permanent ant-frizz effects if you use them over time.


There are products like sprays or gels that you use while your hair is dry and after you have styled it. These types of products are temporary, and will not have any permanent effects on your hair.
The other type of hair product you can use are shampoos and conditioners/deep treatments. These products are applied to wet hair and will have permanent effects and great results on your hair. It won't happen all at once, but the results will be worth the wait.;
, Silicone is an artificial material added to many conditioners; it is added in an attempt to keep the hair moisturized by creating a shaft over the hair and protecting it from the air and heat around it. However, it also keeps out helpful oils and therefore creates frizzy hair.Don't worry if you put your sulfate-free shampoo in your hair and it doesn't foam or bubble up. This is because sulfates are what make your shampoo foam up when you apply it to your hair. However, if you scrub at your scalp with the shampoo, then run the shampoo through the rest of your hair (don't bundle it all up on top of your head), it will still clean your hair.
If you color your hair, use a product without ammonia. Ammonia damages your hair, and damaged hair is more likely to frizz.
Avoid any hair products that contain alcohol or citric acid, as these will only dry out your hair more.

, If you have extra frizzy hair and the sulfate- and silicone-free shampoos products aren't working for you, try using a shampoo and conditioner meant for people with curly hair. More than people with wavy or straight hair, people with curly hair are prone to extremely frizzy hair. Because of this, curly-hair shampoos and conditioners usually include more natural oils and frizz-fighting materials than regular shampoos.

, These are usually ""leave-in"" products that you don't rinse out of your hair. You will use some leave-in products while your hair is still damp, and others after your hair is dry. If you don't have a leave-in product on hand, you can use regular hand lotion on dry hair. Rub the hand lotion into your hands as usual, then run your hands over your hair while they are still slightly damp from the lotion. This should smooth down the frizzy areas.


This can be done several times, if needed, but always remember to rub the lotion into your hands until slightly damp first, and then run through your hair. Never have lotion in your hands that you can visibly see.
If you run hand lotion through your hair without rubbing it into your hands first, or overdo the process, you will have oily-looking hair. Getting it right may take some practice.

, Spread oils thoroughly onto your roots and tips for a gradual de-frizzing effect. Start by using a dime size amount on damp hair, from about the ear lobe down to the ends. Keeping oil off of your roots and scalp will prevent your hair from getting greasy. Oils that are good for de-frizzing include almond oil, argan oil, keratin oil, coconut oil, macadamia oil, olive oil, and Moroccan oil.


You can use oils as a hair treatment by thoroughly working the oil into your scalp and through the hair shaft, letting it soak over night and washing your hair in the morning.
You can also purchase products that have these oils in them.

, Apply this solution thickly onto your hair, concentrating on the frizzy strands. Leave the mixture in your hair for 15-20 minutes, then wash it out.

, It will definitely remove the frizzy factor, but keep in mind that flat iron use can cause damage your hair over time. The lower the heat setting that you use, the better it is for your hair.


Don't pull your hair when using the flat iron.
Find a product that is made especially for spraying on the hair to help protect it from the heat from the flat iron.

, This will allow your hair to slip and slide on the pillow while you sleep, which may reduce frizz. Consider sleeping in a silk scarf if your hair is super textured. To keep your cotton pillowcase from sucking up all the moisture in your hair, wrap it up at night in a bun, and then tie on a silk scarf, which will help retain moisture.

, Oils might include olive oil and coconut oil. Nuts might include cashews and almonds. The healthier you eat, the healthier your hair will be. You can find special vitamins that are designed especially for your hair. Take advantage of these products, but ask a doctor first before taking anything—even vitamins. These vitamins make your hair stronger, and stronger hair has less breakage. Less breakage means less frizz.

, When you don't cut your hair for a while, the ends can split. Over time, they continue to split all the way up the hair shaft, making your hair look gradually frizzier.

, Shampooing your hair every day can strip it of oils it needs to be smooth and healthy. The natural oils that accumulate are good frizz fighters. Instead, use shampoo once a week, and use conditioner whenever you wet your hair. If your hair feels uncomfortably oily, use a dry shampoo between washes.


Shampoo hair once or twice in a week, maximum, thrice.

, This is a key part of preventing frizz. To keep your hair properly moisturized, try using a deep conditioner that you can let sit on your hair for an extended period of time. Unless your hair is extremely fine, use a deep conditioner each time you wash, and be sure to leave it on for 15 to 30 minutes. Frizz happens when dry, porous hair sucks up moisture in the air, causing the shaft to swell. This heavy dose of conditioner coats the hair shaft, making it harder for moisture to sink in.

, If you have curly hair or plan on wearing your hair in a curly style (twist out, braid out, bantu knot out, etc.) try to avoid touching it while it's wet to prevent frizz. It also helps to seal your twists or braids with a natural oil such as coconut oil or olive oil. Everything like hair ties and head bands, can also pull and rip hair, causing more damage to the hair, and adding more frizziness. So be careful when choosing and using hair accessories.

, This tears up your roots, causing damage to the hair, which then can cause breakage or frizziness. Always use your fingertips to massage your scalp while washing hair.

, Avoid blow-drying your hair or wrapping in a towel. It's best to use a wide-tooth hair pick on wet hair to pick out any hair knots first, if needed, instead of using a brush or a fine-toothed comb, because this keeps the hair from breaking or frizzing. After it is completely dry then you may brush or comb your hair gently. Any pulling of the hair will cause it to frizz.


Don't wrap your hair up in a towel. Wrapping and twisting your hair to keep it up will cause the hair to frizz. Try just laying the towel over your head any way you like, standing straight or bent over, and gently patting your hair dry. Never rub quickly to towel-dry, because it causes your hair to frizz.
Regular towels can create friction and unnecessary frizz. Instead try using either a microfiber towel or a 100% cotton t-shirt.
Don't blow dry your hair. If you blow dry your hair every time you wash—or just too often—it may be suffering from heat damage. If you must blow-dry: let your hair dry 90 percent of the way before you blow-dry. Too much hot air focused directly on your strands dehydrates it, making it frizzy — especially during the winter months when the air is less humid.

Decide whether to use your shower or sink.,
Turn on warm water in your shower/sink.,
Wash your hair with shampoo.,
Use conditioner in your hair as well.,
Dry your hair with a towel.,
Run your fingers through your hair.,
Repeat, repeat, repeat.",How to Get Candle Wax out of Hair1," If the candle wax has only reached the tips of your hair, you can use a shower. If the candle wax has sunk in towards your roots, it is best to use a sink. A sink allows you to be more up close and personal with the wax you wish to remove.To determine this, run your fingers through your hair. Start at the roots, and then move outwards towards the tips. Feel whether the wax has drifted downwards, or has stayed mostly near the edge.
While running your fingers through your hair, stand in front of a mirror. This can make it easier for you to see if you have a hard time feeling the wax.
If you have a hard time determining this, use a friend or relative. They can comb through your hair and will be able to see better.;
, The hotter the water it is, the softer the wax will become, and therefore make it easier to remove. Soak your hair in the warm water until your hair is soaking wet. However, make sure not to turn up the water to hot that it irritates your skin.

, Pour a healthy amount of shampoo into your hands. While soaking your hair in the warm water, run the shampoo through your hair.


Start at the roots and move outwards. Use slow, methodical motions. Make sure to touch all of the wax as you are shampooing.
If you feel any of the wax already starting to come undone, peel it out with your hand, and place it to the side of the sink/shower. If you let it go down the drain, it could clog it up.

, Rinse the shampoo out of your hair first, and any wax coming undone. Then add a healthy amount of conditioner to your hands, and run it through your hair.


Start at the roots and move outwards. Make sure your hair is still wet when you are applying the conditioner. You want to maintain the heat coming from the water.
If you feel any wax starting to come undone as you apply the conditioner, remove it with your fingers and place it to the side of the sink/shower. If you let it go down the drain, that could result in a clog.

, Step out of the shower, or pull your head up from the sink. Wrap your hair in a dry towel or paper towel. Let your hair remain still at first, drying on it's own. Then work the towel through your hair.


Try not to use one part of the towel more than once as you are drying, as wax might come out. You do not want wax to me removed, then stick somewhere else in your hair again.

, Stand in front of a mirror, and run your fingers through your hair. Try peeling out the wax, which should be incredibly soft at this point.


You can also use a comb or brush. Each time you run the comb/brush through your hair, check to see if any wax is sticking. Remove any wax from the comb/brush before you take another pass through.
Get a friend or relative to check your hair for you. They might be able to see better where any excess wax is still hiding.

, If one pass through does not get all of the wax out, try again. Make sure to let your hair sit, at least for a few hours before you wash it again. Washing your hair too many times in a row can cause damage to your hair.


However, make sure not to go days without washing. The wax can recede farther down towards the roots, and become harder and harder to remove the longer you wait."

Apply a vitamin C solution.",How to Get Chlorine Out of Your Hair2," Chlorine is an oxidant that chemically reacts with your hair and skin, and can be very difficult to wash away with conventional shower methods.


Vitamin C crystals (available from Trader Joe's as well as health and wellness stores) are very inexpensive, and can be used for much more than hair and skin care.
Dissolve one teaspoon (5 grams) of vitamin C crystals in a one-pint spray bottle of water.
You can also mix with a normal-sized bottle of shampoo or body soap—it's just a little harder to be sure the vitamin C is fully dissolved.
Spray yourself all over, rub it in with your hands, then rinse off or bathe as usual.
Be sure to completely cover your hair and skin—it can’t work where it doesn’t reach.
You’ll know right away how well this works by how your skin and hair smell. If you still smell chlorine, repeat the process.

Use a clarifying shampoo monthly.",How to Get Bigger Hair1," If you have fine or thin hair, using a volumizing shampoo and conditioner can help give you bigger hair. They cleanse and moisturize your tresses without weighing them down, so your hair appears fuller and thicker.For best results, use a shampoo and conditioner that are clear or translucent. That usually indicates that they’re not loaded with heavy ingredients that will weigh down your hair and make it look flat.;
, While fine or thin hair needs moisture too, using conditioner at the roots can weigh down your hair so it looks flat. To get more volume, only apply conditioner to the ends of your hair from the ears down.If your hair isn’t particularly dry, you don’t necessarily need to condition every time that you wash your hair. Using conditioner every other time may provide all the moisture that you need and leave your hair looking fuller.

, Your hair may lack volume if it’s weighed down by product buildup from hairspray, mousse, gels, and other styling products. To remove any film that may be leaving your hair flat, wash your hair with a clarifying shampoo one to two times a month. It will remove the residue so your hair has more body.Don’t use clarifying shampoo more than twice a month. It can easily dry out your hair.

Determine whether the wax is solid or soft.,
Wrap waxed hair with paper towels.,
Use your hair dryer.,
Remove the paper towels.,
Use new paper towels on your hair.,
Apply warm water to your hair.,
Shampoo and condition your hair.",How to Get Candle Wax out of Hair2," Use your fingers and feel the wax, whether at the tips or at the roots. If the wax is soft, it is best to use the shampoo method. However, if the wax has hardened, it will need to be melted in order to be removed.


You can always get a friend or relative to check for you, whether or not the wax is hard. Sometimes it can be hard to see/feel for yourself, and in that case get a second opinion.

, Try and position the paper towels exactly where the wax is. Grab the section of waxed hair, and wrap the paper towel around it tightly.Only do this one section at a time, otherwise the paper towels will become hard to manage and might fall out.
You may want to dampen your hair, or the paper towel in order to help the paper towel stick in position.

, Plug the hair dryer in and turn it on to high heat. Feel the heat with your hand to make sure that it is not too hot, which would damage your hair follicles.Hold the paper towel in place, and run the hair dryer over the area. Make sure not to get too close to the paper towel, which might result in burning.
Make several passes through the area and over the paper towel. You should start to see/feel the candle wax melting, and soaking through the paper towel.
If you have a hard time managing this step, you can always use a friend or relative to run the hair dryer for you as you hold the paper towel into place.

, Press on the paper towels with your fingers. Feel the wax through the paper towels. As you pull the paper towels off, hold onto the wax. Do this slowly, as to pull off as much of the wax as you can get off.


Run your fingers through your hair. Try and pull off as much of the excess, now melted, wax as you can. If you cannot do this by yourself, get a friend or family member to do so.
Determine whether this section still has wax that needs to be removed, or whether this section is now relatively clean.

, If you are moving on to a new section, or redoing an old section, apply new, clean paper towels. Repeat the previous methods over and over again until the wax has been mostly removed.


Try and take breaks in between sections. Your hair can receive damage if it is heated for too long.

, Turn warm water on in your sink, and run it through your hands. You can also lather them with soap. Run the water and/or soap mixture through your hair. Use a comb or brush and go through your hair. Try and get out any excess wax that remains after you have melted it., The final step is to clean your hair. Make sure your hair is wet with warm water.

Invest in a commercial wax remover.,
Contact a hair stylist.",How to Get Candle Wax out of Hair3," If the candle wax is on the tips of your hair, this is the simplest and easiest method. Get in front of the sink, and bend your head forward. Let your hair drop down and fall in front of you. Turn on water in the sink to warm/hot.Let sink fill up with warm water. Make sure that the stopper had been pushed down, and allow the sink to fill up.
Dip your head down slowly, and allow the hair ends to enter the bath of warm water. Let your hair follicles bathe in the water for a few minutes. Pull your head up after the time is up, but do not bend your head back in the normal position yet.
Use a paper towel or a clean wash cloth and dry the ends of your hair. Apply pressure, and try to pull off the wax as you are drying. If this does not get all of the wax off at once, repeat, repeat, and repeat.

, The ice will chill and harden the wax until it will break apart. You can do this with either loose ice cubes, or ice in a small plastic bag. Simply place the ice on the wax, and let it sit for a few minutes. Pull the ice away, and then break up the hardened wax. Repeat if all the wax is not removed. Finish this by washing your hair with shampoo and conditioner., If the wax is closer to the roots, this is the easiest, and cheapest, home remedy available. Choose either olive, baby, jojoba, or mineral oil to put in your hair (all four work the same way). First dampen your hair with warm water. Then, apply a healthy amount of oil to your hands and/or small cotton balls.Rub the oil between your hands or blot it on small cotton balls. Then run it through your hair, starting at the roots and moving outwards.
Let the oil sit there for a few minutes to soften and dissolve the wax. Use clean cotton balls or towels to wipe away the oil and dissolved wax.
Rinse your hair out with warm water. Repeat if the wax has not completely gone away.

, The petroleum jelly acts very much in the same way as oil does, in that it helps to dissolve the wax. Feel through your hair to find where the wax has settled and apply a healthy helping of petroleum jelly with your hands.


Let the petroleum jelly sit there for a few minutes and dissolve the wax.
Because petroleum jelly is hard to remove, apply a few drops of dish detergent to a damp washcloth or towel. Dap the washcloth on the spots of your hair where you have applied the jelly.
Rinse your hair out with warm water. Repeat the measure if the wax still has not come out. If the wax has come out, finish this method by shampooing and conditioning your hair. The dish detergent can dry your hair follicles out, and so it is necessary to moisturize them., These products are designed to remove wax residue. They also have the added benefit of softening your scalp and hair follicles. These can usually be found at your nearest hair professional, or store specializing in hair products. Make sure to follow the instructions on the bottle clearly.

Apply mousse to your hair before blow drying.,
Work with a round brush.,
Use the concentrator nozzle to focus on the roots of dry natural hair.,
Finish drying your hair your the head upside down.",How to Get Bigger Hair2," A volumizing mousse can help boost the volume in your hair when you blow dry. Squeeze a golf ball size amount into the palm of your hand, and apply it to the roots of towel-dried hair to give them extra lift when you blow dry.Be sure to choose an alcohol-free mousse to avoid drying out your locks.

, When you’re blow drying your hair, a round brush is a great tool for adding volume. Use the brush to pull up at the roots of your hair and run the dryer along the sections to lock in extra height and body as you’re drying.Don’t use a metal round brush. It can become too hot when you’re blow drying, so you run the risk of burning your hair or your skin.
You can also substitute velcro rollers for a round brush. Place them at the roots of your hair all around the crown, and blow dry your hair to add volume.

, If you have natural curls or twists, attach the concentrator nozzle to your blow dryer. When your hair is already dry, begin lifting medium size sections of your hair at the roots and hitting them on low heat for approximately 10 seconds. Repeat the process for your entire head for bigger hair.After you've hit all of your roots with heat, add even more volume to your natural hair by flipping your head upside down and gently comb through just the roots with a wide tooth comb. Flip your head right side up and allow your curls to fall naturally.

, When your hair is mostly dry, bend over slightly so your head is upside down. Gravity will help lift the roots to boost volume as you finish drying your hair.Focus the blow dryer on your roots when your head is upside down to get the extra height and lift.
If you have bangs, make sure to dry them completely right side up before flipping your head upside down to finish.

Switch your part.,
Use dry shampoo.,
Tease your roots.,
Curl your hair.",How to Get Bigger Hair3," In many cases, the easiest way to boost the volume of your hair is to change which side you part it on. Switching the direction that you comb the hair helps lift it away from the scalp so it appears to have more body and fullness.For example, if you normally part your hair in the middle, a deep side part will give it instant volume. You can also move a side part to the center, or switch a left or right part to the other side.

, Dry shampoo can help absorb excess oils from your scalp when you don’t have time to wash your hair so your hair isn’t weighed down. It also adds texture that gives your hair more volume.For the best results, don’t just apply the dry shampoo to your roots. Work it throughout all of your hair for major volume.

, Backcombing your hair may be an old-fashioned hair styling trick, but it definitely works to add volume. Take a section of hair and use a brush tease it backward toward the scalp at the roots. When you’re finished teasing the top layer of your hair, use a brush to smooth it into place with disrupting the volume.Using a fine-tooth comb to tease your hair can create knots. Instead, work with a large paddle brush to add soft volume.

, Adding curls to your hair can definitely make it appear bigger and more voluminous. Use hot rollers or a curling iron to curl your hair, paying particular attention to the top layer to give the impression of fuller hair.If you’re using a curling iron, raise your hair so each section of hair is elevated as you curl it. That will give your hair added lift instead of allowing the curls to drag your locks down.

Color your hair.,
Eat a hair-healthy diet.,
Massage your scalp to improve circulation.",How to Get Bigger Hair4," Coloring your hair can actually make it look fuller and bigger. If you lighten it with bleach, the process roughs up the cuticle so it appears thicker. However, you don’t have to color all over for fuller-looking hair. Adding a few highlights can help make your hair appear more voluminous.While bleaching and dyeing can make your hair look thicker, be careful not to over colour it. That can dry your hair out and lead to damage.

, If your hair is fine or thinning, incorporating foods that promote hair growth into your diet can help give you bigger hair. Look for foods that are rich in biotin, zinc, iron, and protein to support healthy hair growth so your hair becomes fuller.Tofu, kale, spinach, chard, and beans are high in biotin, zinc, and iron.
Salmon, eggs, beans, bananas, cauliflower, peanuts, and lentils are also high in biotin.
Lean red meat, chicken, seafood, eggs, nuts, beans, low-fat dairy, and whole grains are high in protein.

, Another way to encourage hair growth is to boost circulation to your scalp. Stimulate blood flow to your hair follicles by massaging it regularly. That helps promote healthy hair growth and makes your fine or thin hair appear plumper.For an effective scalp massage, spread a few drops of a lightweight hair oil, such as argan, macadamia nut, sweet almond, or coconut oil, between your fingertips and rub it into your scalp in circular motions just before you plan to wash your hair.

Don't shampoo as much.,
Use blow dryers cautiously.,
Change to a more delicate brush.,
Limit the use of hair elastics.,
Don't use straightening treatments.,
Try new repairing products.",How to Fix Dry Damaged Hair1," For many people, shampooing in the shower is such a part of their daily ritual that it may seem unthinkable not to do it. However, if you're suffering from dry hair, frequent shampooing is actually one of the worst things you can do. Shampoo strips essential oils from the hair along with dirt and grime, leaving it dry and vulnerable to damage. These oils will eventually return to the hair, but if you shampoo every day, they may not get a chance to.


Shampoo is good for cleaning your hair and scalp, so a good compromise is to shampoo every third day. You can shower as often as you normally do to clean your skin and even use conditioner, but limit shampooing to about twice per week unless your hair gets especially dirty.;
, Using a blow dryer after bathing can dry your hair out, but the effects can be minimized with a few easy changes to your drying habits. Try the following:


Don't blow dry right after you get out of the shower. Let your hair air dry or blot it dry with a towel to soak up excess moisture.
Set your dryer to a low setting and dry your hair gradually over a longer period of time.
Use a thermal-protective hairspray or product to protect your hair.

, The stiff, sharp bristles of most hair brushes can tear and fray delicate hair. Instead of using a harsh brush, switch to a brush with wide-spaced, round-tipped bristles. Better yet, skip the brush entirely and use a wide toothed comb. Any of these alternatives should be available at a local department store or pharmacy for cheap.

, Rubber bands and tight hair ties can fray, and damage your hair. The tighter and more constrictive the material, the worse the effect. Try switching to free-flowing hairstyles or use braids or buns if you need to wear your hair up.


If you have to use a hair tie, get the big poofy ones that have soft fabric over them.

, If you normally straighten your hair every day, this can gradually damage the outer layer of your hair. Over time, this causes your hair to become weaker and dryer. Eventually, it will become so dry and brittle that you can be left with split or broken-off ends. Embrace your non-straight hair and it will naturally become less dry.


This is especially true if you get your naturally kinky hair straightened at a specialist's. The chemicals used in the straightening process are quite caustic and can cause severe damage to your hair (or, if you leave them in too long, your scalp). Luckily, this goes away once the treatments stop.

, A wide variety of products designed to repair dry, damaged hair are available at supermarkets and beauty stores. Try switching to a product labeled ""moisturizing,"" ""repairing,"" ""restorative,"" ""strengthening,"" or ""fortifying."" These sorts of products are available as shampoos, conditioners, hairsprays, hair oils, and more. Regardless of the specific product you choose, use a light application on your hair every day and it should get stronger, shinier, and easier to brush and manage.

These ingredients will dry out your hair, break down healthy hair proteins, and leave your hair prone to more damage in the future.Look for ingredients like sodium cocoyl isethionate, sodium lauroyl methyl isethionate, and disodium laureth sulfosuccinate. These compounds are gentler than the sulfates used in many cheaper shampoos and are derived from more natural ingredients like coconut oil.You can also choose shampoos that contain glycerin and panthenol. Glycerin helps fortify your hair by creating a protective barrier and panthenol allows your hair to retain more moisture and thickens the hair follicles.;
, This kind of shampoo will help fortify your hair by creating a barrier between the hair and any heat you may apply to your hair (through blow drying, straightening, etc.). Leave it in your hair for five minutes and then rinse it out.

Cover your hair with a plastic wrap (or even a shower cap if you don’t have a plastic wrap) and leave it in for 30-45 minutes, depending on the severity of your hair’s damage.
When you are finished, rinse the oil out of your hair with lukewarm water.

, Mix together one tablespoon of a protein-enriching shampoo, on tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil, and one tablespoon of a moisturizing conditioner.Massage the mixture into your scalp and leave in as a mask for your hair.

Leave the mixture in for twenty minutes, then rinse your hair clean.

, Combine two tablespoons of honey with three tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil. Apply the mixture to your damp hair, making sure to rub it into your scalp completely and pull it down towards the ends of your hair.After you have saturated your hair with the mixture, wrap it in a towel.
Leave it in for 30 minutes to one hour, depending on the amount of damage your hair has. Then rinse with warm water.
Wash out any remnants with a mild shampoo.

, If you are serious about preventing future damage to your hair from harmful chemicals, you should avoid them altogether when possible. While they may look nice for a while, they only cause damage in the end. Avoid using these damaging chemical treatments to help prevent future trouble for your hair.If you have to dye your hair, try using a more natural dye like henna or tea. This will cause much less damage.

A shower filter will also enhance the pH balance of the water that you are using to wash and clean with and will ultimately result healthier, softer skin and hair. It may seem a bit over-the-top but the benefits can potentially outweigh the initial hassle of installing it.


Shower filters can be purchased at home goods or home improvement stores, such as Bed Bath and Beyond or Home Depot.
To install the filter, begin by detaching the shower head from the pipe it is attached to.
Place the filter on the pipe and hand turn it in a clockwise direction to secure it.
Turn on your shower and let water run through the filter to flush it out. The water may be discolored, which is normal for a new filter. Let the water run until you see that it is clear when coming out of the filter.
Place the shower head on the filter and hand turn it clockwise until it is secure.;
, Each hair type has different needs and requirements. A shampoo that works great for your friend’s hair may not work very well for yours. Talk to your hair stylist or do some research to find a shampoo and conditioner that will work best for your hair type. You can even take a quiz online to find out which products might work best for you, based on your hair and scalp type.Color-treated hair can benefit the most from shampoos that are sulfate-free and contain gentler alcohols than what is found in other shampoos. There are shampoos available based on the color that you have dyed your hair, such as blonde, red, or brown.
For individuals with naturally curly hair, you may want to try a nourishing shampoo that reduces frizz and manages curls, such as DevaCurl Low-Poo.Those with dry, brittle hair should try a moisturizing shampoo that cleanses but will also rehabilitate dry, damaged locks. A great shampoo to try would be the Living Proof Restore Shampoo, which contains a molecule that controls moisture.

, It is best to wash your hair in the evening to allow it time to air dry. Hair is susceptible when wet, so brushing your hair directly after you wash it can damage it more easily. Letting it air dry will keep it healthy and will reduce your styling time in the morning!, Shampooing your hair too frequently can strip the hair of natural oils that are essential for your hair’s health and vitality. Individuals with fine hair may need to shampoo almost every day, otherwise it may look oily. But those with thicker or curly hair may be able to get by only shampooing a few times a week., As soon as you step in the shower, rinse your hair with warm water. You hair should be thoroughly wet before adding any shampoo or conditioner. Rinsing your hair first with warm water is also beneficial because it opens the cuticle of each strand of hair, which is the shingle-like outside layer of the strand of hair. This will allow the dirt, product, and oil to be more easily removed. It will also help your hair efficiently absorb the oil in your conditioner., Conditioning your hair before adding shampoo will actually protect your hair and will prevent the ends from drying out too much. It will also fill in any holes in the cuticle with moisture, which will ultimately both protect your hair and increase the smoothness and shine. Add a dime sized amount of conditioner to your palm and quickly run it through your hair. Rinse lightly., Add a quarter-sized amount of shampoo and begin lathering, but only at your scalp. Younger hair, closest to the scalp, is often the most oily, while the hair farthest away from your scalp is older and dries out faster. This is why it’s only necessary to shampoo at the base of your scalp, rather than lathering up all of your hair. It is not necessary to shampoo the rest of the hair, unless it is dirty or oily. Rinse away the shampoo with warm water.

, You do not want to make the tips of your hair absorb more oil than they naturally already do. To avoid this, apply conditioner starting only from the middle of the length of your hair to the tips. Let the conditioner sit in your hair while you finish showering. You can clip it up to keep it out of the way. When you’ve finished up with everything else, release the hair from the clip and rinse the conditioner thoroughly out of your hair with warm water.

, Finish washing your hair by giving it a final rinse with cold water. This can be tough but the benefits outweigh the pain. Cold water will seal the cuticle of the hair and make your hair shine, since the sealed cuticle reflects light., Allowing the hair to air dry before you blow-dry it will save you effort and will reduce damage. The drier your hair, the less exposure it will have to the blow-dryer, which will save you time and your hair from unnecessary damage. Take this time to do something else, such as preparing for your day or completing a task that you have been meaning to do., Squeeze a dime-sized amount of serum onto your palm and rub between your hands. Apply to your hair, taking care to avoid the roots, so as not to make them greasy by adding too much product. Once you have applied the serum, brush your hair out with a wide-tooth comb, carefully brushing out any knots or tangles you encounter.

, The concentrator nozzle is often overlooked but it is an important tool to use with your blow-dryer. It focuses the flow of air onto one section of your hair, rather than blowing hair all over in a chaotic manner. Each hair dryer should come with this nozzle in the box. If you do not have one for yours, you can search online for a nozzle that matches the make and model of your blow-dryer., Tie back the uppermost part of your hair near the crown of your head, then section the rest into three or four inch sections. You can use clips to pin the hair firmly into place. When you are ready to dry a section, remove the clip and brush out any tangles.

, Hold the round brush firmly in one hand (usually your dominant hand) and the blow-dryer in the other. Position the round brush at the end of the hair that is closest to the scalp, with the hair of the section you are getting ready to dry resting on top of the round brush. Press the concentrator nozzle against the brush and hair, with the round brush supporting the hair. Your hair will be between the blow-dryer and the round brush. Comb out the section of hair, keeping the nozzle pressed against the brush, until that section is dry. Repeat with each section until all of your hair is dry."

, Run your fingers gently through your hair to separate knots and kinks. Do not use a brush or a comb, this could lead to unnecessary breakage and shedding. Starting at the roots of your hair may cause breakage, even with gentle finger detangling.

Try to get all of the shed hair out; shed hair often has no way to actually fall out of your hair so it stays mixed in with the healthy hair and creates knots.

, Shampooing the hair strands may lead to over dryness, and if you are planning on blow-drying your hair this could very likely lead to breakage. 

Only shampoo your scalp once or twice, or it could lead to flakiness. Warm water opens the hair cuticle to allow shampoo to fully cleanse.

",How to Untangle Matted Hair," It’s likely that there are going to be areas of your hair that are much more tangled and matted than other areas. Run your fingers through your hair (as much as you can) to identify the areas that are particularly matted and tangled.Use your fingers to gently press and pinch the matting to determine the thickness and magnitude of the tangle.


Once you find those particularly matted areas, you can figure out where you need to focus your detangling efforts.;
, Divided your dry hair into sections that will be easy and manageable to work with. This might mean sectioning your hair in halves (down the middle of your head), quarter sections (down the middle of your head with a top portion and bottom portion), or random small sections.However you decide to section off your hair, use claw clips or gentle hair ties to keep your hair sections separate from one another.

, In general, you are going to need to use some sort of lubricant to work out the matting and tangles in your hair. The lubricant you use can come in many forms: detangling hair products, smoothing serums, conditioners, and/or oils (baby oil, olive oil, jojoba oil, coconut oil, grapeseed oil, etc.).You can spray the lubricant liberally on each section of matted hair, or coat your hands with the lubricant and use your fingers and hands to work it into the various sections.


Really use your fingers to massage the lubricant into the knots of your hair. You wanna be sure to penetrate not only the surface of the matting, but to lubricate the inner areas of the matting. That way, the hair strands can slide past each other when you comb out and detangle your hair.
However, that does not mean to rub the tangles. Simply try to wiggle and work your lubricated fingers into the center of the matting.The lubricant on your fingers will transfer to the hairs on the inner part of your matted hair, saturating them and minimizing friction as you detangle.

, Let the lubricant soak into your matted hair for approximately 10-15 minutes.This will allow adequate time for your hair to absorb the lubricant and slicken your hair.

, Once your lubricant has had time to penetrate your matted hair, unclip one section of hair, and gently use your fingers to detangle it as much as you can. Start combing your hair with your fingers, working from the bottom of your hair up toward the roots.Depending on the level of matting, you may be able to make some progress with finger combing your hair, or you may not.
Finger combing you hair serves as a preliminary way to remove tangles before moving on to combing, which may require more pulling, and slightly rougher detangling.

, Start combing that one section of hair with a wide-tooth comb. Again, work from the bottom of your hair (about 1 inch from the bottom) moving upward, toward your roots.Combing your hair this way allows you to work out tangles starting at the most commonly tangled area, and brush the tangles out the ends of your hair as you move up the hair shaft. Continue combing your hair until you can smoothly pull the comb from the top roots of your hair to the bottom ends. Once you are finished with one section, move onto the next section, first finger combing your hair, then actually combing your hair with a wide-tooth comb.


If you try combing your hair starting at the top, you comb will most likely just get stuck as you try to comb it down, and further knot your hair.
If you feel resistance pulling the comb down, gently remove the comb from your hair, and use the teeth of the comb to work at that specific knotted section. Once you can comb through a big knotted section more freely, try combing through that section all the way down to the ends of your hair.
Consider gripping your hair at the roots with one hand, and combing your hair with your other hand. Holding your hair at the roots will lessen the pulling on you scalp and reduce pain while combing.

, Once you have combed and detangled all the separated sections of your hair, shampoo your hair to remove the lubricant you chose to detangle your hair.At this point, your hair will look very slick and oily, but it will be fully detangled.

While some may advertise themselves as being suited for “all hair types,” others aim to treat a specific characteristic. If you have normal hair, you can use a shampoo aimed for “all hair types,” but if you have a specific problem, you may want to look for a shampoo that targets the issue. Some common hair types that may use clarifying shampoo include:


Dry hair
Oily hair
Curly hair
Straight hair
Fine hair
Thick hair
Colored or treated hair;
, A chelating shampoo is very similar to a clarifying shampoo, but it is more effective against mineral build-ups. If your local water is hard or if you are a swimmer, you should look for a chelating shampoo. If you cannot find one, you can also use a clarifying shampoo that contains the chelating ingredient EDTA.Hard water is water that has a high mineral content. If you are uncertain about how hard your water is, you can check with your local water treatment facility, or you can test the water at home. Add ten drops of soap to a bottle of water. Shake the bottle. If it suds up, you have soft water, but if it doesn’t, you may have hard water.

, If you have curly hair, you will want to make sure that you do not dry out your hair too much. Since clarifying shampoo will strip away natural oils, you should replace them with a shampoo that uses an oil, such as Argan oil, coconut oil, avocado oil, or olive oil.These shampoos will often be labeled as “cleansing oil” shampoos.

, If you have sensitive skin on your scalp, extremely dry hair, colored hair, or damaged hair, a normal clarifying shampoo may be too harsh. Instead of causing more damage to your hair, you may want to try using a baby shampoo. These are formulated not to strip essential oils, but they will still provide a deep clean for your hair., Many beauty websites offer comparisons and reviews on different clarifying shampoos. Do your research before you buy to make sure that the one you purchase is effective without being too harsh. You may want to see if the shampoo increases shine and reduces oil. If you have dyed or highlighted hair, make sure that other reviewers do not report that the shampoo fades their color.

, You should make sure that your hair is completely wet before you apply the shampoo. If you are using a shower or bath, dip your hair under the water. If you are using a sink, you should fill a bucket with water. Hold your head over the basin, and gently pour the water over your hair.


Wet your hair with warm, but not hot water. Hot water may damage your hair and make it limp., Squeeze out about a quarter-sized amount of the shampoo into your hands.Rub your hands together to create a lather, and massage the shampoo into your hair. Make sure you rub it into your scalp so that the shampoo can remove oils that have built up around your roots.

, Once you are done, you should rinse all of the shampoo out of your hair. Make sure that your scalp, roots, and tips no longer have any shampoo on them. If your hair is excessively oily, you can try to shampoo it again, but in most cases, one application is all you need.


Many stylists recommend that you rinse with cold water, as cold water may help seal in moisture and make your hair shiny., Since clarifying shampoo strips your hair of both natural and artificial oils, you will need to replace some of that hydration to prevent breakage and damage. After you rinse out the shampoo, apply your favorite conditioner.If you do a weekly deep-conditioning treatment for your hair, you may want to use the clarifying treatment right before the special conditioner. If you pair these treatments together, you may find that they work more effectively.If you have oily hair, you may only want to condition the tips of your hair. Start about halfway down the shaft, and rub the conditioner into the tips. Do not condition the roots or scalp.

, If you are a frequent swimmer or if you use many different hair products every day, you may need to use the clarifying shampoo weekly. Pair it with a deep conditioning treatment, such as a hair mask, to avoid extensive damage.A hair mask is a deep conditioner that you can use once a week to hydrate your hair. Apply the mask to wet hair, and brush it through with a wide-toothed comb. Leave it on for between two and fifteen minutes before washing it out., Most people will need to use a clarifying shampoo no more than once every two weeks. This schedule will allow you to benefit from its cleansing properties without over-drying or damaging your hair.


Clarifying shampoos use sulfates to cleanse your hair. During the rest of the month, you may want to use a sulfate-free shampoo to reduce your exposure to these harsh and irritating chemicals. This will prevent further damage to your hair. Look for a shampoo that will hydrate your scalp as it cleans.

, If your hair is dry or if it is dyed, you do not need to use a clarifying shampoo more than once a month. If you use it more often, you risk breaking your strands or fading your color., A day or two before you get your hair dyed, you should use clarifying shampoo to remove excess oils. This will help the color stick to your stands. Do not use it the same day as a color treatment, however, as you want a little bit of natural oil in your hair."

Dry your hair lightly.",How to Wash a Hair Weave1," Normally, you would want to wash your hair a few times a week. However, the lengthy time it takes to wash hair with a weave in makes it impractical to do more than once a week, and a weave may be damaged with excessive cleaning. Washing your natural hair once a week, and washing your weave twice a month should be sufficient in most cases. Try to approach these two things relatively separately.

Washing your natural hair once a week, and washing your weave twice a month should be sufficient in most cases.;
, Using a brush, comb or your fingers, get any snags out of your hair. Hair weaves can be notorious when it comes to tangling, so delicately smoothing it out is necessary for a proper cleaning. Begin from the roots at the top of your head, and gently brush downward. Make sure to keep the brushing in a relatively fluid motion; that way, you'll minimize the risk of tangles.


For any kind of hair extensions, you should be using a looper brush or a smooth comb. Looper brushes have no tips on the end of the bristles, meaning they won't snag any hair piece.Be very delicate and meticulous; natural hair is very easy to untangle compared to a weave, and any extra force runs the risk of permanently damaging the fixture. , Pouring warm water on your head and parting your hair from the centre will make it easy to identify the wefts (individual parts of the weave) in your hair. That way, you'll have an easier time trying to figure out which parts of your head you should be focusing on the most., Weaves tend to need more attention and meticulous care than your natural air, as they're not being regularly supplied with the same oils from your scalp. Rub some of your favourite shampoo into your scalp; from there, you can gradually tease the weave with the shampoo, stroking it downward.


Make sure not to use the traditional circular rubbing method with your weave, as it will encourage tangling. The way you touch the hair should go from top to bottom. Be patient and gentle.

, There's a good chance you would use conditioner following shampoo as part of any hair routine; because hair weaves aren't naturally with oil however, conditioner becomes that much more important. Apply it in the same way as you did with the conditioner, starting from the top, and applying it downwards.

Because an excess of conditioner can result in tangling, it's recommended you find a leave-in conditioner for this purpose.

, Many people who use hair weaves have complained of a smell that comes after it's been wet for too long. This is usually caused by a build-up of mold. Buy a relatively inexpensive anti-bacterial hair spray (such as the Salon Pro 30 Second Spray ) and give your hair a spritz while you're waiting for it to dry. , Making sure to dry your hair thoroughly is very important when you're using a weave. Otherwise, a weave left wet runs the risk of acquiring mold, which will leave your hair smelling far worse than before. At the same time, you want to dry it lightly enough that you don't run the risk of causing heat damage. There are a few ways to do this:


Sitting in front of an oscillating fan and letting the air to its work is time-consuming, but it's ultimately the safest way to dry your leave-in weave and hair.
Hair dryers come with the risk of heat damage, but hooded dryers can alleviate some of the cons. Start with the ends and work your way up to the scalp. "
"
Brush your hair thoroughly.,
Get your hair wet with warm water.,
Remove each weft carefully.,
Mark and label each weft before cleaning.,
Wash your weave with a dab of shampoo.,
Put your weave in a plastic bag with conditioner and microwave for 30 seconds.,
Re-attach your weave to your head.,
Replace your weave on a regular basis.",How to Wash a Hair Weave2," If you're looking to take your hair weave out, you're first going to want to make sure it's as untangled as possible. Otherwise, taking it out could pull at your natural hair and cause pain. With a brush or a comb, gently brush through, smoothing out all the kinks. Start from the top, and gently brush downward in a slow, fluid motion., With your hands or a shower faucet, wash your head, letting the water pour down the middle. This way, the wefts will become easier to distinguish from the rest of your hair., Now that your hair is detangled, it's time to meticulously remove the weave from your scalp. Pick them apart from your head, checking for damage as you set them aside., Knowing where each weft goes on your head beforehand can take a lot of the guesswork out after the fact. Make a basic system, giving a number (1, 2, 3 etc.) to a corresponding part of your head where it's supposed to go (leftmost weft, centre-left weft etc.). That way, once you've gotten it all nice and clean, you'll be able to put it all back perfectly. , Clean your weave in the sink or in a steel pot. Use warm water and a dab of shampoo the size of your finger. Next, clean it gently, moving your fingers from the root to the stem of the piece. Much like cleaning a leave-in weave, try to refrain from rubbing in the traditional circular motion, as it's just going to increase the risk of getting tangles., Once you've got the wefts nice and clean, it's time to add some oil and shine to them. Put them in a bag with some conditioner, and apply the same way you did the shampoo. Next, put the wet weave in the microwave and put it on for 30 seconds. That will speed up the drying process far more than letting it dry naturally. If you're against the idea of putting your hair in the microwave, you can dry them manually if a hooded dryer. Avoid towel-drying, as this runs the risk of matting.

, If you've marked down each piece to its corresponding part of your head, replacing them on your head should be an easy thing. If you haven't, you may have to do some guesswork. Try to remember where each weft was placed. It may take some trial-and-error, but you'll soon find a placement that suits you.

If you're feeling particularly daring, you might try to try new combinations and placements, just to see how they compliment your face and the rest of your hair!
Give your hair an anti-bacterial spritz for good measure. While the drying process should have made your weave relatively dry and safe from the build-up of smells, it's nonetheless a smart idea to give your hair a quick spray. That way, you won't end up with the dreaded mold smell, and have to repeat the process all over again!

, Weaves will lose some of their lustre over time, so it's generally good form to replace them around every three months. Even natural hair weaves are fairly inexpensive, so making purchasing a new set part of your routine is a great way to maximize your look!"

, This way the hair is not over-saturated with water, and the shampoo will coat the hair better because it cannot be diluted.

,,, Once again spread it over your hands. But this time, spread it through the ends of the hair. Be careful not to concentrate too much shampoo in one area, or you'll dry out the hair.

,, If you plan on giving your client a blow-dry or any sort of heat styling, it is very important that you use a heat styling conditioner (or shampoo and conditioner set). This will prevent most of the damage from the heat.

,, Colder is generally better. This will seal the cuticle (fortifying the effects of conditioning), cause the hair to shrink back to its natural length, and keep the hair damper longer.

Decide when to untangle your hair.,
Use the right instruments.,
Begin at the tips.,
Work your way up the strand.,
Apply conditioner to help with stubborn knots.,
Make sure all tangles are removed.",How to Untangle Hair1," To protect your strands against breakage, you should be careful about when you untangle your hair. The one rule of thumb to follow is that you should never tackle knots immediately after shampooing your hair. The elements of shampoo that wash your hair also strip away natural oils, leaving your hair dry and prone to breaking — especially if you’re tugging at knots. You should also wait for your hair to dry if you are going to brush it, because water can weaken your hair follicles and leave your hair prone to breakage. You should address tangled hair:Before shampooing, with your hair completely saturated, or
After both shampooing and conditioning, when the conditioner has begun rehydrating your stripped, shampooed hair.;
, The one tool to avoid when detangling hair is a rounded brush. Long, tangled hair can wrap around a rounded brush and get caught, making a bad situation even worse.Instead, use a flat brush that will be able to move through the hair without getting wrapped up in it. If using a comb, make sure to work with wet hair after it’s been conditioned., You may be tempted to start at the roots and work your way to the end, but this can make the tangles worse. With this method, you’re just brushing your tangles down instead of out, either making the knots denser and harder to extract or pushing multiple knots into each other. Instead, begin untangling the knots at the ends of your hair first.

, Using your flat brush or comb, work your way up the length of your hair. Don’t tug or force the brush through knots, as this could cause the hair to break. Be gentle and deliberate, using your fingers as an aid to detangle the hair.

, If you reach a point where you can’t detangle a knot without damaging your hair, you might need to use a product to help. Whatever conditioner you use on a daily basis will be very useful; just apply it to the tangled strands and leave it in as you continue trying to work the knot free. You can also use a moisturizing hair mask or a detangling spray or cream — all of which can be purchased wherever shampoos and conditioners are sold.

, For daily upkeep, you want to make sure that you’re not leaving any knots in your hair, as they can build up over time and result in mats. This might take some time, so turn off the water in the shower if necessary. This will both prevent water waste and make sure you’re not stuck in a cold shower by the time you’re done.

Calm yourself and make sure you have time to devote to detangling.,
Gather your materials.,
Decide if you're going to work on the knot before or after showering.",How to Undo a Knot in Your Hair1," Trying to rush through the process will likely worsen the knot and leave you angry and frustrated. Working out a knot can take time and a lot of patience, and you should go into the process as calmly as possible. Take a few deep breaths, put on some enjoyable music, and get to work.


If you have a friend, sibling, or parent willing to help, you can speed up the process. And if the knot is somewhere that is difficult to reach, they may be necessary.Remember to take breaks. You may need to stop and rest your arms.
If you don't have time to deal with the knot, pull your hair into a bun and wait until you have enough time to dedicate to working it out.;
, When trying to unknot hair, your tools can make all the difference. You absolutely want to use a detangler, conditioner, or other lubricant (like coconut oil). Don't use a brush, as this can lead to more knotting. Instead, find a sturdy medium- or wide-toothed comb. Set up a chair in front of a mirror--you'll want to be sitting, since it may take a while.


There's an abundance of detangling products for curly-haired people. Look for sprays to use after the shower, plus rinses and shampoos that can help when you wash your hair.
Look for gentle, no-tears versions for kids or very fine hair.
If your hair is dry and damaged, look for a product that moisturizes as it detangles.
You can also use a silicone-based de-frizzing gel to work out tangles.Make your own spray by mixing conditioner and water in a clean, empty spray bottle.

, Many experts recommend detangling right after you shower, but it depends on how healthy your hair is to begin with. Wet hair is stretchy and elastic, but also extremely fragile, so it will break very easily.However, damp hair can add lubrication, which can assist in loosening the knot. If your hair is very damaged or fragile, begin with dry hair.The spray or conditioner will add lubrication and ""slip"" to dry hair, which is often sufficient for working out a knot.
Some experts recommend detangling right before you shower, so you can easily work shampoo and conditioner through your hair and comb it out afterwards."
"
Use a variety of combs.,
Apply a detangling product to your hair.,
Begin detangling with the widest-tooth comb you have.,
Hold the hair at the root if the process is painful.,
Transition to narrower tooth sizes.,
Cut through mats if necessary.,
Brush through the detangled lock.,
Work your way through the rest of your hair in sections.",How to Untangle Hair2," Because mats are so densely tangled, they can be very difficult to remove. Instead of trying to power your way through them with a brush, you should use a more delicate, focused approach. A variety of combs with different tooth widths is ideal, but a single comb with wide teeth on one end and narrower teeth on the other will suffice.

, If your hair is very matted, you’ll want to work in sections, so the product doesn’t dry and become less effective.You might apply conditioner or moisturizing mask to dampened hair, or you might spray a detangler or leave-in conditioner onto dry hair. Make sure the product is fresh on the section of hair you’re working on at the moment.


Gently massage the product into the tangle with your fingers. Use a pressing rather than rubbing motion, as rubbing can make the tangle worse.

, You will move from wide to narrow teeth as you detangle the mat, working your way up to the densest parts of the knot. Just as with normal, daily untangling, you should work your way up from the end of your hair to the roots. Otherwise, you may just compress the tangles even more by pushing it down into itself from the root to tip.

, As you’re working on the tangle, you may find yourself wincing in pain. It can be helpful to hold onto your hair above the point that’s being worked on, as you can prevent the strands from pulling at the scalp painfully.


Note that hairstyles that pull on the scalp can result in hair loss over time., When you’ve freed up the parts of the mat that can be addressed with a wide-toothed comb, transition to a narrower-tooth comb. Remember to always work at a tangle from the bottom up, moving from the least to most dense part of the knot. As you reach the most tangled center of the knot, you will transition to your finest-tooth comb., This doesn’t mean that you should lop off an entire lock of hair! Snipping through a mat addresses only the tangle, not the actual length of hair. If you work and work at a mat, but can’t work through it with a comb, use a small pair of scissors to give the knot a small, vertical snip.You don’t even need to cut all the way through the mat — sometimes just cutting away part of the mat will help you work through the rest of it with your fingers and combs.

, Once you’ve worked out the mat, use a flat brush or comb to brush through the entire length, from root to tip. Make sure there are no small snags left before moving on to a different tangle.

, If you have other serious mats that need addressing, repeat this process. Make sure, though, that you’re always working in sections. Attacking your whole head of hair without a plan will just leave you tender-headed and frustrated. Reapply detangling products as necessary to make the process easier.

Divide your hair to isolate the knot.,
Spray the section of hair with your detangler.,
Finger-comb your hands through the knot.,
Comb the very bottom of the knot.,
Work your way up the section of hair, through the knot.,
Remove tiny knots with your fingers if possible.",How to Undo a Knot in Your Hair2," Use plastic hair clamps or clips to separate your hair. Try to clip back all the hair that is not already part of the knot so it doesn't end up in the mess. The knot should be free from the clips with everything else pulled out of the way.









If you have a ton of tangles, it will be much easier for you to work in sections.Try dividing your hair into about six sections and work on them one at a time.
If you're working through all your hair, make sure you separate the finished sections from those that are still knotted. You may want to braid the finished section so it doesn't tangle again., Apply the product and allow it to sit for several minutes so it can soak into your hair. Follow the instructions on the bottle of product, but know it's okay to be generous. The more slip and lubrication, the easier it will be to undo the knot.









If you're using oil or gel, rub a little into the knot with your fingertips.

, Begin close to the bottom of your hair and gently slide your fingers through the lock. If you encounter a knot, don't tug, just skip over it and continue combing down to the end of your hair.Slowly move up the length of your hair, gently pulling the strands apart. You'll be surprised how far you can get de-tangling using this method.








Feeling the knot with your hands can give you a better idea of what you're working against, like the size and how tightly the strands are knotted.Finger-combing will also help distribute your detangling product through your hair., You always want to start at the bottom of the knot. Pulling above the knot will only make it tighter.Gently pull the wide-toothed comb from the bottom of the knot to the end of your hair. If you can't get it through without hitting a snag, move even closer to the end of your hair.








Be very, very gentle when combing through the knot. If you tug and break your hair, those damaged and broken strands will only create future tangles.If you can't get the comb through the knot, try applying more product.
Remember to take breaks if you get tired or frustrated. This process may take quite a while.

, When you are able to comb easily through your hair, move up the strand a little and gently pull the comb downwards, applying product as needed.









Make sure you are holding your hair firmly with your free hand, near the root. This will make the tugging less painful and can help prevent breakage.If you can't move the comb smoothly through your hair without hitting snags or tearing your hair, move upwards in smaller increments., Even when you've successfully removed the knot from your hair, you may find a few tiny knots that are extremely tight. Try loosening these knots by pulling a few strands just above the knot and see if they slide through. If they won't budge, stop and try a different strand of hair.








If you have removed some hair from the tiny knot but it still won't undo, use a pair of hair scissors to snip them off just above the top of the knot. Never rip the knot out with a comb."

Braid or pineapple your hair before going to sleep.,
Trim your hair regularly.,
Wash your hair like you're in a shampoo commercial.,
Avoid necklaces with fine chains and shirts with collars if you have long hair.",How to Undo a Knot in Your Hair3," Gently gathering your hair in a braid or pineapple updo will keep you from sleeping directly on top of it, decreasing friction. You can also try a sleeping bonnet, satin or silk pillow case or a hair net to keep your hair tangle-free at night.








Use soft hair ties, not rubber bands, to pull your hair back.
Remove any bobby pins you may have used to style your hair.

, Many women can't stand to give up even a centimeter of their hard-earned hair length, but avoiding haircuts leads to dead, dry hair and split ends that cause tangles.At the very least, you should get your hair trimmed every three months, and tell your stylist you want the dead hair removed.








Split ends can travel up the hair shaft, damaging living hair and causing major tangles.As much as you may love every inch of your hair, dry, dead hair really doesn't look very good. Remember that your hair will continue to grow, and it will look healthier and stronger if you get a minor cut every season., Don't pile your hair on top of your head and scrub like crazy. Picture the way women shampoo their hair in commercials: focus on the scalp, massaging with your fingers, and allow the product to rinse through your hair., Very long hair is prone to tangling, and can easily snag on the fine chain of a delicate necklace or an elaborate collar on your blouse. If you don't want to give up your necklaces, make sure the chain stays under the collar of your shirt, and try not to wear more than one.Check necklaces and collars often to make sure they aren't catching your hair and forming a knot."

Wet hair thoroughly.,
Pour the size of a dollar coin (more/less depending on thickness of hair) into hands, Rub hands together and massage product from root to tip.,
After finished, apply conditioner to your hair NOT your scalp(as this can cause buildup) and leave in hair for however long the directions call for.,
If you want to proceed to blow drying your hair, you can blot your hair.",How to Wash Relaxed Hair," Some shampoos like Suave or VO5 or Garnier Fructis aren't exactly designed for our hair or don't have enough moisturizing ingredients. Although depending on what texture your hair is, you can use those products. Other hair companies like Crème of Nature, Kera Care, Elasta QP, Organic Root Stimulator, Mane n' Tail, or related are have moisturizers that help keep hair shiny, silky, and healthy.


Avoid using shampoos and conditioners with mineral oil, petrolatum, or Sodium Lauryl/Laureth Sulfate (SLS). If you do have dandruff, Head and Shoulders has a great line of products and smell good too. But make sure to use a good moisturizing conditioner.;
, Make sure that the whole head is wet so that applying shampoo would be a little easier. If you want, spend a little more time going through hair/ scalp.

, This will help get the buildup from the scalp as well as hair. Do not pile hair on top of your hair and don't use your nails. Rinse hair out and repeat.

, Take a comb and comb through your hair with the conditioner still in it so that it will be tangle free out of the shower also. If you are impatient, you can take a shower while you wait. Now rinse hair out but with just a little touch of conditioner in hair. This helps to make your hair softer.

, DO NOT rub the towel on your hair. If you want to dry your hair without heat, twist your hair with the towel in a turban.

Shampoos with glycerin, panthenol, or shea butter are good for coarse or kinky hair because they infuse extra moisture into the hair., If you have fine or thin hair, look for a shampoo that adds volume without weighing your hair down. You’ll also want to stick to “clear” shampoos – if you can’t see through the shampoo bottle, don't get it.Avoid shampoos with ingredients like sodium chloride or polyethylene glycol. Both chemical compounds are used as thickeners, but they can cause hair to become dry and brittle., If you have curly or wavy hair, you’ll want a moisturizing shampoo, but you should also look for shampoo formulas that include silicone. This gives your curls the moisture they need to stay bouncy but also prevents them from absorbing too much moisture and getting frizzy., If you have ""normal"" - otherwise known as medium or well-balanced hair - you can use pretty much any type of shampoo that you like. Just make sure you’re choosing shampoos that don’t strip your hair - white tea shampoo is a good option.Avoid shampoos with ammonium lauryl sulfate, sodium laureth sulfate, and sodium lauryl sulfate. They are all harsh detergents and will strip your hair of its natural moisture and dry it out.

, If you have thick hair, you'll want volume at the roots, but not at the ends, and you'll also want to make sure your hair has enough moisture.


Shampoos with avocado or macadamia nut oil will give your hair volume where necessary and moisturize it at the same time., If your hair is dry, or it's been damaged in any way - from over-coloring, excessive use of heat, or overuse of hair products - look for a shampoo with keratin. Keratin acts as a sort of super-moisturizer that will help repair your hair.You should also avoid shampoos that have certain alcohols in them, as they can further dry out your hair. Avoid cetearyl alcohol, cetyl alcohol, and stearyl alcohol if you have dry or damaged hair., To maintain the vibrancy of your colored hair, look for shampoo that includes vitamins E and A. Shampoo for color-treated hair is also usually specially formulated and more gentle than regular shampoo., Oily hair is actually the result of your body compensating for a dry scalp by producing more oil. Tea tree oil helps to treat your dry scalp, which in turn stops your body from producing so much oil., The easiest part of choosing a shampoo is finding a scent you like. Try to be mindful of your work or school environment while you’re choosing, however. Some people have sensitivities to certain scents – if you or someone you work closely with has such a sensitivity, look for a fragrance-free option., Before you shampoo your hair, make sure you fully soak it. Soaking your hair in hot water will help open up the cuticles and loosen the oil that’s already in your hair.








You should rinse for at least a minute; this allows the water to start rinsing gunk out of your hair and makes it more receptive to the nutrients in your shampoo.Although you should soak your hair in hot water, you should turn the temperature down a bit once you’re ready to wash your hair. Washing your hair in hot water can cause damage to your hair., If the amount of shampoo you use is bigger than a quarter, you’re using too much. Unless your hair is very thick or very, very long, a quarter-sized amount is enough. If your hair is very thick or long, you can double the amount you use, but you shouldn’t use a full handful of shampoo on your head no matter how long or thick your hair is., When you’re shampooing your hair, you should really only lather it at the roots and the nape of your neck and then work it through to the ends. In other words, don’t place more shampoo at the end of your hair and work it through from bottom to top.








If your hair is longer than past your shoulders, condition your hair first – this keeps the ends of your hair healthy., While you’re lathering your hair, be gentle in your movements. Try to avoid circular motions – although these feel like the natural movement for washing your hair – and instead use an up-and-down motion with the tips of your fingers.







, Just like you use hot water when you first rinse your hair to help open the cuticles and prepare your hair for shampoo, you should do your final rinse in cold water. This seals the cuticles and keeps moisture in. It can also make your hair look healthy and shiny.







, If you condition your hair after you shampoo it, don’t use conditioner on your whole head – this can make it feel weighed down and greasy, especially at the roots. Instead, condition from about the middle of your hair to the ends.








You should generally condition your hair every time you shampoo. If your hair is damaged from heat or over coloring, you might want to try a deep conditioning treatment once a week in addition to your regular conditioning., Once you’ve washed your hair, towel it dry to remove most of the moisture from it and then let it air dry. This is the best way to prevent damage to your hair.







, If you have to use heat to dry your hair - either because you’re looking for a specific style or because you are in a hurry - use protective products on your hair first. This prevents the heat from a blow-dryer or straightener from damaging your hair.








Good protective products include thermal setting mist, heat seal spray, or gels designed to control heat and humidity., How long you can go between washes varies from person to person, depending on your hair type and how comfortable you are with letting your hair get a bit greasy. But you should generally give your hair every other day off from shampooing.If you want to avoid shampooing but want to refresh your hair, rinse with water. This will still remove grime and oil without running the risk of stripping it from over-washing., If your hair is looking a little greasy, but you want to put off shampooing it for another day, try dry shampoo. Dry shampoo soaks up the grease and oil in your hair to make it look fresher longer.









Start by spraying your hair line around your face (be careful not to spray yourself in the eye).
Then divide your hair into 2 to 4 sections, using your index finger to create sections backward and forward from your ear.
In each section, divide your hair into 1 to 2 inch (2.5 - 5 cm) sections parallel to your part. Spray your roots in each of these sections.
Blend the spray into your hair by using your finger tips to work the spray from your roots to your ends. Otherwise it will look like you have gray/white roots. Then brush out your hair."

See a healthcare professional if your dry scalp does not improve.",How to Use Exfoliating Shampoo," A little bit of exfoliating shampoo goes a long way. After showering as you normally would, squeeze about a quarter-sized drop of shampoo into your palm.Consult the instructions on your specific shampoo, however. Most shampoos do not need more than a quarter-sized drop, but some brands may suggest using more or less.
Application may also vary depending on your type of hair (i.e., curly hair, thick hair), so consult the instructions here. It may be a good idea to look for an exfoliating shampoo specifically designed for your hair type.;
, You want to make sure you work the shampoo into your roots. Use your fingertips to massage the shampoo in order to remove dead skin cells to exfoliate properly.If there are any areas where your scalp is particularly itchy, focus extra energy here.
Keep massaging until you have worked the shampoo into your entire scalp.
With exfoliating shampoo, you primarily focus on applying it to the scalp and near your roots. You do not need to work your shampoo into your tips.

, Make sure you rinse completely. Lingering traces of exfoliating shampoo could leave your hair greasy or otherwise damages. Use warm water to rinse. Rinsing may take longer after applying exfoliating shampoo due to its grainy nature, so give yourself extra time to get all the shampoo out.Keep rinsing until the water runs clean. There should be no traces of shampoo or exfoliating grains in the water running off of your scalp.

However, dry shampooing every day can lead to clogged hair follicles. This can lead to hair loss, scalp dryness, and other issues that exfoliation is meant to counteract. If you want the most effective hair exfoliating routine, cut back on dry shampooing.For example, if you dry shampoo your hair every day, cut back to dry shampooing once every two to three days.

, You should exfoliate at least once a week. If you have trouble remembering, put a notification in your calendar. Choose a day when you have extra time, like a Saturday, and make a point of exfoliating your scalp then.If you wash your hair less often, you should exfoliate more. If you wash your hair less than four times a week, make a habit of exfoliating twice a week instead of just once.

, You should continue to do things like conditioning your hair and anything else you do in regards to styling. The only thing you should cut back on is dry shampooing your hair. Otherwise, maintain your regular routine.

, Store bought shampoos can be pricey. If a store bought exfoliating shampoo is out of your price range, you can make your own shampoo by adding an exfoliating agent to your regular shampoo.Any household product that is grainy can be added to your regular shampoo. Try something like cornmeal or ground almonds.
Mix an equal part of your exfoliating agent with your regular shampoo to make your own exfoliating shampoo.
You can also add a few drops your favorite essential oil to create a pleasant scent.

, Some exfoliating shampoos contain turmeric. Some DIY shampoo recipes also call for your to use turmeric. If you have very light hair, turmeric can cause staining. Scan ingredients labels for turmeric and avoid using turmeric as an exfoliating agent if you're making your own shampoo., It's very important to get all traces of an exfoliating shampoo out of you hair. If you leave shampoo in near your scalp, this can cause more harm than good. Spend extra time rinsing your hair after exfoliating., Issues with dandruff and hair loss can sometimes indicate an underlying health problem. If you're still noticing flakes and hair loss despite exfoliating regularly, make an appointment with your doctor. Things like psoriasis can cause a dry, itchy scalp and require medical treatment."

You could also consider adding some leave-in conditioner for keeping the hair in better shape.


Hair can be be braided damp or dry. If you braid it when damp, you will have wavy hair in the morning.;
, These can help to keep your hair smooth and less frizzed up. It's not essential but a nice touch if you like satin.

, If you don't like braiding or wearing the hair in a ponytail, wrapping is another option. Use a thin summer weight scarf or a bandanna to wind your hair into place. Ensure that the hair does not move before tying a knot at the front of your head. Don't tie the knot on the back or side, as you don't want to lie on the knot.


Using a toweling cap is another option in place of a scarf. The cap should have firm but not tight elastic.

, With some luck, this can help to minimize overnight movement but there are no guarantees, as moving about during the night is normal.

, While self-evident, it's an important start to taming the mess. If you have problems getting the hair brushed or combed, use spray-in conditioner to ease the knots and tangles out.


Give each section of hair five to ten brushstrokes.
If you plan on wearing your hair down, finish up with a little hair gel or a touch of hairspray. That will keep the flyaways at bay.

, It's a vicious cycle––you add heat to try to get the hair into good condition, only to find it dries and gets flyaway, then add more heat to tame that, and so on. If you must use heat, always use heat protectant on your hair as well.

, If the hair likes messy, then use messy updos to keep things looking fashionable while staying natural to your hair's preferred appearance. Some possibilities include:



Messy braids or plaits
Messy buns
Beach waves

You may discover that your hair is:




Oily
Dry
Normal
Wavy
Straight
Curly
Thick
Fine


Once you have figured out your hair type, always treat your hair in accordance with that. Your hair will likely react differently than a friend's hair to certain products and care.;
, Many people believe that they need to wash their hair daily, but in truth most hair types only need to wash their hair every other day or a few times a week. Depending on your hair type, wash your hair when it's dirty, not just out of habit. If you have dry hair, you should only wash it every third day
If your hair is more oil prone, try washing it every other day, but if it looks really oily after just one day you can wash it every day
If you have normal hair (not super dry and not super oily) you should wash your hair ever other day or every three days
There is no perfect formula for how much you should was your hair. Just monitor your hair and wash it when you feel it's getting dirty. Washing it too much will prevent the natural oils from restoring in your hair, which can damage your hair.

, Hot water can actually strip your hair of protective oils that serve as a natural conditioner. By washing hair with lukewarm water you will prevent losing any natural shine from you hair and will avoid dull hair. , After you get out of the shower it can be tempting to run a brush through your hair, because it's a fast way to get rid of tangles. However, a wide-tooth comb is the best way to remove any knots post showering. A brush often snags and pulls your hair, causing it to break and become damaged, so use a comb and start at the bottom of your hair, working your way up. , Blow dryers are a fast way to dry your hair, but the heat from the dryer can damage your hair follicles, leading to dry, damaged hair. Allow your hair to air dry when possible, but if you need to use a blow dryer stick to one that allows for a cooler setting. , Hair is prone to split ends and if you go long periods of time without cutting your hair, it can look damaged and unhealthy. Try to give your hair a trim every three months or so, and if you are really prone to split ends, trim your hair every six weeks. If visiting a salon frequently is too much trouble or too expensive, trim your hair yourself. Invest in scissors for your hair and use a mirror that allows you to see the back of your head. It's easiest to trim your hair when it is wet or straight so that you can get even ends.

, Because your hair already has natural oils, and so do your hands, constantly touching your hair or moving it out of your face can increase those oils in your hair, making it look greasy. To avoid this, the best option is to get a hair cut that is manageable and won't bother you throughout the day.

, Hair dye has many chemicals that can damage your hair, and if done too often it's nearly impossible to repair that damage.

Too much sun can dry out your hair, especially if your hair is color treated, so whenever you are outside for long periods of time try covering your hair with a hat or use a hairspray with SPF protection. , Throwing your hair back in a ponytail or in a braid is always convenient when on the run, but be careful not too pull your hair too tight as this can cause damage and breakage.

Olive oil: warm olive oil will help moisturize dry hair. Apply to your hair and let sit for 45 minutes, then shampoo and rinse.

Coconut oil: this serves as a natural conditioner. Take heated coconut oil and apply to hair, letting it sit for thirty minutes. Then rinse with shampoo. Honey: honey is a natural moisturizer and can help strengthen hair follicles. Mix equal parts honey and shampoo and rinse. , This is one of those obvious things, but in order to have healthy hair, you need to have a healthy body, which means eating right and taking in the right nutrients.

Some nutrients to improve your hair are: Essential fatty acids: flaxseed oil, salmon, tuna, walnuts and almonds
Vitamin B6: bananas, potatoes, and spinach
Protein: fish, chicken, eggs, and soy products
Folic acid: fresh fruits and vegetables, especially citrus fruits and tomatoes, as well as whole grains, beans, and lentils


Stress and smoking can also cause damage to your hair by making it dull and prone to breakage, so avoid these things if possible , Shampoos are made in a wide variety for different hair types and can range from cheap to very expensive. While you should avoid choosing really cheap shampoos, salon shampoos may not provide any extra benefit to your hair.

Some popular hair masks are made by Neutrogena, Alterna Ten, Aussie, and Fekkai. , What is often in style is thick hair with lots of body, but unfortunately not everyone is blessed with this hair type. Volumizers are great because they help you achieve that look even if you hair is extremely fine. Flip your hair over and spray a few spritz to your roots and the rest of your hair. Then create volume by blow drying or boosting your hair with your hands.

, If you want to maintain the best health for your hair, it's good to avoid washing your hair too much, but you may feel like your hair just looks way too dirty. Dry shampoos are great because they are an easy product that covers any dirt or grease in your hair and makes it look fresh.

If the product is a true deep conditioner, the directions will state to leave the product on for 15-20 minutes. The product, especially for women of color, should be extra moisturizing. Natural-based products penetrate the hair shaft which will keep your hair healthier for a longer period of time. Natural ingredients are always better.





;
,, Apply your deep conditioner to dry hair. Ultra moisturizing deep conditioners work wonders on hair. Apply a plastic cap, apply a turbie twist (or hair wrap to secure in place) and go to bed. The next morning, shampoo this product out. While you were sleeping, the heat from your scalp and body produced natural heat underneath the plastic cap. It’s a great way to save time and not spending your precious moments of free time underneath a noisy dryer.

, Try doing this for about 15-20 minutes.

",How to Choose a Short Hairstyle That Suits Your Face Shape," The first step is to observe your facial shape intently and identify the key aspects and features that make your face stand out. To do this, stand in front of a mirror with your head tied back and an expressionless face. Take note of your key features to assess your shape. Even if your face shape doesn’t exactly match these guidelines, stick to what’s the closest to your face shape:


An oval shaped face is slightly long and has well defined cheekbones. It gets widest at the forehead and resembles the shape of an egg. Oval is the most versatile face shape.
A round face isn’t always pudgy. It is widest at the cheekbones and curves smoothly towards the top and bottom, forming a circular shape.
A square-shaped face is almost proportionate in height and width and has a chiseled jaw line.
A heart-shaped face is broadest at the forehead and greatly narrows down towards the chin.
A diamond-shaped face has a narrow forehead and a narrow chin. The cheekbones are the widest part of the face and the hairline is the narrowest as compared to any of the other face shapes.;
, Before choosing your hairstyle, you must identify those areas of your face that you should highlight and those that you should camouflage. Doing this will add just the right zing to your look.


Oval face: The perfect hairstyle for your oval face will help reduce the length of your face.
Round face: If you have a round face, you should opt for short hairstyles that make your face look slimmer and longer.
Square-shaped face: A hairstyle that complements a square-shaped face is one that softens the jaw line and enhances the cheekbones.
Heart-shaped face: The ideal hairstyle for your heart-shaped face should be able to divert attention from your broad forehead and add width to your tapered chin.
Diamond-shaped face: For your diamond-shaped face, your hairstyle must add an illusion of width near your chin.

, You could try the following styles:


A funky style like a razored pixie will look great on your face structure and will define your cheekbones.
Layered and messy bobs that add volume to your hair, take the attention away from the length of your face. They also help highlight your cheekbones.
If you are conscious of the length of your face and your broad forehead, you can opt for rounded bangs that will give your face a softer look.
Avoid short hairstyles with elements of height like bouffant and pompadour, as they are heavy on the crown and can make your face seem longer.

,
If you want to try out a pixie cut, make sure to ask your stylist to give your hair volume at the crown, with tapered edges and softness around the ears. A bigger crown will give the impression of a longer face.
Opt for side swept bangs rather than letting them fall on your forehead. These bangs help define your cheekbones and make your face seem longer and thinner.
Avoid blunt hairstyles that end at the jaw as they accentuate the roundness of your face.

,
Wavy and layered shag with soft edges will help soften the impact of your well defined jaw line. Ensure you ask your stylist to cut the shortest layer in line with your chin.
Opt for side swept bangs over blunt bangs to minimize the emphasis on your forehead. Go for side parting instead of middle parting
Avoid sharp cuts like the classic bob which will only further highlight your strong jaw.

, Adding bouncy waves to this hairstyle is even better as it will give the illusion of width.
An experimental yet stylish hairstyle that you can try if you dare is a sleek crop with side swept bangs. If you are willing to show off your pointed chin, this style is perfect for you.
Settle for long and side-swept bangs that cover your broad forehead.
Avoid hairstyles that add height at the crown as this may increase focus to your slender jaw line.

, Adding texture and waves to this hairstyle will help camouflage the narrowness of your face.
Opt for a side parting as the diagonal direction emphasizes the cheekbones and creates the illusion of an oval shape.
Bardot bangs work beautifully for diamond shaped faces as they help add some width to your narrow hairline.
Avoid hairstyles with too much volume at the crown.

, Before choosing any short hairstyle that suits your face shape, make sure it blends well with your personality and doesn’t hinder your professional standing.

, Reach out to a good hairstylist if you are opting for a drastic change of hairstyle. Remember, a haircut gone wrong takes a long time to outgrow.

, Once you have weighed all the pros and cons, get a haircut and flaunt your edgy new look.

Do you want to look powerful, professional, or polished? If so, a sleek bob or a pixie with long sidebangs may be your best bet.Do you want a practical hair cut to cut down on styling time? A pixie cut, chin-length bob, or short layers may work well for you.
Do you want to create volume for thinning or fine hair? A fringed or layered look may help.

, Once you have an idea of what type of style you might go for, you can look through magazines, fashion blogs, and style websites for inspiration about the specific style that you want.

Look into new accessory choices.",How to Convince Yourself to Cut Your Hair Shorter2," If your hair is very long, try trimming an inch (or less) off each visit to the salon and scheduling a number of visits close to one another. This will give you time to consider a variety of different lengths and to learn more about various styling options.


Planning several different cuts will also give you time to see how your hair ‘settles’ after a trim. It usually takes a week to see the true final product as the newly cut strands intermix with the old., Do you want a textured and choppy feel? Would you prefer a smooth and sleek look? Buy an assortment of products, from straightening gels to lightweight waxes, and try them out, rotating every few days. Ask yourself, “What works with my hair texture now?”It is a myth that shorter haircuts require less styling and, therefore, are cheaper. If you want a short cut that requires the very minimal product usage, make sure to express this to your stylist.

, Take another glance at your example photos and pay attention to their fashion and jewelry choices. Short hair will show your ears more, so you might want to consider getting your ears pierced. Or, play with the possibility of emphasizing the now-visible length of your neck by wearing high-necked shirts.

Consider your lifestyle.,

Experiment with a wig.,
Recall past haircuts.,
Remember that it will grow out again.",How to Convince Yourself to Cut Your Hair Shorter3," Sit down, take out a pen and paper, and create a t-chart with “pros” on one side and “cons” on the other. Add specific examples to both sides, such as “I like the idea that shorter hair will make me look younger.” Or, “I’m afraid I’ll look bald if it is cut too short.”


Just the process of writing down your concerns will help you to feel more in control of this process. After all, it is your body and your choice in the end.For example, getting regular trims (every six to eight weeks) prevents split ends and breakage that travels up the hair shaft. So, scheduling regular hair appointments (even to just trim a small amount) will see health benefits in the long term., Ask yourself, “What are my professional obligations regarding appearance?” “How much time do I have to devote to hair care?” “Do I need a cut that can withstand certain athletic activities?” For example, if you are used to wearing a ponytail you may want a cut that will keep hair strands away from your face., Ask them about their routine and what they perceive as the benefits, as opposed to longer hair. Get them to detail their salon experience and how, and why, they made the decision to go short. You could say, “What is the best thing about having short hair?”, Purchase a short wig made out of a high quality material (such as human hair) and wear it for a trial period. Don’t just stay indoors-go out on a date or meet friends for drinks wearing your new acquisition. Ask them what they think and pay attention to how you feel with short hair.The sensation of wearing a wig will be foreign to you (the ways it acts in wet weather, the feel of the strands, etc.), so try to concentrate primarily on the length and feel of the cut itself. Ask yourself, “Do I prefer this length or a bit longer? Do I think these layers are flattering?”

, Remember that time that you gave yourself a bob or that really poor-choice perm? Visualize and recount these experiences in as much detail as you can. You made it through these moments, so any decision you make now has to be better, right?

, Remind yourself that this is really only a short-term change. If you dislike the final product, your hair will grow back to its former length and will, quite possibly, be healthier as a result. If it helps, repeat the mantra to yourself, “Change is good.”

Determine your face shape.,
Emphasize your best features.,
Minimize your flaws.,
Discover your hair texture.,
Avoid blunt hairstyles.",How to Choose a Short Hairstyle As an Older Woman2," Face shape is an important way of deciding what type of hair cut will look best on you. To determine your face shape, take a wash-off marker (such as a dry erase marker) and stand in front of a mirror. Try to outline your face with the marker, and decide which shape best describes it: oval, round, heart, or square.


Oval face shapes look good with any type of cut. You might try a pixie or a bob.
Round face shapes benefit well from soft layers or asymmetrical cuts.For a heart shaped face, you might try wispy bangs, an asymmetrical cut, or a chin-length bob.
If you have a square face, you might try styles that are parted to the side, or you might soften your face with layers or curls., A haircut can bring attention to the best parts of your face. Decide what your favorite feature is. You may want to alter the length of your cut based on what you are trying to emphasize.


If you want to bring attention to your smile, choose a style that is lip length.
If you want to bring attention to your cheekbones, either a pixie-cut or cheek-length cut may help.
You can bring attention to your eyes by choosing a cut that ends around your ears., Haircuts can also help conceal or reduce certain features. If you are uncomfortable or unhappy with a certain feature of your face, try to find a haircut that will either draw attention away from it or that will gently cover it.


If you are worried about the softness of your face, you can use an angled cut that helps create shape in your face.
If your jawline is causing concern, a jaw-length cut with soft layers can hide and distract from it.
If you do not like your forehead wrinkles, you can use sideswept bangs to bring attention to your eyes instead., The texture of your hair is defined by the thickness of each individual strand. If your strands are thin and fragile, you have fine hair. If your strands are sturdy or thick, you have coarse hair.If you have thick or coarse hair, you may be able to pull off a straight pixie cut. Add tapered ends or an angled side swept bang for a more youthful look.
As women age, they may find that their hair is changing texture. Perhaps it is becoming thinner or more brittle. It may be losing volume as a result. To add volume to thinning hair, try a fringed, layered look. You can also go for a stacked haircut, where the lower layers are cut longer than the higher layers., It is important to avoid blunt, straight lines in your hair. These can age your appearance and are generally not flattering to older women. Instead choose soft looks with layers, tapered ends, curls, or angled cuts. These can add both volume and style to your look.


Instead of straight-cut bangs, go for bangs that are swept to the side or wispy bangs.A one-length hairstyle without layers may not be the most flattering hairstyle for an older woman. If you want to get a bob, consider having it cut longer in either the front or the back.

Work with your complexion.,
Add highlights.,
Go bold.,
Embrace gray.",How to Choose a Short Hairstyle As an Older Woman3," Your complexion can help you determine the best color for your hairstyle. Choose a color that flatters your complexion. A good color will make your skin appear bright and healthy; it will not wash your complexion out or make you look tired.


If you have an olive or dark complexion, you can choose from brown, burgundy, and blond colors.
Lighter shades are often recommended for women over fifty, unless you have a pale complexion. In that case, you might want to go slightly darker.If you already dye your hair, you might try going just one shade lighter to see how it looks on you., Highlights add definition to your hair color, and they make your hair color look more natural. Choose natural highlights that pair well with your chosen hair color. A hairstylist can help you decide on the right color.


Highlights should only be one to two shades lighter than your main color.
Warm and golden highlights may be better suited for older women than cool or bright tones.Babylights, which are fine strands of highlighted hair, give your hair a natural and youthful dimension. They’re a good choice for those who do not want to draw attention to their highlights, and they can work for a variety of hair colors.
If you are dying your own hair, look for hair dyes that offer natural highlights or that provide highlighting tools in the kit.

, Just because you are getting older does not mean that you have to stick to natural colors. Bold, bright colors can express your personality and still look great.


An ombre hair color can add definition to your hair while making you look younger.If your hair is graying, you have the perfect base for a pastel color, such as lavender or light pink. These are very trendy looks that can give you a pop of color., Gray or white hair can appear sophisticated. If your hair is graying, don’t be afraid to rock your new color. Instead of dying your hair, you can make it sleek and shiny by conditioning it often.


Gray hair looks great with sharp and sleek hairstyles, such as a straight bob.
Wash your hair at least every other day to keep it clean and shiny.
Use a shine spray instead of heavy pomade or oils to style your hair without making it look greasy or dull."

, Oval faces are similar in proportion to round faces, but more elongated. The chin and the forehead are about the same width, with slightly wider cheekbones and smooth lines going down to the chin.

Resist the temptation to smile in the picture. You want to be able to figure out your face's shape in its most natural position, and smiling might make it harder to tell.
If you don't have a camera, stand in front of the mirror and use an old lipstick or a dry erase marker to trace the shape of your face. You should trace around your chin, past your ears, and around your hairline.;
, Examine the picture you took, or the outline you drew. What shape does it most closely resemble? Is it round, square, heart-shaped or oval? Everyone's face is different, of course, and you may find that yours doesn't closely match one of the most common shapes. Answer the following questions to help you figure out which one comes closest:


Is your face as wide as it is long? You're probably a square or a circle.
Is your face longer than it is wide? You come closest to an oval.
Is your chin angular and squared off? Most people with square-shaped faces have angular chins.
Does your chin come to a pretty point? Your face may be heart-shaped, especially if you also have a widow's peak.

, Bring out the best in your softer, round features by contrasting them with some edge. Go for sleek lines and tapered ends, and avoid bulky hairstyles.


Consider a medium-length cut with layers that frame your face. Have the styles make your shortest layer fall below your ears. Your longest layer should fall a few inches below your chin.
Longer cuts look great with round faces because they tend to lengthen the features. Consider long wavy layers to contrast the roundness.
Asymmetrical styles can be a bold, beautiful move for people with round faces. Long, layered bangs create edgy angles that offset round features. An angled bob is another great choice.
Consider a pixie cut to bring out your apple cheeks and make your eyes look larger.

, Square faces look beautiful with haircuts that call attention to the strong jaws and bold lines. Alternatively, harsh angles can be softened with cuts designed to bring focus to the eyes and mouth, rather than the face's edges.


A tousled chin-length bob makes the perfect frame for a square jaw, highlighting its angular beauty.
Long curls and waves can offset severe angles.
Long, straight hair provides an interesting contrast to a square face.
Avoid extremely short cuts, which may draw too much attention to the lower portion of the face, making it look larger.

, Oval faces tend to look incredible with a wide range of haircuts. Layers, bangs, curls and waves can help offset longer faces. Keeping an average hair length, rather than a very long or very short one, can also make the face look less long.


Blunt, straight bangs are a pretty choice for oval faces. They bring out the eyes and contrast with a defined chin.
Long, soft waves are a classic look for people with oval faces.
Shoulder-length bobs bring attention to the jawline, bringing out the best in an oval-shaped face.
If you want to go short, try an angled cut with some longer pieces, rather than getting a pixie cut.

, Medium and long-length hair is a good choice for heart-shaped faces; it provides balance to the face by filling in the area around the chin.


Accentuate cheekbones on a heart-shaped face with bangs or layers that end right at the cheeks.
Side-swept bangs bring out the eyes and downplay the forehead of a heart-shaped face.
A pixie cut with bangs can be a wonderful choice for a heart-shaped face, since it highlights the elegant chin and makes the eyes look larger.

, Browse through the thousands of resources available online to look at different people's face shapes and the cuts they chose. When it's time to go to the salon, print out some pictures of your favorite cuts, so the stylist knows what you have in mind.


Kirsten Dunst and Ginnifer Goodwin have round face shapes.
Salma Hayek and Lucy Liu have square face shapes.
Jada Pinkett and Megan Fox have oval face shapes.
Reese Witherspoon and Christina Ricci have heart face shapes.

, Your stylist is very familiar with what cuts look best with what face shapes, so his her or him as a resource. Don't be afraid to ask for advice - just make sure you don't get talked into a cut you don't really want.

, If you adore pixie cuts and simply have to try one even though your face is square, get a pixie cut. If you wear it with confidence and flair it will look good - and if it doesn't, just wait until it grows out and try something else.

Pick a style that works with your hair's texture.,
Choose a style for thin hair.,
Work with your thick hair.,
Be aware that medium-thick hair can hold many styles.",How to Choose a Hairstyle2," Hair comes in a variety of textures—from limp and silky thin hair to frizzy and bouncy coarse hair—and you should style yours accordingly.


For instance, a short and choppy fast cut that works on straight, thin hair may not look good on someone with thick and curly hair.

, If you have thin hair with a silky texture, avoid wearing it in a long, blunt style that can make you look childish. Instead, favor volume-creating layers and try a shorter cut that hits at your shoulders or above.


Try to avoid blunt cut bangs; opt instead for a side swept look.

, If you have thick, coarse hair with natural curl or wave, don't cut it too short—you'll end up with ""Christmas tree"" hair that's full and bushy at the bottom before tapering up to your head. Hair that's prone to frizz usually needs a little length to weigh it down.


Consider cuts that start at the chin or below, and go longer if your hair is frizzier.

, If your hair is of medium thickness with a ""normal"" texture, you can use a short or long style. Play around with your hair and keep your face shape in mind.

For instance, if you love the length of your neck, try a short haircut or a high updo to show off your neck.
To draw attention to your eyes, get brow-skimming bangs that make your eyes pop.

, The right haircut can help you hide or downplay features you don't like as much.


If you have wide ears, avoid a cut that's too short as well as severe ponytails and buns (or, for men, wear the sides a little longer to create the illusion of comparable width around the ears).
If you have a broad, deep forehead, you can cover it up with bangs.

If you dislike the length of your neck, hide it with long layers.

, Coloring your hair can be extremely high-maintenance, but it can also help even out your skin tone and improve your overall appearance. Selecting the right shade and tone can be tricky, so consult your stylist about which color would look best with your skin tone.

Think about maintenance.,
Put it all together.",How to Choose a Hairstyle4," While keeping your face shape and hair texture in mind is important, you should also play around with your hair to see what sort of styles you like the most. Stand in front of a mirror and try out a bunch of different styles, or fold your hair up to see what it would be like to have short hair. Try straightening your hair, or curling it to see if you like the way it looks. For men, try spiking it or slicking it back.Ultimately, you should get a cut that will make you feel confident and happy, regardless of whether or not it compliments your appearance. Your cut should be based on your own personal preferences.

, Look up your face shape online and browse through images of people with your face shape. Consider what kind of haircuts the people in these photos have, and whether or not you would want that haircut.


If you find one that you like, print out the picture and take it to your hairstylist.

, If you are having a difficult time figuring out what hairstyle you want, set up an appointment with a hairstylist to talk about your possibilities. You won’t have to get your haircut then and there, but having the opinion of a professional may help you to make your decision.

, Consider how much time you're willing to put into your hairstyle every day. If you don't like spending more than five minutes on your hair in the morning, then you might not be happy with several layers that have to be straightened or curled each day.


Remember that for a short look, you'll have to get another hair cut every three or four weeks to maintain the length.
Longer hair, on the other hand, can go up to six to eight weeks without a trim, but special attention must be paid to avoid split ends and heat damage.

, Now that you've evaluated face shape, hair texture, facial features and maintenance, choose a hairstyle that you feel will bring all of these aspects together.


Find a compromise. For instance, if you've found a really great cut that you think would look great on your square face but you're worried about wearing thin hair in a long, ask your stylist if there's any way to add some volume. He or she will be happy to work with you and design the right cut for your needs.

Keep it short.,
Go with a combover.,
Style it up for added height.,
Shave it off.",How to Choose a Haircut for Guys with Thinning Hair1," Generally speaking, the number one rule of dealing with thinning hair is to not let it get too long. This applies to men with both straight and curly hair, and anything in between. Close-cropped cuts will give your hair a more uniform appearance and make inconsistencies in fullness less noticeable. For most hairstyles, a length of about an inch or less will work best for minimizing the appearance of thin patches.
Trying to compensate for hair loss by leaving hair longer in certain areas usually just highlights the thin spots.;
, Smooth your hair in one direction so that it lays over spots with the most thinning. This technique will be especially useful if most of the thinning is concentrated around the crown. Combover styles are versatile because they allow you to slick your hair back, part it to one side or brush it down for a more tousled look.For best results, leave the hair on your crown a bit longer (around an inch) to cover more area, and move a shallow part deeper to one side.A combover won’t always be able to hide everything. If bare patches are still peeking through, it may be worth it to give a more subtle style a shot.

, Work a little low-hold product into your hair, then comb or tease it with your fingers until it comes to a subtle point over the crown. By drawing the hair inward toward the center, you can conceal bald spots and create the illusion of height and thickness. You can even while preserving your natural part—just use a comb to coax the hair upward before sweeping it over.Piled-up styles will look best with cuts that preserve a little length on top while keeping the hair short on the back and sides.
Gathering the hair in the middle will be especially useful for men with fine, straight hair, which tends to have a harder time providing coverage over the scalp., If the thinning is already fairly advanced, or if you’ve begun balding all over, the best solution may be to just take a trimmer to what’s left. A buzzcut will help make bare patches less obvious by bringing the hair closer to the scalp all over. Less hair means cutting, grooming and styling to deal with.Buzz thinning hair down to a quarter inch or shorter, or go all the way and shave all the way down to the skin.Many men prefer the freedom and ease of upkeep that shaved hairstyles offer.

Type something like ""Spring hair trends"" into a search engine and see what comes up. You can browse styles online and see if you find anything you like. If you find a style you would like to try, make an appointment with your stylist.;
, A light trim is a good start to altering your hair for the spring. A trim can leave you feeling refreshed and new. It can also provide a clean, neat slate from which to build a new style. Stop by your salon and ask for a trim.While getting your trim, ask your stylist what spring style could suit you. You can think over your options for a few days before making a decision.

, Hair accessories that reflect spring are a great way to add to your style. If you're not quite ready for any major changes, play around with accessories to give your hair a light touch of spring.As spring is a time for new life, look into floral accessories. Opt for things like flower patterned headbands or flower hair clips.
Go for pastels. Try wearing pastel bandanas, hats, or visors to celebrate spring.

, Side bangs can be a cute look for spring, and can trim down some of the hair surrounding your face. This can help you stay cool during warm weather. If you're interested in getting bangs, talk to your stylist about doing a side bang look for the spring.If you already have bangs, consider growing them out until your stylist is able to snip them into side bangs.

, If you want to go shorter for the spring, ask your stylist for a face-framing bob. A bob, with light bangs, can be a great, lighter look for the spring months. A hairstylist should be able to find a bob that best frames your face., If you want a lighter style without cutting your hair too short, go for layers. These work great with longer bangs. It can give you a lighter look while allowing you to maintain longer hair., If you want to make a bold move, get your hair trimmed short for the spring.

Grow your hair out.,
Comb it down.,
Try out an undercut.,
Cut your hair in uneven layers.",How to Choose a Haircut for Guys with Thinning Hair2," When you first notice your hairline starting to recede in front, it will help to put on a little extra length. You can then slick the hair back, presenting a full, sleek look. As an added bonus, slicked hair will naturally appear thicken when it’s laying in the same direction.Though most style experts advise against longer cuts on men with thinning hair, with the right length and arrangement they can work wonders.
Just be careful not to let the hair get too long, or you could end up looking like you’re trying to overcompensate.

, Arrange your fringe so that it drapes over your forehead. The result is a casual mid-length style that neutralizes a retreating hairline without being too conspicuous. Men with straight hair can stick with a modest length, while those with wavy and curly locks should plan on going a little longer to make the most of the screen that the added volume provides.Like piled-up styles, this look will be most successful with hair that’s longer on top and shorter on the sides.
Work with your natural part or let the hair come together in a precise point rather than simply letting it hang in your face., Undercuts are a throwback style for men in which the hair on the sides is closely cropped or buzzed, leaving all the length and thickness on the crown. This may be just what you need to fight back against a hairline that’s receding at the temples. Undercuts draw the eye to the fuller hair on top while making thinner areas look intentional.High blended hairstyles are also a popular choice among many actors, models and celebrities, making them a timely and fashionable solution.
As an alternative to a more exaggerated undercut (which can look somewhat dated), consider a close and clean military-inspired high-and-tight., Trim the hair in sections along the crown and let them fall loosely together. The overlapping layers will help reinforce thickness in places where it’s needed most. Textural depth is also useful for making hair appear more plentiful.The basic idea behind layers is that they “stack” on top of one another, enhancing volume.
Layered cuts will work best for a more playful, casual aesthetic, as they can be tough to style neatly for dressed-up situations.

Wash your hair every other day.,
Shave patchy balding spots.,
Grow out your facial hair.",How to Choose a Haircut for Guys with Thinning Hair3," Natural oils and residue from styling products can weigh the hair down, causing it to look flat and lifeless. Regular rinses with shampoo will strip away this buildup and give thinning hair some much-needed lift. Start shampooing three to four times a week (about every other time you shower), assuming you don’t already, and finish with a blow dryer to give your hair an extra fluffy texture. Choose shampoos and conditioners that are formulated to make hair more voluminous.Avoid oversaturating newly-washed hair with greasy products. These will reduce volume and leave it limp.

, No combover is going to cover a crown with an erratic balding pattern. Keep your hair short and neatly groomed to prevent pervasive hair loss from commanding too much notice. Use a razor to do away with stray tufts that stand out on darker colored hair.Multiple small bald spots can be even more noticeable than one big one.
If you’re balding all over, including the back and sides, you may have little choice but to opt for a short buzz or clean-shaven cut.

, A fashionable mustache, goatee or beard will call attention away from flagging head hair and instead complement your other features. This can suggest a graceful maturation in the way you present yourself. Well-kept facial hair also tends to make older men look more distinguished, showing that you take your appearance seriously.Sprout a layer of thick stubble for youthful, rugged air, or play up your masculinity with a full beard.Facial hair is always in style, and can stand on its own no matter how much (or little) hair you have on your head.

Consult your doctor about chronic yellow nails.",How to Whiten Nails," Denture cleaners can contain one of several different active ingredients, but each cleanser has some type of active ingredient that is capable of stripping away stains from hard, white surfaces.


Dissolve a denture cleaner tablet in a dish of warm water according the the label instructions. Make sure that the tablet is completely dissolved so that you get the full benefit of the cleanser it contains.
Soak your hands in the diluted denture cleaner for five minutes. When done, rinse lightly in clean, warm water and pat dry.
Repeat this treatment a few times a week for continued improvement.;
, A soak made from hydrogen peroxide and baking soda can be a very effective stain remover.


Mix 1/2 cup (125 ml) hot water with 1 tsp (5 ml) 30% hydrogen peroxide and 1 Tbsp (15 ml) baking soda in a small plastic bowl. Stir with a spoon until the powder dissolves.
Dip your nails into the solution for 1 to 10 minutes, or until the stains disappear.
Wash your hands with soap and water when done. Apply lotion or moisturizing cream to your hands when done, as well, since peroxide can be harsh on your skin.

, The acidic properties of lemon juice can help dissolve away stain particles in your nails, and the soapy water can further assist in the removal of those particles from the surface of your nails.


Soap helps the process by binding with the particles of stain-causing debris after the lemon lifts those particles from the surface of the nail. This makes it easier to wash those particles away.
Mix 1/4 cup (60 ml) lemon juice with 1 cup (250 ml) warm water and 1 to 2 Tbsp (15 to 30 ml) gentle liquid soap in a plastic or glass bowl.
Soak your nails in this mixture for 5 minutes.Rinse your nails with running water when done, and apply a lotion or moisturizing cream to prevent your skin from drying out too severely.

, Vinegar is another mild acid capable of stripping away stain particles from hard surfaces. Make sure that you use white vinegar, however, since an apple cider vinegar, balsamic vinegar, or other color vinegar could actually stain your nail in the process.


Pour 1 cup (250 ml) of warm water into a bowl and add 1 tsp to 1 Tbsp (5 to 15 ml) of distilled white vinegar.
Soak your nails in this mixture for 8 minutes.
When done, rinse your nails under lukewarm, running water and pat dry. Apply a lotion to your skin to prevent it from drying out.

, If your nails became stained after you used a dark nail polish, you might be able to get rid of some mild stains by reapplying more commercial nail polish remover.









Soak a cotton pad or cotton ball in nail polish remover. One containing acetone will probably be more effective since acetone is a fairly strong ingredient.
Scrub the stained areas of your nails with the soaked cotton. After 15 to 30 seconds, you should notice some difference. If not, then you may need to try another solution.
This remedy may not work if your nails are stained with anything other than nail polish.

, Baking soda is a powerful home cleaning agent that can assist in everything from odor absorption to stain removal. Mixing baking soda with a little hydrogen peroxide can create an effective scrub for your nails.









Combine 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of 3% hydrogen peroxide with 2 1/2 Tbsp (37.5 ml) baking soda in a small bowl or dish.Stir with a spoon or chopstick until the two ingredients are thoroughly combined into a paste.
Using a cotton swab, apply the paste over the top of each nail and under the tip of each nail. Cover all the nails on one hand.
Wait for three minutes before rinsing the paste off your nails with warm water. Repeat with your other hand.
You should notice some difference after the first application. For better results, though, repeat this remedy once every six to eight weeks.

,









Apply the toothpaste to each nail, using a pea-sized dollop or less for each.
Rub the toothpaste into your nails using a nail brush or an old toothbrush.
Let it sit for 5 minutes, then rinse with warm water.
Repeat this treatment a few times weekly for notably whiter nails.

, If you have sensitive, dry skin or damaged cuticles, a better option would be to rub the lemon directly on your nails.









If you have a leftover lemon half that has recently been squeezed and still feels moist along the inner flesh, rub the flesh of the lemon directly over your nails, working on each nail for about 30 to 60 seconds. The lemon half should still contain enough juice to be effective.
If using lemon juice, dip a cotton swab or cotton ball into the juice and thoroughly rub it over your nails. Let it sit on your nails for 10 to 30 minutes before rinsing your hands with warm water.

, Combining lemon juice with a bit of baking soda can form an even more powerful cleansing paste for your nails.









Mix 1 Tbsp (15 ml) lemon juice with 2 to 3 Tbsp (30 to 45 ml) baking soda. Stir together in a small plastic or glass dish until a paste forms.
Use a cotton swab to apply the paste over the tops of your nails and underneath the tip of each nail.
Let the paste sit on your nails for 10 to 15 minutes before washing it away with soap and water.

, Salt can act as a gentle buffer, so when you combine it with stain-fighting lemon juice, you can help buff away any stains while simultaneously polishing your nails naturally.









Combine equal parts lemon juice and salt in a small glass or plastic container. A grainy scrub should form.
Apply this scrub to your hands, focusing on your nails. Let it sit on your nails for about 5 minutes.
Rinse with lukewarm water when done.

, If you need an immediate fix, you can purchase a nail-whitening pencil from a convenience store and touch up your nails. These pencils do not fix the underlying stain, but they will help you mask those stains for the time being.


A nail whitening pencil looks similar to an eyeliner pencil. Make sure that the tip is as sharp as possible for an easier application.
Lightly moisten the tip of the pencil or moisten the tips of your nails with a little water.
Color evenly along the underside of your nail tips. Let it set, and reapply the pencil as needed each time you wash your hands.

, Regularly buffing your nails with a gentle nail buffer can gently scrap away any stains while giving your nails a healthy-looking shine.









Do not use a nail file to remove stains. Nail files, especially metal files, can get rid of stains but will greatly weaken your nails in the process.
Use an actual nail buffer to buff the nails. Rub the buffer over each nail for 20 to 30 seconds to give it a shine and help minimize stains.
If using a nail buffer with multiple steps, follow the label instructions to determine proper use.
Follow this procedure once a week or so.

, In the future, you can prevent additional stains by brushing a base coat over your nails before applying your nail polish.









Apply a base coat product to your nails immediately before applying nail polish. Once it dries, you can apply your polish as usual.
Base coat fills in the cracks and crevices in the nail surface, making it harder for color pigmentation to find its way into those crevices and settling in.
You can also use base coat without applying nail polish since it can also protect your nails against other potential stains.

, If your nails are chronically yellow, there could be an underlying medical condition at work. Talk to your doctor to determine if this might be the case.


Yellowed nails could be a sign of yellow nail syndrome, which is often a sign of respiratory disease or a swelling of the hands.Nail discoloration could be a sign of fungal infection, as well, and about half of patients who suffer with chronically discolored nails do so due to an infection.Nail discoloration can, at rare times, also indicate a problem with the liver, kidney, or heart.

, A good facial starts with a fresh, clean face, so use your favorite cleanser to gently wash away makeup, dirt and sweat before you begin. Wet your face with warm water, apply the cleanser using a gentle circular motion, and rinse your face with warm water when you're finished.


Use warm or cool water, rather than hot or cold. Room temperature water is best for your facial skin.
If you want to create your own luxurious cleanser, try using oil. Rub olive oil, almond oil or jojoba oil into your skin, then wipe it off with a towel dampened with warm water. This makes a great makeup remover and leaves your skin soft and moist.

, The hallmark of a great facial is bright, refreshed looking skin. Exfoliating is a very important part of the process. Apply your scrub using a gentle circular motion to slough away the dead skin and reveal fresh skin underneath. You can make your own scrub at home using all natural products you probably already have in your kitchen. Try one of these combinations:For oily skin: mix 1 teaspoon sugar, 1 teaspoon honey and 1 teaspoon water
For normal skin: 1 teaspoon ground oatmeal, 1 teaspoon honey and 1 teaspoon milk
For dry skin: mix 1 teaspoon ground almonds, 1 teaspoon honey and 1 teaspoon olive oil

, Use lukewarm water to rinse off the scrub. Make sure to rinse carefully around your eyes and nose so you don't leave any of the scrub on your face. When you're finished, pat your face dry with a soft towel.

, Massaging your face increases circulation in your facial tissue, causing your skin to feel and look refreshed. In addition to making your skin look beautiful, it helps combat puffiness and wrinkles and relieves stress. Do a facial massage using this technique:


Massage your cheeks with your fingertips using a wide circular motion. Move your fingers up to your nostrils, over your cheekbones and back around. Repeat for one minute.
Massage your forehead, starting with the temples and moving in toward the center. Repeat for one minute.
Massage your eye area, starting at the arch of your brow, moving down past the outer corner of your eyes, sweeping under your eyes toward your nose, and back up to your brows. Repeat for one minute.

Place a small pot of water on the stove and bring it to a simmer. Drape a towel over your head and place your face over the pot, so that the steam hits your face. Keep steaming for face for three to five minutes, then turn off the heat.

For normal skin: mix 1 tablespoon yogurt and 1 tablespoon honey
For dry skin: mix 1/2 mashed banana and 1 tablespoon honey

, Smooth it over your skin and let it sit for a good 20 minutes so it has time to nourish your skin. In the meantime, do one of the following treatments to make the most of your facial:


Reduce eye puffiness by closing your eyes and placing cucumber slices over them for five minutes.
Deal with chapped lips by using a toothbrush to scrub away dead skin. Apply lip balm when you're finished.
Moisturize your neck, from your chest all the way up to your chin. Your neck skin is as delicate as your facial skin, and shouldn't be neglected.

, Gently splash warm water on your face to wash it away, making sure to get every last bit of honey. Any bits of honey left behind will make your face feel sticky. Pat your face dry with a towel. Take a look in the mirror. Is your face glowing by now?

, After opening your pores with the steam and mask treatment, it's time to use some toner. Toning your skin closes your pores, which helps your skin look bright and youthful. Just splash some on your face and let it soak in; wipe away the excess with a towel. You can make your own toner using any of the following:


Plain cool water
1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar mixed with 1 teaspoon cool waterWitch hazel
Rosewater

For oily skin: jojoba oil or aloe
For normal skin: olive oil or almond oil

Use a heat protectant before heat styling.",How to De Poof Hair," Hair gets poofy and frizzy when it’s dry. While washing your hair cleans it, it also strips your locks of the natural oils that keep it moisturized and more manageable. To keep your hair from getting poofy, wash it every other day at most.If you already wash your hair every other day and it’s still poofy, try two days between washes.
When your hair looks a little greasy between washes, add a little dry shampoo to freshen it up.;
, When you do wash your hair, it’s important to use the right products to keep it from getting too big and poofy. Your best bet is a moisturizing shampoo that will clean your hair while still keeping it hydrated. Look for a shampoo that’s infused with moisturizing ingredients, such as argan oil, macadamia oil, vitamin-E, and other emollients.Make sure that your shampoo is sulfate-free. Sulfates are the sudsing agents that allow a shampoo to work up a rich lather. They can be extremely drying on the hair, so it’s best to avoid them.

, When you’re finished washing your hair, drying it in the right way can help keep it from getting poofy or frizzy. Rubbing a towel over your hair can cause breakage that makes it look poofy. Instead of rubbing, gently blot the towel over your locks to get rid of the excess water.It’s best not to twist the towel around your hair either. That can also lead to frizz.
For the best results, use a microfiber towel to dry your hair. It creates less friction so your hair isn’t as likely to become poofy.

, When you want to keep your hair from getting poofy, you’re better off letting it air dry rather than blow drying it. That’s why it’s best to wash your hair before you go to bed so it has all night to dry. Wash at least 30 minutes before you plan to go to sleep, though.To wake up with the most manageable hair, apply a styling cream from root to tip after washing it. Next, pull your hair back into a tight bun at the nape of your neck and go to sleep. In the morning, undo the bun and you’ll have soft, sleek waves. Run your fingers through them to gently separate them.

, Your hair is more likely to become poofy if it’s dehydrated. To make sure that it has enough moisture, be sure to follow up every shampoo with a rich conditioner. Look for a formula that contains proteins, natural oils, and emollients such as shea butter.For the most hydrated hair, leave your conditioner on for 3 to 5 minutes in the shower. That will give the moisturizing ingredients enough time to penetrate your hair.

, While a traditional conditioner will help moisturize your hair, you ultimately wash it out so your hair may start to get dry and poofy over time. To keep it sleek, use a leave-in conditioner that will hydrate your hair throughout the day. Work it through your hair while it’s still damp to lock in the moisture.If your hair is thick and coarse, use a lotion or cream leave-in conditioner.
If your hair is fine, use a spray leave-in conditioner.

, Even using a traditional conditioner and leave-in conditioner every time you wash your hair may not be enough to prevent it from becoming dry and poofy. Incorporate a deep conditioner or hair mask into your hair care routine for an intense dose of hydration at least once a week.Follow the instructions on the hair mask’s packaging to determine the proper way to use it. In most cases, you apply it to wet hair after you’ve washed it and allow it to sit for 20 to 30 minutes before rinsing it out.
Wear a shower cap or plastic wrap over the hair mask to create some heat when you’re wearing it. That will help it penetrate the hair more easily, so it is fully hydrated.
If you hair gets extremely poofy, you may want to use a deep conditioner every time that you wash your hair. You can also wear the mask overnight and wash it out in the morning for more hydration. Just be sure to cover your head to keep the mask from getting on your sheets.

, Some haircuts can encourage frizziness and leave you with poofy hair. To keep your locks from getting poofy, avoid short and heavily layered styles. Instead, opt for styles that feature blunt ends with just a few long layers. The length and weight of the cut will help keep your hair from poofing up.You should also avoid texturizing, thinning or razor cutting, which has a tendency to promote frizziness.

, When you get out of the shower, don’t use a brush to detangle your hair. Brushes are too rough and can snag your hair when it’s at its most fragile. Instead, use a wide tooth comb to gently work through the tangles so your hair doesn’t become frizzy.A wooden comb is the best option because it won’t generate static electricity, which can lead to frizz.
When you need to use a brush on dry hair, opt for a natural bristle style. They are less rough on your hair than synthetic bristles.

, If your hair is dry, it will soak up all of the moisture in the air, which means that it can become super poofy in humid weather. To ensure that your hair behaves no matter what the weather, use a hair oil, such as argan, jojoba, or coconut, or anti-frizz serum to seal and protect your hair.If you’re applying oil to wet hair, place a few drops in your palm, rub it between your hands, and gently smooth it throughout your hair.
If you’re using oil on dry hair, apply a drop to the tips of your fingers. Gently work it through the ends of your hair from the ears down to fight the poofiness.

, Heat styling isn’t a good idea if your hair is prone to poofiness -- but using a flat iron can give you sleek, smooth hair, so straightening it can be tempting. If you must heat style your hair, always use a heat protectant product beforehand. It coats your hair so none of its natural moisture is striped when you use the heat.For thick, coarse hair, look for a lotion or cream heat protectant.
For fine, thin hair, opt for a heat protectant spray.

, Avoid using too much conditioner by focusing on its contents. Use conditioners that are so concentrated that you only need a small dollop. Avoid using volumizing conditioners.Use a deep-treatment mask every third shampoo or once a week if the ends of your hair are extremely damaged. If the damage is only slight, you may use it once a month.If you want soft and smooth hair you have to retain your hair’s moisture with quality hydrating conditioner and shampoo.
The secret to getting the softest, smoothest hair possible is retaining moisture in your hair. It’s important to start with a quality hydrating shampoo and conditioner.

Products like Macadamia Oil Deep Conditioning Treatment and Silktage Rejuvenating Styling Serum can smoothen coarse hair., Humidity can cause a lot frizz. Products with keratin can fill out your hair cuticles and reduce frizz. You may use products like keratin Spray throughout the year. Remember to take the time to work in the product so that it reaches down to the cuticle., If you have really thick hair you may find it extremely difficult to get a blowout. Rough-dry your hair so that there’s only 10-20 percent left to dry. Use a smoothing nozzle on your dryer to dry the remainder of your hair.Rough-drying works best for wavy and straight hair. Use the smoothing nozzle when there is 20-30 percent left to dry to avoid opening your cuticles too much with rough-drying.

, If you have thick hair, you're probably used to your hair-drying being an all-day event. If you prefer to air-dry, speed up the process by using a head-wrap towel that will absorb more moisture than a regular towel. And if you prefer to blow-dry, try a primer that will reduce the time it takes to fully dry hair., Wash your hair 30 minutes before you sleep and allow it to air-dry overnight. Use a half-barrel curling iron in the morning by splitting your hair into about 12 sections. Swoop your iron through each section, making sure to go all the way to the ends of your hair. This will create a blowout look but in less time than a salon., Avoid cowlicks or uncontrollable bedhead with a topknot. Turn your head upside down, gather your hair and twist it into a ponytail.

Avoid too much layering because your hair may look like a triangle., Mid-length hair may look like a helmet when thick hair gets too big for a choppy bob. Ask your stylist to add dimension to a chin-length cut by adding layers. Get rid of fluffiness with a balm or silky wax. You need product to anchor your pouf and weigh down your hair while still allowing it to move. Consult your stylist to choose the right product to bring out the dimension to your hair while weighing it down.

, Thinning shears and razors may damage your hair or cause frizz if not utilized correctly. Tell your stylist if thinning shears have damaged your hair in the past. Use them only on the ends of your hair if you are prone to frizziness.Ask your stylist to use a different method to thin out your hair or give you layers if thinning shears and razors have damaged your hair in the past.

, Look online or talk to your stylist to find braids that suit your style. Braids look great with thick hair and keep your volume under control. If you can’t control the frizz, weave your hair into an easy to maintain braid., Work with your stylist to find a style that suits your hair type and face shape. While she may thin out your hair, it may reveal small layers on the underside of your hair that will make your hair feel thin but look full and uniform.Search online or provide pictures for your stylist to give a starting off point. Find inspiration from celebrities with the same hair type.

Wash your hair only a few times a week.,
Shampoo just the roots.,
Use a deep conditioner.,
Dry with a microfiber towel.",How to Deal With Frizzy Hair1," Your hair usually becomes frizzy because it’s dry, and shampooing too often can dehydrate it even further. Instead of washing your locks every day, limit it to every other day or less if you can.If your roots are starting to look a little greasy in between washes, use a dry shampoo product to help soak up the excess oil. It can also help boost volume and texture if your hair is looking a little flat.;
, When you do wash your hair, you can help cut down on frizz by applying the shampoo only at the roots, near your scalp. That’s where most the dirt and grease in your hair usually is. Applying shampoo to the length of your hair can also rough up the cuticle, so it looks frizzier once it dries.Choose a sulfate-free shampoo when you’re washing. Sulfates, which are ingredients that help shampoo suds up, can be very drying, so they’re a bad choice for frizzy hair. Look for a formula with glycerin instead.Avoid using too much shampoo when you wash too. A quarter-sized amount is usually enough. If you have very long or thick hair, though, you may need to double the amount., Frizzy hair needs hydration, so it’s important to moisturize your hair every time you wash. Follow up with a deep conditioner, which contains intensively hydrating ingredients such as oils and butters, each time you shampoo.Allow the deep conditioner to sit on your hair for at least 5 minutes to ensure that it really penetrates and coats the strands.
If you have very fine or thin hair, using a deep conditioner every time you wash may be too much for your locks. Instead, aim for once or twice a week to cut down on frizz.

, Using a regular cotton towel to dry your hair after washing it can rough up the cuticle, leaving it more frizzy. Instead of drying with your usual bath towel, choose a microfiber towel. The material is extremely absorbent so you can just squeeze it around your hair to help dry it.Press the microfiber towel over your hair. Don’t rub it.
If you don’t have a microfiber towel on hand, you’re actually better off using paper towel to dry your hair than a regular cotton towel. It will absorb the excess water more easily than cotton, and won’t rough up your cuticle."

Give immediate feedback.When your stylist is finished, he or she should always give you a hand mirror and allow you to inspect your cut from all angles.,
Be specific about what you didn’t like about your cut.,
Show the stylist a picture to guide their final brush-up.,
Stay calm and polite throughout this discussion.Allowing frustration to guide your tone might sour the stylist on you, and you don’t want someone who’s upset with you cutting your hair.,
Return to the salon immediately if left without noticing your cut was wrong.,
Ask to speak to a manager if necessary.,
Explain the problem to the manager clearly.,
Ask the manager to finish cutting your hair.,
Wait it out.,
Try out new styles.,
Play with accessories.,
Put in hair extensions.",How to Deal with a Bad Haircut," If you don’t like what they’ve done to your hair, don’t be too shy to let them know that you’d like them to fix it before you leave the salon.;
, Some mistakes cannot be fixed immediately. For example, maybe the stylist cut your hair too short — there’s nothing to be done in this case but let your hair grow out. However, giving this feedback will let the stylist know that they should be more careful in the future about paying attention to the length their customers request. If you always go to the same stylist, it’s especially important to make them aware of your length preferences, so they’ll remember the next time you come in for a cut. There are some things the stylist will be able to fix immediately, though. Let them know if:


You’d like your hair cut shorter
You’d like the hair around your face framed differently
You’d like your bangs shaped differently
You’d like your layers shaped differently

, It’s best if you show them the picture of the cut and style you’d like before they begin the haircut, but sometimes the cut you get doesn’t match the cut you ask for. If that’s the case, show them the picture again and give them an opportunity to get you closer to your desired result.

, Think of the discussion as constructive feedback, not a customer complaint. Help guide the stylist toward the haircut you want., Make sure to speak to the hairdresser privately instead of making a fuss in front of the other patrons. Going back immediately raises the chances of getting the cut fixed free of charge, so don’t wait a few days and give them time to forget about you.

, It may be that the stylist has an attitude that makes you uncomfortable, or that you don’t trust the stylist’s skill level. Speaking to a manager can help get the results you need.


Remember to be polite. The words “can I speak to a manager” can strike fear into the heart of any employee, so try not to upset your stylist.

, Use specific examples of what you’d like changed about your haircut. The manager might have some better ideas for how to best fix the situation.

, If you’re unwilling to let the original stylist try again, ask the boss to do it! The manager is often the most experienced stylist in the salon, so they might be best qualified to fix a botched cut.

, Sometimes, there’s just nothing else to be done about your hair, but the good thing about a botched haircut is that hair always grows back! You’ll save yourself a lot of anxiety if you just remember that this is a temporary situation that your body will take care of on its own with time.

, You can make the best of a bad situation by trying to have fun and look cute while waiting for your hair to finish growing out.


See what it looks like when you change your hair’s texture. If it’s straight, try using a curling iron or diffuser to give your hair more body and movement. If it’s curly or wavy, try straightening it.
Style it with different products, like salt spray or texturizing cream for texture.
Try out a new color — maybe going darker or lighter is all you need to make your new work look.

, You might want to hide the bad parts of the cut, or maybe you want to emphasize what you like about your new cut. If your hair was cut too short and is distracting you by falling into your face, try pulling it back with cute bobby pins.Wear a cute headband or tie your hair back with a scarf. If the haircut is truly horrendous, you can always hide it with a cute hat.

, If your cut is distractingly short, extensions can add length that's both instant and temporary — a perfect fix! Make sure to choose extensions that match your hair color and texture as closely as possible. Spending a little extra money on extensions will ensure it looks like your natural hair.


Get the extensions professionally applied and styled if you want it to look as natural as possible. The stylist will cut overly long extensions to flow normally with the rest of your hair.

Apply a silicone serum.,
Use alcohol-free styling products.,
Spray your brush with a shine spray before brushing.",How to Deal With Frizzy Hair2," After you’ve washed your hair, it’s a good idea to apply a silicone-based serum. It will coat the strands of your hair, so the cuticle stays smooth and frizz is reduced. Squeeze a dime-size amount into your palm, rub your hands together, and then work it through your hair.To ensure that the serum is evenly distributed throughout your hair, work through your locks with a wide-tooth comb after applying it.
After applying the silicone serum, you can either allow your hair to air dry or blow dry it.

, When your hair is frizzy, you often need additional styling products to get it to cooperate. Choose gel, mousse, or hairspray that’s alcohol-free, though, or you’ll wind up drying out your hair and making it more frizzy.Styling products that are formulated with natural ingredients are usually a good option for frizzy hair because they aren’t as harsh. That means they’re less likely to dry out your hair.

, If there is still some frizz or flyaways in your hair after you’ve styled it, combat them by misting your brush with a shine spray before lightly brushing your hair with it. That will help smooth the individual hairs that are acting up back into place.It’s best to use a natural bristle on frizzy hair because synthetic materials such as plastic can rough up the cuticle.

Start with a heat protectant.,
Allow hair to air dry partway before blow drying.,
Use an ionic blow dryer.,
Flat iron your hair to smooth it.,
Define natural texture with a curling iron.",How to Deal With Frizzy Hair3," Heat styling strips moisture out of your hair, so it can make your locks drier and frizzier. Protect your hair by always applying a heat protectant product before you blow dry, flat iron, use a curling iron or hot rollers, or heat style it in anyway.Heat protectants work by adding extra moisture to your hair so your natural moisture isn’t removed when you apply heat.
Heat protectants come in a variety of formulas. Sprays work on all hair types, but creams and lotions are best for thicker hair.

, When you want your hair to look sleek and smooth, a blow dryer can come in handy. However, using one to completely dry your hair can lead to more frizz. Instead, let your hair air dry almost 90%, and use the blow dryer to finish it off.It’s especially important to allow your hair to air dry at least part way before blow drying in the winter. That’s because there’s less humidity in the air in cold weather, so your hair is already drier.

, Not all blow dryers are created equal. With frizzy hair, it’s best to choose a ionic model that uses ionic technology to help dry your hair more quickly. As a result, you don’t have to use the blow dryer on your hair as long so it isn’t as easily dehydrated.Because ionic blow dryers work so quickly, it’s easy to over dry your hair. Pay careful attention so you don’t let your tresses get too hot.
Using a round, natural bristle brush as you blow dry with your ionic dryer can give you very smooth, frizz-free hair.

, One of the easiest ways to tame frizzy hair is with a flat or straightening iron. It seals the cuticle so your hair looks as smooth as possible. For the best results, straighten your hair in small sections so you don’t have to run the iron over each piece more than once.Make sure that your hair is completely dry before you begin flat ironing it. You can burn damp hair if you try to straighten it.Don’t turn your flat iron up to more than 410 degrees. That amount of heat will smooth all types of hair.
Choose a flat iron with ceramic plates. They heat more evenly, so they smooth and straighten more effectively.

, If your frizzy hair is naturally curly or wavy, you don’t have to straighten it to tame your frizz. Instead, use a curling iron to help smooth and define your natural texture. You don’t necessarily have to curl your entire head -- just run the curling iron over sections that are frizzy.If you have tight, highly defined curls, choose a curling iron with a small barrel. A ¾-inch model usually works well.
If you have looser waves, opt for a curling iron with a large barrel. A 1-inch or larger barrel is usually the best bet.

Apply a hydrating hair mask.,
Use a hot oil treatment.,
Sleep in a silk scarf.",How to Deal With Frizzy Hair4," Deep conditioning when you wash can help moisturize your locks, but frizzy sometimes need more intensive hydration. Using a hydrating hair mask that contains ingredients such as oils, glycerin, and silk proteins once a week can deliver enough moisture to smooth your frizz.You should follow the instructions on your hair mask, but in most cases, you want to leave it on your head for at least 20 minutes.
To make sure the mask is evenly distributed throughout your locks, comb it through with a wide-tooth comb.
You can apply a mask to dry hair, but it usually absorbs more effectively when your hair is wet.
Some heat can help the mask penetrate more easily, so you may want to put a shower cap over it or wrap your head in plastic wrap when you apply it.
It’s a good idea to wash and deep condition your hair after you use a mask to make sure that there isn’t any residue left behind.

, If you don’t have thick hair, using a mask regularly may be too heavy for your tresses. Instead, make time for a hot oil treatment each week. It’s lighter than a mask, so it won’t weigh your hair down. Allow it to sit for approximately 30 minutes.You should only apply the hot oil treatment to the length of your hair from your ears down. It can make the top of your hair look greasy if you apply it there.
You can purchase pre-made hot oil treatments that are easy to use. Follow the instructions on the packaging for the best results.
You can also make your own hot oil treatment with hair-healthy oils such as avocado, castor, sweet almond, and argan oils. Set the container of the oil in a pot of water that’s near boiling to warm it up, and then apply it to your hair in sections., Just as drying your hair with cotton towel can rough up the cuticle and leave it frizzy, sleeping on cotton pillowcases can mean waking up with major frizz. To keep your hair smooth, wrap your head in a silk scarf before going to bed. Silk is a soft, smooth material that won’t damage your hair.Wet hair is especially prone to damage, so be sure to wear a silk scarf if you’re going to sleep right after washing your hair.
Instead of wearing a scarf, you can swap your cotton or other material pillowcases for silk.

Ditch the treatments.,
Don’t over-brush.,
Avoid certain chemicals and damaging ingredients.,
Protect your hair from the elements.,
Use the right shampoo and conditioner.,
Deep condition your hair.,
Massage your scalp with oil.,
Cut your hair.,
Eat a proper diet.,
Exercise regularly.,
Seek medical treatment when necessary.",How to Cure Dry Hair," One of the major causes of dry hair is damage to the protective outer layer. Once this layer is damaged, it allows moisture to escape and your hair to dry out.The main culprits are dyeing, perming, and heat treatments from blow dryers, straightening and curling irons, or crimpers. Consider some new hair styles that don't require heat to achieve, or cut back on how often you wear your hair like that.


When blow drying your hair, keep the blow dryer six to 10 inches away from your hair.Try rollers instead of the curling iron.
Use a thermal product that protects your hair from heat when you do style your hair with hot irons or blow dryers.;
, Comb out tangles with a wide-toothed comb or a brush that has protected plastic bristles, but don’t continue brushing once the tangles are gone. The friction caused by brushing will actually damage your hair,and if your hair is already dry and brittle, the damage done by over-brushing will be even worse.

, There are many things that can dry out your hair, and avoiding them will help keep your hair healthy and moisturized. Swimming, for example, is excellent exercise for your body, but the chlorine in pools can wreak havoc on your hair.Try a swimming cap to protect your hair if swimming is part of your regular routine. Similarly, avoid hair products that contain alcohol, as this too can dry out your hair. Stay away from products that contain:


Mineral oil and other petroleum-based products, which actually prevent your hair from absorbing moistureAlcohol, which dries your hair
SulfatesFragrances, which can be derived from thousands of sources, and are common irritants

, You may love the feeling of the sun’s warm rays on your skin in summer, but too much sun will damage your skin and your hair. Protect your hair with sun hats in the summer and warm hats in the cooler months, especially when it’s windy.

, Since heat treatments, chemicals, and some everyday beauty product ingredients can all strip moisture and oil from your hair, it’s important to pick hair care products that won’t leave your hair dull and lifeless. Choose a mild shampoo, nourishing conditioner, and leave-in conditioner that won’t leave your hair looking and feeling like straw. Look for products that contain ingredients like:Glycerin
Sorbitol
Argan oil
Olive oil
Shea butter

, Once a week, work a dime- to quarter-sized dollop of deep conditioner into your hair. These conditioners are meant to restore moisture, but make sure yours matches your hair type (such as curly or fine). Alternatively, you can also make your own deep conditioner using liquid coconut oil,or a ripe avocado mashed with two tablespoons (29.6 ml) of olive oil.Towel dry your hair, squeezing the water out instead of twisting it.
Apply your deep conditioner, wrap your head with a shower cap or plastic wrap, and allow it to rest for 30 minutes to an hour. Try adding the heat from a blow dryer that’s no more than 95 F (35 C).Rinse out the deep conditioner with water when your time us up, but shampoo out a homemade conditioner.

, This can be a relaxing bedtime routine that also helps put some necessary oil back into your hair and scalp. Cover your fingertips with a dime- to quarter-sized amount of oil, such as jojoba or coconut, and gently rub your scalp for 10 to 20 minutes. With a wide-toothed comb, comb your hair from root to tip to help distribute the oil.

, Dry hair is prone to split ends, and this makes your hair more unmanageable, and makes it look thin and damaged. Trim your hair once every eight to 12 months,and get rid of damaged ends to help your hair look healthier. Continue with your healthy hair treatments, and eventually all the dry and damaged hair will be cut away and replaced with healthy, luscious hair.

, A healthy body means healthy hair, because your body is responsible for distributing the nutrients needed to keep your skin and hair in good shape. At mealtimes, fill half your plate with vegetables of all colors. Choose water instead of juices or sodas, eat whole grains, eat lean proteins like peas, nuts, and seeds, and avoid processed foods that are high in added fat, sodium, and sugar.A healthy diet isn’t everything when it comes to dry hair, because genes and hormones determine how much oil your hair produces.But if your dry hair is caused by a lack of oil, try supplementing with foods that are rich in essential fatty acids, like avocado and olive oil., Exercise, like a healthy diet, is beneficial for all body functions. While exercise won’t specifically treat dry hair, it will improve circulation and blood flow to your scalp, which will help make your hair healthier, and can mitigate some of the effects of dryness.


For people who are too busy to hit the gym every week, try adding some extra fitness to your day by taking the stairs instead of the elevator, walking or biking to work, or doing a few exercises while you're relaxing in front of the television at the end of the day.

, There are medical and genetic disorders that can cause dryness and other hair problems. The most common medical conditions that cause dry hair are malnutrition, anorexia, and thyroid problems. Consult your healthcare practitioner if you’re also experiencing symptoms such as:Muscle cramps and spasms
Join pain
Obesity or extreme weight loss
Fatigue or weakness
Depression

Firstly, brush out your hair so that it is free of tangles.,
In a bathroom or kitchen (anywhere without carpets) set up what you need.,
Once the roots are well covered, move down to the mid and end sections of the hair.,
Don't rough up the hair, apply gently.,
When all the hair is thoroughly covered, comb through gently, twist up onto your head and use a large clip to hold it.,
Leave for one hour, then remove the towel, cling film and clip.,
Once dry, brush out.",How to Create a Warm Oil Hair Treatment for Very Dry/Damaged Hair," For medium to long hair, measure out 100 milliliters (3.4  fl oz) of olive oil into a jug and microwave for 25 seconds. The oil must be WARM only. It is VERY IMPORTANT you do not heat for longer as you can get some horrendous burns from hot oil.;
, An old towel is essential for protecting clothing, and wear some old clothes you don't mind getting oil-stained. Standing over a sink or tub, slowly pour small amounts of oil a bit at a time onto the roots and massage into the hair with your fingertips. This is a great opportunity to give yourself a relaxing head massage, and the warmth from the oil feels great and is very calming.

, It may be easier at this point to pour the oil into your hands and massage gently through all the layers of the hair with your palms so everything is covered.

, This will make covering all the hairs and combing through easier.

, Wrap your head in cling film to keep the heat from your head warming the oil. Wrap a towel around your head so you don't look like some crazy person with a cling film hat if someone comes to the door!

, First rinse off all the excess oil (its better to a detachable shower head so can just wash your hair and not get your entire body all oily if taking a full shower). Then using a silky/moisturising shampoo, thoroughly lather all over the scalp, hair and nape of the neck. Rinse (you may need to wash the hair twice) and apply a moisturising conditioner. Rinse and squeeze out excess water with a towel. Allow to air dry and DO NOT BRUSH this point. Hair will stretch and lose elasticity if brushed when wet; not ideal for already damaged hair.

, Hair should feel thicker and look shinier and sleeker. Repeat this routine once a week and you'll really begin to see results.

Use a gentle shampoo.,
Incorporate rinse-only days into your washing routine.,
Wash with a clarifying shampoo once a month.,
Apply conditioner only to the ends of your hair.",How to Control Oily Hair1," You may think that using a strong shampoo is the best option for oily hair. However, harsh shampoos can actually strip too much oil, causing your scalp to produce even more. Opt for a mild shampoo that will clean excess oil without irritating the hair follicle.Look for a shampoo that is free of silicone and sulfates for the best results.
When you wash your hair, let the shampoo sit on your scalp for a few minutes before rinsing it. That will give it time to penetrate the oils and remove them.;
, When you have oily hair, you usually feel the need to wash everyday. However, that can actually cause your scalp to produce more oil. Try to cut down on your use of shampoo by working a rinse-only day when you just rinse your hair with lukewarm water into your routine.Use a rinse-only day every other time or every third time that you plan to wash your hair to get your hair used to less shampooing.
Your scalp will eventually adjust to less shampoo and stop producing as much oil, so you can wash every other day or less.

, While it’s important to use a gentle shampoo that won’t cause your hair to produce more oil, both oil and styling products can build up on your hair, making it look greasy, dull, and limp. Use a clarifying shampoo once a month to remove the buildup and add shine and volume back to your hair.Clarifying shampoo can be extremely harsh, which can trigger excess oil production. Never use it more than once a month.

, Even oily hair can have dry ends, so you don’t necessarily want to skip conditioner completely. However, when you’re applying it, focus it only on the ends of your hair. Never put any near your scalp and roots.You don’t necessarily need to condition your hair every time you wash either. You may only want to use conditioner once a week if your ends aren’t particularly dry.

, They are the best source of vitamins and will definitely help your hair look healthier. You can buy certain herbs at a local market or Natural Food store depending on what type of hair you have:


If you have oily hair use burdock root, oak leaf or nettle leaf: pour one cup of boiling water over one tablespoon of herbs and leave for an hour, then filter thought the strainer and spray on your hair when you get out of the shower (you may also just pour it on your hair in the shower but then don’t rinse it with water after you’ve done so)
Any sort of natural oil is good for dry hair (burdock oil, lavender oil, etc.) – put it on your head (you don’t even need to spread it all over your hair; just cover the roots), wrap a towel around it and wash it off in an hour.
Normal hair doesn’t require any special treatment but you can help keeping it healthy by spraying chamomile extract or calendula extract on it after you take a shower.

Square/Round/Oval Shaped Face – The width of your forehead, cheekbones and jaw are the same.
Diamond Shaped Face – Your cheekbones are the widest part of your facial shape.
Pear Shaped Face – Your jaw is the widest part of your face.
Heart Shaped Face – Your forehead is the widest portion of your face and inverts inwards towards your chin.;
, Once you know your facial shape, try looking through magazines to find hairstyles that flatter that shape. There are also many sites online that allow you to test out hairstyles using current pictures of your face, so you can preview how the cut or color will look in real life. Finally, you can try identifying a celebrity who has a similar facial shape to you and checking out haircuts that have looked good on them.

, Hair comes in many different textures: fine, medium, and coarse. It also comes in many different densities: sparse, medium and high. Your hair’s texture and density will determine how the haircut falls on you, so make sure you consult with your stylist before committing to a cut., Having a good stylist is the most important variable in securing a good hairstyle. If your stylist is inexperienced or unwilling to execute on your vision, you will likely leave the salon disappointed. In order to find a quality stylist, seek out referrals from friends or look online at Yelp reviews.

, Once you’ve determined the kind of cut or color you want, it’s important that you convey that information to your stylist so they can execute on your vision. Be clear with your stylist regarding the style you want, how much hair you’re comfortable losing and what shade you’re looking to achieve if you’re coloring your hair.


If possible, make a Pinterest board or have a picture on hand to better demonstrate the look you’re going for.

, If you find a stylist who works well with your hair, use them as frequently as possible. The more they work with your hair, the better they will understand it and the more they will be able to give you haircuts that will keep you coming back for more.

, Oftentimes, bad hair can be solved using good products. Slight damage can be cured using hair quality hair serums and products, found either in drug stores, online or through the salon of your choice.


When investing in quality hair products, it’s important to use products designed to fix the problems you’re actually having. Using a shampoo that guarantees more volume does nothing if the problem you’re suffering from is dry or damaged hair., Nobody ever need know that you’re having a bad hair day if you learn how to fix your own hair. There are endless possibilities for potential hairstyles, and you can learn most of them simply by watching an online tutorial. Some popular styles you can try include:


Braids.
Buns or topknots.
Experimenting with moving your hair part.
Straightening or curling your hair.

, There are numerous accessories on the market, designed to hide a bad hair day. From clip-ins and extensions to headbands and headscarves, if you need to disguise your hair, there’s a way for you to do that.

Some schools and places of work do not allow hats to be worn indoors. Make sure you know what the protocol for wearing a hat indoors is before planning to wear one for the day.

, If you recently got a bad haircut or color and you’re still at the salon, communicate the issue. Chances are, they can fix it on the spot, and if not, they can schedule a time to have you come back. If it’s a color problem, most salons will allow you a week to come back and correct the issue, free of charge. Hairstylists want you to leave their salon happy; it increases the chances that you’ll become a permanent client for them., If you go too long between haircuts, hair becomes unmanageable and damaged and it may be time for a change.Some common signs of unhealthy hair are:


Dry frizz
Limp/dull hair that always looks flat
Greasy hair
Hair that feels too thick or too thin
Split ends
Extreme breakage or shedding

, Sometimes, dissatisfaction with personal appearance stems from boredom in other areas of a person’s life. If you are frustrated with your hair, check in with yourself to make sure you’re actually unhappy with your hair and not something more insidious.

, Be aware that your hair only makes up one small fraction of who you are as a person. There will always be something about your hair that you may not love, but as long as you love and value yourself, it doesn’t matter.

Blow dry your hair on the cool setting.,
Freshen your hair with dry shampoo.,
Use pulled back styles to disguise oil.",How to Control Oily Hair2," If you turn up your blow dryer to the hottest setting, you may be making your hair greasier. The heat causes the scalp to produce more sebum and oil, so your hair looks greasy. Instead of using heat, use the cool setting on your blow dryer when you need to dry your hair.To make it easier to dry your hair with cool hair, gently towel dry it to remove some of the moisture and then allow it to air dry for 10 to 15 minutes before using your blow dryer.

, If your hair is greasy and flat between washes, dry shampoo is your new best friend. It soaks up excess oil at your scalp and adds volume, so your hair looks fresh. Apply dry shampoo whenever your hair looks oily, and it isn’t time to wash yet.To use the dry shampoo, hold the bottle 10 to 12 inches (25.2 to 30.4 cm) from your head, and spray it on your roots. Use your fingers to work the dry shampoo into your hair so there’s no powdery residue. Brush and style your hair as usual.

, The right hairstyles can help conceal the fact that your hair is oily. Pulled back styles, such as a ponytail or top knot, are ideal because they’re meant to have slick look that the oil in your hair can provide.Brush and pull your hair back as tightly as possible for a pony or bun to create the sleekest look for your oily hair.

Apply a baking soda hair mask.,
Use a lemon juice treatment on your scalp.,
Rinse your hair with tea.",How to Control Oily Hair3," Baking soda can help absorb oil from the scalp so your hair doesn’t appear as oily. Mix 2 to 3 tablespoons (28 to 41 g) of the baking soda with approximately 4 cups (1 liter) of water to dilute it. Pour the mixture over your scalp, and let it sit for 20 minutes before rinsing it out.After rinsing the baking soda mixture from your scalp, wash your hair with your usual shampoo.

, Not only can lemon juice boost your hair’s shine, it can also help remove excess oil and buildup from your hair. Mix the juice from 1 small lemon with 1 cup (237 ml) of water, and apply the mixture to your scalp. Allow it to sit in your hair for 3 to 5 minutes before rinsing it out with warm water.Follow up the lemon juice treatment with your usual shampoo.

, Tea contains tannic acid, which is astringent that can keep oil production in check and tighten the pores. Steep 1 black tea bag in a cup (237 ml) of warm water until the liquid darkens. Pour the tea over your hair and let it sit for 2 to 3 minutes before rinsing it out with a gentle shampoo."

Apply conditioner before you shower.,
Mix a bit of shampoo with conditioner.,
Skip shampoo if your hair is dry.,
Avoid rinsing out all of the conditioner.,
Dry hair with a T-shirt instead of a towel.",How to Care for Frizzy Hair1," Before you step into the shower, apply a deep conditioner to your hair. Cover your hair with a shower cap and then step into the shower. Wash your body and do your other shower tasks before you remove the cap to wash your hair. The heat from the shower will help to moisturize and soften your locks.;
, Right before you wash your hair, mix a quarter-sized amount of sulfate-free shampoo with double the amount of conditioner to allow your hair to be moisturized as it is cleaned. Massage the mixture into the scalp, starting at the crown of your head. Focus on cleaning only the roots, since this is the oiliest area of your head. This will allow you to clean your hair without stripping it of its natural oils., If your hair is particularly parched, skip shampoo altogether. Hair that is lacking in moisture or oil doesn’t necessarily need shampoo. Shampooing dry hair will only dry it out further, leading to brittle, damaged-looking hair., When you have finished shampooing, apply conditioner to your hair and allow it to soak into your locks for several minutes. Rinse it out, leaving a small amount of conditioner in your hair, especially on your ends. This will help keep your hair moisturized and should help tame any fly-aways. This works especially well for super dry hair., Once you have stepped out of the shower, wring out excess moisture from your hair with an old T-shirt, rather than using a towel. Towels can be too absorbent, thus depriving frizzy hair of much-needed moisture. Lack of moisture will produce more frizz.Unlike towels, T-shirts are smooth enough to help smooth out frizzy hair and will help prevent curls from matting together.

Choose shampoos containing zinc pyrithione.Zinc pyrithione is an antibacterial and antifungal agent.,
Consider tar-based shampoos.Shampoos containing coal tar slow down the rate at which skin cells die and flake away, making them effective against dandruff, seborrheic dermatitis, and psoriasis.Popular brands include Neutrogena T/Gel and Denorex.,
Use shampoos with selenium sulfide.Shampoos with selenium sulfide also slow down the rate at which your skin cells die and shed, similar to the way tar shampoos work.,
Try a shampoo with salicylic acid.Salicylic acid is a relatively mild acid that can soften the skin and strip away the dead skin cells on your scalp.,
Test out ketoconazole shampoos.Ketoconazole is an antifungal agent that works against a wide variety of fungi.,
Commit to trial and error.,
Massage the shampoo into your scalp.,
Use the shampoo regularly.,
Swap between two anti-dandruff shampoos, if necessary.,
Work with your hair type.,
Consider using an anti-dandruff conditioner.,
Avoid shampoos containing harsh ingredients.,
Contact a dermatologist if necessary.",How to Choose Anti Dandruff Shampoo," Dandruff shampoos containing this ingredient are especially effective at treating dandruff and seborrheic dermatitis caused by malassezia fungi.Popular brands include Head & Shoulders and Jason Dandruff Relief 2 in 1.;
,
Some tar shampoos can discolor blonde, gray, or white hair, so this may not be the best option if you have light-colored hair.Tar shampoos can also make your scalp more sensitive to sunlight. If you use a tar shampoo, wear a hat when you go outdoors and stay under shade as much as possible., Additionally, selenium sulfide may also reduce malassezia fungi like zinc pyrithione shampoos do.Note, however, that selenium sulfide shampoos can discolor blonde, gray, or dyed hair. It might be best to avoid these shampoos if your hair color falls under one of these categories. Furthermore, you should thoroughly rinse these shampoos out of your hair to help reduce the risk of discoloration.
Popular brands include Selsun Blue and Dandrex.

, Results may vary with this type of shampoo; for some individuals, salicylic acid shampoos can cause more dryness and flaking.If you experience dryness and excess flaking with this type of shampoo, you might be able to relieve the condition by following each shampooing with a standard conditioner.
Popular brands include Neutrogena T/Sal and Keralyt Scalp.

, It's often used as a last resort when other dandruff shampoos fail to treat the problem.Many ketoconazole shampoos are available only by prescription, but there are some over-the-counter options, like Nizoral and generic drug store brands.

, No two dandruff shampoos are exactly alike; similarly, no two dandruff sufferers are exactly alike, either. The best dandruff shampoo for one person may not be the best one for you, so be prepared to try out a few different options before finding one that works.Zinc pyrithione shampoos tend to have fewer negative side effects and are generally well tolerated, making them a popular first option.
If you have darker hair, tar shampoos and selenium sulfide shampoos are equally good options as long as you follow the label instructions closely.
Since salicylic acid shampoos can cause additional dryness, they are generally a less popular choice, but are still safe for most people.
Ketoconazole shampoos are generally used when other anti-dandruff shampoo types fail to work or stop working.
For a more precise recommendation suited to your hair type and scalp needs, consult a dermatologist.

, You should always follow the label instructions closely for any dandruff shampoo you use, but generally, you'll need to apply the shampoo to wet hair and thoroughly massage it into the scalp using your fingers.In most cases, you'll need to let the shampoo sit on your scalp for about five minutes before rinsing it out. Others, however, should be rinsed out immediately after application (especially those containing selenium sulfide)., To bring severe cases of dandruff under control, you'll typically need to use your anti-dandruff shampoo once every one to two days.The exception is Ketoconazole shampoo, which should be used only twice per week.As your dandruff subsides, you can cut back the amount used to about twice per week, or once per week if you have coarser hair., One shampoo may work for a period of time before suddenly becoming less effective. If this happens, consider switching back and forth between two different ingredient types, using each one at least once per week.You may also consider switching entirely to another type of dandruff shampoo instead of alternating between the old and new ingredients,but doing so may prove less effective than alternating between two.

, Many anti-dandruff shampoos only have one formula, but others are formulated for different hair types.Focus on finding a shampoo that helps cut down dandruff first; if that shampoo makes your overall hair quality worsen (e.g., making your hair limp, dry, or weak), consider looking for a special formula that contains the same active ingredient while correcting the new problem.


While some dandruff shampoos are also available in multiple scents, the smell of your shampoo should be the last concern on your list. Dandruff control and overall hair health maintenance should be of greater concern.

, While the conditioner itself won't help fight the dandruff, it's important to select a conditioner that won't strip away the active ingredient in the shampoo. Your best bet is to select a conditioner specifically formulated to accompany your shampoo of choice.If you are unable to find a conditioner that matches your shampoo, try to find one made with natural or organic ingredients. Gentle moisturizers are usually best, but stay away from clarifying conditioners.

, If you eventually decide to introduce a normal shampoo back into your hair care routine, stay away from those containing ingredients ammonium lauryl sulfate and other anionic surfactants, which tend to dry the scalp and worsen the problem. Try to find a sulfate-free shampoo instead.Also note that washing your hair too frequently or not often enough can worsen dandruff.Once your dandruff problem is under control, you should only wash your hair once every other day at most, and at least two or three times per week at minimum.

, If you are unable to get your dandruff under control on your own, consult your family doctor or dermatologist and ask for a prescription-strength shampoo or steroid lotion.While dandruff is frequently caused by dry skin, it could also be caused by a medical condition, like seborrheic dermatitis, psoriasis, eczema, or fungal infections.Your doctor will be able to determine the cause of your dandruff and work with you to find the best solution for it.

Braid your hair.,
Wear your hair in a bun.",How to Care for Frizzy Hair2," When detangling your mane, always use a wide-tooth comb or your fingers, rather than use a brush. This will minimize breakage and damage and will also preserve the shape of your curls. Brushing your hair will separate the individual strands, making it much frizzier., If your hair is frizzy, chances are it is often difficult to brush through. Avoid starting from the roots and start detangling at the ends instead. Take a wide section of your hair, about three inches or so, and use a wide-tooth comb to detangle the strands, starting from the ends and working upward. Do this for each section of hair until you have detangled all of it.If you get pretty severe tangles, try a spray-on detangling product. Apply it to wet hair and then proceed with your wide-tooth comb.

, Brushing your hair while it is dry will only serve to make your hair frizzier by separating each strand of hair, especially if your hair is curly. A great way to avoid brushing dry hair is to comb it before you get out of the shower. Start by detangling large curls with your fingers, then use a comb to start combing out the tangles, starting from the ends.If you get a knot during the day, gently work through it with a wide-tooth comb.

, After you have stepped out of the shower, apply styling cream to your hair. This targets frizz before it even has a chance to start by forming a moisturizing protective layer over your locks.Styling cream can be purchased at a beauty supply store. Look for creams or sprays that protect hair against frizz, such as Moroccanoil Frizz Control or DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam.

, A diffuser is an attachment for your hair dryer that can be purchased at a low cost at your local beauty supply store. These attachments are designed for curly hair and work well for managing frizz and keeping the curls intact.

You can wear a single braid off to the side of your head, down your back, or sport pigtail-style braids for a more youthful look.

The way they talk about curly hair should reveal their level of knowledge about it. Ask to see samples of their work on other curly-haired clients.

, To maintain healthy hair, visit your hairdresser at least four times a year (every three months) for a trim. Regular trims will prevent split ends, which can contribute to unruly frizz.

, If you see another curly-haired person with a great haircut, don’t be shy! Approach them and ask where they get their hair cut. You can start a conversation by saying something like, “Hey! I love your hairstyle. Would you mind telling me where you get your hair cut? I’m looking for a good stylist.” It is generally perceived as a great compliment, and most people are willing to divulge who cuts their hair., Curly/dry/frizzy hair should always be cut in layers to avoid the dreaded triangle-head, which is a term for curly hair that is cut in a blunt style. Curly hair is often voluminous, and when it dries, the ends become voluminous while the top remains flat, creating a triangle effect. Cutting hair into layers will distribute the volume and look much more flattering on you."

Apply coconut oil all over your hair.,
Mix leave-in conditioner with styling gel or cream.,
Use a dab of hair oil after styling your hair.",How to Care for Frizzy Hair4," Coconut oil is a great oil for moisturizing hair and taming frizz.

Then, work the lather through your hair and rinse. Rinse hair thoroughly so no shampoo is left behind. Washing your hair should take about five minutes.;
, Even though greasy hair looks and feels dirty, washing your hair every day will make your hair more greasy because shampoo strips hair of its nutrients and natural oils, causing your scalp to produce even more oil.Wash your hair every 2-3 days at the very most. This gives your hair enough time to replace the natural oils, so you're not producing an excess.

, In addition to not shampooing every day, use a gentle cleansing shampoo. Shampoos that are aggressive tend to irritate hair follicles, causing the scalp to produce more oil. Also, switch shampoos once every week to avoid buildup.


Shampoos with salicylic acid, selenium sulfide, or ketoconazole are good for greasy hair.
Salicylic acid helps reduce oil on the scalp.
Keep 2-3 different shampoos in the shower so you can easily switch back and forth.

, Oily hair does not need to be conditioned often. Condition every other time you wash or just once a week. Also, only use conditioner on the tips of your hair instead of the roots, where grease gathers more easily., The best dry shampoos for greasy hair come in a powder form.

Choose moisturizing shampoos and conditioners.,
Avoid washing your hair daily.,
Use a quarter-sized amount of shampoo.,
Condition your hair daily.,
Rinse your hair with cold water.",How to Care for Dry Hair1," Use shampoos and conditioners that contain natural oils, like olive and argan oil, glycerin, sorbitol, and shea butter. Shampoos and conditioners that contain keratin or plant-based moisturizers, like phytobalm, are super hydrating as well.In general, try to avoid products that contain mineral oil, petrolatum, sulfates, silicone, and alcohol such as stearyl, cetyl, and cetearyl alcohol. These substances can exacerbate dryness.;
, If you wash your hair daily, gradually reduce the frequency with which you wash your hair. Start by washing your hair every other day for a month. After a month, reduce the washing to every three days. You should observe a noticeable difference in the texture of your hair after two to three months.Washing your hair every day strips it of its natural oils.
Use dry shampoo to touch up your hair in between washes.

, If you have long or thick hair (or both), then double the amount. Try to avoid using too much shampoo since this can further dry out your scalp and hair. Additionally, when shampooing, focus on the roots of your hair near your scalp., Even if it is not time to wash your hair with shampoo, you should wet your hair and apply conditioner daily. Focusing on the middle of your hair and the ends, apply the conditioner. Leave the conditioner in for five to ten minutes, then rinse.Use a deep conditioning treatment once every seven to ten days.
You do not need to apply too much conditioner to the roots since the natural oils produced by your body will moisturize them.

, Do this after shampooing and conditioning. The cold water will close the hair follicles, enabling your hair to trap in the moisture.Additionally, if you have color treated hair, rinsing with cold water will help preserve the color, reducing the amount of touch-ups needed to maintain your look.

Keep heat away from your head.,
Touch your hair less.,
Spray on dry shampoo.,
Avoid oil-based products.",How to Prevent Oily Hair2," Heat stimulates oil production, so avoid blow drying.It’s also a good idea to avoid flat irons, curling irons, and hot rollers if serious oiliness is a concern.

, Running your hands through your hair and otherwise playing with your hair spreads oil from the scalp to the rest of your hair. It may also stimulates oil production at the roots.Touching your hair is also problematic because it transfers oils from your hands (from things such as lotion or anything you've eaten) to your hair.The same goes for brushing: every time you drag the brush down your head, you’re pulling oil from the roots through the rest of your locks. Obviously you need to brush when you’ve got tangles or pesky fly-aways, but try to resist those 100 strokes a day.

, These products help to get rid of oiliness at the roots, and they can increase volume.They’re a great option for non-shampoo days.


Dry shampoo is great for occasional hair help, but you shouldn’t use it every day. It can block hair follicles and make it difficult for the sweat glands on your head to properly do their job.Cornstarch, cornmeal, and blotting papers work similarly to dry shampoo, soaking up excess oil in between washes., Styling products with silicone or a high concentration of oil can make your hair look greasy, so read ingredient labels carefully and choose alternate stylers."

Have a firm idea of what you want in mind.,
Just say no.,
Do be clear on what you do want.,
Enjoy the visit.,
Return if you're unhappy.",How to Avoid Hairdressing Mistakes," Only go to the hairdresser when you have a firm idea of the exact reason for going.


If you want a cut, that's it. Know what length, what style, and what limits to the cutting before you go. Be prepared for the ""at least an inch off to cure split ends"" line and if it is not something you want done, say so. It is your hair and you have to live with it.
If you want a color, know about it beforehand and spend some time looking at color swatches online and in pharmacy aisles so that you can choose with certainty when you are there. Sometimes it even pays to spend 5 minutes visiting the hairdresser a few days before your appointment and asking to see their swatches when you aren't pressured to have the color done right then.
If you want a perm, choose the style ahead of visiting the hairdresser.;
, Sure, it sounds easy. Oftentimes it is not. We sit in front of those mirrors looking all washed out and tired under the fluorescent lights and we start thinking a totally new hairdo will make everything all right and our tired eyes, sagging face, sore feet, bad work karma, and unfed pets will all suddenly miraculously be cured by a new haircut. Don't believe it; the rest of life won't be convinced by a new haircut, only an attitude change can do that! Be strong and tell your hairdresser firmly, ""no"". Say something like ""Well, that's an interesting suggestion but it's not for me. Thanks for making it though.""

, As soon as you say ""Aw, I dunno, I sort of want this bit over there, with a little twirl here, and a kinda cutesy look at the back"", you become fodder for suggestions. Don't go with this lack of clarity; you open yourself right up to temptation. Know exactly what it is you want. Say clearly point by point what you want done (for example, ""I would like 2 inches off the back and a really neat cut across the bangs, with some razoring on the front layers""). And end your instructions with ""Do you follow me?"" or ""Is it clear to you what I want?"" If you have a photo of how you looked after the cut last time, feel free to bring this to complete your description.

, You will be amazed how a simple fresh wash, cut, and blow dry will still leave you feeling great when you leave the salon. It's the pampering that makes a difference and the beautiful new crisp cut. The spur-of-the-moment style change isn't going to build on this aspect of the experience; it will be quite the opposite if you don't like the outcome!

, Don't sit at home fretting and crossing out the days until this time next year when it will have all grown out. Call back once you have made a decision that you can't live with it. Tell the hairdresser it is not working for you and ask for a new appointment to fix it. Do not be shy - as with any service, the service provider must be willing to remedy a fault. Wouldn't you call back the plumber if the faucet he just fixed still leaked? Well, call the hairdresser back too.

Use a hydrating shampoo.,
Space out shampooing your hair.,
Condition your hair after shampooing.,
Apply a deep conditioner to your hair.,
Apply a natural ingredient hair mask.,
Be gentle when drying your hair.,
Protect your hair before using hot tools.,
Trim your hair regularly.,
Rinse out harsh chemicals.,
Shield your hair from the sun.,
Incorporate a balanced diet.,
Avoid brushing wet hair.,
Avoid using hot tools.,
Avoid damaging hair treatments.",How to Prevent Dry Hair," There are many different kinds of shampoo on the market, but choose a shampoo that specifically contains moisturizing properties aimed at restoring dry hair. Look for shampoos that are labeled as “hydrating,” “moisturizing,” or “replenishing.”Shampoos that contain oils hydrate hair really well.


Some shampoos contain cleansing ingredients such as alcohol and sulfates that can effectively clean your hair, but can also cause your hair to dry out. Try to avoid shampoos that have sulfate ingredients or buy shampoos that specifically are labeled “sulfate free” and “alcohol free.”You could also try using a gentle shampoo made for babies. Baby shampoo has a gentle formula that can cleanse your hair without washing away your natural hair oils.;
, Frequent shampooing can wash away the natural oils from your hair that keep your strands moisturized. If you wash your hair every day, try washing your hair every other day, or even every couple of days.This will allow your hair to naturally retain its oils and stay hydrated.


If you’re concerned about your hair being oily looking, consider using dry shampoo in between your washes.Dry shampoo can liven up the look of your hair without having to shampoo it.

, Conditioning your hair after you shampoo is an easy way to add extra moisture to your hair. Conditioners, by nature, are meant to add hydration to hair, but look for conditioners that are specially formulated for dry hair.Be sure to focus adding the conditioner to the ends of your hair; the part of your hair that is most likely to be dry and damaged.

, Using a deep conditioner a few times a month can add even more moisture to your hair. Deep conditioners contain natural ingredients like oils but also contain man-made ingredients like proteins and polymers that help hydrate hair.Before shampooing, add a deep conditioner to your hair, and use your hands and fingertips to completely cover your hair, especially the ends. Leave the deep conditioner on your hair for at least 15 minutes, then rinse out the conditioner.Deep conditioners work especially well for adding shine to previously dull and damaged hair.

, A hair mask works much in the same way as a deep conditioner. The mask is used to coat the hair for a period of time, adding moisture and nutrients to your strands. Hair masks can be made out of all sorts of natural ingredients like eggs, yogurt, bananas, mayonnaise, avocado, and pumpkin, just to name a few.Coating your hair with different natural oils, butters, and teas can also help hydrate and soften hair.

, Rather than intensely rubbing your hair with a towel, or immediately blow drying your hair, consider trying to squeeze most of the water out, then letting your hair air dry.You could also try drying your hair with an old t-shirt, as a t-shirt fabric is gentler to your hair than a towel. Drying your hair roughly with a towel can cause damage to the outer layer of your hair strands., The heat from your styling tools can cause significant damage to your hair, ultimately making your hair dry and brittle. Protect your hair from the heat by adding a protective product to your hair before using your hot tools.Heat protectants can come in sprays, serums, and gel-like formulas.


This protective protect will lend a barrier between your hair and the heat from the styling tools.

, Since the ends of your hair are most likely to be dry and damaged, keep your ends healthy by getting regular hair trims every few of months. Cutting the last ½ inch off from the ends of your hair can help your hair look even and healthy, reduce split ends, and remove the most damaged portion of your hair., Swimming in chlorinated pools and bodies of salt water can significantly dry out your hair. Be sure to rinse your hair after swimming in these water environments so the chemicals don’t sit on your hair and suck out the moisture.Consider wearing a swim cap if you are going to be swimming in pools with chlorine, or salty bodies of water., Before going outside to spend the day in the sun, spray a protective sunscreen onto your hair so the sun’s intense heat and UV rays don’t dry out and damage it.Or, you could try keeping your hair covered with a wide brim hat., Consuming foods that are high in protein, vitamins, and healthy fats is a good way to promote healthy hair from the inside out. Foods like leafy greens, fruits, fish, and wholes grains contain essential fatty acids and vitamins that help to nourish not only your body, but also your hair., Use a wide-toothed comb to detangle your damp hair.Since hair is more fragile when it’s wet, brushing your hair with the bristles of a brush increases the chances of breaking your hair.


If you do brush your hair, brush your hair when it’s dry, and use a boar bristled brush.Boar bristled brushes do a good job of bringing hair oils from the top of your head downward, effectively moisturizing dry ends.

, The temperature from styling tools can cause heat damage to your hair. Try styling your hair in other ways that don’t require you to use a blow dryer, flat iron, or curler. Consider styling your hair in braids, buns, or twists so you can give your hair a break from the heat.If you must use hot tools to tame your hair, consider lowering the heat settings. Some hot tool heat settings go all the way up to 450°, which is significantly high considering water only has to reach 210° to boil., Any kind of chemical hair treatment (including dye jobs, highlighting, lowlighting, perms, relaxers, etc.) causes damage to your hair.This chemical damage can, in turn, cause your hair to become fragile and dry. If you can, avoid chemical treatments altogether, especially if your hair has had more than one treatment at a time.


Giving your hair a break from the chemicals will allow your natural hair to grow out which should be healthier and more hydrated.
If you must dye your hair, consider using a dye with either low amounts of ammonia, or no ammonia at all."

Keep your eyes closed when shampooing.,
Always read the care label before using.Directions for use are printed on the back of your shampoo bottle.,
Don’t rub your hands or fingers in your eyes immediately after shampooing.,
Wash your hands after shampooing your hair.,
Wear protective eye-wear.Wear goggles in the shower if getting shampoo in your eyes causes a particularly acute irritation.,
Try a tears-free shampoo.,
Use an eye shield.",How to Get Shampoo out of Your Eyes," When shampoo is in your eyes, you might experience a burning or stinging sensation. Pain can often lead us to panic. Staying calm will ensure you do not do anything which might make the situation worse. There are few options for calming down when you’re confined to your shower, but one way to calm down in such a situation is to take control of your breathing.Become conscious of the pattern of inhaling and exhaling. Try to slow your breathing by inhaling deeply and slowly for a count of five, then exhaling for another five seconds. Do this at least three times.


You might also envision yourself in a peaceful scene where nothing hurts and you are not in danger. For instance, try imagining yourself on a peaceful mountaintop. Try to imagine the breeze on your face and the gentle warmth of the sun on your skin.;
, The stinging pain you experience when shampoo gets in your eyes is caused by sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS).SLS is a foaming agent, so by rubbing the shampoo into your eyes, you'll only end up exacerbating the foaming process at work within your eye. Rubbing will work the shampoo deeper into your eyes -- quite the opposite of a desirable outcome when your aim is to remove it.

, Bring your top and bottom eyelids together to close them. By closing your eyes, you end the exposure to shampoo and ensure the problem does not increase in magnitude. Do not open your eyes until you are ready to rinse the shampoo away.


With your eyes closed, rinse the rest of the shampoo off. By removing the rest of the shampoo from your head, you’ll avoid getting more shampoo in your eyes.

, Open your eyes and turn your face up towards the shower head so that your eyes receive the most direct application of water. Turn your head from side to side so that the water flows across both eyes. Keep your eyes as open as possible as the water flows into them. Run the water for 2-3 minutes.The shower should be gentle. If it is not, run the faucet on the tub and cup cool water with both your hands. Splash the water in your eye repeatedly for several minutes.

, After rinsing the eye with water directly from the shower, most of the shampoo should be out. Just in case it isn’t though, you should try to cry in order to remove any remaining contaminant. Your eyes might be watering already as a natural reaction to getting shampoo in the eyes. If they are not, bringing yourself to tears will remove toxins and clear your eyes of any remaining shampoo in a natural way.Crying on command takes long practice, but thinking of tragic thoughts -- like being a child alone and scared in the woods -- is a good way to inspire tears., However, if you experience eye pain or blurriness in your vision which is acute, recurrent, or inspires worry, contact a medical professional immediately. It's possible you have an allergic reaction to a specific ingredient in the shampoo you used. More serious symptoms such as blood or pus coming out of or congealing on the eye after an encounter with shampoo should also be cause for concern, and be checked by a doctor without delay.

, As you lather your shampoo into your hair, tilt your head back. Look up towards the ceiling at a forty-five degree angle. This ensures that any suds and shampoo bubbles fall behind you, not down into your face. Do not tilt your head forward or keep your head on an even level as you would when looking forward normally. Continue to hold your head back when you rinse the shampoo out., Try to shampoo quickly and efficiently with your eyes closed. Doing so is not as difficult as you might think. If you are familiar with the space of your own bathtub or shower, you’ll know where to step and where not to. Squeeze a small amount of shampoo into your hand, then close your eyes and apply it as needed. Keep your eyes closed when you step beneath the shower head to rinse, and only open your eyes after you’ve rinsed completely.

, They will provide instructions as to how to best apply the shampoo. Some shampoos have specific directions as to how you can avoid getting shampoo in your eyes. Heed these guidelines when utilizing your shampoo.

, When you apply shampoo to your hair, you probably use one or both hands to do so. After applying the shampoo, your hands might have shampoo suds or residue on them. If you place your hands or fingers in your eyes while the residue or suds are still on them, you will get the shampoo in your eyes.

, If you want to place your fingers or hands on or around your eyes after shampooing, rinse your hands vigorously with water before doing so. You can use soap, but don’t have to. Ensure you rinse the shampoo (and soap, if using) from the palms and backs of your hands, as well as between your fingers. Only then can you safely touch or rub your eye.

, You can purchase goggles intended for aquatic environments from your local sporting goods store. Wear them while shampooing, but remove them after you’ve finished rinsing the shampoo out so as to ensure your face gets washed properly.

, Several shampoo brands have a neutral acidity, meaning their pH value is 7. When using a neutral shampoo, chances are that you will not notice or feel discomfort when some gets in your eyes. As their name suggests, these shampoos are perfect for babies or young children who cannot yet wash their own hair properly and are sensitive to the slight acidity of normal shampoos. These tears-free shampoos will cause less pain than a normal shampoo will if you get any in your eyes.

, An eye shield is a cap with a small brimmed cap which resemble a golf visor. Place the eye shield on your head and ensure the brim is snugly against your forehead. By wearing the eye shield in the shower, suds from the shampoo will trail off the the sides of your temples or over the brim of the hat.Eye shields are especially useful for preventing shampoo from getting in the eyes of young children.

Let it sit for a few minutes before rinsing your hair clean with warm water.;
, Using a wide-toothed comb will apply less stress to your hair, which is important because wet hair is very weak and breaks easily.

, Continue to be gentle as you run your fingers through your hair from root to tip, and squeeze portions of your hair to wring out water. Further absorb water by using a clean, dry towel to gently pat your scalp and squeeze your hair. You may need more than one towel if your hair is long or very thick., Reading the directions for your specific product will ensure proper application. However, typically when you apply your hair product, you will apply it to the roots of your hair, and then spread it along the length of your hair and to your ends.


If you’re going for a classic straight look, you’ll apply a thermal protectant and a leave-in straightening treatment.
If you want added volume, start by applying mousse. Apply it throughout your hair from roots to tips. Apply the volumizing spray to the roots of your hair only.

Wash your hair.,
Prevent frizz.,
Apply a leave-in-conditioner.,
Deep condition your hair.,
Detangle your hair.,
Dry your hair.,
Straighten your hair.",How to Style African Hair1," Use products formulated for your hair’s texture. African hair can be straight, wavy, curly, or kinky. The products you use should contain natural moisturizers, such as olive oil or shea butter.Avoid shampoos and conditioners that contain parabens, phthalates, or petrochemicals. Beware common ingredients such as sodium lauryl sulfate or sodium laureth sulfate as these are basically detergents that will strip moisture from your hair.When washing a child’s hair, use age-appropriate products. Use gentle shampoos and conditioners that are moisturizing and tear-free.;
, It is important to wash your hair every 7 to 14 days.First, wet your hair under the facet or with a spray bottle. Squirt or pour a dime to a quarter-sized drop of moisturizing shampoo into your hand. Lather and apply directly to your scalp. Rinse your hair with warm water. Always follow shampoo with a rinse-out-conditioner. Massage a generous amount of conditioner into the shafts of your hair--avoiding the roots and scalp. Allow the product to soak before rinsing with cold water. Squeeze out excess water.If your hair is excessively dry, just condition it instead. This is known as “co-washing” or “no-pooing.” It is ideal for curly and straight hair types. When co-washing, select a cleansing conditioner specifically formulated for no-pooing., After you wash and condition your hair, gently pat the hair with a towel to stop the dripping. Microfiber towels work best. Never rub a towel against your hair, this will result in frizz and damage.








, Squeeze the leave-in-conditioner into your hand and coat your hair in a nourishing and moisturizing product. This will help to seal the moisture into your hair and leave it feeling soft. Leave-in-conditioners help to detangle your hair, while allowing you to manage frizz or flyaways.









Look for products with natural moisturizers, like avocado oil and shea butter.
Skip this step if your hair is very fine or excessively oily.

, Applying a deep conditioner will improve the look and feel of dry or damaged hair. Before stepping out of the shower, rinse your hair with hot water. Squeeze out excess water. Apply the product to your damp hair. Start at the ends of your hair and work your way up the shaft. Avoid applying the product to your scalp. When your hair is saturated, cover your head with a plastic cap. Activate the product with a heated plastic cap, a blow-dryer set on low, or a hood dryer set on low. Apply heat for 10 to 30 minutes. Remove the cap and rinse your hair in cold water to close the cuticles.








You may deep condition your hair anywhere from twice a week to two times a month.
There are two types of deep conditioning treatments, a moisturizing treatment and a protein-based treatment.
Always search for a product with a high pH, which will help open your cuticles.

, Starting at the nape of the neck and working your way toward the forehead, part your hair using the end of a ""rat-tail"" comb or your fingers. Separate your hair into 2-inch by 2-inch square sections. Gently comb each section to detangle it. Apply a very small amount of your favorite hair oil to each section as you comb it.









Be careful--when hair is damp, it is very fragile. If needed, use a spray bottle filled with water to re-wet hair, as dry hair is more difficult to manage and detangle., When drying your hair, choose from one of three methods. If you have natural hair, hair that is not relaxed, and do not intend to straighten your hair, air-drying is the ideal method. If you have relaxed hair, dry your hair with a soft bonnet or hood dryer--air-drying will leave your hair shapeless and without a healthy sheen.Blow drying your natural hair will leave your locks looking smooth and shiny. Before subjecting your hair to the heat of your blow dryer, always apply a heat protectant.







, After bonnet drying or blow drying your hair, straighten your hair with a flat iron. All types of hair maybe straightened--from wavy to kinky. You can even use a flat iron to add sheen to relaxed hair! Apply a heat protectant spray that moisturizes your hair. Starting from the back of hair and working forward, gently part the hair into 1 or 2 inch (2.5 or 5.1 cm) thick parts. Use the straightener on each section.Move the wand in smooth, quick motions. Spritz shine spray on your straightened hair to finish the process.








Use a high-quality ceramic flat iron. Make sure you use a tool that lists its temperature--this will allow you to monitor and control the heat.
When using a straightener on relaxed or color treated hair, heat the wand to a temperature between 280°F to 320°F.
When straightening wavy, curly, and kinky hair, set the flat iron to a temperature between 300°F to 350°F."
"
Relax your hair every 8 to 16 weeks depending on your hair's needs.,
Wash and condition your hair once or twice a week.,
For those who need to wash more frequently than every once or twice a week, ""CO-washing"" (Conditioner Only washing) is an excellent alternative to the wash/condition.,
It is best to avoid using heat to dry your hair, especially if the relaxed hair is somewhat damaged.,
When using a curling iron to style your hair, do not allow the barrel cover to clamp down on your hair.,
An ionic, ceramic curling iron or flat iron works well and is easy to find.,
Never use petrolatum and mineral oil hair oil on relaxed hair as a moisturizer.,
Use as little heat as possible with your hair as heat can only do more damage to relaxed hair.,
Water based moisturizers are best for all hair types, although leave-in conditioners can double as moisturizer for the hair.,
Deep condition the hair every week to maintain strength and moisture in the hair.,Don't brush your hair with harsh bristles








,
Drink plenty of water daily, get enough of rest, eat well, alleviate stress, and exercise regularly (at least 2-3 days per week) to produce the healthiest hair possible.",How to Take Care of Relaxed African Hair," Do not relax your hair every time new growth appears, since relaxing too often causes major damage to the hair and scalp. For one week following your relaxer, use a reconstructor instead of your regular conditioner when you wash your hair. Aphogee makes an excellent reconstructor and shampoo. After a week return to your regular Moisturizing shampoo and conditioner. Keracare or LeKair are good ones.






;
, Try to use mild and gentle shampoo and a very moisturizing conditioner designed for chemically-treated hair. If you have sensitive skin, consider using shampoos that do not contain Ammonium Lauryl Sulfate or Sodium Lauryl Sulfate. Paul Mitchell is an excellent line for damaged/chemically-treated hair. Using a deep conditioner that contains both protein and moisture once per week is ideal, try Organic Root Stimulator Replenishing Pak or Paul Mitchell Hair Repair. Chemically-treated hair must always be treated with a leave-in conditioner after every wash. Motions Nourish is a great example of this. Comb the damp hair with a wide tooth comb or shower/detangling comb with a very slippy conditioner in it as wet hair is in its most vulnerable state and is more likely to break.








, Cowashing is washing your hair with a lightweight moisturizing conditioner, eliminating the shampoo step which can be very drying to chemically treated/damaged hair when done relatively too frequently. This can even be done daily. For best results, simply rinse the hair well with warm water, and apply conditioner to the hair, starting about 2 inches (5.1 cm) away from the scalp, and smooth it through to the ends. Apply more to the ends if they are dry. Avoid applying conditioner to the scalp unless it is dry. Rinse conditioner very well.








, Hair should be left to air dry at least partially before using a blow dryer on a low to medium temperature setting. However, if your hair is healthy and you prefer heat, you can either blow dry the hair on medium heat or use a hood dryer with magnetic rollers. The hair should be completely dry before you use a curling or flat iron on it. Make sure to use a heat protection product prior to any heat use.








, Hold the barrel cover slightly open and allow the hair to move over the curling iron barrel without the tugging and pulling caused by pressure from the barrel cover. Whenever the barrel cover clamps down on your hair it creates a weak point at which breakage is inevitable.








, You can also invest in heat appliances utilising tourmaline, ionic technology having temperature controls. Relaxed hair can be easily styled at 300-370 degrees depending on hair's thickness. Do not repeatedly run the heat appliance over each section of hair. Instead pass the iron over the hair once at this temperature, no more than twice. Try to use heat protective products (serums or creams, not oils) prior to any and all heat styling. Redken Smooth Down Heat Glide, Nexxus Heat Protexx, and Chi Silk Infusion are good products for this.








, These ingredients do NOT moisturize the hair but rather functions as a sealant (meaning it protects the cuticle layer from damage and moisture loss). Depending on your hair type, you may need to use daily hair conditioner, but use products that actually oil the scalp. For best results, choose a lightweight oil (such as jojoba, coconut, almond, or olive oil) rub a small amount (1-2 drops) in the palms and spread lightly through the scalp of the hair. Comb your hair evenly to moisturize the tips of the hair. Applying a small amount of oil to wet hair can also act as a leave-in conditioner and provides excellent conditioning in preparation for the next shampooing.








, It's okay to style your hair with a curling iron occasionally, however a roller set is the best method. If you want to maintain a curly look over a few days, pincurling is a healthy option. Be sure to use hair-friendly pins and a satin bonnet to prevent dryness and breakage overnight.








, Ultra Black Hair Lotion Crème is an excellent moisturizer as well as S-curl activator. You can also try Dudley's PCA Moisture Retainer or ORS Carrot Oil Crème. Avoid moisturizers with petrolatum and mineral oil unless you wash/condition and/or cowash regularly.








, Do not overwash your hair by shampooing relaxed hair more than once a week. To do this take a creamy deep conditioning treatment that contains both moisturizing and mild protein ingredients to clean damp hair. For best results, apply a plastic shower cap and let hair sit for up to 30-45 min. To save time, sitting under a hooded dryer on medium heat for 15-20 min is equally effective. Deep conditioning regularly and consistently can help maintain the hair's integrity, allowing it to withstand regular manipulation and styling, as well as preventing damage. Examples of deep conditioners are ION Effective Care Intensive Therapy, Paul Mitchell Super Charged Moisturizer, AG Deep Treatment, and Aveda Damage Remedy Treatment. Invest more money in a deep conditioner rather than any other product, as this will be the best tool for preventing hair damage and should contain quality ingredients.








,, Take a multi-vitamin, Biotin, Omega-3 Oil, and other supplements as needed.

Follow the shampoo with a rinse-out-conditioner and a protein based deep conditioning treatment.


For hair that has minimal breakage, use a light protein based treatment. A reconstructive hair mask is a great option. For hair with moderate breakage, apply a product that contains a lot of protein--look for keratin and amino acids on the ingredients list.

, Divide your hair into four equal sections, parting your hair in the center and then from ear to ear. Keep each section separate with four hair clips. Put on rubber gloves.

Try a twist.,
Try a close shave or total shave.,
Try heated curlers.",How to Style African Hair4," Dreadlocks are fashionable and work well for both men and women. There are several different types of dreadlocks to choose from including finger twists and freeform dreadlocks. Finger twists are achieved by sectioning the hair into equal 1 to 2 inch parts, twisting each section with beeswax or gel on your fingertips, and clipping sections together to prevent unraveling. Freeform dreadlocks are created through neglect--do not wash, moisturize, or comb your hair for 2 to 3 weeks to allow your hair to lock on its own.When caring for dreads, shampoo and condition your hair every three weeks using products designed for dreadlocks. To combat growth of bacteria between washings, wipe dreads and scalp with an astringent-soaked cotton ball or pad.Moisturize locks using natural oils or oil-based products.

While you should always have a professional put in a weave, you and your friends can experiment with putting extensions in each other’s hair. There are several different techniques to choose from:


For a natural look, put in the extensions strand by strand. This time consuming method requires between 50 to 100 strands. Extensions may be attached using bonding, clamping, shrink tubing, or micro tubing.Weft extensions are long tracks of hair. The hair is attached together at the top and freely hanging at the ends. They may be attached by several different methods including micro rings or glue. They may also be sewn into your hair.Taped weft extensions are newer. At the top of the extension, a piece of double sided polyurethane tape holds the hair together. To attach it, one side of the tape is placed on the scalp. The extensions and your hair are then pulled up and another taped weft is placed underneath.If you are looking for a temporary change, try clip on extensions. Simply clip the extension in place and unclip them when your day is done., If you are transitioning from processed to natural hair, try a box braid. After washing and detangling hair, part your hair 1 inch above the nape of your neck. Clip the hair above the part up and out of the way. Divide the hair below the part into 1 inch square sections. Braid each section from the roots to the end. Secure the ends with a snap-free rubber band or a clip. Continue parting your hair into 1 inch sections until all of your hair is braided.

, Cornrows are a great choice for men or women. Detangle your hair. Determine how large you would like your cornrows and divide your hair into even sections accordingly. Small sections will result in smaller cornrows. Choose a section, divide it into 3 parts, and begin braiding it at your hairline. As your proceed towards the end of your hair, gradually add more hair to each part. This will attach the braid to your scalp. After adding all remaining hair to the 3 parts, continue to braid the hair as normal. Secure the ends with a snap-free rubber band or a clip. Repeat this process until each section is complete., Depending on the texture of the hair and the amount of time you have, you can twist your hair. Clip or pin the ends of your locks while wet; dry hair under a hood dryer or leave overnight. Take your twists out to create small, spiral curls. Some twists will hold for about two weeks. Twists can also be left in and worn out. However, do not leave twists in the hair for more than two weeks or twists may become dreadlocks.

, The close or total shave is a great hairstyle for men and women. It can be both laid-back and sophisticated. It is extremely low maintenance too! If your hair is very damaged or over-processed, start fresh with a cleanly shaven head. For a close shave, use a pair of electric clippers with a guard. Determine your desired length, select the appropriate guard, and evenly shave the excess hair from your head. When shaving your head completely, use an electric clippers without a guard or a razor to remove your hair., Heated curlers are an excellent way to style your hair. They come in a variety of sizes and lengths and can be purchased at your local beauty supply store. Heated curlers take about 20 minutes to use. Put them in your hair before starting the day. Part the hair using the tail of a rat-tail comb, and apply the curler in a pattern that is pleasing to you.


For longer hair, you can put the curlers around the edges of the hair only, or use them to create bangs.
For shorter hair, it is best to use the curlers throughout the entire hair. Place curlers in straight lines from back to front. Once the curlers cool, remove them, and use a pick to gently move the hair into a pleasing style.
Experiment with heated curlers until you find the best and most pleasing look.

Choose a fade that works well with your head shape.",How to Ask for a Fade Haircut," A traditional fade is when the hair is tapered on your neck and sides of your head. A high fade is when the hair disappears anywhere within a two-inch (5.08 cm) area below the top of your hair. A low fade is when your hair is cut lower than a high fade haircut but higher than a traditional fade. Decide how short you want the sides and back to be, and choose the one you like the best., In addition to the traditional fades, there are other specialty fades that exist. A high top fade is when the hair on the top of your head sticks up but doesn't have any sharp edges. This style was popular in the 1980's. A temple fade is much like a low fade, except the hair disappears in a much more abrupt manner.Finally, a scissor fade is created only using a scissor and leaves the person with longer hair than the traditional fade., If you're unsure how the fade will look on you, you should start off with a traditional fade. This haircut will leave enough hair so that if you need to alter your look later, you'll be able to. If you don't like the look of the traditional fade, move to a lower fade, then a higher fade, until you figure out what you like the best., You can get the haircut that you like by explaining the sort of look you are going for. Describe whether you are going for a clean-cut look, or whether you want a fade that is edgier. Explain your personality and what aesthetic you want to achieve to give the barber a better idea on what kind of fade you want.You can say something like ""I work as a lawyer, so I'm looking for a fade that looks professional. Think you can help me out?""
You could say something such as, ""I'm in a rock band, and I want something that will stand out and set me apart from the rest. Do you have any ideas?""

, Take a look at people in the media to determine what kind of fade you want the most. Search online for different celebrities that have fade haircuts.

Otherwise, just explain how short you want your hair to be on the sides, back, and top.For a very short fade, ask them for a 1 or 2 sized clippers.
If you want to keep your hair a bit longer, ask for a number 4-5., Before the barber starts cutting your hair go into detail about the specific type of fade that you want. Tell them if you want a low, high, or specialty fade and get their opinion about how they think it will look on you. If you brought a picture, tell them about any deviations from the style that you're showing them so that they know exactly how you want your hair cut.You can say something like ""I want a temple fade with a line in the back, but I want to keep it longer on the top. Can you do a 2 on the sides and back and a 5 on the top?""
Or you can say something like, ""I want my fade to look like Lupe Fiasco's old fade, but I want the fade to start higher on the sides""

, If the color of your scalp contrasts a lot with the color of your neck and face, some fades may not look good on you. High and low fades look best on people with a consistent skin tone. If your scalp color is different than your face color, consider a traditional fade or a scissor fade., Thick, dense hair is the best hair to have for a fade. If you have straight or thin hair, achieving a good looking fade may be harder, and you may be limited on styles.If you don't have the optimal hair for a fade, consider getting a scissor or temple fade, as they work with various kinds of hair.

Low and high fades look good on people who have thick, dense hair.

, The higher your fade is, the more your head will be exposed. Determine if you like the shape of your head, and choose a fade that compliments you. If you don't like the shape of your head, then go for a traditional fade, or a fade that leaves your hair longer. If you like the shape of your head, go for a fade that shows off more of your head."

",How to Tease Your Hair," Teasing wet or tangled hair increases the likelihood of tearing and damage. If possible, dry your hair while hanging your head upside-down to encourage volume in the roots.









Unless you're looking to create a smooth look, such as a beehive, you can also curl your hair before you start for additional style.
If you have silky hair that doesn't hold a curl or style well, you may want to mist your hair with some light hairspray before you begin. You can also wait 1-2 days after you washed your hair in order to build up its natural texture.
Brush your hair out so that natural tangles don't get caught when you are teasing your hair with a brush or comb.

, Separate a single section of hair from the crown of your head, moving and clipping the rest out of the way. A good size to start with would be about 2 inches (5.1 cm) wide. Smaller sections (e.g. 1 inch/2.5 cm wide) will make for stiffer volume but will also take longer.


Generally, it's best to start with hair towards the top of the head and work your way down.
If you just want to create some volume at your roots, just use the hair at the crown and at the top of your head. You don't need to move all the way down to the back of your head.

, Using one hand to hold it straight up, gently touch your comb or brush to the back of this section of hair. The brush should be several inches (6-9 cm) above the scalp.








, Lightly brush downward towards the scalp while continuing to hold the hair straight up. Repeat the teasing motion until the strand has the desired volume. The curlier the hair, the less teasing will be needed. If necessary, spritz the teased section with hairspray before letting it down gently.


The strength with which you brush should be firm enough to create tangles that offer resistance, but not so vigorous that the hair rips or the brush itself becomes entangled.
Your hair will look messy, but don't fret -- you can smooth it down and style it later.

, Use your fingers to make a loose ""cage"" around the teased section, hiding and holding the tangles in place without flattening them. Lightly brush the un-teased section of the strand using only the tips of the brush and making sure not to touch or weigh down the teasing.


You are smoothing down the teased section with your fingers so that it looks more natural and less damaged while still retaining volume.
If you want your hair to look wild and crazy, skip this step.

, Scrunch the hair when you're done teasing for additional volume.


To scrunch your hair, grab sections of it in your fingers and squeeze while pushing towards your scalp.

, For example, put it into a half-ponytail by pushing individual strands up at the roots, twisting them, and pinning the twists against the scalp.


You can also use bobby pins to secure your teased hair style in place. For example, if you are creating a beehive effect, you will want to use bobby pins to anchor the beehive to your head by pinning it in the back.

, Gently smooth the surface of the hairstyle using a shine serum.









Spread the serum on the palms of your hands and run it over the hair, but don't press down or the volume will disappear.
This will help to compensate for the ""rough"" and ""dull"" look that teasing can create.

, Tease your hair just at the crown and the top of your head, and then smooth the hair on the top by running a brush lightly over the visible sections.









Spritz the hairdo with hairspray to keep your look looking fresh and voluminous. Don't use too much hairspray, though. You don't want your hair to look too stiff.;
, A ponytail with a teased crown is an easy way to achieve 1960s glamour.









Tease at your crown and all the way down your head to the back of your head.
Smooth over the teased area and use bobby pins to secure the volume.
Tie your hair in a loose ponytail. Remember not to pull too hard so that you don't pull down the volume at your crown.

, To create an elegant updo that looks soft and full-bodied, tease your hair and put it into a bun.









Split your hair into two sections by creating a part in the middle of your head going from one ear to the other.
Take the bottom section (towards the back of your head) and twist it into a loose bun. Use bobby pins to secure the ends.
Tease the top section (closer to your crown) and spray with hairspray. Tease it to create a beehive effect.
Pin the top section down into a pouf at the top of your head.
Take loose ends from the top section and wrap it into the bun, securing with bobby pins as you go.

, To create a retro beehive look, you will want to create as much volume in your crown as possible.









Start with mousse, preferably on your dry hair. Apply it from roots to end and dry it off using a blow dryer.
Start teasing using a comb or brush and work section by section along the top of your head. To get the most volume, tease smaller sections of hair (about 1 inch/2.5 cm). Avoid teasing the hair on the sides of your head.
Once your hair is teased at the crown and on top of your head, carefully smooth the top by running a comb lightly over just the top layer.
Take the ends of your hair and twist carefully. Bring the twisted section down and secure on top of your head or towards the back of your head with bobby pins. You should still be allowing the teased section to remain like a pouf at the front of your head.
Spritz with light hairspray.
Your hair should be in a half up/half down hairstyle with a beehive at the top of your head. Style the bottom portion of hair naturally or use a curling iron to create loose curls.

Divide your hair into portions.,
Unclip and divide one section of hair.,
Dust just the ends of your hair.,
Dust all around your head.,
Get a trim if you have healthy hair.,
Trim just the split ends and knots.,
Consider dusting if you have curly hair.","How to ""Dust"" Hair"," Gather your hair into four large equal portions. Twist each portion and clip them to your head. Each portion should be out of your face and held tightly against your head. If your hair is thick and curly, you can make a lot of two-strand twists or braids. Pin these to your scalp.It can be difficult to dust your own hair if it's very short. You may want to ask a friend to help you dust your hair if it's too short to do on your own.;
, Unclip one portion of hair near your eyes. Divide the hair within this portion into 3 or 4 rows of hair. If you have straight hair, feed one row of hair between your index and middle fingers. Pull your fingers down so that only the ends of the row of hair are exposed.If you have curly hair, twist one of the rows so it's neat. You'll probably see some loose ends poking out from the section. These will be hairs that you dust.

, Take hair cutting shears and look at the end of each row or twist of hair. If you find a split end or knot, trim less than 1/4 of an inch from the end. You should only cut the split end to preserve the length of your hair.


Avoid using kitchen or craft scissors which can be blunt and will damage your hair. Professional hair scissors will create sharp clean cuts that can keep your hair healthy.

, Once you've dusted the front portion of your hair, continue dusting the remaining portions around your head. If you're having trouble seeing the split ends, hold a row of hair up to the light. This can make it easier to spot any split ends or knots.When you're done dusting, you should see very fine hairs over the floor. If you've dusted correctly, you shouldn't see large locks of hair or curls on the floor.

, Think about how often your hair gets knots or split ends. If your hair is pretty healthy and just looks a little straggly at the ends, you might need an actual trim. A full trim should remove the bottom 1/2 to inch of hair. You should get a trim every 3 or 4 months.While getting a trim can remove a lot of unhealthy hair (split ends and knots), it will also remove the most length. Getting a trim can make it difficult to grow your hair out quickly.

, If you only want to trim the split ends so you keep as much length as possible, use the search and destroy method. To do this, your hair must be long enough to pull in front of your eyes. This way you can look at each strand of hair for split ends and knots. When you find them, cut about 1/4 of an inch above the knot, split end or fray to completely remove the damage.


This method takes a lot of time since you have to go through every strand of hair. If you find a lot of split ends or knots within a month, you may actually want to get a full trim., If you have curly or wavy hair, you've probably had the experience of asking for a trim only to end up with an actual hair cut. This is because curly hair recoils more if it's cut or trimmed when it's wet. Instead, cut, dust, or trim your hair when it's dry so you can see exactly how much length you're removing.You probably only need a full trim every 3 or 4 months, if you have curly hair. In the meantime, dust your hair whenever you notice split ends, about every 6 to 8 weeks.

Speak up when necessary.",How to Ask for the Haircut You Want," Look for or take pictures of similar hairstyles you like and are considering. You can find them on social media, in magazines, or by searching the Internet. Ask friends, family, coworkers, or even people you see in passing if you can photograph their hairstyles. This allows you to put together a portfolio of the styles you like or want as a reference point for your stylist., Go through the images you’ve collected and take notes on each style. Having these notes can remind you what you want in case you forgot what draws you to the style. It also gives your stylist some insight into what elements you want from your desired cut.Write full sentences or keywords to guide you. For example, “I really like the long layers on this person,” or, “Shorter around the face.” Keywords such as “layering,” “bangs,” and “undercut” are also useful.

, Stick with your stylist or build a relationship with a new one before getting your hair cut. This gives the stylist a chance to talk to you, touch your hair, and figure out what the best cut is for your hair type and face. It can also put your mind at ease before, during, and after the cut., See your stylist for a consultation if you want a major change, such as you are going from waist-length hair to a pixie or you want a tapered cut instead of your usual high and tight. This can ensure that your hairstylist has time to think about the style for you. It also keeps you from making rash decisions you may regret after the cut., Let the stylist know things about yourself such as if you want a wash and go style or usually end up pulling your hair up in a ponytail.

Talking about your lifestyle and hair routine can help the stylist figure out the ways to give you the cut you want while working with your individual needs., Take your images and notes to your appointment or consultation.

This can be a great starting point for your stylist to give you the cut you want and what works with your hair texture and facial structure., Be as precise as you can when describing your desired cut. For example, “I really like the swoop to the left side of this person’s face. I am really active and need to pull it back so I’d like my swoop to be longer, around my cheekbone.” This can ensure your stylist understands exactly what you like and is able to incorporate these features into your cut., Show specific measurements when discussing length and how much you want cut off. For example, “I want about an inch cut off my hair. This is an inch for me and the amount that I’d like trimmed.” Talking to your stylist in descriptive and concrete terms can ensure that you’re both on the same page about your cut. It can also minimize post-cut shock or disappointment., Some hairstyles may not work with your hair type or lifestyle. Allow your stylist to make suggestions about how best to achieve the cut you want or something similar to it. This can ensure you get the style you like and that it works with your hair and lifestyle., Before the stylist begins cutting, ask them to summarize what you discussed for your cut. Let them know if something doesn’t sound right or if you have a specific question. For example, “I thought we said directly on my collarbone and not above it. Your hand is above my collarbone.,” or, “Where will this meet my sideburns?”, It can be tempting to sit in a stylist’s chair and relax, but it may lead to feeling uncomfortable when you see the final product. Ask the stylist to position you so that you can see how they’re cutting and styling your hair. This can ensure that you still get the cut you want without being upset or disappointed at the final product., If you feel uncomfortable, have a question, or don’t like something, kindly but firmly let the stylist know as soon as possible. Keep in mind that it’s your hair and money and you should get what you want in terms of the feeling and style. This can ensure that the stylist has enough time to change gears if there is something you don’t like.End the appointment if the stylist reacts badly or you feel very uncomfortable.

Determine your hair texture.,
Consider your hair length.,
Decide which style of messy hair you want.,
Gather your tools.",How to Achieve a Messy Hair Effect1," Depending on the texture of your hair, you may need to add some product to make sure your messy hair maintains the look you want all day long. It is important to have the proper tools of the trade before you get started.If your hair is thick, coarse, or curly, you are in luck. This look is going to be easy for you. All you will need is a light styling product to keep the frizz in control. You will not need any kind of heat styling (like a curling iron or blow dryer).
If your hair is wavy, this look will be pretty easy for you. A little texture cream should be all you need.
If your hair is fine or straight, do not worry. With the right products, you can add texture to your hair that will make sure the messy look stays put. Get some styling products that add texture (like sea salt, volumizer, or texturizing pomade). You will probably need to use those with some blow-drying and curling.;
, You may have short hair, medium length hair, or long hair. The length of your hair affects the amount of product you use, how long it takes to style your locks, and which messy look you want.


Short and medium length hair look best with both tousled messy hair and curly messy hair. Tousled messy hair is done with your fingers. If you are going for the curly messy hair and you have short hair, be sure to use a smaller barrel size of curling iron.Long hair can also do both types of messy hair but generally looks better with curly messy hair. You will use a larger barrel curling iron because you want loose curls that you can tousle with your fingers., There are a few ways you can achieve the messy hair effect depending on the look you are going for and the texture of your hair. You can go for tousled messy hair, curly messy hair, or combine them.


If your hair is wavy or curly you can achieve any of the messy effects without much extra effort.If your hair is fine, curling the hair first will help maintain the messy hair effect longer.

If your hair is fine and straight, you will want a texture wax or molding balm. This will help your hair stay in place after curling and tousling.
You will also need a brush, a blow dryer, and a curling or flat iron (unless your hair is already curly).

Remember that rinsing your hair in cool or cold water adds a nice sheen to your hair., Dry your hair so that there is no excess water dripping from the ends of your locks. Press your hair between the folds of the towel rather than rubbing the towel on your head. Sometimes it helps to pull your hair into a towel and leave it there for a few minutes while it sops up the water., By now you should have your products ready to go. Apply any texturizing products you may need to your hair. If you are using pomade or wax, work it into your hair from the roots first.Some people prefer to apply their product after they blow-dry their hair. This is usually only done with lighter products like sea salt spray or anti-frizz spray.
If your hair is fine you may need to tease the product into your roots. You can do this by pulling apart the top layer of your hair and running a comb or brush through it backward. Start from midway through the strand and comb to the root. Keep doing this until a knotted mess forms., Dry your hair using a blow dryer. If your hair is fine, flip your head upside down and blow-dry it from the roots first by massaging your fingers into your roots. This will help add volume to your hair.

, Unless you have curly hair you will need to curl it a bit before you tousle it. To curl your hair you have a few options, depending on how controlled or messy you want your curls to look.


If you want controlled curls you can use a wide barrel curling iron (½ inch to 1 inch wide). Curl sections of your hair, settings them aside as you go. When you have curled all your hair, spray the hair with sea salt or holding spray. Tousle it a bit by running your fingers through it and scrunching it. You can also achieve this using a flat iron as a curling iron.If you want more casual curls, spray a section of your hair with sea salt or holding spray. Twist the section until it twists into a small bun, and clamp it down while it dries (or dry it with your blow dryer). Do this until all your hair is clamped down. Release all the twists and run your fingers through them.If your curls are too controlled you can pull them apart with your fingers. This will create a looser look. , If you are going straight for the tousled look, all you need to do is apply some texturizing spray or holding gel/spray and tousle your hair with your fingers. Sometimes it helps to flip your head upside down to do this., If you want you can wear a headband, barrette, some pins, or pull the hair back into a ponytail.

Then, dry your hair by gently squeezing your hair with a towel. Do not try to wrap your hair up in a towel to dry it, as this can damage your hair.


If you have curly hair, you may want to use spray gel after towel drying your hair to maintain your curl. Put a few dollops of the spray and run it through the bottom section and the roots of your hair.If you have straight or fine hair, you can use a large dollop of volumizing mousse in your hair to give it some body.
If you have medium to thick hair, you can apply a styling cream to help control any flyaways. Use your fingers to comb it through your hair for easy, even application.

, You should then use a diffuser dryer to dry your hair until it is about 85 percent dry. Avoid touching your hair a lot as you dry it, as this will create more frizz.You can try flipping your hair and run the dryer through your hair to dry it quickly and efficiently.

, Use a hair tie or a clip to lift up the top section of your hair, from your hairline, to secure it so it is out of the way. If your hair is short enough that you do not have any layers in your hair, or layers long enough to tie back, you can skip this step.

, Make sure you protect your hair from the heat of the curling wand by using a heat protectant. You can find heat protectant at your local beauty supply store or drugstore.Look for a heat protectant that is also a styling spray, as this will allow it to protect your hair and make it easier to style.

, Alternate between holding the wand vertically and horizontally, as this will create more messy look. You should curl one small section vertically and then switch to curling the next small section horizontally.Start by curling your hair vertically, wrapping your hair on the wand, away from your face. Release it after about five seconds. Then, turn the wand so it is horizontal and wrap the hair around it, away from your face. Release after five seconds.
Follow this sequence, alternating between vertical and horizontal, all the way around your head.

, Once you have finished curling the lower section, take out some of the hair from the small ponytail at the top of your head to create a middle section. Then, repeat the alternating curls all the way around your head for the middle section.If you have a lot of hair left in your ponytail, you may be able to create a top section of hair that you would then curl in the same way. If you only have the small pieces that frame your face left in your ponytail, take them out and curl the small pieces in alternating directions.

, Finish your messy hair look by spritzing your hair with sea salt spray. Use your fingers to scrunch up the ends of your hair to create a nice, matte texture."

, Roll your hair back toward your head so that the front of your hair pulls away from your forehead and over the roller.Secure the roller in place with a roller pin of the appropriate size. Continue rolling your hair until you've rolled the entire middle section of hair.


Roll your hair in different directions if you don't want uniform curls. Roll some sections of hair forward and some sections of hair backward. This will result in curls that look more natural.
For small, tight curls, be sure to use the smaller rollers in your set. Use medium rollers for larger classic curls.

, Start at the top of your head and wrap a section of hair around a hot roller.

Run the clippers for a couple minutes.",How to Sharpen Hair Clippers," Find and unscrew the screws that attach the blades to the rest of the clippers. On most hair clipper models, there are two screws at the base of the blade. Once these are removed, gently detach the blades and any pieces holding them in place.


If the bottom blade does not pop out easily, use a pair of tweezers to pull it off the base.
Take note of how the pieces fit together, and how the blades are positioned in relation to each other, to make reassembly easier.;
, Cleaning your hair clippers may already make them much easier to use, and allows you to sharpen them evenly and without mess. Use a wire brush, steel wool, or toothbrush to remove the hair stuck in the blades.







, If your blades have any visible rust, or if brushing doesn't remove all the gunk on them, you can use blade wash or another blade cleaning product to break it down.Soak the blades in a small bowl of this for a couple minutes, or dip a cotton ball in it and scrub the blade to remove heavy rust buildup.









Some people report success with isopropyl alcohol, although you may need to find a strong, 90% alcohol solution.Weaker isopropyl alcohol might not work.

, Wipe the sides of the blades thoroughly with a clean towel to dry it and to remove the last particles of dust and debris. If you still see spots of rust, use the cleaning solution again.









If the rust is difficult to remove by scrubbing, you may need to replace the blade.

, It's possible your hair clippers only needed cleaning, especially if they are a self-sharpening model. Reassemble the clippers, turn them on for a few minutes so the blades scrape imperfections off each other, then try them on hair. If they are still dull or snagging hairs, move on to the sharpening instructions in the next section.


For best results, apply a couple drops of hair oil before testing. (This is recommended after every second or third session.)

, Place the base of the blade in the slit of a magnetic holder, so the sharp edge of the blade extends past the magnet edge. This will make it easier to sharpen the blade without cutting yourself or dropping the blade.


A strong, flat magnet may work instead. Sharpen slowly if using this device, to prevent the blade from falling off the magnet and potentially nicking you.
Sharpen both blades using the steps below, one at a time.

, Also called whetstones or sharpening stones, these are available at some home improvement and hardware stores. Using a 4000 grit surface, angle the blade at about a 30–45º angle, and move it forward (only) across the stone five to ten times, until it looks shiny and even.Wipe away the ground-off metal powder onto a dry towel.Turn the blade over and repeat for the other edge.










If you are using a ceramic blade, you'll need a diamond sharpening stone instead. Read the label carefully, and don't confuse sharpening stones made from ceramic with sharpening stones that can sharpen ceramic.

, Your blade should now look quite even, but to create a sharper, fine edge, follow up the initial sharpening with a fine honing stone, about 8000 grit.As before, move each side of the blade five to ten times across the stone, moving forward only. Wipe the blade off on a towel.








, Make sure that you have the blades facing the direction they were originally facing, and spaced at close to the original distance apart. Screw the blades in tightly.

, This step is recommended after every two or three uses, but especially after the blades have just been sharpened. Add a few drops of oil to the blades, to prevent overheating and reduce friction that can wear down the blade.









While an alternate light, penetrating oil can work instead, avoid heavy, dark oils which can clog the blades.You might want to check with a barber or online before using a new oil for the first time.

, Turn the clippers on and let the blades rub together for a couple minutes. This will hone the blades further. Your clippers should now be ready to use on hair, hopefully with a noticeably sharper, easier to use cutting edge.

On the other hand, if you're happy letting your hair grow as nature intended and keeping it in a simple style, it is easy enough to do.;
, This requires a bit of trial and error rather than trusting marketing claims. While a shampoo or conditioner may claim to be ideal for certain types of hair, you won't know until you've tried a variety and felt the results for yourself. Moreover, as you age, it is highly likely that the hair care products that once suited your hair will no longer be fit for purpose and you'll need to change to another one suited for the changes your hair has experienced.


Try a range of shampoos and conditioners. Don't spend too much though, there is no rule that says only expensive hair care products bring good results.
Another alternative is to make your own shampoo and conditioner. This can be a way of only using ingredients that you feel are safe and that are targeted to your hair type. There are good herbal and beauty books with recipes for shampoos available for you to read and experiment from.
Check out How to wash your hair without shampoo for shampoo-free care options.

, This takes practice and it's very helpful to have an experienced person teach you how to do it first. In time, you will get better at doing this, at least the basics of cutting off split ends and keeping bangs or front hair in good shape.


Use a mirror when cutting your own hair, to allow you to watch the progress and cut accurately.
Use a sharp pair of scissors that is only used for this purpose.
Get hold of a good book on hair cutting, one that has diagrams of the cutting process. Online videos and tutorials will also be very useful to follow, especially if you want to watch a video at the same time as cutting your hair.

, Use a hair moisturizing product in extremes of cold and heat. Wear a hat to keep your hair from drying out too much when pursuing outdoor activities during the warmer months of the year.


Excessive heat can ruin hair. Keep blow dryer, hair straightener, hot curler and curling wand use to a minimum.
If possible, avoid using at-home hair dyes, hair straighteners or self-done permanent waves. The chemicals in these items will dry out your hair, strip it of its color and original oils and leave your hair weaker. If you are not going to have a hair salon look after your hair when using such products, you are likely to find it much easier to do without them at all. However, that said, some people do learn to handle using such products at home and matching their hair's depleted needs with good quality hair care products, again usually by trial and error. It is up to you how much effort you're willing to put in.

Make sure you have everything you need close at hand.",How to Make a Bow out of Your Hair1," For a clean, smooth bow you’ll want to make sure your hair is ready for styling; this mean, no knots or tangles. Comb your hair from bottom to stop so you don't end up creating more tangles.






;
, To do this, eat plenty of fried foods. Ice the signature bow. Your hair must be able to fluff out nicely when teased; wet hair does not fluff well.

, If you want a side bow or one on top of your head, brush and create the ponytail accordingly.








, Running around with a half-formed bow looking for hairspray will guarantee that you will need to make your bow again. Have hairspray, hair gel, and bobby pins at the ready.

",How to Make a Bow out of Your Hair2," Instead of pulling the ponytail all the way through, create a loop using about half to three quarters of the hair in the ponytail, leaving a long loose end.









Another option is to create a smaller bow with only half of your hair, leaving the other half of your hair loose. Follow the same steps but instead of gathering all of your hair up into a ponytail, simply gather the top of your hair up into a loop. You can create 'ribbons' by curling the hair that you leave down.You could also create two bows, one on each side of your head. Create a loop on both sides of your head and follow the instructions listed below.

, This loose end becomes the centerpiece of the bow. You should be left with what resembles a loose bun with the hair ends securely fastened underneath the hair tie.









Make sure the loop isn't too loose or the sides will be too long and uncontrolled.

, Gel can help with sculpting and shaping the bow. Be careful to only use a very small amount (a dime-sized dab of gel) so that you don’t overwhelm your hair, thus creating a droopy bow.








, Section off your hair into two evenly distributed sections. Work on one side at a time. These will form the sides of the bow. Use a mirror to guide the division and to help you keep it even.








, Use your finger to straighten out the other loop and push it flat against your head. Insert a bobby pin going from top to bottom at the base of the loop (under the hair so it is not showing). Place another bobby pin going from bottom to top. Do the same with the other loop.







, Take the loose strand of hair in front of the bow and pull it back over and through the middle of your bow sections. Make sure you get all of the loose strands.








, You may need to use a little hairspray to keep the hair in place but try to stuff as much of the top strand into the hair tie as possible.








, Push at least three or four pins into the strand and into the hair tie to connect the entire piece. Make sure that the bobby pins are not too visible.









Hairspray may be helpful to tidy loose or flyaway strands.

, Use a teasing comb or your fingers to fluff the hair. If your hair doesn’t hold the bow shape on its own, hold one section out and spray with extra-hold hairspray. Do the same with the other section.

, This is also known as ""co-washing."" It will help moisturize your hair, and keep it manageable. You can help further seal the moisture in with a natural oil of your choosing.


Step things up a bit by using a deep conditioning mask once a week to twice a month.

, Oils like grape seed oil, are more easily absorbed by hair than products like lanolin, which will only clog and weigh hair down. Lightweight oils will moisturize your hair and make it shiny, but they won't weight it down., Silicones are great for making hair nice and smooth, but they can only be removed with sulfates, a harsh cleaning agent that leads to dry hair. If you don't remove the silicones from your hair properly, your hair will get too much build-up, and end up looking dull, greasy, and lanky.


Fortunately, there are lots of ways to make your hair nice and silky without using silicones, including nourishing masks and coconut oil. These products are easily washed out of your hair, without any dryness or brittleness.

, Organic products are strictly regulated from farming to harvesting. This means that ingredients such as avocado, coconut, and shea were grown without the use of toxic chemicals, antibiotics, and pesticides that are harmful to humans and animals. These toxic chemicals can potentially harm your hair.


The term ""natural"" is used very loosely by corporations. An orange soda can be natural because it has an orange flavoring that once shared a compound of a fruit. High fructose corn syrup is considered ""natural"" just like ""petrolatum.""

, Always start from the ends of your hair first; never comb straight down from the roots. Avoid using brushes, as they will only make your hair frizzy. Lastly, avoid combing your hair everyday; detangle it when necessary with your fingers. Excessive combing will break your hair off.









Make sure your hair is slightly damp before you detangle. Hair is very vulnerable when wet, so if you just washed it, let it dry a little first.

, Let your hair air-dry a little first, when gently blow dry your hair using a comb attachment. With will reduce the amount of pulling and tugging, which can lead to breakage.Instead of air drying, you can also sit under a dryer.

, When styling your hair, hold the curling iron or flat iron slightly open while passing it over your hair. This way, you will avoid tugging and pulling your hair, which can lead to breakage Try to limit heat styling to two times a month maximum.


Try to use the lowest temperature possible, and avoid going too hot. Heat protectant sprays can only do so much.
Opt for ceramic flat irons over metal ones. They will be gentler on your hair.Heat protectants come in many forms, other than sprays, including: shampoo, conditioners, creams, and serums.

, Tight ponytails and tight braids can look chic, but they also put a lot of stress on your hair and scalp. Overtime, they can create crimps and breakage in hair. They can also stress the hair follicles, and cause thinning along the hairline.Braids, cornrows, and weaves should not hurt. If they start to hurt, they are too tight, and are damaging your hair.Avoid using rubber bands when styling your hair, as they can cause tears and breakage. Instead, use a ponytail holder without a metal clip.

, They are much better at protecting your natural hair against heat styling and outdoor elements. Glued-in weaves can rip out your natural hair upon removal, thus damaging it.If you are using a weave, visit your stylist every 2 to 3 weeks to ensure that it stays tight. A loose weave can tug on your hair and damage it.
Change your weave every 1½ and 3 months.
Let your hair rest for a few weeks after two consecutive weaves.

, Try to get your hair relaxed professionally. If you do it at home, read the instructions carefully to prevent any damage. You should only apply relaxer to new growth, and never to hair that has already been relaxed.If you apply relaxer to previously relaxed hair, you will over-process it and damage it. Also, never leave the relaxer on the hair too long; this will cause serious damage and possible hair loss.


When relaxing your hair, some natural oil, like olive oil, to previously relaxed hair. This way, you won't accidentally over-process it.
Some stylists will recommend a touch-up every 6 weeks; that unnecessary, and actually very bad for your hair. You should get a touch-up every 2 to 3 months.
Look at the ingredients: if it has too many long chemical names, try to stay away from it.

, This is especially important if you are using high-stress hairstyles, such as weaves, cornrows, and braids. While fashionable, these styles put a lot of strain on your hair. Let your hair go natural for a week or two in between styles so that it can relax.


If you must do something with your hair, consider wrapping a scarf or headband around it, or adding in a cute hair clip.

, This way, your hair can stay healthy and won't break or tear. Cotton pillowcases tend to snag hair and create tiny rips and tears. They also tend to suck the moisture out of your hair, which can make it even more frizzy and brittle.Satin or silk pillowcases are also great for skin, as they don't draw out moisture the way cotton pillowcases do.If you can't get a satin or silk pillowcase, consider tying your hair up at night with a satin or silk scarf instead.

, You can use a moisturizing serum, or you can use a natural oil, such as coconut oil, castor oil, or olive oil. This will help prevent your hair from getting dry, snagging on things, and breaking. It will also help prevent split or damaged ends.








, Look for products that contain natural oils, such as almond, Argan, coconut, and jojoba. You can also just use natural oils straight from the bottle instead. Skip products with petrolatum, lanolin, and mineral oils. They will only dry your hair out and stop moisture from penetrating the shaft.


A little bit of oil goes a long way. Start with a small amount, and add more as necessary.
After washing your hair, apply a moisturizing leave-in conditioner, then add the oil of your choice. This seal in moisture and ensure that your hair stays healthy.

, Protein will make your hair less prone to breakage and over-moisturizing. Your hair will be a lot shinier too. Be careful not to overuse protein in your hair otherwise it will start to snap off. You can use a store-bought treatment or try your hand at making a DIY hair mask at home.

, Part your hair into several sections, then use an applicator bottle to apply the oil. Massage the oil into your hair and scalp, then cover your hair with a shower cap for 30 minutes. Once the time is up, wash your hair as usual with shampoo.Don't use a microwave to heat the oil, or it will lose its nutrients.
If you don't have a shower cap, you can wrap a damp, warm towel around your hair instead.
You can use any of the following oils: Argan, avocado, castor, coconut, jojoba, olive, sesame, and sweet almond.

, Even healthy hair is prone to getting split ends, so be sure to check your hair for them regularly. The longer you leave them unchecked, the further the damage will creep up the hair shaft. Don't reply on ""split end mending"" serums, at they are only temporary fixes; they are not permanent and will not mend your split ends.

The hair should be lightly damp but not soaking wet. Take a towel and pat down the hair again to dry it slightly. Then grab a comb and part the hair.



Knowing where the hair will be parted is important because you may have to blend the shorter side a little more than the longer side depending on the style.;
, Pick a higher guard number to start with like a #3.


You can use a higher number to get an even shave around the sides and back of the head as a baseline.
To get the fade look you will switch to shorter guards as you move down. But by starting with the larger guard size you can easily get an even fade.
You will shave the entire sides and back of the hair with your first guard, and then repeat with a lower guard, moving part way down the head, leaving the top the length you just cut.

, The fade line will determine where the hair transitions from one length to another. It will wrap all the way around the back of the head, essentially going from ear to ear.


Fade lines don't have to go straight across in the back. In fact, some fade lines dip slightly around the back of the head, then return to the original line before reaching the other ear.
You can have more than one fade line. Start with one on your first cut; as you get more confident, dry doing two.
Where you position the fade line is a matter of personal taste. You can put it anywhere from slightly above the top of the ear to 2 or 3 inches (5.1 or 7.6 cm) above that.

, Take a comb, and trace a rectangle above the round of the skull. This will separate the longer top hair from the shorter sides. Use a clip or an elastic band to keep this hair out of the way.

If you are uncertain how big the rectangle should be, use the eyebrows as a guide. The lines of the rectangle should line up with the outer tips of the eyebrows. Include the entire crown at the back of the head.

, Just like shaving your face, the general rule of thumb is to shave in the opposite direction that the hair grows.Start at the sideburns and move the clippers in an upward motion as you back towards the head.









Do not cut the sectioned-off hair on top of the head.
Move your clippers in an upward motion, moving out with an arc with each movement.
With your free hand, lightly press down on the scalp just below where you are currently cutting. This will ensure a smooth, even cut.

, This doesn’t mean turning the clippers horizontally though, keep them vertical. Remember that the fade line is where the hair transitions from one length to the next.









Hold the clippers in your hand so that your thumb is over the top, with your other fingers beneath. Move your wrist in a ""flicking"" motion upward.
To make the fade lines disappear and give the hair a consistent transition, you want to angle the clippers so that only the bottom third or quarter of the blade is actually touching the head at the fade line.
The portion of the blade, the teeth, that isn't touching the head will still cut the hair, but at a ""natural"" fade angle.

, The slower you go and the more precise you are, the better the cut will look, and you won’t spend a lot of time at the end cleaning up uneven spots.









Push the clippers forward a bit on uneven spots to make sure the blades are catching the hair.
To cut behind the ears, pull the top of the ear down and cut straight up starting at the spot where the ear connects to the head. You may have to cut at an angle to get the hair behind the ear.

, Once you’ve got the base cut around the sides and back of the head, it’s time to switch to your next guard. If you Started with a #3, switch to a #2.









Repeat the same shaving technique as before, starting at the bottom and moving up.
Don’t go all the way to the top. To get an even fade you’ll want to pick a spot where your next fade line will be. This will vary from person to person, but your second fade line should be above the ear.
Depending on how much of a fade you want, you may have to switch guards again and repeat the process, shaving the lower portion of the head with a #1.

, Start to clean up the fade by grabbing a regular comb. (Use a white comb for dark hair, and a dark comb for light hair.) Angle the comb so that it's at a 45-degree angle to the fade line and comb upward toward the top of the head, only moving the comb an inch or two into the hair. Run the clippers upward over the comb, from the fade line, so that they cut the hair that's above the teeth.


Repeat this process around the fade line(s), taking care to keep your combing distance the same all the way around.
If done correctly, you should have a nice even fade with no visible fade lines. The hair should gradually get shorter as it gets closer to the base of the skull.

, Either use scissors if you want to keep the hair long, or a higher guard if you want a buzzed look. For something like a quiff, pompadour, or messy top, you’ll use scissors; while a caesar, or crew might need clippers.To cut with scissors, use a comb or your fingers and pull the hair up, cutting above the fingers or comb a little at a time.The fingers or comb should be kept straight and parallel to the floor as you cut.
Take into account the angle at which you are cutting. For a fade look with longer hair on top you will want to cut the hair at an angle as you move towards the back of the head to blend it.
Check the corners as you cut. To do this, pull out a lock from the top of the hair and check the edges. The corners of this cut should be soft.
If too much hair is falling back from the top, you can use a thinning shear or clippers to trim it back.

, Now you want to make sure that fade has a distinct ending point at the base of the head and bottoms of the sideburns. Take your trimmer or clippers and shave any remaining hair away.


You may not need do this to the sideburns if the person whose hair you are cutting has facial hair connecting to the sideburns.
Shave down the base of the neck and up a little ways on the lowest fade to make sure that the hair is evened out.

, Look for any patches where the hair is uneven now and make sure to go over them again to clean them up.


You may have to position your clippers at a bit of an angle to get any stragglers and even out the fade.

, Now that your bottom fade line is established, cut the hair beneath it. Make sure you get the sections at the bottom of the neck that have thinner longer hairs.


Clean up the edges using a straight razor or the trimmer to make sure the edges of the cut are clean, as well as removing any neck hair.
If you are using a straight razor, apply shaving cream to the area you are about to cut, then pad with a warm damp towel.
Brush off any loose hairs and style the top with a pomade or gel for a finished look.

, Clippers can get expensive, but in order to ensure that you get a consistent fade you’ll need clippers that are powerful and reliable. A great pair of clippers will make all the difference.Some popular and highly rated clippers are:

Oster Classic 76 Clipper w/ 2 Blades.
Wahl Senior clippers.
Andis Master clippers.


Make sure the clippers come with at least 5 different guard sizes.
It's also a good idea to purchase a professional trimmer, which is used to line sideburns and clean up the areas around the ears, neck and forehead. Ask your barber where he purchases his, or look around online.

, Even if you have new clippers, you should make sure that they are clean before oiling them. Your clipper set should come with a cleaning solution, but if you don’t have a cleaning solution you can use distilled white vinegar.


Make sure your clippers are unplugged and remove the blades.
If you have a solution, spray the solution over your blades and let it sit before wiping off.
If you are using distilled white vinegar, put the blades to soak for a few minutes in a solution of vinegar.
Avoid washing your clippers with soap and water as this can cause your blades to rust.

, Read the instructions that come with your clippers to see if you need to remove the blades for oiling, or if you can simply point them toward the bottom of a sink and drop oil onto them. After you've applied oil to the blades, wipe off any excess with a soft, dry cloth.


When oiling your clippers, you should make sure that you’ve brushed off any excess hair that might be in the blades.
Turn your clippers on and drip the oil onto the blades, allowing the moving blades to become saturated.
Run the blades for about 20 seconds.
Thoroughly wipe the blades down, making sure that the tops of your blades are dry so hair doesn’t stick.

, Bend over so your head is upside down, comb your hair forward, and use your hands to form a ponytail at the top of your head. Fasten it there with a hair elastic, then turn your head right side  up. Make sure your hair is smooth against your head; any lumps or tangled parts could result in messy layering.


, Slide it down until it's a couple of inches from the end of the ponytail. If you want subtle layering, slide the elastic down so there is only an inch or so of hair remaining in the ponytail. For more drastic layers, leave a few inches of hair in the ponytail.


, Hold your hair at the elastic to keep it from coming loose. Use a sharp pair of haircutting scissors to cut your hair just above the elastic, then shake out your hair.

If your hair is quite thick, you may have to cut through the ponytail in more than one section. Just make sure you cut each section at the same length, just above the elastic.
Be careful not to cut at an angle or let the scissors slip. Cut straight across for even layers.

, This method creates a few face-framing layers in the front with longer layers in the back. If you'd like to adjust the length of your layers, use the scissors to carefully cut individual locks of hair.

Get your hair ready for layering.,
Comb your hair into sections.,
Use a comb to lift the frontmost section of the top box.,
Trim the top box.,
Part your hair down the middle.,
Trim the sides of your hair.,
Examine your layers.",How to Do a Layered Haircut2," It's better to layer short hair when it's wet, so that you can cut the hair with greater precision. Wash and condition your hair as usual, then towel it dry in preparation for the haircut.



Layering short hair is more difficult to do by yourself than layering long hair, since you're creating each layer individually. Take a look at your hair and decide exactly where you want the layers to be and how short you want them before you begin.
Plan to cut your hair in a well-lit bathroom with at least two mirrors, so you can check your progress often and see the back of your head as well.

, Short hair must be divided into sections before layering. Use a comb to carefully divide your hair in the following way:



Make a ""top box"" section by creating a part on either side of the crown of the head. The two parts create a section of hair in the middle of the head.
Comb this ""top box"" forward and comb the hair to either side straight down, so that the sections are clearly delineated.
Divide the top box into two parts: the first part extends from the crown of your head to your forehead, and the second part extends from the crown of your head to the nape of your neck.

, Lift the hair at a ninety-degree angle from your head and hold it straight between your forefinger and middle finger. Your fingers should be perpendicular to your forehead.


, Use a sharp scissors to trim the tips of the hair extending from between your fingers. Let the hair fall, then use the comb to lift another section of hair in a slightly different spot. Hold it at a 90-degree angle from your head between your forefinger and middle finger, then trim the tips to the exact same length as the first section of hair you trimmed.



Continue trimming hair from the top until you've trimmed the entire front and back sections of the box.
Use a spray bottle filled with water to keep the hair wet as you go.
Pay careful attention to which sections of hair have been cut and which still need to be cut. When you're working with short hair, cutting the same section twice can make a big difference.
All hair should be trimmed to the same length. When the cut is finished, it will be layered in appearance.

, Once the entire top box has been trimmed, change the part of your hair by combing it to the sides so that you have a part straight down the middle.


, Working from the front of your hair around the side to the back, lift sections of hair straight from the top of your head and hold them between your fingers. Hold your hair so that your fingers are perpendicular to your forehead. Use the scissors to trim the tips of your hair, then move on to the next section. Repeat until you've trimmed the top layer of hair on the side of your head, then do the other side.


, If you see a spot that is uneven, or you want shorter layers, use the scissors to carefully trim your hair a small section at a time.

Deal with the nail that’s left.,
Stop any bleeding.,
Clean the wound thoroughly.,
Apply antibiotic ointment.,
Put a dressing on your toe.Purchase sterile gauze pads or non-stick dressing, and medical tape.,
Change the bandage daily.",How to Treat a Torn Toenail1," Some nail avulsions are minor, leaving most of the nail attached, whereas others can take off an entire toenail. After your injury, properly care for the portion of the nail that’s left over to get your healing off on the right foot. Whatever is still attached, leave it attached. If a portion of the nail is unattached, gently clip it with clean nail clippers as close to the cuticle or to the attached area as possible.Cut along the line of the tear.


File any part of the nail left over so that it is smooth. This will help you avoid catching it on socks and bedding.
Ask a friend or loved one for help if you're squeamish or are having trouble. Children will probably need help from an adult when caring for a torn toenail.
If you are wearing a toe ring, make sure to take it off before you treat the torn nail. You can use soap and water to lubricate your skin if the jewelry is difficult to remove, or call a healthcare provider if you cannot remove it.;
, Apply direct pressure to the bleeding area with a clean cloth or a gauze pad.Keep pressure on the area for 10 minutes, or until the bleeding stops. It will also help to slow bleeding if you lie down and elevate your foot by propping it up on pillows.


If the bleeding hasn’t slowed after 15 minutes of pressure, seek medical care.

, Wash your toe with warm soapy water and a washcloth. If the wounded area is dirty, gently scrub the dirt away. Scrub off any dried blood or debris from the injury. Don't be afraid to ask a friend or loved one to help you. Clean the area as well as possible to prevent infection.


Gently pat the area dry with a clean towel or washcloth. Do not rub the area, which might cause more bleeding.

, When your toe is clean and dry, dab a topical antibiotic ointment such as Neosporin, Polysporin, or any of the ""triple antibiotic"" ointments onto the entire injured area. You can get these at most drug stores, without a prescription.These often come in cream form, as well. Be sure to get the ointment, which is better at preventing your bandage from sticking to the wound.
If the skin is intact and there are no cuts or scrapes, then you can just apply some petroleum jelly instead of antibiotic ointment.

, Apply a gauze pad or bandage over the injured toe (cut the pad to fit, if needed), then wrap around the toe with gauze several times to keep the bandage in place. Leave enough extra gauze at the top of your toe to gently fold it over the nail, creating a sort of bandage “cap” that you can later pull off easily. Tape over the top twice in crisscross fashion (like an X). Use two pieces of medical tape to adhere the bandage to your toe up by your foot, to help keep it in place.


Either purchase non-stick dressing, or be sure to apply antibiotic ointment or petroleum jelly before bandaging your toe. Be careful when removing the bandage not to pull on your toenail or injured area; if the bandage is sticking to your toe, soak it in warm water for a few minutes so it’s easier to remove.Don’t wrap your toe so tightly that it turns red or purple or loses feeling. The wrapping should stay in place and be snug, but not be uncomfortable tight.

, Every day, gently remove the bandage and wash your toe with warm, soapy water. Reapply your antibiotic ointment and put on a fresh bandage. If your bandage gets wet or dirty, put on a fresh one.You should do this for 7-10 days until the nail bed, the soft sensitive area underneath the nail, hardens.Ideally, put your new bandage on your toe each night before you go to bed. This will protect your injured nail from snagging on bedding or hitting something while you sleep.

Ice often on the first day.,
Elevate the foot.,
Take OTC pain relievers.,
Wear open or loose shoes for several weeks.",How to Treat a Torn Toenail2," The day of your toe injury, apply ice every 2 hours for 20 minutes at a time to reduce pain and swelling.Fill a plastic baggie with ice and wrap it in a towel before putting it on your toe, so that it’s not too cold.


After the first day, ice for 20 minutes three to four times a day.

, If your toe is throbbing, lie down and elevate your foot with pillows to above the level of your heart.This should greatly reduce swelling. Do this for the first 48 hours after being injured., Ibuprofen and naproxen will reduce swelling and improve your pain. Acetaminophen will not help with swelling, but it will help with pain. You can get these at your pharmacy without a prescription. Only take them as instructed on the package.


If you have heart disease, kidney problems, high blood pressure, or have ever had stomach ulcers, talk to your doctor before using these medications., Tight shoes will put uncomfortable pressure on your injured nail. Wear open-toed or loose fitting shoes to relieve pressure and improve healing. Do this as long as you need to in order to be comfortable.

"
"
Seek medical care if you have signs of infection.,
Visit your doctor if you have worsening pain, redness, or swelling.,
Get checked out if your nail turns black and blue.,
See your doctor if there’s visible damage surrounding the torn nail.,
Ask for help if you can’t get the wound clean.,
Go for an x-ray if your toe is immobile or looks odd.",How to Treat a Torn Toenail3," No matter how well you take care of your injury, you might still get an infection. If your toe is infected you might see red streaks running up your toe, foot, or leg. You might get a fever of 100.4ºF (38ºC) or higher. Pus – thick, white or colored drainage from the injury – is another sign of infection. See your doctor if any of these signs occur, because infections can be serious.Your doctor will prescribe you antibiotics if an infection is present. Take these as prescribed and until they’re gone.

, See your doctor if your pain is severe enough to interfere with sleep or daily activities, does not improve 2 hours after taking pain medicine, or gets worse over time. If you have swelling that gets worse or does not improve after medicine, ice, and elevating your foot, get help.Ask questions like, ""My toe hurts more today than it did yesterday and Tylenol isn't helping, is that okay?"" or ""How much swelling is normal?""

, Sometimes, a crushing injury to a toenail (like having a heavy object dropped on your toenail) can cause a subungual hematoma – bleeding underneath the nail. This creates a little pocket of blood under the nail, which can be uncomfortable because of the pressure. It looks like a dark blue, black, or purple bruise like splotch beneath your nail. If the bruise is less than ¼ the size of the nail, it will probably resolve on its own. Otherwise, see your doctor because you may need to have the fluid drained from under the nail to prevent further pain and injury.Don’t attempt to do this on your own or for someone else. See a doctor.


Your doctor will drill a very small hole in your toenail to let the blood drain out. This procedure shouldn’t hurt, and draining the blood will make your toe feel better because it relieves the pressure.

, Whether your toenail will regrow normally depends on whether or not the nail bed was damaged. If you’re worried about how your nail might look when it grows back, speak to your doctor about the possibility of a small surgery on your nail bed. If you can see visible damage to your tissue around your nail, like any tears, see your doctor. If the nail bed or nail matrix are very damaged, your nail might not grow back or might look different – but some problems are fixable.


It may take 6-12 months for a toenail to completely regrow., If you spend 15 minute or more trying to scrub your injury clean, and you still see dirt or debris in it, get medical help. It’s really important to thoroughly clean the wound to prevent infection, so if you can’t do it on your own you need someone who can.Depending on how you hurt your toe, you might also need a tetanus shot or tetanus booster. If the cut is dirty and it has been 5 years or more since your last booster, then you will need a tetanus shot. If the cut is clean and it has been more than 10 years since your last tetanus booster, then you will need a tetanus shot., Many injuries that cause nail avulsion can also cause broken bones. Check your injured toe to see if it bends and straightens all the way. If not, or if it’s sticking out at an odd angle, it may be broken. Get emergency care for an x-ray and proper treatment."

Apply a heat protectant.,
Section your hair.,
Braid your hair.,
Apply heat to the braids.,
Take out the braids.",How to Wave Your Hair With a Straightener1," Use your hands to collect and lift your dry hair, and evenly apply a heat protectant spray.This will help reduce heat damage from the straightener.









Be sure that you don’t dampen your hair too much with the heat protectant spray. If you do, wait for your hair to naturally dry, or quickly blow dry your hair so you are working with dry hair.;
, Use your fingers to separate your hair into 2-6 different sections. Try using the part down the middle of your head to section your hair into a right and left portion, and then section up each side into smaller sections.Do your best to make all the sections of hair the same thickness.









Keep in mind that the fewer braids you make (meaning more hair in each braid), the bigger your waves will be.The more braids you make (meaning less hair in each braid), the smaller and more crimped the waves will look.

, Braid the sections of your hair using the normal three strand braiding technique. Once your braid comes within an inch or half inch from the bottom of your hair, use a thin hair tie to secure the bottom of the braid.









Where you start your braids depends on where you want the waves to start. If you want waves starting at the top of your head, make your braids as close to your scalp as possible. If you want the waves be start midway down your hair, start your braids down more, near your ears.
Depending on the tightness of your braids, the end result will either be loose waves made with looser braids or tighter waves, made with tighter braids.
Pull the braids apart to make them less cylindrical, and more flat. The flatness will help when moving the hair straightener along the braids., Clamp the flat iron onto one braid at a time. Start at the beginning of the braid, and hold the straightener in place for about three seconds.Open the clamped straightener, and move down the braid a little bit. Again, apply heat for about three seconds. Open and close the straightener as you move down, applying heat to the entire braid. You want to be sure that you can feel warmth on both sides of the braid. Apply heat to all of the braids.









Allow the braids to cool for about ten minutes after you have run the hair straightener over all of them. When the braids are cool, you can quickly run over the braids once more with the hair straightener, or finish up, and lightly mist the braids with a hairspray., Remove the hair ties at the bottom of each braid, and use your fingers to gently loosen and undo the braids. Don’t pull too hard, because you don’t want to mess up any of the waves. Rub the top of your head with your fingers to give your waves a more natural look and add volume your roots.








At this point, you can add a texturizing spray or hairspray to help the waves stay in place.

Finish the look.",How to Use a Triple Barrel Waver," The size of the barrels on your waver will determine the type of style you can create with it. The first part of choosing the right tool is figuring out the look you're going for and then selecting a barrel size best suited for the results you want.


Do you want to create loose, beachy waves? Do you want to achieve a more natural look? Medium/large barrels that measure from 1 to 2 inches are best for creating loose, free-flowing waves.Do you want to go for a retro, Old Hollywood look with tighter finger waves? Or maybe you want to create an all over crimped looked? Smaller barrels that measure 3/8 to 1/2 inch or less in size are your best bet for getting that vintage look. ;
, Heat styling tools like triple barrel wavers come in a variety of materials. Choosing the right one for your hair is key to getting the look you want without damaging your locks.Heat tools made from ceramic are best for fine to medium hair. Look for tools that are 100% ceramic rather than those with a ceramic coating, which can chip over time.Titanium tools provide intense heat and are best for styling coarse hair.
Tourmaline tools can help reduce static and frizz.Tourmaline is usually layered on top of ceramic or titanium, so choose the base material according to your hair type.

, Some styling tools offer only one heat setting, which can lead to damage if it's too hot for your hair.


Look for a tool with a range of temperatures or a high, medium, and low setting.
Low temperatures or settings should be used for fine, thin hair.
Medium to high temperatures or settings are necessary to style thick or coarse hair.

, Taking the time to prep and protect your hair will lead to better styling results now and healthier hair later.

, Try washing your hair the day or night before you style it instead of washing it the same day.


You don't need freshly washed hair to achieve a wavy style as hair with some product on it is actually easier to work with.
If you wash your hair the day or night before, let it air dry if possible. By eliminating the need for a blow dryer you'll cut back on the amount of heat your hair is exposed to, which will keep it healthier overall.

, Wet hair is weak hair.Trying to style wet hair can lead to breakage and damage.


Regardless of whether you air dry or blow dry, make sure your hair is totally dry before you use your triple barrel waver.

, There are a variety of serums, sprays, and creams out there designed to protect your hair from the harsh effects of heat styling tools. Apply one before you use your triple barrel waver.


Look for a heat protecting product with a silicone base, which creates a protective coating around the hair shaft and helps prevent damage., Curl enhancing products are designed to help your hair hold curls and waves. Applying a curl enhancing product before you start styling it will help keep your look intact longer.

, It's easiest to add waves to your hair one section at a time, moving from one side of the head to the other.


Pull the top half of your hair up and secure it with a large clip or ponytail holder.Grab a 1 inch section of hair on one side of your head and move the rest of your hair out of the way. Securing the hair you aren't currently styling with a large clip will help keep the hair you're working on separate from the rest.

, With the hot part of the barrel on the bottom, clamp the triple barrel waver down at the top of the 1 inch section you're working on.


If you're trying to create a looser, beachy looking wave, start further away from the roots of your hair.If you're trying to create vintage waves, start as close to the roots as you comfortably can., Create the first wave by clamping the waver down at your starting point and holding for a few seconds.


Don't hold the waver in one place too long; if you're working with the right heat setting for your hair, 4 to 5 seconds should do.Continue moving down the 1 inch section of hair. The trick to making one long continuous wave is to line up the first barrel of the waver with the last indent you made in your hair., Working from one side of your head to the other, continue to section out 1 inch portions of hair. Repeat until the bottom half of your hair is finished and then move onto the top section.


Pull the styled hair over your shoulder and out of the way. Don't use a ponytail holder to tie hair back the hair you've already styled or you'll be left with a crimp or indent in your hair.
After you've finished the bottom section, un-clip the top half of your hair and continue in the same way as before.

, Once you've styled all of your hair, lightly spray it with hairspray to set the look in place.


For a more natural look, run your fingers through the waves to loosen them, or turn your head upside down and shake to separate the waves.
For additional texture, spray a light mist of sea salt spray on your hair and rough the waves up a bit with your hands.
If you're going for a tight, retro wave look, leave the waves alone and simply set the look with a misting of hairspray.

Add heat protectant to your hair.,
Section your hair.,
Wave your first layer.,
Tie back your waved section.,
Section off your middle section of hair.,
Wave your second section of hair.,
Wave your third section of hair.",How to Wave Your Hair With a Straightener2," Heat protectant usually comes in a liquid spray form, so generously spray heat protectant all over your dry hair.Be sure to lift up sections of your hair to coat the inner and bottoms layers of your hair with the heat protectant.









Heat protectant will add a protective barrier between your hair and the heat from your hair tools, so your hair is less likely to burn.

, Depending on the length of your hair, you may need to section your hair in 2-3 times to make 2-3 different sections.Start your first section by placing your thumb nails at the top of your ears on the sides of your face, and draw a horizontal line through your hair, meeting at the back of your head. Take all the hair that you’ve collected in your hands, and pin it up on your head so it’s out of the way. The bottom portion of your hair should be hanging down now. Once you have your section, split it in the middle, half on the right side, half on the left side.









Keep in mind that you’ll be working on each section on both the left and right side of your head. For example, If you only section your hair in two sections, it will really be like working on four sections of hair.
It’s most helpful to start waving on the bottom portion of your hair (the bottom 1/3 of your head), and work your way up to the top of your head to your roots and bangs.

, Grab a 1-inch section of hair from the back area of your head (starting on either the left or right side of your head), and clamp on the hair straightener about an inch down from the root of your hair. Rotate and bend the hair straighter downward (toward your face) about 90° and hold it for one second. Then slide the straightener down a little bit (perhaps an inch), and bend the straightener away from your face, 180° the opposite way.Keep doing this back and forth bending motion slowly sliding the straightener down your hair, until you come to the last inch or half inch of hair.









Don’t wave all the way to the last strands of your hair; it will make your waves look less natural.
Once you have finished waving a section of hair, move it behind your shoulder so you know that section of hair is complete.

, Use a small, thin elastic hair tie to loosely tie back the section of your hair that’s completely waved. This way, you can keep your completed and uncompleted sections of hair separate, as you section off the next section of hair you’ll be working with.








Do not tie your hair back too tightly. The elastic should be just tight enough that it keeps your hair section together, without leaving an indentation in your hair.

, With your waved hair tied back, unclip the rest of your hair from your head and let it hang. Then place your thumb nails on the sides of your face near your temples, and draw a horizontal line back to your head until your thumbs meet.Twist together the collected hair, and pin it up on the top of your head so it’s out of the way. You should now have your middle section of hair.









Split this section of hair down the middle of the back of your head, so you have half of your hair on the left side of your head, and half of your hair on the right side.

, Just how you waved your first section of hair, wave your second section of hair using the same bending motion of the straightener. Start with about a 1-inch portion of hair at the back of your head, clamp the straightener on the hair about an inch down from the roots, and rotate the straightener to turn it approximately 90°downward, away from your face. Slide the straightener down your hair about an inch, then rotate the straightener 180° upward, toward your face. Slide the straightener a little more down your hair, keeping it in its upward turned position, then rotate the straightener 180° downward again.









Continue this until you get to the last inch or inch and a half of hair, then release the straightener.
Once you straighten all of the hair in the second section, you can add this section into the elastic holding together the hair that has been waved. Then you can move onto waving your third, and final, section of hair.

, Depending on how you part your hair, your third section of hair may be separated unevenly between the left and right sides of your head. If you part your hair down the middle of your head, the left and right sides will be even. Separate your hair how you naturally wear your part, and start waving 1-inch pieces of your hair starting with hair at the back of your head, and moving forward, toward your face.









Once you are finished waving all sections of your hair, lightly run your fingers through your hair to blend the waves together and give it a more natural look.
Then lightly spray your hair with some hairspray to set the waves in place.

Remind yourself you want healthy nails.,
Immediately remove old nail polish.,
Fix chipped polish with an accent tip.,
Find something better to do.,
Relieve stress in other ways.,
Use affirmations every time you get the urge to peel.,
Don’t wear nail polish.",How to Stop Peeling Fingernail Polish Off1," One of the worst things you can do to your nail bed is peel the polish off of it.The reason behind this is simple: you peel off a layer of your nail along with the polish. If you’re wearing gel polish, you can pull several layers of nail off, because gel is more adhesive than regular polish.


Remember that it can take six months to a year for nails to grow out, after being badly damaged.;
, When nail polish starts to chip, it’s easy to mindlessly start picking at it and peel it off. Avoid this problem altogether by running to the nearest bottle of polish remover once you get any chips.If you’re on the go a lot, carry sealed, pre-soaked remover pads with you.

, Chipped polish is unsightly, and peeling it off may be the quickest way you know how to fix it. But there is a much better way that is even quicker than peeling polish off fingernail by fingernail. Keep glitter polish, which is easy to apply, to seal any chips and protect polish from your prying hands.

, Sometimes, you may start peeling your polish off out of plain boredom. Recognize when this is happening and distract yourself with another activity. Read a book or pick up a magazine. Clean your house or apartment. Anything is better than ruining your nails!

, If you start picking at your nails every time you get stressed, find another way to release it. Take a few deep breaths, instead of ripping your manicure to shreds. If you're especially stressed out, go for a walk or engage in more vigorous exercise., A great trick to strengthen willpower is by telling your brain you don’t do something. When you tell yourself you don’t wish to engage in a bad habit, you are empowering yourself. Every time you get the urge to peel your polish off, tell yourself ""I don't want to peel my polish."" This will create new pathways in your brain to help kick your peeling habit., This may be a no-brainer, but if you find yourself not able to keep polish on, simply don’t wear it. You can sport a great natural look by keeping your nails trimmed and buffed. Some buffers include a leather-like side that will give nails high shine, like a clear top coat.

Regularly manicure your nails.,
Prepare your nails before you polish.,
Use a base coat.,
Apply polish in thin layers.,
Use a top coat.",How to Stop Peeling Fingernail Polish Off2," Even the best manicure is not going to last longer than ten days. If you’re getting gel manicures, you can extend this to two weeks. The point is: don’t think your polished nails will last forever. When you go too long between manicures, you will find yourself wanting to peel old polish off.

, It’s important to have a clean surface on your nails before you try to polish them. If you have any dirt or oil on them, your polish will try to lift off, causing them to peel. Dip a cotton pad in alcohol or polish remover to remove any grime before you polish., A base coat will not only prevent your polish from staining your nail beds, but it will help it adhere, and stay adhered. Wait for your base coat to dry before moving on to applying your color. It takes a full two minutes for polish to completely dry between coats., Be careful not to use old or low quality polish that is clumpy or thick. Apply each coat of polish thinly and it will last longer. Don’t worry if your first coat of color is streaky. Simply apply another thin layer of polish over this, and you will get rid of streaks or transparent looking color., A top coat will keep your polish shiny and help lengthen your manicure, so you will be less likely to peel off your polish. After you apply two coats of polish, use a clear top coat. Reapply every three days for a rock solid manicure.You can purchase an at home LED manicure light to use a gel topcoat that will seal polish in for an extra week.

Bypass buffing.,
Improve your filing technique.,
Clip your hangnails.,
Leave your cuticles alone.",How to Strengthen Weak Fingernails Naturally1," Buffing is used to even out ridged fingernails. What most women don’t know is that ridges in nails are a healthy part of the finger.The thickest part of the nails are the healthiest parts, and the dips are actually deficits in thickness. Therefore, when you buff your nails off, you’re buffing down the stronger, healthier portion of the nail.If ridges really bother you, try picking up a high quality top-coat. A top-coat that is used specifically for targeting ridging will fill in the dips on your nail.This will give you the smoothness you’re looking for without damaging your fingers.;
, First, always file flat against the edge of the nail.After you’ve filed off your desired amount, take the emery board and file at a 45 degree angle away from the nail.This smooths the edge of your nail to prevent snagging, and it will help avoid hangnails.









Always use a fine-grit nail file. The coarser grit of nail files are made for artificial nails and can be damaging and harsh on your natural ones.The same theory applies for metal files. Instead of a metal file, use an emery board that has been cushioned., Hangnails are often caused by splitting or improper cutting of nails. After your nail rips away, your skin and nail bed can be left damaged or torn.Even the smallest of tears in the skin can allow infection to enter your body. Be proactive and use nail clippers to gently clip off your hangnail. 








Don’t chew off hangnails. Along with the ripping of your nail or skin, chewing them off transfers bacteria from your mouth directly into the wound.

, It is popular myth that cuticles are easily removed. This couldn’t be further from the truth, as the cuticle is what seals and protects the nail bed. Unless you’re a seasoned professional, you shouldn’t be attempting to cut your cuticles yourself.It can cause unnecessary trauma and damage to your fingers.









If you feel that your cuticles are truly awful, try moisturizing them instead of clipping them. By softening the cuticle with an essential oil or hand cream, you can promote happy nail growth.A second option is to use a cuticle removal cream. Cuticle removal cream is massaged into the cuticles followed by use of a soft-tipped cuticle wand to gently push the cuticle back towards the nail bed.This can help keep unruly cuticles looked more trim and clean.

Give your hands a nail soak.,
Add a happy-nail supplement to your diet.,
Be wary of what you put on your hands.,
Don’t use your nails as tools.",How to Strengthen Weak Fingernails Naturally2," A DIY nail soak can be made up of any combination of oils. Try coconut, argan, or olive oil mixed with tea tree or vitamin E oil.By applying a large amount of oil to your nails with a cottonball and leaving it to soak, your nails will get a healthy dose of moisture. However, don't soak your nails in water, try to avoid water exposure as it will soften your nails to the point of bending and peeling.


If you find your nails are soft and split easily, try vitamin E.Tea tree oil can be a healthy way to keep your nails clean and fungus-free., Many women find supplements to be helpful to nail growth and overall health. In particular, biotin can be taken to help strengthen brittle nails.Consider investing in a high-quality supplement for hair, skin and nails. These supplements usually contain vitamins A, C, D, E, as well as many B vitamins, and folic acid, zinc, iron, calcium and biotin. When taken on a regular basis, supplements can have considerable positive effects. Not only will your nails grow stronger, you might see an improvement in your skin and hair.


If your diet is lacking, a simple multivitamin can often supplement you enough to have happier nails. Weak, brittle nails are often a result of nutrient loss. Speak to your doctor to find the right multivitamin for you.
Making sure you have a good intake of omega 3 oils can also reduce your risk of weak, brittle nails. Omega 3, also known as fish oil, can be taken in supplement form or found in dairy, eggs, nuts and fats such as olive oil., Common everyday items such as nail polish remover, hand sanitizer and cleaning products are damaging to not only your nails, but will also speed up the aging process of your hands. By choosing gentler options, you can keep both your nails and hands looking young and fresh.


Hand sanitizer is often alcohol based. Alcohol is drying not only to the skin, but also the nails.The alcohol will dehydrate your hands and leave your nails brittle and breakable. It is a better option to wash your hands with antibacterial soap and dry immediately, if you must use a sanitizer.
Wear gloves when cleaning whenever possible. It might seem harmless to use that glass cleaner on your hands. In reality, it won’t kill you, but it certainly will kill your nails. Keep your hands covered to prevent the moisture from being stripped away from your nails.Skip acetone-based nail polish remover. It has been proved relentlessly that acetone-based nail polish strips the nail, making it weaker over time.Instead, opt for a acetone-free remover, available at most drugstores.

, When your nails grow, the weakest portion will always be the tip. When the weakest part is stressed, it will pull the rest of the nail up and away from the finger.This can be very weakening to the nail. To avoid this, don’t use your nails to open pop cans, peel off stickers, or scrape things off the counter.

Trim your nails regularly.,
File your nails the right way.,
Be careful when trimming your cuticles.,
Use oil or lotion to hydrate your nails.,
Consider trying nail strengthener.",How to Strengthen Your Nails1," If you let your nails grow too long and get jagged and rough, they are more likely to break off and get weaker. Your nails are kind of like your hair - without regular upkeep, they start to get weaker at the tips. Trimming your nails regularly is one important way to help them stay strong.


Trim your nails with a nail clipper or nail scissors - not a regular pair of scissors or any other type of trimming instrument. And make sure your clippers or scissors are sharp!
Don't trim your nails too short. Trimming them to the quick can leave the tips of your fingers prone to hangnails and infections. Leave a little white edge at the tips of your nails.;
, Filing the nails in a sawing motion is one of the most damaging things you can do, since it destroys the fibers in your nails. This can actually weaken the entire nail, not just the tip! To file the right way, use an emery board and lightly run the file in one direction only, instead of sawing back and forth.

, Some people like to trim their cuticles all the way back, but this can leave your nail beds prone to infection. Instead of trimming your cuticles, consider soaking them and then lightly pushing them back using a cuticle pusher. This way they'll be out of the way when you paint your nails, but they'll still protect your fingers from getting infected with bacteria.


Soak your nails in warm water for about 5 minutes to start. You can add a little oil if you want to.
Use a cuticle stick to push back the cuticles toward the base of the nails. Don't press down too hard, and don't force them back. Don't rip or shred the cuticles.

, If your fingers and nails tend to get dry, using some oil or lotion is a great way to strengthen and hydrate them. Put on lotion each time you take a shower. You can also cover your fingers in lotion before you go to bed at night, so your fingers and nails will be hydrated by morning. Here are a few hydrating products that will help your nails get strong:


Aloe
Chia gel
Olive oil
Coconut oil
Argan oil
Castor oil
Almond oil
Jojoba oil
Tea tree oil
Shea butter
Cocoa butter

, Nail strengthener is said to form a hard shield-like protection for your nails so that they aren't exposed to things that can weaken them. Some strengtheners are meant to be applied weekly, some monthly. Give it a try, but keep in mind that relying solely on a strengthener probably isn't going to be your best bet, since brittle nails are often caused by harsh treatment and not getting enough nutrients.

Don't get too many manicures.,
Let your nails go bare sometimes.,
Don't bite your nails.,
Don't use harsh products on your nails.,
Don't use hot water when you wash your hands.,
Get treated for a fungal infection.",How to Strengthen Your Nails2," The process of applying several coats of base coat, color, and top coat, having the polish chip slowly away, then taking it off using a chemical can do a lot of damage. In addition, while some manicurists use the proper technique for filing the nails and pushing back the cuticles, many don't. Getting frequent manicures weakens your nails in the following ways:


Your nails get exposed to lots of chemicals, including the chemicals in polish and polish remover - especially acetoneYour nails may get handled roughly - filed incorrectly, etc.
Your nails might get exposed to bacteria from the tools at the nail salon

, Strong, healthy nails will begin to emerge if you give them the chance by going bare sometimes. If it has been ages since your nails have seen the light of day, commit to going one month without applying any polish. It will take about that long to see the solid new nail growth coming in. Here's what you're likely to see:


Discoloration caused as a result of using highly pigmented colors on your nails (especially deep purples, dark reds, blacks and blues) will start to go away as your nails grow out.
Your nails will grow in more smooth - you'll see fewer lines and they won't feel rough.
Your nails will be less prone to breakage.

, This leads them shredded and tattered, and also makes your fingers more prone to infection. If you have a habit of biting your nails, they're bound to be weak! Make a commitment to stopping - you'll see improvement right away.


Try putting tea tree oil on your nails. The strong taste will deter you from putting your mouth on your nails, and tea tree's healing properties will go to work, too!
You can try using a formula specifically created to stop people from biting nails (sold at drug stores). However, since these formulas have a lot of chemicals in them, this may not be the best long-term strategy - it could end up making your nails brittle.

, If you wash the dishes without wearing gloves or clean your bathroom with your bare hands, that's going to have an effect on your nails. The strong, harsh detergents in dish soap and household cleaners is really hard on nails and skin. Any time you use a product with chemicals, wear a pair of nonporous rubber gloves.


Better yet, try using products that don't contain toxic chemicals. Vinegar, lemon juice and other natural substances can do a lot of the same work without hurting your nails!
Even some hand soaps have strong chemicals that can be hard on skin. Look for soap with moisturizing properties or use a gentle soap like castile soap to protect your hands.

, Using very hot water is hard on your nails and skin, too. It can make your nails get soft, and during that time they can rip and tear much more easily. Use very warm or lukewarm water and soap instead.

, If your nails are yellow or brown, and break all the way down to the cuticles, you might have a serious fungal infection that needs to be treated. For severe symptoms like these, see your doctor to discuss a treatment plan, which will likely involve taking prescription medication or using a topical anti-fungal cream."

Eat protein.,
Get plenty of vitamins.,
Make sure you're eating enough food.",How to Strengthen Your Nails3," If your nails seem to be weak and brittle no matter what you do, it's time to think more about what you're putting in your body. Your nails, like the rest of your body, are nourished and strengthened by the food you eat. Nails are actually made out of protein, so if you aren't getting enough on a daily basis, it really shows in your nails.


Eat protein as part of every meal. Eggs, meat and fish are good choices, as are beans, other legumes and tofu.
You can also drink protein shakes or add protein powder to a glass of water or milk to get an extra boost of protein.

, Nails are also nourished by a lot of different vitamins that make them strong, healthy and shiny. If your nails look dull and yellowed, it's important to step up the amount of nutrients you're feeding them. Vitamins D, H and A are especially important for nail health.Dairy products are a great source of vitamin D.
Bananas, beans and eggs are great sources of vitamin H.Carrots and sweet potatoes will load you up with vitamin A.

, If you're on an extreme diet, it might make your nails stop growing. Not getting enough food can cause your nails to become brittle, yellowed and prone to breakage. Make sure you're getting enough calories - that includes calories through fats, proteins and carbohydrates. A balanced diet and healthy lifestyle are essential for healthy nails.

Gather fresh aloe vera gel.,
Consider buying aloe vera gel.,
Buy aloe vera juice.,
Soak your nails in aloe vera juice.,
Apply an aloe mixture to your cuticles.,
Massage your nails with the aloe vera gel.,
Apply an aloe lotion.,
Wear gloves.,
Gather the lotion ingredients.,
Combine aloe, vitamin E and essential oil.,
Heat beeswax and oil in a separate container.,
Blend the lotion mixtures.,
Continue blending the lotion.,
Store the lotion.",How to Strengthen Nails with Aloe," If you have a healthy aloe vera plant, you can harvest an outer stalk for the gel. Use a sharp knife and make a clean cut near the base of the plant. Take the stalk and carefully peel away the flat side so the gel is exposed. Scoop the gel into a small bowl and set it aside.

You'll need to use your fresh aloe vera gel right after scooping it out. You may want to cut just a small stalk if you don't think you'll use very much gel.;
, If you don't have access to a fresh aloe vera plant, you can buy the gel at most pharmacies or drug stores. Buy a gel that lists aloe vera as its first ingredient. A natural aloe vera gel should contain only a few ingredients.

The aloe vera gel you buy will contain some preservatives. These just extend the storage life of the product.

, Aloe vera juice can also help your nails, but you need to choose a product that contains mainly aloe vera. Look for aloe vera juice that has the International Aloe Science Council Seal of Approval. This ensures that 95% of the item is made up of aloe vera.Avoid products that list water or a sweetener as the first ingredient. These have diluted the aloe vera to the point that they probably won't be as effective as pure aloe.

, If your nails or cuticles are cracked or dry, soak them in pure aloe vera juice. Pour aloe vera juice into a small bowl. Dip your hands in the juice so that the fingernails are submerged. Let your nails soak for 5 to 10 minutes.

Soaking your nails in the juice will moisturize your nails and prepare them for more aloe vera treatments.

, To keep your cuticles moisturized and healthy, make an aloe/oil mixture. You'll need to mix together equal parts of raw honey, aloe vera juice, and olive oil in a small bowl. Dip a cotton swab in the mixture and rub it over your cuticles. Gently rub the aloe/oil mixture onto your cuticles for a few minutes.You can use the mixture on nails that have psoriasis (whiteness or flaky buildup). Wipe the mixture off with witch hazel after you've let the aloe mixture soak into your nails for a few minutes.

, Spread a little of the gel on each nail bed. Massage the gel into the nail for at least 30 seconds. This will help the nail absorb the aloe. You can rinse your nails off or leave the aloe on your fingers until it dries.Ensure that your hands are clean so that you don't introduce germs or bacteria to your fingernails.

, You may already be in the habit of rubbing lotion on your hands when they get dry. You should also be rubbing the lotion onto your nails and around the cuticle to keep them moisturized. Choose a lotion that contains aloe, alpha-hydroxy acids or lanolin.Alpha-hydroxy acids and lanolin can help keep your nails from splitting when they get dry and brittle.

, If you'll be cleaning your house, washing dishes, or doing any activity where your hands will exposed to water or chemicals, wear gloves. You can wear any glove, but look for one that contains an aloe coating on the inside.The aloe on the inside of the glove will keep your hands from drying out.

, You'll need 1 cup (80 g) of aloe vera gel, 1/2 cup (115 g) of grated beeswax, 1/2 cup (112 g) of oil (sweet almond, grapeseed or jojoba), 1 teaspoon of vitamin E oil, and 15 drops of an essential oil of your choice. You'll also need a jar with a sealable lid to store the aloe lotion. It should hold about 2 cups (16 ounces) of lotion.You can find most of these natural ingredients at a health store or natural goods supplier.

, Place the aloe vera gel, vitamin E oil and the essential oil in a mixing bowl. Stir until the gel and oils are completely combined and set the bowl aside. You'll want the ingredients to come to room temperature.If the ingredients are very cold, you could nest the bowl in a larger bowl that's filled with warm water. This will help it warm up faster.

, Combine the beeswax and the oil of your choice into a glass measuring cup. Ensure that the measuring cup is heat-proof. Set this cup into a small saucepan of water so water comes about halfway up the side of the measuring cup. Bring the water to a slight boil and let the beeswax and oil heat for several minutes. Stir the beeswax and oil so that they completely melt together. Let the mixture cool to room temperature.Use oven mitts or gloves to carefully lift the measuring cup out of the pot.

, Once the aloe mixture is at room temperature and the beeswax mixture has cooled to room temperature, you can blend your lotion. Pour the beeswax mixture into a blender and cover it with the lid. Blend the mixture on low. Open the spout in your blender lid and slowly add the aloe mixture while the blender is still on low.If you don't have a spout that you can open on the lid, just take the lid off and add the aloe mixture. Place the lid back on and continue blending the mixture on low.

, Keep blending the lotion mixture to get a lotion consistency. This will take about 10 to 15 minutes of blending. Stop the blender every few minutes to scrape down the sides with a spatula.If oil floats to the top of the mixture, use your spatula to stir it back into the mixture and continue blending.

, Once the lotion has reached lotion consistency, use a clean spatula to spoon it into your clean jar. Screw on the lid and refrigerate the lotion so it will last longer. The lotion will last for around a month if you keep it in the refrigerator. If you think you'll use up the mixture sooner than that, you can keep the lotion out at room temperature.To store the lotion at room temperature, keep it tightly sealed and try to use it within a few weeks.

Learn to anticipate when you're going to bite.,
Cover your nails with bandages.,

The unpleasantness of biting into a bandage, as well as the feeling of self-consciousness and embarrassed you may feel about wearing bandages in public, can help you get rid of your habit.,
Use a bitter-tasting nail polish.,
Keep your fingers and mouth busy.,
Take it one finger at a time.",How to Stop Biting Your Fingers1," If this is a relatively new habit, start by thinking harder about when you're about to bite. Figure out what feelings lead to the impulse. By being more aware of what you're doing, you might be able to catch yourself before you bite. Next time you raise your finger to your mouth, stop and think.


Ask yourself what you're feeling in the moment you raise your finger to your mouth. In most cases you'll feel anxious or bored. Other signs of anxiety include shallow breathing, a faster heartbeat, and sweating.
Next time you have that same bored, nervous, or anxious feeling, you'll consciously realize what's going on. You can put down your finger before you bite.;
, If you're having trouble catching yourself before you bite, try using bandages on your fingertips. Wrap an adhesive bandage around each fingertip to completely cover it. Wear the bandages throughout the day so that each time you bite, you get a mouthful of bandage,( yuck!),
For a more discreet option, try using clear tape. You could also cover just the fingertips you tend to bite most often.
You could also wear gloves to cover your fingers.

, This works for nail biters and finger biters alike. Get a bitter tasting nail polish, also called a ""nibble inhibitor."" Paint your nails with the product. Use a generous amount and allow it to cover the skin around your nails as well. When you put your fingers in your mouth, the bad taste will repel you.You could also try a different bitter substance, like vinegar or lemon juice.
Or rub your fingertips with a mixture of coconut oil and cayenne pepper. Just be very careful not to touch your eyes.

, If your fingers and mouth are otherwise occupied, you won't be able to pursue your habit. Keeping your fingers and mouth busy is also called the ""competing response technique."" After using it for a few weeks, your impulse to bite your fingers should go away.To keep your mouth busy, chew gum, eat breath mints or hard candy, or carry a water bottle that you sip every few minutes.
To keep your fingers occupied, try doodling, knitting, folding your fingers together or sitting on your hands.

, Some biters find it helpful to focus on keeping one finger ""safe"" at a time. Choose the finger you're most likely to bite. Consciously focus on not biting that finger. You're allowed to bite the others, but that one is safe. After a week or two, you'll see what a difference it makes to leave one finger alone.


Your safe finger will not be swollen, bloody or otherwise damaged. It will look healthy in comparison to the rest.
Seeing this difference can be motivation to stop biting all of your fingers.
One by one, keep more of your fingers ""safe"" until you're no longer biting any of them.

Try progressive muscle relaxation.,
Do a deep breathing technique.,
Practice mindfulness.,
Try alternative medicine treatments.,
Try making lifestyle changes.",How to Stop Biting Your Fingers2," This is a physical technique you can use to relieve stress and distract yourself from finger biting. When you feel yourself getting anxious in a given situation, try this to resettle yourself. It also works if you're feeling bored.Start by tensing the muscles in your arms as hard as you can. Breathe in as you do this. Hold your muscles tight for five seconds.
Exhale and relax your muscles. Stay relaxed for 15 seconds.
Tense another muscle and inhale for five seconds. You could tense your back muscles, abdomen, thighs, calves, and so on. Exhale and relax for 15 seconds.
Continue until you have tensed and relaxed all of your main muscle groups. The urge to bite should have subsided. If it hasn't, repeat the process. You may need to rotate between muscle groups for ten or more minutes.

, Deep breathing, or diaphragmatic breathing, is a known stress relief technique. Studies show that it can be used to help put an end to many types of bad habits. When you feel the urge to bite your fingers, use this technique:Sit or stand up straight with your shoulders back and your head upright.
Take a slow, controlled breath that fills out your abdomen. Your stomach should move out when you inhale. If only your chest moves, your breathing is too shallow, and you need to focus on inhaling more deeply.
Exhale and let your belly recede. Continue deep breathing in this way for at least five minutes, or until the urge to bite your fingers passes.

, Mindfulness is another word for being fully in the present moment. It's easy to get distracted by bored or anxious thoughts. When you're mindful of what's going on in the present, you're less likely to unconsciously bite your fingers. Practice mindfulness as often as possible, since it gets easier with time.When you feel your thoughts wander in an anxious direction, focus on your physical senses. Think about what you see, taste, hear, feel and smell right now.
Keep focusing on the present moment until the urge to bite passes. If you're having trouble getting your mind into the present, try looking down at your fingers and flexing them.

, If your finger biting seems related to a larger problem with anxiety, alternative medicine may work for you. Speak with an alternative health practitioner about which treatments might be best for your situation. Here are a few popular choices:


Acupuncture. This is the ancient Chinese practice of inserting needles into certain areas of the body. Some studies have shown that acupuncture can be a helpful treatment for anxiety.Hypnosis. This involves working with a practitioner to tap into your unconscious mind and take steps to relieve anxiety.Meditation and yoga. Studies show that these practices are helpful in getting in better touch with your body and treating the physical and mental symptoms of anxiety.

, Certain lifestyle habits can make anxiety worse, contributing to the state of mind that leads you to bite your fingers. Addressing anxiety by making simple changes can go a long way toward helping you kick a bad habit. Try doing the following:


Eat a nutritious diet. Studies show that whole grains, almonds, maca root and blueberries can help with anxiety. Avoid foods high in refined sugar.Cut back on alcohol and caffeine. Both of these substances have properties that can make anxiety worse.
Regular exercise releases endorphins that reduce anxiety.Getting plenty of sleep is another important way to reduce your anxiety and sense of well being.

Get a diagnosis for dermatophagia.,
Seek the help of a therapist.,
Consider medication.",How to Stop Biting Your Fingers3," Dermatophagia is a psychological condition similar to obsessive-compulsive disorder. If you feel that your finger biting is uncontrollable no matter what, you may have this treatable condition. The symptoms of dermatophagia are as follows:Bleeding skin. When you have dermatophagia, you bite the skin around your nails so much that it causes bleeding.
Skin discoloration is common.
Hangnails and other nail damage may occur.
The fingertips may be calloused from excessive biting.

, If you have dermatophagia, it's important to get outside help to deal with the condition. Like obsessive compulsive disorder, it's very difficult to cure this on your own. Make an appointment with a therapist who knows what the disorder is and has experience treating your condition.A therapist will be able to help you figure out if your condition is caused by anxiety, and treat the underlying problem.
Cognitive-behavioral therapy is a form of therapy that focuses on the relationship between thoughts and behavior. This has been found to be very helpful in treating anxiety disorders.
Seek out a support group, either in person or online, for extra help in dealing with the disorder.

, Make an appointment with a psychiatrist to explore whether medication could be the right choice for you. Some anxiety disorders respond very well to medications in addition to psychotherapy. Depending on your needs, a psychiatrist may prescribe one of the following types of medications:Antidepressants such as serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI)
Buspirone

Clean up stray nail polish.",How to Prevent Hangnails1," Your cuticles are the pieces of skin that you can see over the top of your nail near the knuckle. It's important to have healthy cuticles to avoid hangnails. That means not letting the skin dry out too much. The best way to do this is to regularly apply cuticle oil to moisturise them.You can use a regular hand cream, or moisturiser designed specifically for the cuticles.
Applying cuticle oil once a day before bed can make a big different to your cuticle health.;
, As well as caring for your cuticles, moisturising the skin around the sides of your nails will help prevent hangnails. Applying a basic hand cream to your fingers, focussing on the area around the nail once or twice a day will help you have healthier, and less dry skin in this sensitive area.


A lotion or cream with vitamin E can hydrate and soothe nicks and cuts.Petroleum jelly is a great moisturiser that is easy to get hold off., If you have painted your nails and you find that some of the polish has made it's way onto the skin around your nails, be sure to remove it quickly. Nail polish will dry out your skin, so wash it off carefully without picking at it.This applies to base coat as well as top coat.
Acetone-based nail polish remover will also dry out the skin around the nails."

Don't pick or bite at your nails and skin.,
Cut off potential hangnails early.,
Wash your hands regularly.,
Give your nails a break between polishes.,
Visit the nail salon.,
Know when to contact your doctor.",How to Prevent Hangnails2," Picking at dry skin around the nail only exacerbates the problem, and often leads to hangnails. Hangnails are generally made up of dead skin around the sides of your nails, but they can include strips from the nail plate if it has become damaged. Hangnails will keep recurring if you continue to pick at the skin around your nails.Biting your nails increases the chances of spreading infection, so try to avoid this too., If you have a hangnail developing you can cut it off early before it grows and becomes an irritant. Before you do this, gently wash your hands and then soak your nails in warm water for five minutes. With your nails still wet, carefully clip the hangnails with nail clippers.Specialist cuticle scissors can be used for this if you have them.If it doesn't cut easily be extra careful and always avoid pulling on the skin., Part of caring for your hands and nails, and keeping the skin healthy and free from infections, is cleaning them regularly with soap and water. This is common sense, but it is an important part of caring for your hands and nails so don't neglect it.


Try to find a soap that doesn't dry out your skin.

, Over time, the regular application of nail polish, followed by nail polish remover, can damage your nails and skin. This is especially true if the products you are using are acetone-based, contain formaldehyde, or formaldehyde resin.


These chemicals can cause dryness and irritation which can lead to hangnails.
Look for products that are acetone-free.

, If you find that your hangnails keep recurring, or you are struggling to stick to a good nail care regime, you can make an appointment at the nail salon. You can ask for some advice on preventing hangnails or just get a manicure. Sometimes if a professional does a great job with your nails you will be more inclined to look after them yourself to keep them looking good.


Just trimming your nails regularly will help keep them in shape and prevent hangnails., Hangnails are not a serious medical problem, despite the pain and discomfort that they can cause. There are circumstances, however, when you should go to see your doctor. If an infection develops that resists a basic antiseptic or antibiotic cream then you should make an appointment with your doctor.An infection could run up your hand and cause nerve problems.Indicators of infection include redness, swelling, feeling generally unwell, fever or high temperature.

Get enough vitamin B, and vitamin C. In order to have healthy skin and nails, it's important to have a well-balanced and healthy diet.,
Get plenty of iron.,
Drink lots of water.,
Get enough essential fatty acids.",How to Prevent Hangnails3," There are, however, some vitamins which are recommended for healthy skin and nails. Getting plenty of vitamin B can help strengthen and thicken your nails.A lack of vitamin C has been associated with hangnails and ingrown toenails.Try to get these vitamins through a regular healthy diet, rather than supplements.
Foods high in vitamin C include kiwi fruits, broccoli, bell peppers and tomatoes.Foods high in vitamin B include shellfish, fish, liver, and milk., In order to maintain healthy skin and nails, it's a good idea to consume plenty of iron. A lack of iron can lead to itchy and dry skin, and your nails may become brittle.Iron is found in many foods, including:


Whole grains.
Lean meat.
Fish.
Eggs.

, Dry skin is the major cause of hangnails, so drinking plenty of water will help you to keep healthy and hydrated. Drinking water doesn't directly hydrate your skin, but it is an important part of staying healthy.The usual recommendations of eight glasses a day is a good guide.

, Foods rich in essential fatty acids can help skin cells to stay well-hydrated. Incorporate three to five servings of good fatty acid foods a week to help your skin stay healthy and hydrated. If you suffer from very dry skin, you could try some flaxseed or borage oil supplements for a more concentrated hit.These fatty acids are found in food such as walnuts, fish, and olive oil.
If you do take supplements, always take as instructed on the label.

File your nails in one direction.Do not use a back and forth motion because this can weaken your nails. Just use quick strokes and move the file in one direction.

, One of the reasons why some people experience a lot of broken nails is because they use their nails in place of tools. If yu tend to do this, then you can reduce nail breaks by using proper tools instead of using your nails. Avoid using your nails to scrape things, open things, and do other things that you might do with a tool.For example, don’t use your nails to open packages. Get a pair of scissors and cut them open.
Or, if you notice that something is stuck to your desk, don’t use your nails to scrape it off. Use a stiff metal object, like a paint scraper instead.

, Doing household chores can sometimes cause a broken nail because of all of the water and chemicals that you might be exposing your nails to. Protect your nails by wearing a pair of latex or vinyl gloves whenever you are doing chores.For example, make sure that you wear gloves when you wash dishes or clean the bathtub.
You can also wear gloves any time your nails might get in the way or snag on something, such as when you are folding laundry.

, If your nails are prone to breaking, then applying a base coat may offer some protection. Apply a layer or two of a clear base coat to protect your nails from breaking.

If you have brittle nails, apply clear nail polish.,
Consider growing out your nails.",How to Make Your Fingernails Look Good1," The first step to having healthy nails is to avoid biting them. This will increase the chance of having those nails you so desire! Moreover, damaging the nail bed can invite bacteria and fungi and can cause infections., Cleaning with a nail brush is a gentle way to remove dirt, dead skin, and bacteria from underneath your nails. This is especially important if you bite your nails. You could also make a scrub with 2 spoons sugar and 2 spoons olive oil to make a scrub to exfoliate your hands and the matrix and cuticle areas. This will keep your hands clean and soft and also improve blood circulation in them.








, Although there isn’t much evidence to indicate that taking additional vitamin supplements will improve your nail health, some research suggests that biotin may strengthen weak nails., Get in the habit of using moisturizer, which it helps feed moisture to your nails,preventing hangnails and keeping your hands soft. Also, you can massage any kind of oil like coconut or olive oil around your cuticles to hydrate them and provide moisture to them enabling your nails to grow faster.








, This often tears the healthy tissue around the nail bed, which looks unsightly and can lead to infection.

, Excessive moisture can cause your nails to grow brittle and split, so wear gloves when you wash dishes and avoid soaking your hands in the tub.







, Strong cleaning agents like bleach and laundry detergent can weaken nails.

, This will help your nails retain their natural moisture.If you tend to have paper-thin nails, there are nail hardeners that have fibers in the liquid which help tremendously.








, Long, strong nails are the envy of every girl who sees them. Note that once you begin growing your own nails, it can take months to get them where you want them.


If you’re looking for a quick fix, wear fake nails. Although acrylic nails aren’t likely to damage your real ones, avoid applying them with unsanitary tools or allowing them to separate from the natural nails, both of which can invite infection."

, Dribble a small amount of fingernail polish remover onto as many cotton balls as you need to fully remove all nail polish. If you have a spot that's difficult to reach with a cotton ball, use a q-tip; alternatively, pinch off a small piece of cotton, wrap it around the flat end of a cuticle stick, soak it with nail-polish remover, and use it to reach those troublesome places.









To keep nails healthy, use acetone-free nail-polish remover (acetone dries out nails) and don’t apply it more than once a week., Scrutinize the state of your nails. With the polish now gone, you can see any dirt that has accumulated under your nails. Use a good fingernail brush to wash away the dirt under the nails. Again, if you have a spot that is being stubborn, gently use your cuticle stick to get the hard-to-reach areas.








, You should cut your fingernails by following the natural curve of your fingers. Rounded tips look better on most people rather than square, softening the hand for a more delicate look. It is important to trim the nails to prepare them to be filed.









If you intend to grow your nails, cut them all down to the same length beforehand so that they grow in evenly.
Though fingernails should be slightly rounded, always cut toenails straight across, which prevents them from becoming ingrown., Like sandpaper for furniture, there are different grits of nail files for different purposes; with natural nails, you want a fine grit file. Gently slide the file along the edge of the nail, moving only in one direction only to prevent splitting and cracking.









Be sure to remove any dust particles generated by the filing.

, There are a number of excellent nail-hardening products that will keep your nails strong and healthy.








, Steady your hands and paint each nail individually, starting at one side and working your way across in three or four strokes. Do only one hand at a time to prevent bumping and smudging. If polish gets on your skin, use remover to get it off.









Don't make the mistake of applying it too thickly. To keep your polish looking crisp and professional, you want each coat to go on nice and thin; thick polish takes longer to dry, has a greater chance of smearing, and creates bubbled, warped contours.
If you are one of those people who just can't stand sitting still, paint one finger at a time. When one nail is completely dry, paint the next. The bonus here is that, even if you do have an accident, you've only ruined one nail and not all of them.

, You can either reapply the same color or use a second one to create a unique shade.








, This will create a protective shell over the colored polish, which tends to be weaker.

Keep a balanced diet.",How to Make Your Nails Grow Faster and Keep Your Hands Soft," Let's set the record straight right from the beginning: Growing your nails actually means not breaking them. Generally speaking, you can't magically make your nails grow faster, but you can get the strong and less prone to breaking, so they stay long and beautiful. That being said, there are a couple of products that claim to promote nail growth:



Nail hardeners. These are clear ""polishes"" that use formalin (methylene glycol dissolved in water) as the strengthening agent.They're like nail polish, only with a shield and a machete.

Growth gel. Does it work? Well, maybe. Sally Hansen's VitaSurge Growth Gel says, ""The multi-active bead infused formula instantly releases a surge of nourishing Vitamins A, C & E to nourish and treat nails for healthy growth.""Multi-active bead infused formula? Sure. Take that for what it's worth.;
, While it won't speed up the growing process, Biotin has been linked to stronger, less-breakable nails.If you suffer from brittle nails that just won't grow out, it's possible this could help. You might see a change in your hair and skin, too!


This is available in some dietary supplements -- but it'll probably involve reading the ""ingredient"" label. Look for vitamins and supplements that claim to improve the look of your hair, skin, and nails; they probably have Biotin in them.

, It's a long-held opinion that your diet determines what your nails look like (amongst other things). Well, that's true to a point. The fact of the matter is that if you live in a first world country in today's day and age, you probably get enough of everything. So while a better diet -- more protein specifically -- can make a difference, take it with a grain of salt. ""Not getting enough protein"" is hardly an issue for most of us anymore, vegetarians included.


That being said, it's never a bad idea to ensure that your diet is balanced for general health purposes. The more nutrients and vitamins you get, the better your body will look overall, nails included.

, If you're into long, beautiful nails, you've probably heard that there are right and wrong ways to file your nails. When you take your file or emery board to each finger, go toward the center on each side. It doesn't matter what shape you do, just make sure you go from right to center and left to center, not back and forth.


And while we're at the ""don'ts,"" don't cut your cuticles, either. Push them back, sure, but don't cut them. That's your skin's last and final barrier against bacteria (it's on your entire body, after all) -- don't mess with it.
Though it's ultimately a matter of personal preference, you may want to stick to round nails. Square one have more of a tendency to catch, ultimately breaking more easily and more often.

, If you're painting them, that is. It's probably best if they're bare (polishes can eat away at your nail), but we all know how tempting color can be. If you can't imagine possible having nude nails, always use base and topcoat. Just plain polish keeps your nails from being able to breathe, ultimately weakening them. Applying a base beforehand and a topcoat after provides that barrier and the topcoat keeps the polish looking good, keeps you from picking at it, and tops your nail off with a seal-like finish.


Watch out for polishes that have chemicals -- they won't do your hands any favors. If it's something you're concerned about, you can find colors that are ""natural,"" ""vegan,"" or ""chemical-free."" Putting formaldehyde on your nails?No thanks!

, Whenever your hands get wet, use moisturizer. After showers, doing the dishes, playing in the rain, whenever. Heck, throw some on when you get bored. This can actually help with nail growth, too, as it keeps your entire hand hydrated and healthy.


But believe it or not, you may want to skip the lotion. The better option is hand ointments and buttery, thick creams with petrolatum or glycerin.
Hand sanitizer actually dries hands out. So if you use it, be sure to negate the bad effects with extra moisturizer.

, If you're victim of the occasional ""sandpaper hands,"" exfoliating is especially important. When you notice a buildup of dry, flaky skin, take it as your body's cue to exfoliate. Scrub your hands for two minutes or so with a tablespoon of sugar and a few drops of olive oil. Rinse it off and pat your hands dry.; don't rub.


While they're still damp, slab on some more moisturizer for good measure. Do this once or twice a week and you'll see visible changes.

, Sugar and olive oil aren't the only things you probably already have lying around that can make your hands baby smooth. Here are a couple of ideas:


Sprinkle some baby powder on your hands and briefly rub lightly in. Then pour some bath salts into your hands, a few drops of hand wash, wash and rinse. Be sure to use warm water!
Leave an application of coconut or palm oil on your hands for about 10 minutes. Wash away the oil with salt, not soap. Use some warm water if need be.
Wash your hands in vinegar and cover with powdered sugar. Scrub your hands lightly for a minute or two and wash off with warm water. This will also remove dirt and enhance the fairness of your hands.
Cocoa butter works great, too. You can even make some yourself!

, Take a spa night for yourself and moisturize the hours away. All you need to do is apply a thick coating of cream or hand ointment to your hands and slip on a thick pair of cotton socks over your hands -- and feet, if you'd like! Do this right before bed so you're not wondering, ""How the heck am I supposed to type this email?!"" When you wake up, you'll wake up to shockingly smooth hands.


If you can't swing the entire night, do it while you're watching TV or otherwise relaxing and don't need your hands. Even an hour will make a noticeable difference.

, Unfortunately, some soaps aren't that great for your hands -- after all, killing bacteria is no easy job. To be as hygienic as possible, they can actually dry your skin out, exacerbating the problem. Make sure the soap that you keep in the bathroom and the kitchen isn't one of these products!

, This is good both for nail growth and hand softness. Whenever you're doing dishes, cleaning up, or just generally being active with your hands, cover them with gloves (rubber or otherwise) or mittens. Heck, even when you're in cold weather. The fewer elements your hands are exposed to, the better.

, Some people like to think that working your hands promotes blood flow when it's just not true. How many manual laborers do you know that have long, beautiful nails and gorgeous, soft hands? Right. So if you can avoid using them, do so.


What's the easiest thing to stop? Using your nails and fingers as tools. Sure, you'll have to walk all the way to the scissors drawer, but don't open that package! It's a little hard to say ""don't do the dishes,"" or ""don't organize your closet,"" but not putting using your hands and nails as a source of pressure is something you can actually do.

, You know who you are! If you're the reason your nails are short, you've only yourself to blame. When you feel the urge to bite your nails or pick at them, sit on your hands or do something creative with them to talk your mind out of it. The urge will pass -- it's just a bad habit that needs to be broken.


Don't pick at your nail polish, either. The more under duress your nails are, the quicker they'll break. You shouldn't be picking at your nail polish if you're maintaining your nails and using hardeners and topcoats!

, Remember how we talked about getting enough protein and the fact that in today's global economy, it's hard not to? Well, if you're crash dieting, that may not be the case. For the sake of your nails, it's important to eat and eat right. If you're starving yourself, your nails will be starving, too. Maybe your waistline looks good, but your hair, skin and nails will look terrible. It's not worth it.


The more your diet includes fruits and veggies, whole grains, low-fat dairy and lean meats, the better. It's fine to cut calories, just don't be ridiculous about it. The fewer you intake, the fewer that can get devoted to growing and repairing your nails and keeping your hands healthy.

Look for a shampoo with a balanced pH value of 5, which will help to maintain your hair’s natural pH level and keep it healthy. Look for the following ingredients in your shampoo:Water
Lauroamphoglycinate, a moisturizer
Cocoamphacarboxyglycinate, a moisturizer
Sulfosuccinate, a mild cleanser
A list of recommended shampoos for biracial hair can be found online.;
, Many products in commercial shampoos can strip your hair of its natural oils and be detrimental to biracial hair. Read the ingredients list on shampoos and avoid products that contain the following ingredients:Isopropyl alcohol
Mineral oil/ petrolatum
Polyethylene glycol (PEG)
Propylene glycol (PG)
Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS)/ Sodium Laureth Sulfate (SLES)

, An instant conditioner will coat the strands of your hair and give it body as well as shine. It will also flatten the raised cuticles in your hair, making it soft and easy to style, and protect your hair from damage.Look for instant conditioners that contain a combination of lanolin, cholesterol, sulfonated oil, vegetable oil, proteins and polymers.
You can find instant conditioner that are “rinse out” or “leave in”. You can try both on your biracial hair or your child’s biracial hair to determine which type will work best for you. Leave-in conditioner can be beneficial for hair that is going to be combed out or blow dried. However, if you have curly hair that has a finer texture, leave-in conditioner may leave a film or residue on your hair.

, A penetrating conditioner is a deep conditioner that will absorb right into your hair and improve the appearance of damaged hair. This type of conditioner is good if you have split ends, uneven hair growth, hair that is dyed or colored, or hair that has been exposed to chlorine. It’s also good for a dry scalp.Many penetrating conditioners are made from animal proteins and keratin. You should allow this type of conditioner to stay in your hair for 15 minutes before rinsing it out.
You can use a penetrating conditioner once a month if you do not have damaged hair but are looking to moisturize your hair every now and then.

, Overwashing your hair can lead to dryness, brittleness, and damage. You can use other products to style and maintain your hair between washing so it remains healthy-looking and clean without daily shampooing.If you workout every day or sweat often, you can rinse your hair out with water. Avoid shampooing your hair too often, as it can dry out and damage your hair.
To wash a biracial child’s hair, have the child kneel in a chair and bend over the sink or under the faucet in a bathtub. If you are washing your own hair, you should position yourself over a sink with the shampoo next to you. As well, a removable spray nozzle or a detachable showerhead can make the shampooing process easier., Massage the shampoo into the child’s hair. Use the ball of your fingertips, not your nails, to gently massage her scalp with in and out motions. Move your fingers from her hairline and the nape of her neck toward the center of her scalp.If the child has tightly curled hair, avoid gathering her hair into a pile at the top of her head, as this can lead to tangles. Instead, work from the hairline and massage her scalp, letting her hair fall naturally.
If the child has thicker hair, you may need to apply and rinse out the shampoo two to three times. You can do one to two minute rinses in between the shampooing. It can also help to wash thicker hair in sections, pinning back each section and washing one section at a time.

, Conditioner is a key step to caring for biracial hair as it can help to smooth your hair cuticles and keep your hair feeling soft and clean. You should always apply a conditioner after shampooing.Squeeze all excess water from your hair before conditioning it. Divide the hair into sections and put a handful of conditioner in the palm of your hand. Massage the conditioner using your finger pads. You can also use a wide-tooth comb to work the conditioner into your hair.
Work the conditioner through the ends of your hair, as the ends tend to get very dry and are prone to tangling and knotting. Rinse out the conditioner or leave it in for 15 minutes if if it is a leave-in conditioner. You can skip the rinse step for leave-in conditioner if your hair is very dry and needs moisture to look good when combed or styled.
If your hair feels very dry, you can wrap a moist warm towel or a shower cap over your hair and let the conditioner set in your hair for 15 minutes. Then, rinse it out.

, Avoid rubbing your hair as this can cause frizziness and breakage. Instead, blot your hair with a towel and allow your hair to air dry.If you are planning to comb out your hair, you should do so right after you have shampooed and conditioned your hair. Combing out hair when it is wet may be easier than doing it when your hair is dry and lead to less breakage.

, Biracial hair can be tricky to style, as it is often thick, curly, and unruly. You can tackle biracial hair by ensuring you have a styling tools kit that contains several essential styling items, including:Combs: You should have several combs on hand, including a wide-tooth comb, which will help to detangle your hair, a rattail comb for parting hair and removing dirt or residue in your hair, and a pick with wide teeth to help comb out your hair.
A soft or medium boar bristle brush: This type of brush is good for biracial hair as it will not break or damage your hair. Avoid brushes with plastic or nylon bristles.
A spray bottle: You can fill the spray bottle with one part natural oil (such as olive oil, rosemary oil, almond oil, or lavender oil) and six parts water. You can also use a detangler spray that contains natural oils.
A blow dryer: Use a blow dryer that has a comb attachment and/or a diffuser attachment. These attachments can help to dry your hair quickly and prevent tangles.
Hair clips: These will come in handy when parting and dividing your hair.
Styling gel: This can help to keep your hair in place and ensure it looks sleek and clean.
Natural oils: Oils like sage, olive, rosemary, and almond are good for your hair and your scalp. You can apply them every time you style your hair and/or once a day.

, Combing out your hair is one the best ways to keep your hair looking healthy and clean. It will also lead to less tangles and make it easier to maintain your hair.To comb out your hair, you will need a rattail comb, a wide-tooth comb, a boar-bristle brush, hair clips and hair oil.

, If you have finer hair, you may only have four to five sections. Usually, the tighter your curls are, the more sections you will have..Be gentle when you divide your hair and avoid digging the comb into your scalp. If there are any tangles in your hair, use your fingers to pull the strands apart.
Once you have separated a section, twist the section into a tight twist and secure it with a clip. Then, unclip one section of hair and get your wide-tooth comb ready.

, Use the wide-tooth comb and work from the ends up to the roots using quick movements. Try not to comb too aggressively, as you want to avoid pulling out your hair or damaging it.Work one section at a time, unclipping each section and combing from the ends to the roots.

, Once you have combed out all the sections of your hair, apply a small amount of oil to your scalp and massage the oil into your hair. Use only natural oils and avoid heavy oils like lanolin, petroleum, and mineral oils. They will clog up your scalp and attract dust and dirt.You can then use the boar bristle brush to brush the oil into your hair, working section by section again. If you have very thick hair, you may skip this step to prevent your hair from getting too frizzy.

, Blow-drying your hair can help to straighten your hair without using harsh chemicals and make it easier to comb your hair or style it into braids. Blow-dry your hair in sections, after you have combed out your hair and added oil to your scalp.Use the comb attachment on the blow dryer. Blow dry in sections, drying the ends first. Once you dry the ends of a section, move up your hair and dry the hair closest to your scalp last.

, Oiling your scalp with natural oils on a daily basis can help to keep your scalp from drying out. You should also massage your scalp on a daily basis when applying the oil to promote circulation and oil production.Oils like jojoba, argan, castor, and emu can all be beneficial for biracial hair. Shea butter is also known as a good oil for biracial hair.
You should get in the habit of spritzing your hair with water throughout the day, as this will ensure your hair stays silky and moist. Carry a small bottle of water with you and spray your hair throughout the day to maintain a healthy look.

, Wrapping your hair in a scarf or a hair wrap before you go to bed can help to reduce frizziness and prevent your hair from drying out.Another option is to use satin pillowcases, as the satin can help to reduce static and frizziness in your hair., Brushes, combs, and picks can collect dirt, oils, residue, and smells. Give them a good clean at least once a week by soaking them overnight in a mixture of shampoo and warm water.You should also replace any brushes, combs, or picks that are missing teeth or appear damaged. This will prevent your hair from becoming damaged when you use your styling tools.

, A clarifying shampoo can help to remove any residue that has built up on your hair due to the use of hair products and styling products.You can also do a hot oil treatment on your hair once a month to help remove residue on your hair. You can do this at home or get a hot oil treatment done at a professional salon. Hot oil treatments often use natural oils like shea butter or lemongrass oil. Apply the hot oil treatment on your hair and scalp. Then, cover your hair with a plastic cap or a towel and let it sit under a dryer for 15-20 minutes before rinsing it out.

, Maintain your hair by getting frequent trims. This will promote healthy hair growth and prevent the development of split or dry ends. Book consistent appointments with your hairdresser, every six to eight weeks, so your hair gets the trimming it needs to stay healthy."

This helps catch stray hairs before they can drop any farther and cause any itching. , Be sure not to go to the salon with any kind of moisturizer on your skin. It acts like a magnet for loose hairs. , If you don’t have a collared shirt – or even if you do and you want some extra protection – ask your stylist to clip on a neck towel. It will catch many of the smaller hairs that drop around you as your hair is being cut, before they can fall down your shirt or inside the neckline of your salon smock. , One way to minimize itching from stray hairs is to ask your stylist to rinse or shampoo your head in a basin right after they finish giving you a haircut. This will help flush away any stray hairs that might be clinging to your scalp or the back of your neck. , Once your hair is washed or rinsed, ask the stylist to blow dry your hair and neck on a cool setting, if they don’t do so automatically. Then, make sure the stylist uses a dusting brush to spread some baby powder or talcum powder on your neck. This will help neutralize any itching and will loosen the hairs still clinging to your skin.Another helpful powder to apply to your neck area is cornstarch. Put some in an empty shaker container (such as the ones used for parmesan cheese) and sprinkle it on any affected areas. , After your haircut, go directly home and rinse off completely. This is the best way to make sure all loose hairs are removed. , If you don’t have time for a shower, put on a clean shirt. This won't remove all hairs, but will cut them down substantially. Then be sure to wash the shirt you wore to the salon. If you don't, you'll be covered in hair when you put it on again.

, Before you take a nap or go to bed on the day of your haircut, be sure you’ve gotten rid of all loose hairs. If you haven't, they can fall onto your pillow and stick there, causing even more discomfort.

Juice one lemon half.Rinse one ripe lemon under cool water; pat dry with clean paper towels.,
Add 1 to 2 Tbsp (15 to 30 ml) of raw honey.Squeeze the raw honey directly into the dish of lemon juice.,
Mix until well combined.,
Wash your face.,
Apply the mask over your face.,
Allow the mask to sit for 15 to 20 minutes.The wait time is important; if you rinse the mask off too quickly, the honey and lemon won't have enough time to do their work.,
Rinse with warm water.,
Repeat weekly, if desired.,
Add baking soda.,
Use an egg white.,
Mix in milk and yogurt.",How to Make a Lemon and Honey Mask," Slice the lemon in half with a sharp kitchen knife and squeeze the juice from one half, collecting it in a small glass bowl.


In a pinch, you could technically use 1 to 2 Tbsp (15 to 30 ml) of bottled lemon juice for this mask, but freshly squeezed juice will retain more nutrients and is the ideal option.
Similarly, you could select any ripe lemon for this mask, but using the juice of an organic lemon will be the most beneficial.
Lemons have antibacterial properties, so lemon juice can help treat blackheads and other forms of acne. The acidic element acts as an exfoliator, too. Additionally, lemon juice can lighten and brighten age spots, dark spots, fake tans, and other uneven patches of skin, while reducing excess oil on your face.;
, You should use approximately equal portions of honey and lemon juice.


Like lemon juice, try to find organic, raw honey for this mask. Store-bought honey may work but will not be quite as good for your skin.
Honey has antiseptic properties and may be able to help heal scars and inflammation. It can also help reduce and relief sunburn. Additionally, honey attracts water, making it a natural skin moisturizer., Thoroughly mix the honey and lemon juice by hand using a spoon. Continue mixing until evenly combined into a thick liquid.


Note that you'll need to use this mask as quickly as possible--preferably all at once and within a few hours. Mold will grow if attempt to store it for prolonged periods., Wash and dry your face as usual, either over a sink or in the shower, and use warm to hot water to open your pores.It might be a good idea to use a gentle facial cleanser before applying this mask, especially if you have sensitive skin. Lemon juice can be harsh, and stressing your skin with too much abrasive material can do more harm than good.

, When your face is clean and dry, use your fingers to apply the lemon-honey mask all over the skin. Work carefully to avoid the eye area.This mask can cause stinging and irritation to the eyes. If you accidentally get it into your eyes, flush it out immediately with cool to lukewarm water for a full minute, or until the stinging stops.
The mask can also be quite sticky, so it's a good idea to make sure hair is pulled back and out of the way before application.,


Of course, if your skin starts to burn, itch, or otherwise feel uncomfortable, you should rinse the mask off immediately. It's possible that your skin is having a negative reaction to the mask if you experience these symptoms.

, When the waiting period ends, rinse the mask off your face using warm water. After finishing the warm water rinse, do a second rinse with cool water to close your pores.You can also wipe away the mask with a warm, slightly damp wash cloth. The wash cloth acts as a physical exfoliator. Use gentle patting motions when using this trick, however, to avoid irritating your skin., The exact frequency with which you apply the mask may vary depending on how sensitive or oily your skin is, but a good average is about once a week, either in the morning or evening.You can try applying the mask two to three times a week if you have notably oily or acne-prone skin, but cut back if you notice any redness, irritation, or increased amounts of acne.

, After mixing together the usual amounts of lemon juice and honey, add about 1/2 tsp (2.5 ml) of baking soda, stirring well to combine evenly. Gently spread the mask over your skin and let it sit for 15 minutes before rinsing as usual.Baking soda is anti-inflammatory and antibacterial, so it will give the acne-fighting properties of the mask another boost.
Make sure that you apply this mask gently since the baking soda can be too abrasive if you scrub it into your skin.

, Use 1/2 Tbsp (7.5 ml) of both lemon juice and honey, and mix in 1 egg white until smooth. Apply the mask to your face, let it sit for 15 minutes, and rinse with warm water.The egg white has a mild drying effect, so it can help tighten your pores and tone your skin. Note that the effect is temporary, though, and will only work in the short term.

, Combine 2 Tbsp (30 ml) of honey and the juice of a whole lemon. Add 2 Tbsp (30 ml) of fresh milk and 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of plain yogurt (regular or Greek). Combine the mixture until it has the consistency of lotion, then apply the mask to your face.Apply the mask in layers for best results. Wait for the first layer to dry--it should only take a few minutes--before applying the second. Continue until you've used the entire mask. Once the mask is completely on your face, wait for 10 minutes, then rinse with lukewarm water.
Both milk and yogurt can help cleanse, moisturize, and soften skin.

Keep your hair on the shorter side.,
Go for blunt ends.,
Go against the grain.,
Curl your hair.,
Do the side sweep.,
Consider layers.",How to Add Volume to Your Hair1," The longer your hair gets, the more strain it puts on the root. When it's weighed down, your hair will have a harder time standing up and looking as full as possible. By going for a shorter cut, you'll put less strain on your roots and you'll maximize the volume you can get.






;
, When the ends of your hair look wispy and layered, it tends to make your hair look thinner. You can see extreme examples of this in the ends of ""scene"" hairstyles. To make your hair look like it has more volume, choose a haircut with blunt ends and bangs.








, Figure out which direction your hair lays flat and then style it in the opposite direction. This will create lift at the roots, because your hair is still trying to go the other way.









This works best if you pair it with styling products meant to increase lift at the roots and keep hair in place. A basic hairspray is a good place to start.
So, for example, blow dry your hair so that it's going to the left. Once it's dry, comb and style it to the right. BAM: instant lift with almost no effort!

, Curling your hair can add a lot of volume. Just think about all those 80s perms (of course, that was too much volume). While you might not want to go the perm route, you can use a basic curling iron and hair products to get and keep curls in your hair for a day or two.









When you do create curls, use outward-facing waves.These will draw the eye away from the center of your face, making your hair look even more voluminous.

, Instead of parting your hair at the center, part your hair far to one side or the other. This will double the volume of the main section of hair, making it look super full. The other side is meant to look smaller in this style, so less voluminous hair will not look out of place.









This hairstyle will probably require some coordinating with your hair cut, so you might need to plan ahead on this one. If you have long hair with layers, however, you should easily be able to switch into this style.

, Consider experimenting with layered hair. There is a lot of disagreement about whether or not layers help or hinder when it comes to making your hair look more full. It seems to help for some people, and make the problem much worse for others. You'll just have to try it out for yourself and see how it looks on you.

Avoid heat and certain hair products.",How to Apply a Keratin Treatment," You can expect to pay between $100 and $450 for a single keratin treatment at a salon.Doing a keratin treatment yourself won’t give you custom results, since at-home treatments don’t evaluate your individual hair type. At-home treatments tend to be less damaging, but also shorter lasting.For example, if you have a light hair color, a salon professional can adjust the formula so that the tonality of your shade doesn’t change.If you decide to go with a stylist, schedule a consultation first so they can determine the appropriate formula for your hair.;
, Whether you opt for a salon or an at-home kit, make sure to go online and read user reviews before committing. Prioritize quality over looking for a good deal. If you know someone who’s had a keratin treatment, ask them for a referral, including brand of solution and salon/stylist, if applicable., “Keratin” doesn’t actually smooth hair; the treatment will contain chemicals or other smoothing ingredients. Some keratin treatments contain ingredients that release formaldehyde, which can be carcinogenic. Others use alternatives to formaldehyde. Check the product label or ask a salon professional if you want to ensure that the treatment is formaldehyde-free.Methylene glycol, methanol, formalin, and ethanediol all release formaldehyde when heated or combined with water.
Alternatives to formaldehyde contain glyoxylic acid (or derivatives).
Treatments without toxic chemicals are not as effective at softening the curl pattern of hair.

, Massage the shampoo into your hair and work up a lather. Let it sit for three to five minutes, then rinse it out. Apply the shampoo one more time. Make sure to rinse it completely out of your hair afterwards.Anti-residue shampoo is formulated to remove buildup from your tresses, such as from conditioners or styling products. This will prepare your hair to evenly absorb the keratin treatment.
Anti-residue shampoo is sometimes called “clarifying shampoo.”

, Run your hands through your hair as you blow dry on a medium heat setting. Make sure that your hair is entirely dry, unless your product’s directions state otherwise.


A Brazilian treatment requires your hair to be slightly damp (85-90% dry) whereas a keratin treatment requires fully dry hair. Since the terms “Brazilian” and “keratin” (as they relate to hair treatments) are sometimes used interchangeably, it’s important to check with your product’s instructions.

, Using a hair pick or comb, make a part down the middle of your hair. Clip up your hair into four to eight sections (depending on how much hair you have). Make sure to clip each section tightly so that it stays secure during the process., The brand and type of treatment you choose should provide you with precise instructions on how to apply your keratin treatment. Make sure to read and follow all directions and safety precautions.


If your product instructions differ from these instructions, always follow the directions provided by the manufacturer of your product.

, Wear gloves and old clothing or a smock. Take a section of your hair and apply the treatment product, starting with a small amount and increasing until the hair is coated but not overly saturated. Use a fine-tooth comb or a hair coloring brush to work the product into each section, from your roots to ends. Clip up each section when you finish it.

, Cover your hair with a shower cap. Allow the product to remain on your hair as long as the directions require., Remove your hair cap and clips. Don’t rinse out the product unless the instructions advise you to do so. Blow dry your hair with the product still in. Use the hot or cold setting on your blow drier, depending on which one your product recommends., Set the temperature to 450 °F (232 °C). When your flat iron reaches the correct temperature, straighten your hair in small sections (about one to two inches thick). You may want to clip up sections of your hair beforehand or as you finish straightening them., Washing your hair too soon will shorten the life of your keratin treatment. If you can wait a week before getting your hair wet, even better!Try using a dry shampoo if the lack of lathering your locks is bothering you., Avoid using any ponytail holders such as elastics or even hair clips, if possible. Try a fabric bandanna if you want to keep your hair out of your face.Using hair ties or clips may cause a crease in your hair. However, this may not be the case if you wear a hair tie loosely., Your keratin treatment may last longer if you avoid styling or drying your hair with heat. Wash your hair sparingly – as needed – with shampoo only (skip conditioner).Use a sulfate-free shampoo."

Separate your hair.,
Take a chunk of hair.,
Spray hairspray at the roots.,
Comb at the roots in a circular motion.,
Arrange your hair.",How to Add Volume to Your Hair2," Separate your hair into four layers starting at your crown and moving down to your neck (securing each section separately to your head with slips). With that method, start with the lowest section and grab your two inch sections from there.









If you want just a little lift, you can do back-combing only to the upper layers of your hair. This can save a little time.

, Release the lowest section of your hair and then take a two inch section of that hair between your fingers.








, Take your hairspray and spray it on the roots of the two inch section.








, Now, take a fine comb and move the comb in a quick, circular motion. The comb should move down the hair shafts, and then move back out of the hair before coming down again.









Many people make the mistake of moving the comb up and down through the section of the hair, but this just releases the volume you created.

, Arrange the volumized hair to hair to mask the fluffed under section and generally style your hair into a finished look. Largely, as long as you're gentle with your roots and don't use to much combing or brushing, you can style your hair largely as normal.

Section your hair with clips.,
Grab a chunk of hair to work with.,
Crimp the roots.,
Move to the next layer.,
Release the top layer.,
Break up the crimps.,
Style as normal.",How to Add Volume to Your Hair3," Using a comb or pick, separate your hair into three layers going from the top of your head down to the neck. Secure each section to your head with clips in order to keep it in place.








, Release the lower section of hair and grab a roughly two-inch chunk with your fingers.








, Using a crimping iron, crimp as close to the scalp as you can get. Do one crimp, move the iron forward just a bit, and then crimp again.









You can spray each crimped section with hairspray as you go, if you want to. This is an especially good idea if your hair normally can't hold a shape.

, Repeat sectioning and crimping until the layer is finished. When the layer is done, move on to the next layer up.








, With the lower two layers done, release the top layer. This layer will not be crimped, but will instead hide the crimping of the lower layers.








, Gently prod your fingers through your hair, starting low and moving in a short upward motion. This will break up the crimps and give the hair more natural flow.








, With your hair volumized, you can proceed to style as normal. Avoid using too much combing or brushing, however, as this will cause volume loss.

Use light, volumizing shampoo.,
Apply conditioner correctly.,
Dye your hair.,
Use hairspray.,
Use extensions.",How to Add Volume to Your Hair4," Some shampoos leave behind a lot of residue, which can weigh hair down. Use a shampoo that's labeled for volumizing, as this will leave as little residue as possible and help return your hair's natural lift.








, When you apply conditioner, apply it only to the mid-to-ends of your hair. Leaving conditioner at your roots will reduce your hair's natural lift.









A light, leave-in spray might be best if your hair has very little lift, as this will create the least amount of strain on your hair.

, You might hear the advice that if you dye your hair, you'll make it thicker. This is true, but includes a ""but"". Only dying your hair a darker color than your natural color will make the hair shaft thicker.This is because the hair absorbs the dye, making it marginally thicker than it would normally be. When you dye your hair a lighter color, this strips away at the strand of hair, actually making your hair thinner and reducing volume.









You can also try highlights and lowlights to make your hair appear thicker. This will create the illusion of depth, making your hair look thicker even if it is not., Hairspray is the most basic tool in your kit when it comes to adding volume to your hair. Don't neglect it or write it off as just for Jersey girls and your mom. Used sparingly, it can add volume without making your hair look like a helmet. The key is to just apply it at the roots, paired with techniques like back-combing and going against the grain.








, You can use either temporary or longer lasting hair extensions to get more volume. Clip in sections hidden under the upper half of your hair will add plenty of volume. You can also get extensions which weave into your normal hair and last longer. Price and quality will go hand in hand here, so expect to spend some money if you really want your hair to look good.









You're probably acquainted with weaves, which are the more common way of doing extensions, but you might want to look in to micro-ring hair extensions. These are less damaging to your hair, making it a good option for people with thinner hair.

",How to Add Volume to Your Hair5," You've probably heard the advice that you should cut your hair every few weeks in order to make it grow faster, but that advice is actually a bit mixed up. What you're really doing is keeping the hair from breaking, meaning that you'll maximize the amount of hair that you have at any given time. More hair means more volume!









Cut about 1/2"" every two to three months to keep the ends of your hair healthy.

, You're probably used to thinking of dehydration as giving you headaches but did you know dehydration is also bad for your hair. Your hair will become more prone to breakage and shedding when you become dehydrated because of how the lack of water effects your scalp, so be sure to drink plenty of water.









A good rule of thumb is to drink enough water that your pee comes out a pale or clear color.

, Shampoo washes away the natural protectant on our hair, making it more prone to breakage. Use conditioner regularly, although not necessarily every time you shower, and you'll have a much easier time keeping your hair healthy and full.









Buy higher quality, more expensive conditioners if you can. These will work much better than cheap conditioners, which often do almost nothing at all.

, If you use hair dryers, hair straighteners, or your hair gets a lot of direct sun exposure, it's very important to use a heat protector on your hair. This is usually a product that you spray in when your hair is wet. This will keep your hair from breaking and let you build up as much natural volume as possible.

If you're short on time, try chamomile tea for a fast dye release. If you have a lot of time, try lemon juice for a rich stain. The liquid does not have to be acidic, but most people find acidic mixes stain better.

, While this step is optional, it's fun and potentially rewarding to experiment with different herbs for scent, tone and conditioning that suits your own hair type. Some suggestions include:


Unbleached chamomile leaves can be a great blonde booster.
Cinnamon can add warm red or auburn tones.
Powdered cloves can mask the cassia scent.
Rhubarb root, like cassia, contains a large amount of Chrysophanic acid, which makes it stain yellow so it's great to enhance the blonde. This will also stain your hands or clothes, so take care!

one tablespoon of honey
one tablespoon of lemon juice
a small dish
a spoon;
, To make a simple honey lemon mask, you will need frozen honey. Freezing the honey will give it texture, so that you can exfoliate your skin. Put one tablespoon of honey into a freezer safe container and place it in the freezer.








Leave the honey in the freezer until it is frozen. This will take a few hours. You can also place the honey in the freezer before you go to bed and it will be frozen in the morning.

, You will also need a tablespoon of lemon juice to make a honey lemon mask, so cut a lemon in half and squeeze the lemon over a dish. Measure one tablespoon of the lemon juice and add it to the frozen honey.








Make sure that you remove any seeds from the juice before you use it.

, Use a spoon to mix together the frozen honey and lemon juice. Make sure that the ingredients are well combined, but that the frozen honey is still chunky and textured.








Do not allow the mixture to sit for too long or the honey may melt and lose its texture.

, When you are ready, apply the honey lemon mixture to your skin. Make sure that your skin is clean and free of makeup before you apply this mask. Gently massage the honey lemon mixture into your skin using circular motions.








Apply the honey lemon mask to your neck as well.
Avoid applying the mixture to your eyes or too near to your eyes. Lemon juice will sting if it gets into your eyes.

, Allow the mixture to sit on your face and neck for about 10 minutes. You can take advantage of the time to sit back and relax for a while. After 10 minutes, rinse away the mask with some lukewarm water.








Use your fingers or a washcloth to wipe the mixture off of your skin.
Pat your face dry with a clean, dry towel when you are finished.

, Avocados contain healthy fats, vitamins, and minerals, which can offer UV protection and may also slow the effects of aging when you apply it to your skin.If you have dry skin, sun damaged skin, or fine lines, then avocado may be a good addition for your honey lemon mask.









Try adding a tablespoon of fresh avocado to the honey and lemon mixture right before you apply it to your skin. Allow the mask to sit for 10 minutes and then rinse as usual.

, Yogurt skin treatments can help skin to retain moisture, look brighter, and maintain elasticity.It can also even out your skin tone and help to calm your skin after sun exposure.








Try adding a tablespoon of plain yogurt to your honey lemon mask right before you apply it. Then, leave the mask on for 10 minutes and rinse it away.

, You can add egg whites to your face mask to help tighten your pores. If your pores are large and you’d like to tighten them up, add one egg white your mask mixture. Stir the egg white into the honey and lemon and then apply it to your face. Leave the mixture on your skin for 10 to 15 minutes and then rinse it away.









Keep in mind that although egg whites may tighten pores, they can also clog them. If you are prone to acne, then an egg white mask might not be a good idea.
Be careful not to get any raw egg whites into your eyes or mouth. Raw eggs can cause salmonella.You may also want to follow up your mask by washing your face with some gentle cleanser and water to remove any leftover bacteria.

, Oats add extra texture to a face mask for exfoliating, but they are also good for sensitive skin.If you want to exfoliate your skin without irritating it, try adding a tablespoon of oats to your face mask.

Trim the knot as a last resort.",How to Prevent Hair from Knotting," Always use a wide-tooth comb or a paddle brush with plastic tipped bristles,and comb through your hair before showering. This will help stop your hair from tangling when you wash it.As a general rule of thumb, don’t brush your hair when it’s wet, as wet hair is more prone to damage and breakage. Instead, use a wide-toothed comb to gently detangle your hair.;
, Wash your hair by focusing your shampooing on the scalp, rather than the hair, and never pile your hair on top of your scalp.Use a natural shampoo that doesn’t contain sulfates or harsh detergents, as these can dry out your hair.When you wash your hair, work the shampoo in a downwards motion from the roots to the tips. Do not work the shampoo up the hair as this can cause the hair to tangle more.
Don’t wash your hair every day, as this can strip your hair of oils, leaving it dry and more prone to breakage.

, After you shampoo, work a conditioner into your hair with your fingers and remove any tangles. When you have removed all the knots, gently comb through with a wide-toothed comb.This will detangle your hair without breaking the strands.


It is important that you use a comb and not a brush for this step.
If you have thick, coarse, and tightly curled hair, condition your hair twice daily as opposed to just once. Condition once in the morning or after you shampoo your hair, and again before bed with a moisturizer, leave-in conditioner, or dry conditioner., Instead of wrapping, twisting, or rubbing your hair, gently squeeze it with a microfiber towel to get out the excess moisture. It’s also best to avoid heat products, such as blow dryers and flat irons, which can dry out your hair and leave it prone to damage and tangling.


If you must blow dry your hair, towel and air dry it until the hair is mostly dry. This will help cut down on the blow dryer time.
If using a hair dryer, never point the nozzle up towards the roots. Instead, work it down the strands towards the tips to help protect the cuticle of your hair.

, Healthy and moisturized hair is less likely to knot and tangle,so along with regular conditioning, try a weekly hair mask or deep conditioning.


To deep condition, work a quarter-sized dollop of deep conditioner into your hair. Wrap your head with a shower cap or plastic wrap, and allow it to rest for 30 minutes to an hour before rinsing., After you condition your hair, apply a hair butter or oil to the tips. This will seal in the moisturizing conditioner and help smooth and relax the ends of the hair, thereby preventing them from coiling around themselves and forming knots.Another way to seal your hair is to switch your hair dryer to its cool setting. Blow the cool air over your hair, starting up near the roots and moving downwards towards the tips.
This step can be skipped if you have fine or medium hair, but should be followed for hair that’s thick, coarse, and tightly curled.

, This is particularly useful for tightly curled hair, as the stretching will prevent the hair from coiling around itself and forming single-strand knots. You can stretch the tips of your hair by wrapping the ends around rollers.


You can also protect your hair from knots by using hair styles that stretch your hair, such as twists, braids, and buns.

, If you're playing sports, swimming, or exercising, prevent your hair from knotting by wearing it in a braid, ponytail, or bun. The less your hair moves around and the less it gets matted with sweat and dirt, the more likely you are to be able to brush through it when you're done.


Prevent damage to your hair and scalp by positioning your buns and ponytails in different spots on your head every time, and always make sure that such hair styles are loose.
When you are finished exercising, let your hair down. This will help sweat evaporate from your scalp.

, Whether you're going for a summer drive with the windows down or if it’s just a windy day, wrap your hair in a scarf, cover it with a hat, or wear it in a protective hair style to stop it from blowing around too much. Not only will the wind ruin your hair style, but it will also blow your tresses into a tangled mess.

, While cotton is a popular choice for bedding, hair can catch on cotton pillow cases as you sleep, and this can create knots. Instead, look for a polished cotton pillow case, or a smooth fabric such as silk.


You can also wear a satin bonnet or wrap your hair with a protective fabric to prevent knotting when you sleep., To keep your hair healthy and remove damaged ends, you should trim your hair every eight months,but if your hair is prone to tangling, consider trimming it every three months.Removing knots can cause breakage, and frequent trims will remove split ends and broken tips, and ensure your hair stays healthy looking and radiant.

, Tie or pin up the majority of your hair, and leave a small section of hair free. Once you detangle that section, start a new bun or ponytail to keep the detangled hair separate, and move on to a new section of tangled hair.

, On the first section of hair, start near the tips and run your fingers through your hair to remove knots and tangles. Combs can actually make knots tighter, so untangle what you can with your fingers first.As you detangle the bottom of that section of hair, move up the strands and continue removing knots until you reach the top of your hair.

, When you encounter particularly nasty knots, apply some watered down conditioner to the area. Let it sit for a couple minutes, then go back to detangling with your fingers., Once you’ve removed all the knots you can with your fingers and can easily run your fingers through the entire length of your hair, gently comb through the same section with a wide-tooth comb. Like before, start at the bottom and work your way to the top.


Divide the section of hair into even smaller sections if you have trouble running the comb through.
Add more conditioner as needed to help loosen knots.

, If you come across a knot that you can't loosen with your fingers or the comb, insert the needle of a safety pin into the center of the knot and move it around to loosen the knot., In case you come across a knot that you absolutely cannot remove with conditioner, your fingers, the comb, or the safety pin, you may have to trim it off. Use sharp barber scissors, and make sure you remove as much excess hair from the knot as you can before making any cuts. Try to work the knot down toward the tip of the hair as far as you can to minimize the amount of hair you have to trim.

Include protein in your daily diet.,
Increase your iron and zinc intake.,
Eat vitamin rich foods.,
Focus on good fats.",How to Make Your Hair Grow Faster1," Your hair and nails are primarily made up of protein. The majority of your hair’s lifespan is spent in the “growing phase”, which takes about two to three years to complete. The rest of it’s lifespan is in the “resting stage”, which takes about two to three months. After the “resting stage” the hair sheds. Hair that is lacking protein goes into resting stage faster than hair rich in protein.Chicken, eggs, and greek yogurt are great sources of protein.
Your protein needs can vary based off of your weight and lifestyle. Most people need between 45 to 55 grams (1.6 to 1.9 oz) of protein per day.;
, Minerals like iron and zinc are crucial to the production of proteins that make up the hair on your body. Low iron is known to cause hair loss.You can get iron and zinc naturally in foods like spinach, beans, and seafood.The amount of iron and zinc you need to intake daily depends on your age, sex, and lifestyle. Talk to your doctor before making any changes to your daily mineral intake., Vitamin D is thought to be crucial to hair growth. Vitamin C is also important for iron absorption. You can get Vitamin C and D from the sun and food sources like milk and orange juice.Talk to your doctor before making any changes to your daily vitamin intake.

, Omega-3 fatty acids are needed for hair growth. They also keep your hair looking shiny and healthy. Your body does not produce this fat naturally.You can get Omega-3 fatty acids from fish. The American Heart Association recommends that an adult eats two servings of fish each week to get the appropriate amount of Omega-3 fatty acids."

Get your hair trimmed.,
Use a silk pillowcase.,
Avoid wrapping your hair in a towel.",How to Make Your Hair Grow Faster2," It might sound counter-intuitive but getting your hair trimmed will help your hair grow faster. With time, the strands of hair will begin to split at the ends. These split ends tangle and are more likely to be pulled out when brushed. Keeping your hair trimmed will minimize split ends., Your hair can catch on the threads of a cotton pillowcase. A silk pillowcase reduces this friction, thus reducing breakage.Wrapping your head in a silk scarf could be used as an alternative to a silk pillowcase.

, Wrapping your hair in a towel on top of your head after a shower can also cause breakage. Instead, gently squeeze or blot excess water out of your hair."

Minimize heat and color.,
Brush your hair carefully.,
Wear a ponytail correctly.",How to Make Your Hair Grow Faster3," Unless your hair is really oily, shampooing your hair daily can dry out and damage your hair. Washing your hair every other day allows your body’s natural oils to condition your hair., When you do shampoo your hair, be sure to condition it. Hair conditioner helps to replenish the oils that have been stripped your hair during shampooing. Make sure that you completely wash the shampoo out of your hair before conditioning., After you rinse the shampoo and conditioner out of your hair, briefly rinse out your clean hair under cool water. Cool water ensures that the hair follicle is tight. This reduces the amount of hair that is lost after a shower., Using heat or hair color on your hair damages the hair over time. Try to reduce the amount of heat that you use on your hair by letting your hair air dry when possible. Use sponge or velcro rollers instead of hot rollers. Stretch out the amount of time between coloring and use color safe shampoo to minimize hair dying damage., Use a wide tooth comb to gently detangle your hair. Work the comb through the ends of your hair and move your way up to the scalp. Tugging too hard on the hair to brush out tangles will result in hair loss., Pulling your hair too tight into a ponytail on top of your head can result in breakage. Instead, wear your hair down or in a loose ponytail. Avoid using rubber hairbands. Change up the position of your ponytail so that your hair doesn’t get too brittle in one area."

Use shampoo that’s right for your hair type.,
Use a hydrating conditioner.,
Avoid styling products with harsh chemicals.",How to Prevent Hair Breakage1," If your hair is naturally brittle, it’s important to use a gentle shampoo that won’t strip away all of its natural oils. Dry, coarse hair is more likely to break than hair that’s oily. Look for a shampoo made with replenishing oils like shea butter, argan oil or almond oil. These will trap water against your hair shaft and help it stay hydrated and healthy.


Look for shampoo labeled ""sulfate free."" Sulfates are harsh cleaning agents (the same ones used in dish detergent and other cleaning supplies) that strip the oils from your hair, leaving it dry and defenseless. Choosing a sulfate free shampoo is better for your hair.
This is especially important if your hair is curly, wavy or coarse. It's more difficult for sebum, the natural oil produced by your scalp, to travel to the tips of these hair textures.Consider low shampoo or no shampoo methods if your hair is extremely curly or coarse. Many have found that foregoing shampoo altogether and washing using only honey, conditioner or even plain water is better for their hair than using shampoo.;
, This replenishes the oils that your hair loses when you shampoo your hair. No matter what kind of shampoo you use, you should condition your hair to keep it from getting too dried out. Choose a conditioner that does not contain silicones, which coat your hair. Silicones are added to conditioner to hold moisture in, but they can only be washed away using harsh sulfate shampoos, so it's better to avoid them. Look for conditioners that contain oils as well as aloe and other natural hydrators.


Deep condition your hair once a week by treating it with a deep conditioner product such as Moroccan hair oil, letting it soak in for several hours, then rinsing it out. This will protect your hair during the course of the week, helping it to stay hydrated.

Coconut oil or olive oil are both great natural deep conditioners that you might already have in your cabinet. Comb a teaspoon or so of oil through your hair, put on a shower cap for 2 hours, then wash out the oil. .

, Most commercial styling products are loaded with an array of chemicals that aren't very good for your hair. In addition to sulfates and silicones, you'll find alcohol, fragrances and other components that don't do you hair any favors, especially if your texture is coarse or curly. Toss out the hair spray, mousse, gel and other products with an inch-long list of ingredients that are hard to pronounce.


Switch to a natural hair spray and mousse. You can make your own hair styling products by soaking a tablespoon of flax seeds in a cup of water overnight. Drain out the seeds and reserve the liquid. Flax seeds contain a natural gelling agent that works well when you need a light hold.
Coconut oil and argan oil are useful for smoothing flyaways and giving your hair a sleek look.

Wash, dry and comb your hair gently.,
Blow your hair dry sparingly.,
Avoid using other heating tools, too.,
Use alternate methods to achieve your favorite styles.,
Avoid using elastics and barrettes that pull on your hair.",How to Prevent Hair Breakage2," Many people handle their hair roughly in the shower, scrubbing it from the roots to the tips. Then they towel it dry vigorously and brush out the tangles. This routine is terrible for hair, which is more fragile and breakable when it's wet. Don’t scrub it, rub it, wring it out or brush it. Being gentle with your hair will prevent breakage.


Don't brush your hair, since this can cause it to break, especially when it's wet. After your shower, use a wide-tooth comb to gently comb out the tangles, working from the tips upward instead of the roots downward.
Gently pat your hair with a towel to absorb the excess moisture, then let it finish air drying.

, Aiming hot air at your hair is a sure way to damage it. Heat has the power to make hair look smooth and sleek, but unfortunately it comes at a high price, especially if you blow your hair dry every day. Save your blowouts for special occasions, and plan to let it air dry on an everyday basis.

, If you're going to prom, a wedding or a cocktail party, you might want to straighten or curl your hair. Otherwise, keep your heating tools in the cabinet. Using them every day is sure to cause your hair to get dried out, leading to breakage and frayed ends.


Straighteners and flat irons, curling irons and curlers should all be used only sparingly.
When you do use heat on your hair, smooth in a heat protectant product to mitigate the damage as much as possible.

, Just because you shouldn't use heat on your hair doesn't mean you have to go without beautiful tresses. There are other ways to achieve your favorite looks; you just have to get creative. Your hair may not be as bone straight and shiny as it would be if you used a flat iron, but it'll sure look better than it would if you allowed it to break and fray from too much heat exposure.



T-shirt curls look beautiful and require zero heat.

Straightening with a fan instead of a hair dryer takes patience, but it works.

, Every time you use them, you break a few strands. Try wearing your hair down more often instead of pulling it back into tighter styles. If you love updos, there are great alternatives to your typical drugstore elastics. Choose elastics and headbands made of soft cloth like silk or satin. They won't dent or damage your hair.

Never bleach your hair.,
Avoid getting weaves.,
Don't forget regular trims.",How to Prevent Hair Breakage3," It might look gorgeous in the short term, but in the long term this is seriously damaging to your hair, and potentially even your health. Many products used in chemical blowouts contain formaldehyde, which has been connected to bad skin reactions and even cancer.If you absolutely must get a blowout, do it very sparingly.

, You might love trying out different colors, but this can wreak havoc on your hair. This is especially true if you have dark hair that you're always trying to dye a shade or more lighter, since your hair has to be stripped of color before it can be dyed. That being said, there are ways you can subtly change your color that are actually restorative for damaged hair:


Henna dyeing is a great way to enhance your natural color by making it look richer and deeper.
Tea rinses are easy to do and can help blond shades get a little darker.
Honey and cinnamon are both effective hair lighters that aren't damaging to hair.

, No matter how healthy it is to begin with, your hair will suffer if you bleach it.Even if you get it professionally bleached at a salon, the process of stripping color from your hair is going to be very damaging. If you decide to bleach, proceed with caution and make sure not to leave the bleaching product in for too long, or you could burn off your hair.

, Most hair weaves, even those put in by a professional, have the potential to cause breakage and even bald spots. Heavy pull on the roots of your hair causing it to fall out. The hair can also break in the places where the weaves are sewn or glued in. Instead of getting weaves put in, consider clipping a weft to your hair using a clip that can be easily removed without pulling. If you do decide to get weaves, always go to a professional who knows what she's doing.

, When then ends of your hair start to split, there's no going back. Getting a trim every few months is a good way to keep your hair shaft strong and healthy, so it doesn't start to fray. Ask your stylist not to use harsh tools, products and techniques on your hair, especially if your hair is very dry, curly, wavy or coarse.


Hair thinners are particularly bad for curly and dry hair.
Stylists tend to yank the brush through your hair while it's wet. If you're concerned about breakage, ask the stylist to use a wide tooth comb.
If you don't want products containing sulfates and silicones to be used on your hair, you can shampoo and condition your hair before going to the salon. That way, the stylist can just re-wet it instead of washing it.

Scrub and stimulate.,
Use hair-safe accessories.",How to Grow Longer Hair1," Damage to your hair moves up the ends and can only be stopped if you cut it off in its tracks. Getting regular trims ensure hair health, from root to end.


Go in for a trim every 8-12 weeks. It may seem counterintuitive, but trimming even 1/2 an inch (1.25 cm) will give your hair a growth spurt.

If you see damage before 2-3 months, trim as soon as possible.


If your hectic schedule doesn't allow for constant trips to the stylist, invest in a pair of hair shears and make careful snips yourself.
If your hair is intensely damaged, you have to bite the bullet. Cut off all damage -- even if this means a good portion of your hair's growth. If there is any damage present at all it will not significantly grow.;
, Rinse in cool. Cold water seals your hair's cuticles and keeps the nutrients in, ensuring hair health. Hot water opens the cuticle up, allowing healthy enzymes to escape.


Hot water can actually weaken the hair and lead to it falling out.

, If your hair tends to get tangled out of the shower, use a wide-toothed comb. Brushing often pulls hair out prematurely.

Use a detangler to aid in getting rid of those snarls.






Make sure to hold the hair in one hand while brushing with the other. Stress on the scalp prevents maximal hair growth.







, Just like our brains need stimulation for growth, so do our scalps. When you're washing your hair, take a moment and massage those roots for 1-3 minutes.

If you have longer nails, try not to scratch! The scalp is very sensitive and any irritation can keep you from seeing the results you want.







, Accessories with metal edges that have tight spaces can catch on your hair, damaging and pulling it out. Not to mention hurting!


Rubber bands are a no-no for a substitute ponytail holder. Anyone who has tried it can tell you why: They tear out your hair and cut into your strands. If you committed the crime, cut it out with scissors.
Hair sticks and metal-less ponytail holders are generally safe choices. Anything you pull out that neither drags nor pulls anything out with it is generally a good choice.

Do not straighten your hair regularly.,
Embrace your curls!",How to Keep Hair From Getting Greasy1," This is important especially after eating or preparing greasy foods, as you might transfer the food oils into your hair. The same with oily makeup––pin your hair back of your face before applying the makeup and don't touch your hair with fingers covered in makeup. Keep your hair neat without touching it too much also––use a comb to remove tangles, not your fingers.;
, This will help to keep your hair from becoming more damaged and it will appear thicker and stronger.


If you don't do it sooner, you'll have to cut off more of it later because there is only one guarantee and that is that split ends get worse!

, You can use baby powder or dry shampoo to make your hair look less greasy. Simply rub it in to your roots, but be careful not to put too much in so that people can see whiteness on your hair! Try combing it out afterwards.

, Your forehead can be an oily skin zone, so keeping hair off your forehead will help to ensure that it doesn't absorb the oils from your skin.


If you don't want to blow dry your hair, instead clip your hair off your face as it dries naturally, so that it will still be off your face when it drys.
Or, wear your hair with the front clipped back in a quiff when it is dry.

, Straightening the hair really damages it, both through heat or chemical processes. The heat from the straighteners makes your hair produce grease, and since you'll be touching your hair to straighten it, this risks producing more grease.

, Permed or naturally coarse/curly hair shows grease more slowly, since the hair doesn't lie close to the scalp. If you have natural curls, flaunt them.

Skip the heat.,
Pass on the harsh chemicals.,
Ditch the scalp-stressing styles.",How to Grow Longer Hair2," That means no blow dryers, curling irons, hot rollers, flat irons, or crimpers. Heat damages your locks from cuticle to tip. It's best to stay away entirely.

Blow-drying is a quick remedy for morning time-crunches. If you must, use the low setting and stick to your ends.






Use a thermal spray if you do break down and heat-style your hair.







, No perms, no peroxide, and no chemical straightening. If you already have color-treated hair, use a shampoo and conditioner specifically geared for your hair's type.


Low-peroxide hair color is much less damaging than permanent color, but using these products again and again adds up. If you absolutely must color, use non-peroxide hair dye or henna hair dye.






The right hair products extend the duration of your hair's color, keeping you from treating it too often. Consider the small investment a lifetime prevention tactic.







, Many hairdos and styles are hard on our scalps and strands. It's easy to avoid putting undue stress on hair. Not to mention faster!
Cornrows and ultra-tight ponytails can ultimately result in bald patches, if worn too often. They put stress on the hair follicle, cutting off the supply of nutrients to the end.






Extensions may look pretty at the moment, but your hair will be left worse off when you take them out. Adding anything unnatural to your hair slows growth.






Dreads are never ""un-dreadable."" To get rid of them, you'll most likely need to cut them off. If you go this route, know that it is a long-term change.

Talk to your doctor.",How to Grow Longer Hair3," Just how skin is different, so is hair. Keeping your hair clean and healthy with the right products sets it up for quicker growth.

Some types of hair respond poorly to silicone, which is found in most anti-frizz products. Try a number of products and see what works best for you.
Don't feel the need to wash your hair every day. Good, natural oils need to build up in your hair--rinsing them away dries out your hair and scalp.

Do a deep treatment. In addition to shampooing and condition, deep treat your hair a couple of times a month. The extra proteins ensure hair health and shine.

, This generally means foods high in iron, zinc, and vitamin C. A hair-healthy diet is a body-healthy diet. What's good for you is good for your hair.


Feed your strands iron-rich foods like spinach, beans, and meats. It's essential for oxygen getting to your hair follicles.
Ensure your hair has the building blocks to grow with protein-heavy foods like fish, eggs, nuts, and soy products. Hair is mostly keratin, a protein in itself.
Zinc keeps your hair from damaging. Whole grains, oysters, peanut butter, and seeds are all good sources.
Add more fruits and vegetables to your diet. They contain vitamins A, C and E, all of which have antioxidants that help maintain scalp and hair health.
Never, ever, ever crash diet. Refusing to give your body the essential nutrients it needs not only makes you feel weak and lousy, but it will stunt your hair and nail growth and make your skin appear dull.

, Eating well, exercising regularly, and getting a good night's rest are all huge factors in staying stress-free. Intense stress of any kind can lead to all sorts of physical symptoms--including reduced or stunted hair growth.


Your body only has so many nutrients. Unfortunately for your hair, it's not a top priority. Your brain and other vital systems get first dibs. Taking care of your body first allows your body to take care of you in return.
Exercising regularly produces higher levels of endorphins. Higher levels of endorphins lead to lower levels of stress. If you won't walk your dog for his sake, walk him for your hair's.

, If you have noticeably slow hair growth, you may have a medical issue that can be dealt with.


Genetics or family history can also be a player in health and hair growth. Ask your family if any patterns exist in your family's health history.
Slow hair growth or hair loss may be due to medication. Discuss the side effects of the prescriptions you're on with a medical professional. Often, alternatives can be found.
Get checked for a scalp infection. These are easily treated and hair growth will return to normal once addressed.

Wash your hair frequently but not every day.,
Be careful with conditioners.,
Rinse your hair with warm water and then close the cuticle with cold water to add shine.",How to Keep Hair From Getting Greasy2," Daily washing may cause the oils to be stripped too quickly, encouraging them to come back as even oilier to make up for the loss. If you have naturally greasy hair, it's recommended that you only wash it every 2-3 days.


Look for a shampoo guaranteed to work on greasy hair. The best kind of shampoo is one that removes excess oil without drying out your hair. It may take some trial and error to find a good one––ask your hairdresser for advice.
Use a clarifying shampoo once a month. This type of shampoo is designed to remove any build-up of grease and hair product. Do not use a clarifying shampoo every day though, as it can strip your hair of oils, causing your hair to produce more in response. Instead, for daily washing use a mild shampoo that doesn't strip your hair of oils.

, Avoid using them at the root as this part of the hair is already moisturised by the natural oils (grease) produced within hours of washing your hair. A conditioner is actually meant to nourish the drier ends anyway, so try to keep its use just for the lower half of your hair.


Some people use no conditioner at all, or use it infrequently, say, once a week, to avoid over-moisturising.
If your hair gets tangled easily, apply something moisturizing and silky; a very small amount of olive oil works well. Use only enough to make your hands slightly shiny, then apply to hair away from your scalp.
If your hair is very oily, you may not need conditioner. However, it is best to condition the ends of your hair to stop them from drying out.

, Hot water strips your hair of oils and your scalp will replenish them immediately, and will make your hair turn greasy and even hard to comb.


Try a small amount of vinegar as a final rinse. Start with 1 tablespoon per 8 fl oz (236ml) of water and adjust from there. The smell goes away as the hair dries.
Or, try using fresh lemon. Brush the root of your hair with half fresh cut lemon (you can use both halves). Keep the lemon for 5 minutes before taking a bath. Repeat, with every shower, and the difference will come within 2 weeks.

Only shampoo every other day.,
Use hair spray with caution.,
Apply a hair serum.,
Try an anti-frizz cream.If you have fine or straight hair that tends to be exceptionally prone to frizzy static, applying a bit of anti-frizz cream to your hair might be one of your best moves.,
Consider using a conditioning spray.",How to Get Rid of Static in Hair1,"


Use the conditioner every time you shampoo your hair for best results.
If you choose a conditioner that contains silicone, the silicone in the conditioner supposedly neutralizes electric charges in your hair. By neutralizing these charges, the conditioner cuts down on the static electricity in your hair.
If conditioner seems to make your hair feel weighed down or greasy, at least use it on the mid-lengths and ends of your hair, where the strands tend to be the most dehydrated. Near the base of your scalp, you natural oils may keep your hair hydrated enough.;
, Keeping your hair clean is important for general hair care, but keeping your hair too clean can cause it to become overly dry, thereby making the static worse.


Shampoo cleans your hair by bonding with the oil and dirt molecules weighing it down and stripping them away. Unfortunately, when you strip these natural oils out of your hair, your hair also becomes drier and more prone to static.
By giving your hair a full 48 hours in between washings, you keep enough oil on your strands to naturally hydrate them without letting them get too dirty or greasy.
When it does come time to shampoo, opt for a hydrating shampoo instead of a clarifying shampoo. Clarifying shampoos strip everything from your hair while moisturizing shampoos only clean away the surface level of dirt.

, A little hair spray can tame your flyaway locks temporarily, but too much can cause more harm than good.


Standard hair sprays contain alcohol. Alcohol is a drying agent, so as a result, drenching yourself in hair spray will cause your already dehydrated hair to dry out even further, making the problem worse.If you do decide to use hair spray, spritz your brush or comb with it and run the bristles through your hair while it is still damp.

, Hair serum coats your hair with a protective layer that prevents the excessive loss of moisture. Less moisture loss means less static.


Serum works best on damp to towel-dry hair. After washing your hair and letting it partially dry, apply 3 to 5 drops to the palm of you hand. Rub your hands together to spread the serum before running your hands evenly through your hair.
You do not need to rinse the serum out of your hair.

,


Add a small dollop of cream to the palm of your hand. Gently rub your hands together to evenly spread the cream over both hands.
Rub your fingers and palms through your hair, focusing on the tips of your hair. This will distribute the anti-frizz cream through the most static-prone area of your hair.
Avoid putting too much anti-frizz cream on your scalp, especially if you have fine or straight hair. These products tend to be too heavy for find locks, and when they mix with the natural oils of your scalp, your hair can look greasy and flat.

, If your hair is of medium density or a wavy texture, a rich conditioning spray containing silicone or other moisturizing ingredients is a better option.


Wash your hair as usual and apply the conditioning spray to your hair before you dry it.
A conditioning spray can help you to lock moisture into your locks before the air around you has a chance to steal that moisture away.

Use a comb instead of a brush.,
Opt for a comb made of metal.,
Invest in a natural boar bristle brush.Even though combs are generally better than brushes, when you do use a hairbrush, you should choose a brush made from natural bristles instead of plastic bristles.,
Partially dry your hair using an ionic dryer.",How to Get Rid of Static in Hair2," Hairbrushes create more friction in your hair and combs create less friction.


A wide-tooth comb has teeth placed far enough apart to reduce the amount of friction. By contrast, a brush has bristles that are held close together, so electrical charges in the form of friction build up faster.

, While combs are better than brushes, metal combs are even better than plastic combs.


Plastic combs supposedly contribute to the static problem.
Metal combs cause the electric charges building in your hair to discharge, thereby reducing the amount of static present.

,


Natural brushes do a more effective job of spreading your natural oils through your hair. These oils will coat each strand of hair, locking in the moisture and preventing a good amount of static.
As an added benefit, your hair will also look shinier and smoother.

, Ionic hair dryers cut down on the amount of time and heat used to dry your hair. As such, your hair is exposed to less dry, hot air, minimizing the amount of moisture that gets lost.


Additionally, ionic dryers supposedly neutralize electric charges in your hair. These electric charges are responsible for static, so the dryer cuts down on the overall amount of static directly.
When you blow dry your hair, stop once it reaches a partially dry, partially damp state. Let the rest of it dry naturally by air. Your locks will lose less moisture this way.

Mist your hair with a little water.This is a quick fix, and unfortunately, only a temporary one.,
Keep a dryer sheet with you at all times.,
Tame the frizziness with a little lotion.,
Run a humidifier in the same room.,
Trade rubber-soled shoes for leather shoes.Leather shoes allow you to ground yourself, reducing the amount of electrical charge on your hair and clothes.",How to Get Rid of Static in Hair3,"


Fill a spray bottle with a fine-mist nozzle with water. Tuck this bottle into your purse when you leave the house.






When you notice excess static frizz, give the flyaway strands a few quick spritzes of water and gently pat them down into place. Only mist your hair, though. Do not drench it.
The water will give your hair a quick boost of moisture that can keep your hair going for another hour or so.

, Dryer sheets can be a surprisingly helpful and effective tool to use against last-minute surprise static. Carry one in your purse or pocket to help tame your frizziness on the go.


Rub a dryer sheet on your brush or comb before running the hair tool through your locks.
Keep your combs and brushes wrapped in dryer sheets during high-static conditions and times, like in the middle of winter.
Worst case scenario, you can even rub a dryer sheet over your hair to put last minute flyaways in their place.

, Lotion is another tool that can be useful for waging a last minute battle against frizzy, static-infested hair.


Place a dollop of lotion into the palm of your hand. Lightly rub your palms together to spread the lotion over your hands without rubbing it into the skin.
Only use a small amount of lotion. Too much can weigh your hair down too severely.
Run your fingers through your hair to spread the lotion. Focus on the ends and any areas with notable flyaways.

, If static-ridden hair is a frequent, daily problem for you, especially during winter or another dry time of year, a humidifier could provide you with some form of long-term solution.


In winter and other low-humidity conditions, the dryness of the air can steal moisture from your hair, causing it to be more prone to static.
Running a humidifier in any room you intend to spend a long time in can add moisture back into the air and, as a result, back into your hair.

,


Rubber soles, on the other hand, cause your clothes and hair to build up electrical charges. As these charges build up, your hair is more prone to static-related frizz.

, Once you’ve successfully removed tangles, begin to introduce more teeth into the combing process. If you can comb through the entire length of your hair smoothly and easily, rinse your hair and dry.


If you were unsuccessful, you may have to cut the knot out with scissors. Strongly consider enlisting the help of a professional. They will have techniques to minimize hair loss.

, Instead of throwing long wet hair into a ponytail, allow the hair to air dry slowly, hanging down. Pulling the hair into a ponytail when wet could reverse the work you’ve just done.

Divide your hair.,
Use hair clips.,
Start on a back section.,
Pick the knot.,
Take your time.,
Comb through your hair.,
Repeat per section.",How to Detangle Long Hair2," Use your fingers to gently separate your hair into sections. Consider creating one part down the center of your head and another horizontally across your head. This will make four smaller sections. Doing this will make locating knots easier and detangling more manageable., Gently pin the sections in place with clips. If clips aren’t available, you can use a scrunchy or gentle, loose hair tie.

, Using a wide toothed comb, gently comb the hair, beginning at the ends. Start with only an inch or two. Slowly work your way up to the major knot or tangles. Once you’ve arrived at a major tangle, use your fingers to gently pull the hair in various directions. This will enlarge the hair loops within the knot.


When combining, counteract the force of the pulling by holding your hair on the knot itself. This will also keep the knot from getting tighter.

, Using the same comb, slowly and gently pick away at the knot and tangle. Always start from the base of the tangle and apply light pressure.


Angle the comb so you are only using one or two teeth of the instrument. Do not try to comb through the entire knot right away.

, Rushing the process will only increase the chances of pulling out hair unnecessarily. If you rush, you could also create a more complex knot which will become a greater challenge to remove. Depending on the difficulty, it may take several minutes per tangle., Once you’ve removed tangles, you can begin to introduce more teeth into the combing process. Once you can completely comb through the entire length of your hair easily, move on to the next section., Continue the process of slowly combining and removing knots in each section. Once the entire head is tangle free, comb through all the hair at once.

Brush hair daily.,
Skip a lot of chemicals.,
Put it up.",How to Detangle Long Hair3," Be sure to brush your long locks before going to bed each and every night, as well as every morning. This may sound like a pain but the benefits far outweigh the sacrifice. Just make it a part of your daily/nightly ritual and you're all set.Use a good brush. Ones that have wide teeth are the best. They don't necessarily have to be pricey either.
Keep in mind that certain hair types like Afro-textured natural hair, should only be detangled once a week or so, instead of daily.

, Chemically laced products wreck havoc on hair and are just bad all around. Chemicals usually dry out hair which eventually causes tangling. Using them occasionally is one thing but if you use them often you are asking for trouble.


Using a leave-in conditioner will usually do the trick of counteracting chemical damage. This helps coat the open cuticle and makes it “slippery,” so your hair will glide through itself instead of getting caught and tangled.

, Sleeping with your hair up in a bun, for example, will help contain your tresses when you're tossing and turning all night. Use a non-elastic hair tie to prevent breakage as well.


You can get creative here. Try a loose braid, pig-tails or a simple ponytail.

Your goal is to stop it from dripping but not to dry it completely., Using hair products in wet hair allows them to be distributed more evenly. Add the products before you wrap your hair and they will soak into your locks and boost their effectiveness. You will want to save finishing products such as hair spray until you are ready to style, but you can add others at this stage:








Volumizer
Detangler
Leave-in conditioner
Straightening balm
Curling Serum

, Combing your hair before wrapping it helps prevent damage. Wet hair is the most susceptible to damage, so make sure you comb it gently.








Use a wide toothed comb instead of a brush to detangle wet hair.
Comb small sections at a time.
Comb through tangles gently to avoid tearing your hair.

, In order to wrap your head in a towel, hang your hair upside down to fit it all in the towel.

, You will be looking backwards between your legs to let your hair hang upside down. Pull your hair off your shoulders and make sure it is all hanging downward.



Note Keep your head down until your towel is secured around your hair.

, You need a towel that is long enough to cover all of your hair when wrapped, but not so long that it will be too heavy and fall down.The towel should cover your head and still hang past your shoulders when standing upright.
If you have hair past your shoulders, you may need a longer towel.
Thin towels are better than thick, fluffy towels.
Microfiber towels and t-shirts work extremely well to do the turban tie with., While your hair is hanging down, use the towel to cover all of your hair from the back of your head.Place the long edge of the towel at your hairline on the back of your neck.
Center the towel on the center of your neck.

, Fold the towel around your head tucking one side under the other. Keep your hair inside the towel as your wrap it around your head.

, Continue to twist the towel until it reaches your forehead.








, The twist should be on top of your head going from your forehead to the back of your head.

, Place the end of the twisted towel under the turban at the back of your hairline to keep it in place. You can also use a hair clip to hold the towel in place for extra security.








, If you are taking your time getting ready, you can exchange your wet towel for a dry one to help your hair dry even faster. The more moisture your towel absorbs, the less it will be able to remove from your hair. Replace the wet towel with a dry one, and the drying process will go even faster."

Use a wide-tooth comb or pick.,
Apply a leave-in conditioner or detangling spray.,
Comb from the bottom up.",How to Comb Your Hair Without It Hurting1," Never use a brush on wet hair. By using a wide-tooth comb or pick with rounded tips, you’ll be able to comb out your hair much more gently than if you used a fine-tooth comb or a brush. You’ll be able to work any tangles out softly and painlessly. When your hair is wet, it’s much more fragile and vulnerable to damage, so be very gentle., This will help work out any nasty tangles or knots you have, and make the combing process easier. An easier combing process means less pulling at your scalp, and thus less pain. Many products will give you additional benefits, like taming frizz and softening your hair. Find a product that works best for your hair type, and you’ll reduce the pain of combing., In other words, comb a little bit at the tips, moving upwards only when you’ve gotten out any tangles in the previous section.Most people’s natural inclination is to start at the root and just try to comb their way to the bottom. You’ll run into a lot of tangles this way, and risk breaking and tearing your hair. Start from the bottom, and slowly work your way up.

"
"
Work with small sections.,
Start at the tip of your hair.,
Move your comb upwards.,
Start a new section.",How to Comb Your Hair Without It Hurting2," Rather than trying to run a comb through your entire head of hair at once, it’s best to work with one, tiny section at a time. With your free hand, separate the section that you’ll be working with first.

, With brisk, light strokes, brush the end of your hair until you’ve worked the tangles out of that part of the section. Do not start moving upwards until you’re confident that you’ve worked out all the knots below., As you comb out each section, move up your hair, towards the root. Little by little, you will comb out the entire section you’re holding in your free hand. Remember, take your time. If you attempt to comb our larger sections, you will run into bigger (and more painful) knots.

, Repeat steps 1 to 3, gently working your way up each section. Continue these steps until you've finished combing through every section of hair. This process may take awhile, but combing your hair out gently section by section will greatly reduce any pain to your scalp.

"
"
Consider thinning your hair.,
Condition regularly.,
Sleep with your hair in braids.,
Invest in satin pillowcases.",How to Comb Your Hair Without It Hurting3," The type of haircut and hair texture you have will often determine whether or not it tangles and is easy or difficult to comb through. For example, if you have fine hair but lots of it, this may tangle up. Thinning the extent of hair may seem counter-intuitive but will both give your hair volume and reduce the tangling considerably.


Next time you're at the salon, ask for advice tailored to your hair type.

, By conditioning your hair, you'll ensure that it's moisturized and hydrated. Dry hair tangles more easily than silky, smooth hair. Conditioning is also less damaging than shampooing, so you can condition daily guilt-free! Every week or so, pamper your hair with a hydrating mask (store-bought or homemade) to give your hair an extra drench., If you toss and turn at night, you'll likely wake up with a bed head full of tangles. By sleeping with your hair in loose braids, you'll avoid a huge, matted mess in the morning. Your hair will be restrained in your braids, and therefore can't get too crazy. Not only will this prevent tangles, but you can wake up with pretty waves., The smooth, buttery texture will help prevent tangles. Not only do cotton pillowcases suck moisture out of hair, they create knots from the friction of the rougher fabric. Satin pillowcases will help you wake up with hair as soft as the material!"

Use your fingers to run through long hair.,
Apply a detangling product.,
Use a wide toothed-comb on the knot.,
Use your fingers to finish untangling the knot.",How to Comb Long Hair1," Before brushing long hair, you should check for major knots. If you use your brush through large knots, you can cause damage to the hair. Run your fingers downwards through your hair starting a few inches from the tips of the hair, and gradually work your way up the hair a few inches at a time. Work through the more manageable knots. If you encounter a knot you can’t run your fingers through, don’t force your fingers through the hair.;
, If you’ve encountered a large knot that you can’t get out using your fingers, use a product that will help ease out the knot. Apply the product to the knot according to the instructions on the label. For fine hair, use a spray.
For medium thickness hair, try a lotion.
For thick and coarse hair, or kinky hair, use a cream.

, After you have put the detangling product on the knot, use a wide toothed comb to comb at the knot. Be gentle, using small strokes to work at the knot. You should be able to get most of it out. If you don’t have a wide toothed comb, you can also use a paddle brush.

, By this time, most of the knot should be untangled. Run your fingers through the spot where the knot was to check if there is any more of it left. Your fingers are great tools because you can feel your hair in a way that you can’t when you are using a comb. "

Remove hair from the brush with your fingers.,
Mix a mild cleaner with warm water.,
Scrub down the brush or comb with a toothbrush.,
Rinse the brush or comb.",How to Clean Hairbrushes and Combs1," Get as much hair out of the brush or comb first by simply picking it out with your fingers. Hair should come out fairly easily, so try to be as thorough as possible. If you encounter any hair that's stuck on, use a toothpick to loosen it and then remove it with your fingers., You do not need to use strong cleaners on a hair or brush. A mild cleaner, such as dish soap or shampoo, works great. Add a small dab of your cleaner to a small bowl of warm water. There are no precise amounts that are recommended, but you usually do not need an excessive amount of cleaner to clean a brush or comb., Get an unused toothbrush damp with your chosen cleaner. Then, gently swab down the brush or comb between the bristles. You should also swab down the sides of the brush, as these make contact with your hair and build up residue over time.If you have a brush with a wooden handle, avoid getting the sides wet, however. Water can damage wood.

, Once you've given the brush or comb a good scrubbing, you should rinse out your cleaner. Rinse out the brush under the faucet using hot water until the water runs clean.Let the brush or comb air dry after cleaning it. If you're in a hurry, you can also pat it dry with a paper towel or rag.

Use the right brush.,
Apply a leave-in conditioner or a smoothing serum if you are brushing dry hair.,
Brush from the ends and work your way up.,
Brush from the roots to the bottom.",How to Comb Long Hair2," If you are brushing straight hair, you may want to use a different brush depending on whether the hair is wet or dry. Your hair is most fragile when it’s wet. Many experts advise using a comb when hair is wet rather than using a brush, which is more aggressive on wet hair.
When long hair is dry, you can use either a comb or a brush. Try to use a paddle brush with soft bristles at least a few times a week. This brush stimulates the scalp and spreads healthy oils down from the scalp through the hair. , These products will help to moisturize your hair and make it look healthy. It’s important to apply these before you brush long hair because brushing will help to distribute the product through the hair shaft. , Using your brush or comb, start brushing down the hair about one inch from the roots. This ensures that all the knots are gone, and it is much more gentle. As you are done with a section of hair, keep going up until you have reached the roots. If you start at the roots, you will end up tugging at your hair, which will cause breakage and split ends.

, Once you have worked your way up to the roots, brush a couple strokes down from the roots to the tips of the hair shaft. Doing this will distribute the healthy oils from the scalp to all of the hair, and it will make long hair stronger. "

Use a comb.,
Don’t comb dry hair.,
Apply a deep conditioner or mousse meant for curly hair.,
Comb from the ends and work your way up.,
Brush from the roots to the bottom.",How to Comb Long Hair3," Be sure to only use a comb on curly or natural hair. A brush can damage the hair cuticle and will make curls frizzier and less defined. The best tool to use for curly hair is a wide-toothed comb. , Never comb curly hair when it's dry. You may have noticed that curly hair becomes frizzy when it's brushed or combed when dry. Make sure to only comb curly hair after showering. , Curly hair is drier than straight hair, so it needs all the moisture it can get. Products meant specifically for curly hair deliver this moisture to curly hair for more defined curls. You also may try applying argan oil or another kind of oil at the tips of curly hair. The tips of your hair are the driest part of your hair, and need special attention.

, Just like with straight hair, you want to start brushing near the tips of the hair and work your way up. Curly hair is especially prone to tangling, so it’s important to not start from the roots. If you encounter tangles, do not yank the comb through them. Even if it untangles the knot, using too much force can mess up the pattern of the curl and make curly hair look frizzier.

, Once you have worked your way up to the roots, brush a couple strokes down from the roots to the tips of the hair shaft. Because the hair is wet, you won’t distribute as much healthy oil from the scalp as you would if it were dry, but it is still an important step in making curly hair healthy. "

Clean the hair out of your brush or comb at least once a week.,
Deep clean your brush at least once a month.,
Clean your comb every other month.,
Replace old brushes or combs.",How to Comb Long Hair4," An important part of caring for long hair is making sure that your brush or comb is clean. If your brush or comb still has hair in it, you are transferring the conditioner, dust, oil or germs from the old hair into the hair you're brushing. , You also will want to do a full cleaning of your brush at least once a month. Clean your brush by dousing the brush into a mixture of warm water and a teaspoon of shampoo. Dunk the brush in several times, then scrub the brush and rinse it off. Do not soak your brush, as this can damage the bristles.

, Deep cleaning is more important for brushes, because there is more space for dirt and bacteria to settle. However, it is still a good idea to clean your comb about every other month. Follow the same procedure as cleaning a brush.

, You do not need to replace your comb or brush very often. However especially for brushes, if you notice that bristles are falling out of your brush, or that the round balls at the top of your bristles are coming off, you should invest in a new brush. Old brushes and combs can cause damage to hair if their bristles or teeth are crooked or broken."

Submerge plastic combs in vinegar or rubbing alcohol.,
Soak the head of a brush in vinegar to disinfect.,
Let your brush or comb air-dry.,
Clean your handles.",How to Clean Hairbrushes and Combs2," Plastic combs can be safely sanitized in either rubbing alcohol or apple cider vinegar. Fill a cup or bowl that's big enough to hold your comb with vinegar or rubbing alcohol. Let the comb soak for 10 minutes. Then, remove the brush or comb and rinse it out under running water., You only need to soak the head of a brush to disinfect it. Add a mixture of one part white vinegar to one part water to a bowl big enough to hold your brush's head. Then, soak the brush's head in the mixture for 20 minutes.Rinse the brush under running water when you're done.

, Brushes and combs should be air dried on a towel. Times will vary depending on the type of brush or comb. Some will take a few hours to dry while others may need to dry out overnight., Handles of brushes and combs also come into contact with a lot of germs. You should clean them as well during the disinfecting process. Cleaning depends on the material of your brush or comb, but you can swab down most surfaces with rubbing alcohol to wipe away any residue. You can then rub down the handles with a damp cloth.It may be best to avoid harsh cleaners, like rubbing alcohol, on wooden brushes.

Clean bristles gently.,
Avoid getting cushioned brushes wet for long.,
Do not soak wooden brushes.",How to Clean Hairbrushes and Combs3," When cleaning the bristles of your brushes, go slowly and make gentle motions. Cleaning the bristles too aggressively could result in them bending or breaking during the cleaning process.

, Brushes that have cushioning below the handles should not be wet for long periods. Avoid soaking these brushes to disinfect them and stick to only giving them a mild rub down with a mild cleaner and water., Brushes with wooden handles or frames should never be soaked. Wood is very susceptible to water damage and soaking a wooden brush can easily ruin it. Stick to washing these brushes with a toothbrush and cleaner."

Do not tie the locks in knots.,
Avoid dyeing the locks on your own.,
Plan on leaving the locks in.",How to Care for Sisterlocks," During your first few washings, you should loosely braid your locks and tie them back with small rubber bands meant for hair care use.


Loosely braiding your locks can prevent them from thinning out when you wash them. Keep the braids loose, though, since tight braids can cause breakage.;
, Use a gentle moisturizing shampoo to wash the Sisterlocks, paying special attention to the hair at the roots.


If your hair is particularly dry or damaged, you may want to skip the shampoo and use a conditioner, instead. Opt for a standard conditioner instead of a deep moisturizing one to prevent the locks from getting too slimy or slippery.
Another option is to use shampoo during one wash session and conditioner during the next.

, When the washing stage is done, remove the rubber bands holding your hair in place and give the locks a vigorous shake.


Use your fingers to separate any braids or twisted Sisterlocks.
Allow the Sisterlocks to air dry. Do not use a hair dryer.

, Avoid washing the Sisterlocks too frequently, especially while they are still locking into place. You can wash them using this routine every two weeks or so. Do not wash them more frequently than that.


Washing the locks too frequently can hinder the locking process. It may take longer for your locks to set, and as a result, they may thin out unevenly.

, You will need to follow this routine until the Sisterlocks fully mature and lock into place. Once they reach maturity, they should be slightly more durable and less prone to breakage.


The exact amount of time you need to wait before your locks reach maturity can vary, but usually, this process takes six months or more.
Your Sisterlocks are mature when the locks are airtight and arranged in a tight, even system. They should feel and look solid from root to tip.
Your consultant, trainee, or stylist should be able to tell you when your locks are mature if you have any doubts.

, Your Sisterlocks may seem dry or out of shape in the morning, but you can fix that by gently spraying them with a little water.


Avoid using styling products or moisturizers that make the locks slippery.

, When your scalp starts drying out, you should apply a little hair oil directly to the skin of your scalp to moisturize it again.


Apply the oil directly to the scalp and not to the locks. If applied to your hair, the oil can cause the locks to become too slippery.
The best oils to use for your hair can vary based on the quality and texture of your hair. If in doubt, you can try a commercial hair oil from a trusted brand. Many women simply use standard oils, however, like jojoba oil.

, After your locks mature, you can usually wash them with a gentle shampoo every 7 to 10 days. Select a shampoo that moisturizes as it washes and avoid clarifying shampoos.


Note that mature locks do not need to be tied back while you wash them.
Avoid washing your Sisterlocks any more frequently than this. If you wash the locks too often, the shampoo can leave a residue behind, causing the locks to have a dull appearance., Do not use brushes or combs on your Sisterlocks. When you need to straighten out the locks or remove any tangles, comb through your hair with your fingers.


Combs and brushes can cause your locks to tangle and fray.
Once your locks have finished maturing, you might be able to use a wide-tooth comb instead of your fingers, but you must always be gentle to avoid possible breakage.

, The soft, smooth material can protect your hair during the night, preventing it from breaking or tangling as you toss and turn.


You may want to consider sleeping on a satin pillowcase, as well, for an extra barrier of protection.

, If you have naturally dry hair or if your locks have already been damaged, you may need to apply a deep moisturizing conditioner every 7 to 10 days to keep your hair healthy and glowing.


In fact, some women with particularly damaged hair find it best to alternate shampooing and conditioning. Wash your hair with moisturizing shampoo one week, then wash it with conditioner the next week. Alternate back and forth in this manner to keep your hair both clean and soft.

, Since everyone's hair can be a little different, the steps that will work for one person may not work for the next. Pay close attention to the health of your hair and the quality of your Sisterlocks. Alter your hair care routine as needed to remedy any problems.


If your hair looks dull, you might be shampooing too often.
If your the Sisterlocks are bunching, thinning, or otherwise setting improperly, you might be washing too often or using too much moisture.
When in doubt, talk to your stylist to determine what the problem might be and how you can correct it.

, Return to your Sisterlock stylist or consultant four weeks after the installation of your locks. He or she will need to retighten your locks.


This should also be your first follow-up visit. If you went to a registered Sisterlock consultant, this visit will usually be included in the total cost of the procedure.
During this first follow-up, the consultant should tighten new growth while checking on the overall progress of your Sisterlocks. He or she may also wash your hair.
If your consultant notices any problems or potential problems, he or she should point them out to you and let you know how to correct them. You can also bring up any concerns of your own during this time.
Note that if you need to find a new certified consultant or trainee, you can do so through the Sisterlock website: http://www.sisterlocks.com/finding-a-consultant.html


, After the first retightening, new growth will usually need to be re-tightened again after every six weeks. See your stylist or consultant about this procedure.


The exact time frame can vary. If your hair grows fast, you may need to make a return visit every four weeks. If it grows slow, you might be able to wait six weeks. You can usually tell when your locks need to be retightened by looking in a mirror, but if you have any doubts, talk to your consultant or stylist.
Note that the average cost of every professional retightening after your first ranges between $25 and $30 per hour. The exact amount of time required for a retightening can vary based on the length of your hair, the number of Sisterlocks you have in it, and the skill of the consultant. These sessions usually last a few hours, though.A good consultant will continue to keep you informed of any potential problems that your locks might face after each retightening session.

, If you want to save time and money, you can learn to retighten your Sisterlocks by yourself. It is strongly recommended that you ask your installation consultant or stylist about formal training, though.


Do not rely on unprofessional videos or online instructional articles when learning this process. You should learn from someone who has been trained in the practice of styling Sisterlocks. Improper installation or retightening can cause severe breakage and may result in baldness.It's best to consider this option only after your locks have had a chance to mature. During the first few months, stick to professional retightening sessions.
The class you'll need to take can cost around $250. You'll need to attend four days of two-hour sessions. After you take it, though, you should be able to tighten the locks on your own, making it a better long-term value.
Your are qualified to take the retightening class if you have Sisterlocks installed in your hair, if your hair is well maintained, if the locks have finished settling in, and if you have your locking pattern information from your consultant.
You can enroll in retightening training through the Sisterlocks website: http://www.sisterlocks.com/retightening-classes.html


, Until the locks have a chance to mature, it is best to avoid twisting or pulling your hair. The less you manipulate them during this time frame, the better.


When you do style fresh locks, opt for looser styles to reduce the risk of breakage and thinning.
Your Sisterlocks should be kept loose at least half of the time while they are in the process of maturing, if not more often.

, Since Sisterlocks are so thin, they are very versatile and can be styled in a wide variety of ways. Most styling options you can use with loose hair can be used for Sisterlocks.


Consider tying the locks in with ponytails, half ponytails, braids, twists, cornrows, and up-dos.
You can also add hair accessories, like headbands and hair clips.
Try curling the ends with a curling iron or rollers.

, If individual locks begin the thin out, resist the urge to tie a knot at the end to preserve the length. Doing so can cause more long-term damage to your hair and to the style.


A better option would be to visit your stylist or lock consultant. That individual will know how to repair the fraying, thinning Sisterlocks in a healthy manner.

, Your locks can be colored, but you should avoid dyeing them yourself, especially in the early stages.


Even if the color turns out well, home dyeing kits have a tendency to dry hair severely. Your Sisterlocks can actually be so brittle that they break.

, Sisterlocks are meant to be permanent. You can remove them during the first six months of development, but doing so is not advised.The removal process takes longer than the installation process, so it usually costs more.
Most people prefer to simply cut the Sisterlocks out rather than go through the removal process. Cutting them out may even be your only option if you have had the locks for more than half a year.

It’s important to take your time as hair strands break easily and will become difficult to remove. , When it comes to hairbrush cleansing tools, the miniature hairbrush rake tops the list. While this tool is similar to a comb, it is far more effective. Cleaning rakes vary in size, as well as in single or dual sides. For bristled brushes or if you have multiple styles and sizes of brushes, a dual sided rake is more versatile., Hold the bristled hairbrush over the sink, a trash can, or take it outdoors. Brush the nylon brush through the bristles of your hairbrush. This will remove hair buildup, as well as dislodge skin and dandruff flakes. Continue brushing until the nylon brush rakes cleanly through the brush bristles. Wash the nylon brush to remove debris and allow it to dry completely before reusing it for this purpose.

, Teasing combs are dual sided with bristles and a hair sectioning point called a rat tail. Beginning at the base of your bristled brush, slide the rat tail under the collected hair and gently pull away from the brush. Repeat this on all sides of the cylinder or across the entire face of the pad. Once you have loosened and lifted the hair from the shaft, simply use your fingers to roll the hair up and off. , Oftentimes, the hair will clump or knot in the process of removal.

Make sure to include small circular motions to help dredge up heavily soiled brushes. , After scrubbing the bristled brush cylinder or pad, dip the head of your hairbrush into the cleansing agent. This will help to remove any loose particles, as well as provide a second rinsing, which is particularly useful on stubborn hair product build up. If the hairbrush has a wooden handle or paddle, do not submerge the brush in the water. Most wooden brushes are coated in a moisture repellant, but they aren’t 100% resistant. Instead of submerging in the bowl of water, perform one or two additional toothbrush cleanings.

, Fill a second medium sized bowl with clean and cool water. Lower your hairbrush into the water gently submerging the entire bristled area. For circular brushes, you may have to twist your brush in your palms to make sure the entire area has been rinsed.

If you have a wooden bristled brush, hold the brush bristle side down over a sink or a towel. Take a mist or spray bottle and soak the cleansed bristles until the water runs clear from the bristles. , It's important to immediately remove any excess water that has collected in the bristles or on the pad of a wooden brush. Moisture can cling and seep into brush bristles, cloth brush pads, and wood causing mold and rot. Using a cloth, gently press between the bristles to reach the surface of the cylinder or pad. Make sure to use adequate pressure to soak up any excess moisture. , Once you have absorbed excess moisture, it's important to allow the brush to fully dry before use. Place the bristles facing down on a clean and dry towel and allow to dry overnight. , If you need to use your brush right away, use a hair dryer set to its lowest setting to speed the drying process. Go back and forth over the brush a few times to blow out any remaining water drops and to ensure that the hairbrush is now damp rather than soaking wet."

Learn the triggers for psoriasis.,
Use medical treatments for psoriasis.",How to Choose Shampoo for Scalp Psoriasis3," The most common type of psoriasis that causes issues for your scalp is plaque psoriasis, also known as psoriasis vulgare. This is a common form of psoriasis that causes reddened plaques covered with thick, silvery scaly skin that develop as patches on your scalp.


Scalp psoriasis can be very mild, but it can also be severe. In these cases, very thick patches of skin may be very crusted and cover your entire scalp. It can also extend beyond your scalp onto your forehead, neck, and around the ears.
These patches may also form on the outsides of your elbows and knees, your tailbone, on your buttocks, on your genitals, around the nails, eyebrows, belly button, and anal areas., There are some risk factors for psoriasis that you can look out for. These risk factors include a personal history or family history of psoriasis. Having lighter skin is also a risk factor. You may also develop psoriasis if you have a compromised immune system. This can occur if you have viral or bacteria infections or are under too much stress.Age is not really a risk because psoriasis can occur at any age. It often develops between the ages of 15 and 35, but 10 to 15 percent of those with psoriasis develop the disorder before the age of 10., There are some environmental factors that can cause a psoriasis flare up. These should be avoided if possible when you have been diagnosed with psoriasis. These triggers include:


Any injury, such as a cut, bump or bruise
Sunburn

Wash your hair every 4-7 days.,
Try a pre-poo treatment.,
Keep your hair moisturized.,
Take care of your scalp.",How to Make Black Hair Grow1," Washing regularly helps to remove any hair product build up you might have, allowing your scalp to breathe. When you wash, you also stimulate blood flow to the scalp, which encourages hair growth.A lot of shampoos on the market contain sulfates, which can strip your hair of its natural oils. These natural oils help your hair to stay moisturized, preventing breakage. Search for sulfate-free products to keep your hair healthy and strong.Remember to deep condition when you wash. Deep conditioning can be time consuming, but it may help repair any damage from breakage.;
, If your hair feels too dry after a regular wash, consider treating your hair with oil, or pre-pooing, before shampooing. Popular pre-poo oils are olive oil and coconut oil. Coconut oil may even help reduce protein loss during your shampooing process.Mix together 1/4 cup of olive oil, 2 tablespoons of castor oil, and 4 drops of tea tree oil and apply to damp or dry hair. Cover your hair with a shower cap and let the mixture sit for about 15 minutes before shampooing as normal.Mix together 4 tablespoons of coconut milk, 2 tablespoons of honey, and 1 tablespoon each of 3 different oils. Olive, castor, coconut, almond, and jojoba oil are all great choices. Warm the mixture in the microwave and apply it to dry, unwashed hair. Cover your hair with a shower cap and a thermal heat turban and let it sit for an hour before washing as normal., You might find that your hair gets a little dried out even if you follow a good hair washing routine. If this happens, you may need to use a moisturizer or sealant between washes.Water is the best moisturizer for dry hair. Some days you may be able to get by with just spraying a little water on your hair to keep it soft. If you do have to buy a moisturizer, search for products that have water listed as the first or second ingredient.Sealants help keep the moisture in your hair, and are often made with oils and butters. You should only apply sealants after you moisturize, otherwise you'll just have greasy hair. If you find a product that contains both water and oil, it may work as a moisturizer and a sealant.If your hair is especially kinky or dry, search for thicker, creamier moisturizers., Massaging your scalp for 20-30 minutes a day may help encourage hair growth. If you have any damage or thinned hair from hair relaxers or weaves, this can be especially helpful."

Use protective or low manipulation styles.,
Detangle when your hair is damp.,
Trim your ends.,
Avoid using high heat to style your hair.",How to Make Black Hair Grow2," Protective and low manipulation styles are good ways to prevent breakage and retain length.Protective styles are styles that protect the ends of your hair by tucking them away. Cornrows, and two-strand twists, are common examples of protective styles.Weaves and extensions are technically protective styles, but can still damage your hair.Some protective styles, such as a two-strand twist, allow you to further style your hair with a bun, or a twist-out.Braiding cornrows can be a time consuming task and takes a bit of practice to master. Have a friend help you if you plan on going this route.
Low manipulation styles don't protect the ends of the hair, but they can still prevent breakage. They are easier to do and less permanent than protective styles. Twist-outs and coils are examples of low manipulation styles., After washing, make sure you give your hair a little time to dry before trying to detangle it. If your hair is dry, use a spray bottle and mist it with some water before detangling.Use a wide-tooth comb to detangle your hair. If you find that using a comb causes your hair to break, then switch to finger-combing.Some people prefer to use a little conditioner or shea butter to help detangle their hair. Once your hair is detangled, rinse the moisturizer out with water., When trying to grow your hair, it's best to trim away any split ends to prevent further damage to your hair. Schedule your trims every 3-4 months, when the hair starts naturally splitting.In between trims use a sealant to protect the ends of your hair.Trimming your hair when it is dry will give you a better idea of your hair's actual length. Dry hair also allows you to see more split ends and the true shape of your hair.Trimming your hair when it is wet might be easier because your hair is more flexible. But, during a wet trim you can't see the actual shape of your hair., Heat tools, such as flat irons and hot combs, can permanently damage your hair if used too much. These tools suck the moisture from your hair and increase the chances of breakage.Too much heat may lead to more frequent trims, which means a longer growing process.Try braiding or twisting your hair to naturally increase the length."

Drink lots of water.,
Get enough protein.,
Eat more fish.,
Eat your greens.",How to Make Black Hair Grow3," Water is essential for good health, especially if you're trying to improve hair growth. The cause of poor hair growth is often due to poor nutrition and the best thing you can do is get more water in your diet.The recommended daily amount is 9 glasses of water for women, and 13 glasses for men., Without enough protein in your diet, your hair can become brittle, or even lose color. Many sources of protein contain other nutrients necessary for healthy hair and skin.Poultry is a good source of protein and iron. Beans are also a good source of protein and iron, as well as zinc and biotin.Incorporating nuts into your diet will also give you a good protein boost. Some nuts, such as Brazil nuts, contain selenium, which promotes scalp health., Fish is a good source of protein, but it is also an excellent way to get Omega-3 fatty acids into your diet. Omega-3s are necessary to keep your hair naturally moisturized. A lack of these fatty acids in your diet can contribute to a dry scalp and dull hair.Substitute a couple of tablespoons of flaxseed into your diet to get your Omega-3s if you're a vegetarian., Greens are a good source of vitamins A and C, calcium and iron. Vitamins A and C help your body produce sebum, an oily substance that acts as a natural conditioner, and keeps your hair follicles healthy.Broccoli, spinach, kale, and chard are just a few examples of some greens to add to your diet for healthy hair. Carrots are also an excellent source of vitamin A, though they aren't technically a green."

, To begin the daily moisturizing and sealing process, use hair clips to assist you. Divide your hair into 4 sections and secure with the clip. The sections don't have to be exact or perfect - doing this just makes it easier to work with your hair during the daily routine process and also ensures even product coverage.

, Use a moisturizing conditioner that lists coconut oil, olive oil, argan oil and keratin as active ingredients on the label. Take down each section, one at a time, and apply the conditioner from root to tip, concentrating on the ends. After you finish one section, clip it back up into place before moving on to the next section of your hair.


While you should only wash your hair every 7 to 10 days, moisturizing and sealing (applying leave-in moisturizer and sealing with oil) should be done every day., The best oils to use are jojoba oil, coconut oil, olive oil, and pomegranate seed oil, all of which are widely available at grocery and drug stores. Take down each section, one at a time, and apply a small amount of the oil (a pea-sized dollop should work) from root to tip, again concentrating on the ends.


Experiment with each of the different oils listed above to see which works best for you.
Don't over-do the oil. Using too much will weigh your hair down and may contribute to a greasy look. Use the minimum amount required with a special focus on the ends.
When applying the oil, use a downward sweeping motion with your hair in between your palms. This will contribute to smoothness after completion.
Don't mix your conditioner and oil together to save time. The process will not work properly and the moisture won't be sealed if you do that. Make sure you always moisturize with conditioner before sealing with the oil.

Olive oil will give your hair natural shine as the honey conditions it.

, It needs to be heated so that when you stir the mixture, the oil and the honey mix into each other evenly rather than remain separated in the bowl.

Shampoo hair once a week.,
Condition your hair every time you shampoo.,
Use a leave in conditioner in washed hair.,
Co-wash your hair between shampoos if physically active.,
Use a leave-in moisturizer daily.,
Deep condition your hair once a month.",How to Maintain African Hair1," African hair tends to be naturally dry with minimal oil, which is why it isn’t necessary to use shampoo more than once a week. Shampooing your hair several times a week or even every day strips the oil that the hair needs from the hair shaft so that it becomes drier, frizzier and more prone to breaking.African hair does not often get overly oily like Caucasian or Asian hair does when it is not washed for several days.
Do not wash tangled hair, as this will make the knots even worse. Always untangle hair and then wash.;
, Because African hair tends to be dry, it’s essential to use conditioner every time you shampoo your hair to restore moisture. When you condition, pay attention especially to the ends of your hair, which are the most brittle, and keep the conditioner in your hair for a few minutes before washing it out.

, After you finish washing your hair, add in a generous amount of leave-in conditioner to the wet hair to continue adding moisture to the hair. Try to find a product that contains coconut oil, shea butter or cocoa butter., If you exercise or build up a sweat regularly, you may feel the need to wash your hair more often than once a week to remove sweat or other buildup. Instead of using shampoo, wash with conditioner in between your weekly washes.Conditioner will gently wash away sweat or other buildup while keeping the healthy oils in your hair.
Make sure to use the conditioner on your scalp as well as down your hair shaft.

, Using a leave-in conditioner or moisturizer on days when you don’t wash or condition your hair ensures that your hair stays hydrated and protected from damage. Use a light leave-in moisturizer formulated for African hair at the beginning of the day before styling your hair.Try to find a moisturizer that contains essential oils, which are absorbed into the hair and moisturize. Avoid products containing lanolin or other greasy ingredients that sit on the surface of the hair and weigh it down.
Spritz your hair with water, then apply the moisturizer, or find a moisturizer than can be used on dry hair. Use the moisturizer on all of your hair, but pay special attention to the tips of your hair, which are the oldest and driest.

, In addition to your regular maintenance of your hair, doing a monthly or bimonthly deep conditioning treatment will make a visible difference to your hair, making it more moisturized and less brittle. Use a deep conditioning product according to the label or get it done professionally for the best results.Try to use a product that contains coconut oil, shea butter, or argan oil.

Most standard shampoos contain harsh chemical ingredients designed to strip hair of excess oil and dirt, but because extremely curly hair tends to lack natural moisture, these shampoo formulas can dry your hair out and make it brittle. Your best bet is to find a moisturizing cleanser that contains botanical oils derived from fruits and other natural sources, such as avocado oil, coconut oil or almond oil, and make sure you pair it up with a deep conditioner that also serves to add moisture to your hair.Oils like coconut, avocado, jojoba, castor and olive are deeply nourishing and repeatedly make lists of best products for afro hair. These should make up the bulk of your hair treatment arsenal.Shampoo hair by thoroughly lathering and rinsing completely. When conditioning, let the conditioner rest in the hair for 5-8 minutes to allow it to penetrate to the roots. Rinse it all, or let a small amount of conditioner remain in the hair to coat and protect.;
, A normal wash-condition-rinse routine might not be enough for those with afro hair because of how quickly it loses natural moisture. Instead of always following shampoo with conditioner like normal, rub some specialty moisturizing cream or oil into your hair after you're done showering. These products are made to “wear in,” so that rather than washing them out after they’re applied you allow them to soak into hair strands to replenish lost moisture. Some of the best oils for this purpose are argan, jojoba and grapeseed, as these also contain biological compounds that strengthen hair.In addition to regular creams and oils, many hair products, such as masks, pomades and leave-in conditioners, also include the compounds you’re looking for, and can also aid in styling hair.
Apply moisturizers a little at a time. If you use too much, it can saturate your curls and make it look wet and droopy.

, Try cutting down the number of times you shampoo per week to three of four, instead of every day. Even moisturizing shampoos with beneficial oils will rob hair of its natural moisture because this is how it cleans. Just rinse your hair thoroughly a couple of times a week during your daily shower and avoid relying on products that rob you of your natural hair oils.You can still condition between showers where you shampoo, or you might instead use special moisturizers after bathing.

, Trade your coarse cotton pillowcase in for a soft satin one, or some non-absorbing fabric with a high thread count. Not only can rougher fabrics damage your hair through friction while you sleep, they can actually soak up a considerable amount of the oils in your hair, leaving it feeling like cotton the next morning.Satin pillowcases don’t soak up as much oil from your hair and are machine washable in most cases, making them ideal for those looking for a less distressing sleep solution.
High thread count fabrics make use of thinner, tightly-woven threads so they’re also less absorbent.

, Put on a hat or headscarf if there’s a chance of precipitation. Weather can be wearing to hair if there’s a lot of direct exposure; wind whips, heat fries and rain displaces moisture, making it frizzy and unmanageable. If you know you’ve got to be out in it, make sure you pack a protective layer for your hair.Leave a bandanna or head wrap in your car or bag so that you'll have one on hand in case the weather takes a turn. If you happen to get caught without headgear, bring along an umbrella, put up your hood or find a covered walkway.

, Go easy when washing and brushing. Brushes and combs are hard on hair because of their stiff teeth, but even washing too vigorously or using water that’s too hot can create stress on hair that accumulates after long enough. Wash hair in mild, warm water and detangle it gently once it’s been cleaned, moisturized and smoothed.


Brushes with wider, softer teeth are available and can make detangling hair less damaging (and painful).Even pulling back hair using bands with metal clasps can abrade your hair's outer layer. A better option is to find one piece nylon hair bands (made of pantyhose material) with plenty of stretch., Heat is one of the worst things for curly hair and, along with rain, one that is most likely to cause frizziness to go wild. If you choose to blow dry your hair or straighten or curl it occasionally, make sure it’s done sparingly. Because of its natural dryness, afro hair is prone to take on a crackly, coarse texture when it’s damaged by heat. Once it gets to this point, there’s only so much you can do to restore it to its previous strength.If your hair becomes too damaged, you can undergo a deep conditioning treatment at most salons that will restore vital suppleness to dry, scraggly locks.

, One way to lock in moisture overnight is to braid your hair before going to bed. By keeping your hair contained in the braids, the strands will be held closely together, sharing their moisture and keeping them from coming loose and rubbing against the pillow. Just plait a few braids (not too tight) in the evening and you won’t have to worry about the pillow chafing and leaching oil from your hair while you sleep., Split ends are the most obvious symptom of damage, and if left unchecked can continue splitting and destroy the healthiness of your hair. Inspect your hair for split ends every couple of weeks and either get your hairstylist to touch them up or trim them yourself. Make sure to also give your hair a “feel test” every now and then by running your fingers along the length of a few strands of hair. This can tell you if any breakage has occurred along the strand.


Make sure you trim split ends past the point of the split, or else it will just continue breaking.
Even if you don’t have split ends, hair that feels rough when you glide your fingers over it can be in danger of weakening.

, Eat a balanced diet full of protein, fiber and good fats. Many of the vitamins you might use to keep your hair healthy are the same ones that are found in food. Unprocessed foods like salmon, nuts, olives, green vegetable and whole grains can give your body the nutritive boost it needs to keep hair, skin and nails healthy.""Good fats"" typically mean monounsaturated fats—the kind you'd find in avocados, almonds, olive oil, dark chocolate and other foods you might also find on your shampoo bottle.
Excessive sugar and alcohol consumption has been shown to be bad for skin and hair., Your body heals its tissues while you rest, so make sure you’re getting enough. People who suffer from sleep deprivation often experience hair loss as the hair and follicle become weaker and weaker due to physical stress. For most folks, 6-8 hours a night will be optimal. Not only will you feel better by being more rested, your hair will also reap the benefit of your repose by retaining its strength and luster.Supplement your nightly rest with short naps throughout the day if need be.

Untangle knots using product and a detangling comb.,
Use a blow dryer with a comb attachment to straighten.,
Style your hair in protective and low manipulation styles.,
Choose a sewn-in weave.,
Let your hair rest in between two consecutive weaves.,
Get your hair relaxed professionally.",How to Maintain African Hair2," It’s important to untangle knots as soon as they form and before you wash your hair. Begin by spraying the knot with a mixture that is three parts water to one part olive or coconut oil. Apply your regular conditioner directly to the knot and from the roots of your hair to the tips on the knotted section. Then use your fingers to gently remove hair from the knot.When you have partially untangled the knot, use a wide toothed detangling comb to gently brush hair starting at the tips and working your way up the section, brushing down.
It’s important to never try to comb or detangle knotted hair when it’s completely dry. Doing so is extremely difficult and will damage your hair. Dampening your hair and adding product makes the knotted section of hair more slippery so that the knot can come out easier.

, If you want to straighten your natural hair, let the hair air dry partially, spray your hair with a heat protectant, then use a comb attachment on a blow dryer to gently brush the hair with heat to straighten it., If you are looking to style your hair as opposed to wearing it down, try styling it in protective and low-maintenence styles that keep your hair in place and require no daily manipulation or styling of the hair.Braids, including box braids and cornrows, are classic and stylish protective styles. If you don't have long hair, you can braid synthetic hair in to give you extra length.
Twists, including Senegalese twists and two strand twists are also good options for a protective style. Like with braids, you can also add in synthetic hair or even beads to add more to the look.
You can also do updos such as bantu knots or buns.

, Wearing a weave can actually protect your hair as long as you choose a sewn-in weave as opposed to one glued to your hair, so If you want to wear a weave, have it professionally sewn-in to your hair unless you are very experienced. Visit your stylist every two or three weeks after getting the weave to make sure it stays tight to your hair and doesn’t pull on your natural hair.Glued in weaves often rip your natural hair out when they are removed, whereas sewn-in weaves can be removed without any damage done to your hair.
You can also wear a wig if you don’t want to have a weave put in. Simply put your hair up, put a wig cap on, and wear the wig.

, You can keep your weave in between one and a half to three months, depending on the advice of your stylist. After your second consecutive weave, you should get the weave removed and let your hair rest for about three weeks, as wearing weaves for too many months can strain your hair and scalp., Relaxing your hair does do a certain amount of damage, but the damage is far less if you get it done professionally as opposed to doing it at home. After your first session, you will need to get your newly grown hair near your scalp touched up every few weeks so that it matches your relaxed hair, but never get your whole head of hair relaxed twice, as this can severely damage your hair."

Eat a diet rich in hair-healthy nutrients.,
Use a silk or satin pillowcase.,
Wear silky shirts with shoulder length hair.",How to Maintain African Hair3," Make sure that your diet contains plenty of fatty acids, B vitamins, folic acid and protein to promote the health and strength of your hair. Foods containing these nutrients include salmon and other fatty fish, nuts and eggs., One large cause of hair breakage is the friction that results from your hair rubbing against your pillowcase at night. Counter this damage by opting for silk or satin pillowcases, which create less friction and don’t absorb the moisture from your hair in the way that cotton pillowcases tend to do.If you don’t want to buy silk pillowcases, you can also wrap your hair in a silk or satin scarf at night.

, If you have shoulder length hair, the constant rubbing of your hair against cotton shirts or shirts made of other absorbent material can sap the moisture from your hair and cause breakage. If you have shoulder length natural hair, try wearing silk or satin shirts when you wear your hair down.

Don't use the strongest relaxer every time you get your hair relaxed.,
Condition your ends.,
Apply Moisturizer.,
Avoid using a blow dryer.",How to Have Beautiful Relaxed African American Hair1," The super strength and industrial strength relaxers are traditionally used on African American hair because it is so resistant to straightening. Nothing wrong with that. Just don't use it every time. Alternate between the mild and strong relaxers (of the same brand) so your hair gets some rest between uses of the strong stuff. If you relax every 6 to 12 weeks, ask your beautician to use the super strength on every 3rd or 4th visit. Your hair will have grown out enough to avoid overlapping the super strength relaxer and the milder one will allow your hair to remain relaxed yet still strong. Also apply basing cream to the ends of your hair. This will prevent the ends from over processing due to relaxer runoff.;
, By tradition many African Americans use conditioner often. As a result they have healthy thick hair. Condition is a good friend. Conditioner strengthens hair. Condition the length and ends of your hair daily or at minimum every other day. Do not put water on your scalp daily either, just the ends. Simply wet your ends about 2 inches (5.1 cm) from your scalp to the ends of your hair. Apply the conditioner according to the instructions. Your hair will love you for it. Conditioning your ends will keep them thick full and rich and they will not break easily.

, After conditioning your ends, you will need to moisturize them. Find an excellent moisturizer (Ultra Black Hair is one of the best) and apply it to the ends while your hair is still wet. Again, do not apply moisturizer to your hair full strength. Place a small amount in a container or the palm of your hands and add water to dilute it. Be sure the water and moisturizer are well blended then apply to the ends of your hair only (from about 4 inches (10.2 cm) below your scalp to the ends of your hair. Dry hair is brittle: keep it moisturized for flexibility and less breakage.

, Blow dryers are called blow fryers by The Long Hair Community for good reason. The intense heat of these machines is very damaging to African American hair types. Never blow dry your hair. Simply allow your hair to air dry. Heat damaged hair is extremely weak and breaks easily. To have strong hair, you must avoid using a blow dryer.

Keep your hair moisturized.,
Use oil in your hair.,
Trim your hair when needed.,
Take vitamins that boost hair growth.,
Protect the ends of your hair.,
Cover your hair whenever possible.,
Try using a protein treatment.,
Eat healthy foods.",How to Grow African American Hair1," This is by far the most important tip to growing long, strong, beautiful locks. Because African hair is so curly, oil from your roots takes a much longer time travelling to the ends of your hair. This means you need to spend every time managing the most damaged and dry part of your hair - the ends.


Always use conditioner every time you wash your hair. Look for conditioners which advertise dry, damaged, or brittle hair management. Apply this, and leave in for 2-3 minutes before rinsing out.
Use a deep-conditioner every 1-2 weeks. Leave in for at least 20 minutes and then rinse out.
Make your own deep-conditioner at home. Although it may sound strange, mayonnaise is a wonderful deep-conditioner. Rub it into your locks and leave in for 15 minutes. Rinse with your regular shampoo and conditioner. Repeat this every 1-2 weeks for ultra-soft curls.
Try a leave-in conditioner. This is a special kind of conditioner that can be rubbed into your hair after showering while it is still damp. It does not need to be rinsed out, but will also keep your hair from getting greasy-looking or piece-y. This can be done after every shower or between washes, as you like.;
, Because it does take such a long time for your hairs’ natural oils to travel to the ends of strands, infuse your hair with oils to supplement those your scalp already creates. AVOID petroleum and mineral oils.


Try using castor oil (or Jamaican black castor oil). This has been used for hundreds of years to increase the softness of your hair and aid in faster growth. Rub some oil between the palms of your hands, and run them through your hair to incorporate it to as much of your hair as you are able.
Lavender oil is not only made from a popular flower, but has shown to improve hair growth up to 44% when rubbed into your locks. Use the oil on wet or dry hair in addition to other natural oils to help expedite your hairs’ growth process.Moroccan oil is a new type of oil becoming very popular for its intense moisturization and de-tangling abilities. Although it can be pricy ($30 for a single bottle), reviews make it seem worth the cost. If you aren’t willing to pay that price, look for imitation versions for similar results at your local drugstore or beauty supply store., Although your goal is to grow your hair, fried hair ends can slow your natural hair growth process.Trim your hair every time your ends are split or constantly dry to keep it in tip-top condition.Only trim off the damaged hair don't trim anymore than necessary.

, There are many supplements and vitamins available for oral consumption which help your hair to grow speedy-fast. This is optional.


Biotin is considered the best vitamin to take to boost hair growth. It is available in capsule form at many health food stores, or for purchase online. It helps to renew the cells in your hair, allowing them to grow longer, faster.
Vitamin B6 is a great supplement to take to aid in hair growth, as it blocks the testosterone receptors at your hairs’ roots. Too much testosterone released into your follicles makes hair become thin and slows growth. B6 blocks some of this testosterone., The tips of your strands are the most brittle and damaged (as they receive the least amount of natural oils), and are the most prone to breakage. Leaving hair down constantly increases the likelihood of breakage, so put your hair up sometimes to help prevent this.


Keep your hair in a bun using bobby pins to help keep your hair in place. If possible, don’t use a ponytail or rubber band, as these can break your hair when you remove them.
Braid your hair. This helps keep the ends of your hair from being exposed and damaged further. You can choose to do dozens of small braids or a few large ones, but make sure you leave the ends ponytail-less so that they don’t rip out strands when you remove them.

, To help your hair soak in the oil and nutrients you have been supplying it with, cover it in a satin or silk scarf or bonnet. Although you can’t do this all the time, wear one during the night to prevent damage from the elements.


Use a satin scarf, as this material does not absorb oil like cotton and other synthetic fabrics do.
Sleep on a satin pillowcase so that the oil from your hair doesn’t get sucked out while you sleep., These are products that add protein to your hair to fill in the parts of your strands that are broken or damage. Although they benefit hair only temporarily, they can help your hair to grow long over time. Ask about it in your favorite salon or look for one in a beauty supply store.


Protein treatment has the biggest positive effect in relaxed or treated hair, but can be used on natural hair as well.
When you are looking for a protein treatment, read the bottle. If a type of protein (animal or plant based) is not listed in the first five ingredients, it probably won’t do much to help your hair.
There is no difference between animal or plant based protein hair treatments., Certain foods have proven to increase hair growth, and are great for nourishing your scalp and strands. Try to eat more of these foods to get your hair growing strong and long!


Salmon, avocados, and pumpkin seeds are full of protein and omega-3 fatty acids which help you hair follicles to stay healthy.
Spinach, eggs, greek yogurt, and lentils are all great sources of protein which enrich your strands of hair.
Blueberries are a source of vitamin C which is important for for strong hair. Too little vitamin C leads to hair breakage."

Stop all chemical treatments.,
Do a big chop.,
Wear a weave as you transition.,
Wear your hair in protective styles as you transition.",How to Grow Your Natural Hair (Black Girls)1," The first step to transitioning to natural hair is to stop chemically relaxing or treating your hair. This will allow your hair to begin growing with its natural texture, though the hair that you have already chemically relaxed will be permanently straightened., The easiest way to transition to natural hair is to cut off all chemically relaxed hair. This will help you avoid that abrupt change in textures between the relaxed hair and your natural hair growing in. However, doing a big chop will mean sacrificing length and getting a short cut to remove the relaxed hair.Getting your hair cut at the point where your natural hair connects with the relaxed hair is the healthiest way to transition, as your hair will be especially prone to breakage if you don’t cut off your relaxed hair.
There is no way to un-straighten chemically relaxed hair. New hair growth from the roots will be your natural texture, but the other hair will be permanently straightened.

, If you want to grow out your natural hair but don’t want to sacrifice your length, you can get a weave or hair extensions as you wait for your hair to grow. The weave will conceal the radical change in your hair texture and give you the long hair that you want. When your natural hair has grown to your desired length, you can remove the weave, chop off the relaxed hair, and continue growing out your natural hair.Get the weave sewed into your hair rather than glued, as glued weaves tend to rip out hair when they are removed.

, To conceal the transition between your straightened hair and natural hair, you can also wear your hair in braids, cornrows, or other protective styles until your hair has grown long enough that you feel comfortable cutting off the relaxed hair. These hairstyles have the advantage of being low maintenance while still maintaining the length of your hair."
"
Cut it out.,
Avoid the Curling Iron.",How to Have Beautiful Relaxed African American Hair2," If you want to gain any length on your hair, don't cut it. (well trim it 1/8th inch to even out the ends but that's all)

, A curling iron is one of the most damaging instruments used on African American hair types. When a curling iron is used on your hair, the barrel cover clamps down on your hair causing a weak point. With repeated use the hair shafts eventually break along these areas made weak by the curling iron. If you want longer hair, it is imperative that you stop using a curling iron to style your hair. Curling irons make hair, weak, dry and very thin. Instead try using curlers or keeping your ends evenly trimmed and simply wearing your hair down.

"
Use a very wide toothed comb to avoid ripping or tearing your hair out at the roots.,
Drink lots of water.,
Care for your hair at night.,
Use Oil.",How to Have Beautiful Relaxed African American Hair3," Comb your hair very gently and avoid combing it frequently. Start combing at the ends and untangle those first and work your way up towards the scalp; never place your comb at the scalp and pull it through tangled hair, this will rip out your hair and cause it to be very thin.

, Drink plenty of water every day to keep your hair moisture rich from the inside. Your hair will bounce and move more easily and will not break easily or often. If you notice your hair bouncing and moving less its important to drink more water.

, Nighttime can be damaging to your hair if you sleep on any type of fabric. Traditionally it has been said to sleep on a satin scarf or pillowcase. This is the only material which will prevent your hair from drying out at night.

, Never use greases on relaxed hair. Tradition has always taught African American women to smother their hair with all types of grease in the name of beauty. The use of hair greases has lead to irreparable damage, breakage and blockage of pores. It is impossible to sustain healthy hair and scalp if you use hair greases. Your scalp naturally produces its own oils which should be enough to keep your hair healthy. If you prefer greases, just keep an eye on your hair. If your hair becomes dry, greasy, stiff or brittle it is most likely related to the use of hair greases. Although natural oils are good for the hair such as olive, coconut, jojoba and etc. They give the hair good shine and helps to rebuild damaged hair as a natural conditioner.

Put your hair up with hair ties.,
Wrap your hair in a scarf or a hair cover.,
Wear a sweatband.",How to Maintain Black Hair During Exercise1," One of the easiest and quickest ways to keep your hair looking good during a workout is to put it up in a ponytail with hair ties. You may tie your hair up with several hair ties so it is secure when you do an intense workout, such as running, an aerobic class, or interval training. Tying it back and high on your head can keep your hair away from the sweat on your body as you work out.You can also try using bobby pins as well as a hair tie to put your hair in a loose bun on the top of your head so it is out of your face and away from your sweat.;
, You can prevent your hair from getting too wet and frizzy during your workout by wrapping it in a scarf. You may use a cotton scarf to ensure your hair can breath without getting too wet. You can also try using a hair cover designed to protect your hair when you work out.You may look for a hair cover that is designed for use at the gym online or at specialty Black hair stores. These hair covers are often designed to repel moisture and release heat so your hair does not get too wet or frizzy while you exercise.

, You can keep sweat out of your hair by wearing a sweatband when you workout. You may put your hair in an updo with hair ties and then wear a sweatband for extra protection for your hair from your sweat.Look for a sweatband made of absorbent material. Make sure the sweatband sits securely around your head as you do not want it to slip or move while you are working out.

Avoid using heat on your hair.,
Steer clear of hair color.,
Spread out time between hair relaxing sessions.,
Avoid real-life stressors.,
Be gentle to your hair.,
Avoid using extensions and tight braids.",How to Grow African American Hair2," High temperatures make your hair dry and brittle, increasing the chances of breakage. If you must use heat on your hair, try to limit it to once a week at most.


Allow hair to air dry whenever possible. The heat from blow dryers can be especially damaging, as it is combined with a strong blast of air - another culprit for hair damage.
Keep use of flat irons and curling irons to a minimum. Because these can heat upwards of 400 °F (204 °C), you are literally cooking your hair.

, The chemicals in hair dye are a major cause of hair damage. Using dyes often can prevent hair growth from damage to the entire strand of hair. If possible, don’t dye your hair at all. If you must, spend at least three months between hair dye sessions.

, If you get your hair relaxed, you know how damaging it can be to your hair. Although getting your hair relaxed frequently may be tempting in order to maintain straight locks, try to wait as long as you can between sessions.


Spending at least three months between hair relaxing treatments can help aid in hair growth.
If you are able and willing, try foregoing relaxing your hair for a natural look instead. This will not only mix up your hairstyle, but increase your hair’s ability to grow faster.

, Stress has shown to have an effect on hair growth and overall thickness, so do things to make your life as anxiety-free as possible. Stay away from things that stress you out, and incorporate more things into your life that put you at peace.

, Although sleeping and daily activity can make your hair difficult to manage, don’t try to control it through power-brushing and a strong hand. Instead, be soft to your hair to ease out tangles and knots.


Brush your hair slowly. This will help to reduce the amount of breakage your strands experience. Always begin brushing from the top, and work your way down.
Use a comb or boar-bristle brush to brush your hair. Avoid using a brush that has knobs on the ends of bristles, as these can get caught in your hair and cause more damage.

, These place stress on the roots of your hair, making them more likely to break from the root.


Using weaves and fusion extensions can damage hair roots, so try not to use these if you want to grow your hair long.
Braiding your hair loosely can help protect brittle ends, but exceedingly tight braids or cornrows can break off your hair near the follicles. Use loose braids to help keep your hair protected."

Shampoo your hair once a week.,
Condition hair after shampooing.,
Co-wash your hair between washes.,
Deep-condition your hair once a week.,
Use a leave-in moisturizer daily.,
Seal your hair with oil or butter.",How to Grow Your Natural Hair (Black Girls)2," Because African hair is drier and more brittle than Asian or Caucasian hair, washing more than once or twice a week can zap the hair of the oils it needs and cause breakage. You don’t need to worry about your hair looking oily or greasy, as this won’t be a problem as long as you do a weekly wash.Try to pick a day when you have a lot of free time for wash days, since your hair routine may take a long time.
If you are trying to get long hair, try to buy a shampoo that contains biotin, as biotin can speed up hair growth.

, Always use conditioner each time you shampoo your hair. Conditioner will restore moisture to your hair and helps protect it from breaking. Make sure to heavily condition the ends of your hair, which are the oldest and most fragile sections of your hair., If you are an athlete or sweat regularly, you may feel the need to wash your hair more than once a week to remove sweat or other buildup. Instead of using a shampoo, substitute a conditioner when you wash your hair. Use the conditioner as you would a shampoo, rubbing it into your scalp and through the lengths of your hair.Co-washing is a gentle way of washing your hair but not drying it out.

, Deep conditioning is critical to healthy natural hair, especially if you are transitioning from relaxed hair. Apply a water-based deep conditioner while your hair is still wet after getting out of the shower on days that you shampoo. Divide your hair into sections to make it more manageable and spread the deep conditioner from the roots of your hair to the ends.After coating your hair with the deep conditioner, use a shower cap to cover your head for about thirty minutes. Then take off the shower cap and rinse the deep conditioner out of your hair, paying special attention to washing it out of your scalp.
Use a deep conditioner with an oil or butter base, such as coconut oil, castor oil or shea butter.

, Because African hair is quite dry and prone to breakage, it’s essential to moisturize daily on top of your weekly deep conditioning treatments. Purchase a leave-in moisturizer, trying to find product that is lightweight and won’t weigh your hair down, but is still heavily moisturizing. Begin your morning styling routine by wetting your hair using a spray bottle of water, then applying the leave-in conditioner according to its packaging.You may have to experiment with several products until you find the one that works best on your hair.

, After you apply the leave-in moisturizer, spray your hair with an oil-based spray to seal in the leave-in moisturizer. You can also simply rub coconut oil, castor oil, shea butter, or your prefered oil or butter into your hair, focusing at the tips."

Limit heat styling.,
Untangle knots when they form.,
Comb hair only when damp.,
Wear protective styles.,
Be gentle when styling your hair.,
Change up your hairstyles.",How to Grow Your Natural Hair (Black Girls)3," Heat tools like straightening irons or blowdryers damage your natural hair, so it’s best to limit your use or stop all together, especially if you are transitioning to natural hair. Your hair will be especially fragile if you have not cut off the relaxed ends, and you want to give your newly growing natural hair a healthy start.If you need to use heat, try to reduce it to only two to three times a month. Spray your hair with heat protective spray beforehand, and use the lowest heat settings possible that is still effective. Try to use a ceramic or tourmaline-ceramic flat iron, which does less damage to your hair., If you notice knots in your hair, don’t wait until after a shower to untangle them. Instead, dampen the section of hair in the sink or using a spray bottle of water, apply conditioner and oil directly to the knot, and ease it apart with your fingers. Then use a wide-toothed comb to fully undo the knot.You don’t want to wash heavily-knotted hair because the process of washing will wind even more hair around the knot and make it harder to get out.

, Combing dry natural hair causes excessive breakage, so comb your hair directly after showering while the hair is drying. Apply a small amount of leave-in conditioner or moisturizer and use a wide-toothed comb to gently comb your hair, starting at the tips and working your way up to the roots., Protective styles get their name because they keep your hair in place, minimize friction that can damage your hair, and require minimum handling so that the chances of breakage are less. Examples of protective styles include braids, cornrows, bantu knots and twists. You can keep these styles in for a few weeks up to two months before they need to be taken down.

, When you are putting your hair up in a bun or ponytail, or getting it styled in protective styles, make sure not to pull too hard on the “edges” of your hair, or the hair around your temples and at the nape of your neck. The hair in these areas is finer and more delicate and can easily get broken or ripped out., While it may be tempting to wear your hair in a bun or ponytail every day, or keep in protective styles longer than two months, doing so is bad for your hair. Be sure to take out your protective styles or weaved-in hair after a month or two, and vary up your hairstyles so that you are not doing a style that tugs at the same part of your hair. Doing so will minimize breakage and give your hair a rest."

Try eating foods rich in biotin, fatty acids, B vitamins, folic acid, niacin and protein. These foods include salmon and other fatty fish, eggs, nuts, avocados and lentils., A lot of damage can happen at nighttime when your hair rubs against your pillow, absorbing moisture from the hair and causing breakage. A solution to this problem is to use either silk or satin pillowcases, which create much less friction and do not absorb the moisture from your hair. You can also wrap your hair in a silk or satin scarf at night for the same effect."

Wash your hair after working out.,
Let it dry completely.,
Style your hair to reduce frizz.",How to Maintain Black Hair During Exercise3," Make sure you rinse your hair well and wash it with an acid-balanced shampoo as soon as you are done working out. You do not want your hair to sit with sweat and dirt in it once you have finished exercising, as this can lead to frizz. You should also apply conditioner to your hair when you wash it so it is thoroughly clean.To avoid over washing your hair, you may plan your hair appointments and washings around your workout. For example, if you know you are going to workout on Friday morning, you may wash your hair less frequently during the week and then do a major wash of your hair after your workout on Friday.

, Always let your hair dry completely before you style it. Let your hair air dry or dry it with a towel. You may also apply leave-in conditioner in your hair to keep the frizz under control.Try to avoid using a blow dryer to dry your hair, as the heat can damage it. If you do use a blow dryer, make sure you use heat protectant spray or gel on your hair before you dry it.

, African hair needs moisture and deep conditioning, especially when exposed to heat appliances like blow dryers and flat irons.

Moisturize everything but the scalp.

, Don't plop it all on top of your head. Rinse and repeat.

, Don't pull out any hair. As you comb, apply conditioner through your hair and massage the scalp (Affirm, Matrix or Motions are suggested). Put a plastic shower cap over your head so ALL of your hair is in it. Leave it on for about 30 minutes and rinse your hair out. Comb it out as you rinse ( using slightly cooler than lukewarm water adds natural shine to the hair).

, Conditioner washing is washing your hair with a lightweight moisturizing conditioner, eliminating the shampoo step which can be very drying, especially to chemically damaged hair. Many with damaged relaxed hair wash daily.

, Apply more to the ends if they are dry. Avoid applying conditioner to the scalp unless it is dry. Rinse out conditioner very well.

, Then comb out your hair (this involves a lot of combing and brushing) and work in a heat protection product. Blow dry it on WARM setting - the hot setting will dry out and damage your hair. As you dry, work in a smoothing serum. Paul Mitchell works - and brush it downwards (root to tip) with a circular brush. When you are done, separate it into four large sections (right front, left front, right back, left back and bangs if you have then).

, Repeat the above process once every week (or two). Get a trim every 3-4 months.

Choose a natural cream, such as a coconut curling cream.;
, You can have as many or as few sections as you want, but keep in mind that the more sections you create, the more extensions you will need to add. About six or so sections would be ideal.

, Use a rat-tail comb to create a clean, neat part. Clip each section out of the way before moving onto the next one.Play around with the parting. They don't all have to come from along your hairline. You can have them all start from the center of your head instead.

, You will need about 12 strands per cornrow. If you want thicker, more drastic cornrows, you will need 24 strands. Each strand should be a little thicker than the last one. Have your first set of strands laid out and ready to use.The extensions don't have to match your hair color. Feel free in use a bright color for a surprising effect.

, Take your first section and divide it into three smaller sections. Cross the left section over the middle one, then cross the right section over the middle one., Fold the thinnest kanekalon strand in half, and bring it around the back of your head. The looped part should be facing your hairline and the two tails should be hanging down the back of your head., The easiest way to do this would be to simply feed the middle section through the loop. The kanekalon strand should now be between your real hair and your scalp. Make sure that it is centered.

, Make sure that the center (folded) part of the kanekalon strand is tucked under the middle section of your braid. Add the left side of the strand to the left section of your braid, and the right side to the right section., Holding the left side of the kanekalon hair and the left section of your braid together, cross them over the middle section. Repeat this step for the right section.If you want a thicker cornrow, add another strand of kanekalon hair to the middle section after you cross the right section.

, This time, take a slightly-thicker strand than before. Tuck it under the middle strand, and add the left and right sides to the left and right sections of your braid., For a thinner, more natural braid, add the kanekalon after you cross both the left and right sections. For a thicker, more dramatic braid, add the kanekalon after every cross-over.Start with the thinner strands and work your way to the thicker ones.
Keep your stitches nice and tight. Use more curling cream to smooth down any stray hairs, if needed.

, You can regular-braid the kanekalon hair for a few more inches/centimeters if you'd like to, but leave the bottom half of the hair unbraided for now., Hold a pair of scissors parallel to the strand with the tips pointing upward. Cut into the end of the strand to thin it out. You only need to thin the bottom few inches/centimeters. This will help your braid maintain the same thickness throughout., Do a regular braid for this. Keep the stitches nice and tight. You can braid as far down as you like, but more stylists will braid all the way down to the end of the extension.If you are not braiding all the way down, cut off the excess extensions.

, Wrap a thin hair elastic a few times around the end of the braid. Tuck the tail under the elastic, then wrap the elastic a few more times. This conceals the end without having to deal with heat-sealing., You may have noticed that there are some hairs sticking out of the folded end of your braid. This is perfectly normal. Use a small pair of scissors to trim away any stray strands., This can get tiring, especially if you are doing it by yourself. Remember to take breaks, especially if your arms start to feel sore. You can use the same color of extension for each cornrow, or you can add a few colored ones for a unique look.

, Use your fingers to apply some hydrating hair cream to the fine hairs at your hairline. Smooth them down and back with a soft bristle brush."

Blot your hair to soak up the excess water and shake your hair out!",How to Condition Type 4A and 4B Natural Hair," Not all naturals respond to popular conditioning oils or creams i.e., coconut oil or Cantu Shea Butter Leave-In conditioner. There are many conditioners that contain silicones just as there are conditioners with no additives outside natural ingredients. Know what your hair responds to. This is how you will pick the best conditioner.;
, You will need a wide tooth comb (or Denman brush if you have one), your conditioner of choice, clips to section your hair, and a plastic cap.

, Under no circumstances must you run a comb through your hair without wetting it first. Type 4a and type 4b hair is very dry and you must be gentle. Wet your hair thoroughly before parting it into four sections.

, This is where the wide tooth comb comes in handy. Using your fingers is just as good as an alternative but if you are looking for a defined part use the comb. While you part your hair in four sections, pick up your clips to secure remaining sections. Leave one section of hair loose to start your conditioning.

, Squeeze as much conditioner in your hand as you see fit. Many type 4A/B natural women have porous, thick hair so the amount of conditioner you use is up to you. Massage and finger the conditioner through your hair. Take the comb (or Denman brush) and begin detangling your hair gently, starting at the ends. Once you've completely detangled this section, twist it! This will retain the moisture and save time for detangling it again when you get out the shower. Do this throughout your entire head.

, Take the plastic cap and leave it on your hair for at least 10 minutes. The hair absorbs the product more this way, giving you deeper conditioning.

, Without taking the twists out, place your head under the water as you squeeze the product out of your strands. For example, you would take your fingers and proceed to twist your hair as if you were wringing out a towel.

, You are now finished conditioning your hair. At this point your hair is detangled and completely conditioned. You can leave it as a wash and go style or do what you please! Adding a styling cream or homemade mixture at this point is ideal to keep your hair moisturized. Remember, washing your hair with just conditioner (also known as co-washing) is healthier for your hair and you can do it as often as you like. There's no worrying your hair is being stripped like when you use shampoos that contain sulfates.

Shampoo and condition your hair afterwards.",How to Take Hair Extensions Out1," Take all of your natural hair as well as any extensions and pull them together into a hair tie or big hair clip at the top of your head. There’s no point in trying to differentiate between the two types of hair so gather it all up together in one big grouping.;
, It will be too overwhelming to try and rip out all of your extensions at once, so you want to pull out separate rows of hair at a time. Start with a small section at the base of your head at the nape of your neck.Use a rat tail comb, or a comb with a long pointed end, to pull out an even section of hair.
Start at the bottom of your head and gradually let down your ponytail so you can keep track of where you’ve already removed extensions.

, Your extensions will be pulled snug against your scalp with a thread. Lightly run your fingertips along the ridge of the braid or seam where the extension was sewn to find the end. Use needle nose scissors or manicure scissors to isolate the thread from your hair and cut it.Use a mirror to find the end of the thread or ask a friend to locate it so you cut the thread and not your natural hair.
You may still end up cutting some of your natural hair out if it has grown out around the seam.Be careful and use the end of your scissors to cut the thread. This will help keep you from cutting too much of your hair.
If you don’t mind cutting a little of your natural hair, you use the scissors to clip away some of your natural hair to help expose the thread.

, Use both hands to gently pull the extension away from your scalp. One hand should hold your natural hair roots to your scalp in order to prevent breaking or damaging your hair. With your other hand, firmly grasp the extension thread and lightly pull it in the opposite direction to unravel the sewing.


Work your fingernails or a thin object like a nail file to wiggle in between the braid to help loosen the seam.
You may need to cut another section of the thread if there are tangles of matting from your natural hair growing around the extension seam.

, Some extensions have threads that can be coated with a salon product that breaks down threads without damaging your natural hair. Spray a section of weave or extension thread with the solution and let it sit for a few minutes.Work from the bottom of your head to the top and use a wide toothed comb to pull any debris out of your hair when you’re finished.

, Gradually pull out a little of your ponytail to work on individual sections of your hair. Go slowly so that you don’t miss any pieces of weave or extensions that may be hidden in your natural hair. It’s better to be patient than to find a chunk of hair hanging by a thread later.


If you have extension pieces that are not damaged or ragged, set them aside. They may be able to be reused another time.

, Once you’re finished use a wide toothed comb to make sure that you have removed all artificial hair or materials, Comb from the top to the bottom of your hair and go from one side of your head to the other. Spray hair detangling solution on any tangles or pieces that are proving to be difficult to remove.

, Your hair needs some time to heal itself after the stress of artificial products. Wash your hair with a clarifying shampoo and then use a deep conditioner to help put nutrients back into your hair and scalp.Wait at least two weeks before putting more extensions in your hair to let your roots recover.As you wash your hair, be on the lookout for any extension remnants that may have slipped through your notice.

Decide if you want human hair or not.,
Consider synthetic hair instead.,
Choose a color.,
Calculate how much hair you need.,
Consider how you'll wear your hair.,
Wash and condition the hair.,
Create a part for the extension.",How to Sew in Hair Extensions1," There are two kinds of extensions: human hair and synthetic hair. Human hair is the most popular type for extensions; it's easy to look after (treat it the way you would your own hair) and essentially undetectable when properly put in place. Human hair extensions can be washed and styled like your natural hair. You can use straightening irons and curling irons or tongs on human hair and even dye it if you'd like.


Human hair extensions do not produce their own oil. Thus, they tend to be drier, frizzier, and more prone to damage. They need to be treated delicately.
Human hair is more expensive than synthetic hair and cost can run in the hundreds of dollars. Cost does not always indicate quality; however, so be sure to look and feel carefully.
Virgin hair extensions contain hair that has not been treated with chemicals or dye. They have the cuticle intact. They appear very natural. They are very expensive, however.
The ethnicity of the donor can affect the texture, volume, curl, and ability the style. For example, European hair tends to be thinner, but you can find virgin hair in natural red or blonde tones. Indian hair is much thicker, and it is great if you want a silky straight style.;
, If you're looking to add thickness, synthetic is a great way to go because it creates more volume. Synthetic hair may come already styled. Synthetic hair is also cheaper than natural human hair. That said, most synthetic hair cannot be washed. You cannot straighten or curl synthetic hair with most hot tools without ruining the hair., Unless you intentionally want extensions in a fun color such as pink, blue or purple, choose a color that most closely matches your own hair color. If you can't decide between two shades, go with the lighter one.


It can be difficult to find an exact match to your color, so if you're buying human hair, think about bringing it to your stylist to have it dyed to match your own hair color.

, The amount of hair you'll need depends on the thickness of your own hair and how much length and/or fullness you want to add.


If adding fullness only and your own hair is similar to the length of the extensions, purchase two to four ounces of hair.
If your own hair is much shorter than the length of the extensions you want, you'll need about six to eight ounces of hair to get a full, natural look.
As a general guideline, the longer the length of the extension, the more hair you'll need for a full look.

, Think about hairstyles and decide how you want your hair to fall after you have the extensions in place. This is important, as the way the hair is parted and how the extensions are placed dictates how the hairstyle will fall when it is finished.

, Dry your hair completely with a blow dryer and comb through it to ensure there are no knots or snarls.

, Part your hair at the point(s) on the head where you want to add the extension. For example, if you're sewing in an extension to add length, create a part that goes from temple to temple and/ or one that goes from the top of the left ear and across the head to the top of the right ear.









Use a mirror to help you see as you work. Since this can be extremely difficult to do on your own, you may want to ask a friend or stylist for help.
Try to get the line as even as you can. Once you do, comb up the hair above the part line and clip it into place.
Part the hair again just a tiny bit underneath your first part. You want to create a very thin ""line"" of hair that you'll use to make your cornrow. Take the hair below your cornrow part and secure it with a ponytail holder.

The cornrow braid will serve as the ""anchor"" on which the extension will be sewn.

Pull your hair together with a large clip or hair band.,
Untie a section of your hair starting at the nape of your neck.,
Crimp the bonds with pliers to loosen and break them.,
Rub oil on the keratin bonds.,
Heat the bonds with a hair dryer.,
Pull your natural hair away from the bond.,
Comb your hair with a wide toothed comb and then a fine toothed comb.,
Wash and treat your natural hair.",How to Take Hair Extensions Out2," A ponytail will help keep you organized as you work on finding each keratin bond. Some bonds may be obvious and some may be more difficult to find so you want to work on a small piece of your scalp at a time to avoid missing anything.

, Use your index finger or the thin end of a salon comb to pull out an even row of hair at the bottom of your head. If you encounter any tangles, pull out a little more hair from your ponytail so you can work on the larger section all together.Don't try to remove several hair extensions at once. You'll be able to remove hair extensions much more easily and safely if you work slowly and diligently.

, Isolate one keratin bond and use needle nose pliers to squeeze the bond. The bond will crack when enough force is applied and it will be easier to release your natural hair from it. After the first crack, move the pliers around the bond and squeeze a different section of it to weaken more of the bond.Crush the bond as many times as needed to loosen its grip on your natural hair.
Lightly twist the pliers if you have stubborn bonds but be careful not to pull hair out of your scalp.
After removing all of your extensions, some of the cracked bond may still be in your hand if it shattered, so use a fine toothed comb to weed out any debris.Simply brushing your hair will not help to remove keratin bonds. Instead, it will damage your natural hair and roots.

, Use your fingertips and rub any combination of olive, coconut, baby, or almond oil into the cracks of the bonds you created with the pliers. Let the oil seep in and sit for 10-15 minutes. The oil will break down the keratin and allow you to pull or gently comb the extensions out.Instead of a household oil, use a specifically designed keratin bond remover from a salon or beauty supply store.
A small amount of acetone or other alcohol-based gel on the bond can help as well. Just use a small dab so that you don’t damage your scalp with too much alcohol.

, To help speed up the chemical process of applying oil to the bonds, blow dry your hair on a low setting. Anywhere from 5 to 15 minutes will be helpful as heat makes bonds more malleable and easy to slip off.

, Keep in mind that as you pull on the keratin bonds, you want to keep your natural hair from being pulled with the keratin bond. Hold your scalp and the base of your roots with one hand while you lightly pull the bond with the other hand. If you feel too much of a pull on your scalp, try re-cracking the bonds and applying more oil., Use a combination or combs or brushes to help pick out any leftover bonds or extension leftovers. Overall, combs work better than brushes since they have stiffer teeth but a metal brush can also work as well., Take a shower and use a clarifying shampoo and deep conditioner to help restore your hair, roots, and scalp. Clarifying shampoos will help remove the excess olive oil as well as remaining glue from the weave while the conditioner replenishes any nutrients a harsh alcohol or chemical may have stripped away.

Separate your hair into workable sections.,
Let oil sit on a section of glue or tape for 15 minutes.,
Wrap your hair in a towel and conditioner to break down remaining glue.,
Repeat to get all of the glue out.",How to Take Hair Extensions Out3," Use a hair clip or tie to pull all of your hair together except for one section. Find the first and closest section of artificial hair at the bottom of your head. You want to start at the bottom and work your way up so you know where you’ve already removed extensions.

, Oil helps break up any chemical bonds from glue or tape. Use either almond oil, coconut oil, baby oil, olive oil, or a hair salon product specifically for removing extensions. Dab or gently rub the oil into the extension bond and wait for the bond to break down.The oil needs time to seep into the bonds to break them down. Wait at least 15 minutes or even more time for thick tape or glue bonds.Make sure you set aside time to remove your extensions. You don’t want to be caught off guard with half a head of fake hair that you didn’t have time to finish removing.

, Rinse your hair thoroughly and then coat your entire head in conditioner. Work the conditioner into your roots and the tape or glue bonds. Wrap your head in a towel and wait 20 minutes. After unwrapping, use a wide toothed comb to gently comb out your extensions.


This can help remove stubborn bonds if using oil did not remove your extensions completely.
Comb from the tips of your hair and work your way up to the roots so that you don’t tangle you natural and fake hair together, which makes combing out the fake hair more difficult and painful.

, For each section, it may take several repetitions of applying oil or wrapping your hair in a towel to remove all of the glue. Work through each section of hair entirely before letting down another section of your from your ponytail or hair clip. Wash your hair with a clarifying shampoo and nourishing conditioner afterwards.

Remove one clip at a time.,
Take out temporary extensions before sleeping or showering.,
Spritz hair with water to release difficult tangles.",How to Take Hair Extensions Out4," Squeeze the clip and gently pull it away from your natural hair. Hold your natural hair against your scalp to prevent pulling or stressing your roots. Be careful not to let the clip snap on your fingers if the teeth are sharp.Work in sections around your head if you have more than one clip in.
When reapplying clip-in extensions, be sure to reposition them in different spots on your head. This will allow your scalp to relax from any wear and tear.

, Remove clip-in extensions before bed because they will cause your scalp discomfort, even on the softest pillow. Also, if your temporary extensions cannot be washed with regular shampoo or conditioner like natural hair, always be sure to take them out before showering.Lay your extensions out on a towel overnight or hang them up so that they stay straight.
Comb your fake hair once it’s removed to prevent any tangling in storage.

, Moisture can help detangle any chunks of matted hair that have worked their way around clip-in extensions. Use a combination of a wide toothed comb and a spray bottle of water or a hair detangling product to coax the clips out.


If your temporary extensions cannot get wet, do not dampen them.

Start at one side of the head.,
Grab three small, fairly equal size amounts of hair from the thin section of hair you've reserved for the cornrow.,
Begin by crossing the hair in your right hand underneath the hair in your center section.,
Secure the ends.",How to Sew in Hair Extensions2," Do not start all the way at the end if the person plans to wear her hair up or in a ponytail; otherwise, the extensions will show. Begin about 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) in.








, Hold one in your right hand, one in your left and hold the center strand of hair in whatever hand feels comfortable.









Do not start with too much hair. Keep the strand sections small so that the finished braid isn't bulky and doesn't create a ""bump"" under the extensions.
If the cornrow is too thick, the hair could have trouble drying completely when you wash it and could become moldy.

, Then cross the hair in your left hand underneath the hair that's now in the center.









Repeat this criss-cross pattern along the part line of the hair. As you move, pick up additional hair from the head and add it to the center section so that you're creating one, continuous cornrow braid.

You can either add hair to the center section or to the left- and right-hand sections as you braid. Just be consistent.
Make your cornrow as tight as you can without causing pain.



, When you've reached the end of your part and you've used all the sectioned hair to create your cornrow, secure the end of the cornrow braid with a hair elastic or rubber band.









While braiding your hair, work towards the center of the head, beginning at the opposite side of the hairline and meeting in the middle. If you do this, the tail braid will fall down the center of the head instead of sticking out on one side.

Make a knot.,
Continue sewing.,
End the row.,
Cut if necessary.",How to Sew in Hair Extensions3," Cut a piece of extension thread about 48 inches (121.9 cm) long and thread one end through the eye of a curved needle. Pull the thread through until there is an equal amount on both sides. You're going to be working with a double thread. Tie the two loose ends together with a secure knot.








, A single hair extension is also known as a weft. If you want to create extra fullness, simply fold your weft in half. Take your needle and insert it through the unfolded edge of the weft so that it's held together along the unfolded size.









You may need to trim the weft to the correct width. It should match the length of the braid. If you are folding it over, it needs to be double the length of the braid.

, With the weft now attached to your needle and thread, insert your needle underneath the cornrow and bring it up. The curved needle should make this easy, and the point of the needle should now be pointing back at you.








, Take the needle (the point is facing you) and insert it into the front of the extension right below the seam, which is called the track. If you're working with a folded weft, be sure your needle goes under both tracks. Hold the hair extension up and try to cover the cornrow with it. Insert the needle back under the cornrow and pull the thread gently, leaving a loop.









If your cornrow extended beyond your part, simply fold it back onto the head as you attach the extension.

, Once you bring your needle and thread up from behind your cornrow, insert the needle through the loop you left at the end of your last stitch and pull the thread through. Pull firmly to attach the extension in place securely.








, Insert the needle back underneath the track of your extension about a 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) away from your last stitch. Slide the needle under the cornrow, leave a loop and bring the needle and thread through the loop to secure your extension. Continue sewing your extension along the part line keeping your stitches neat and a uniform 1/2-inch distance apart.








, When you're one stitch away from the end of your extension, insert the needle through the front of the extension and tack the two folded ends to one another. Do not go under the cornrow again. Make two or three stitches to fold the folded end onto itself. Then insert your needle through one of the stitches, pull through to create a loop and insert your needle through the loop to make a knot. Knot the end two or three times for extra security. Trim the edges of the leftover thread on both ends of the extension.








, Depending on how you wear your hair, you may need to get a hair cut to create a new style or to help your extensions blend even more seamlessly into your own hair.

Wash with some care.,
Be smart with styling products.,
Sleep smart.,
Protect your hair when swimming.",How to Sew in Hair Extensions4," You can absolutely wash your hair extensions, but it pays to take a little extra care. Be sure to wash and condition from top to bottom rather than washing your hair upside down or piling it up on top of your head. Put shampoo/conditioner in your hands and run hair through your palms. Avoid washing hair upside down in the sink or scrunching on top of your head.


Choose hydrating or moisture-replenishing shampoos and conditioners. A leave-in spray conditioner is great, especially on ends.
Be extremely careful when combing or brushing hair. Work from the ends slowly toward the scalp, gently removing tangles. Do not yank, scrub, or rub the hair.

, You can use mouse, gel and hairspray on your extensions as long as those products are alcohol-free. It's best to stay away from shines, sheens or oils.

, At bedtime, braid hair into two side braids or secure in a loose ponytail to prevent tangling. If you've curled your hair, try sleeping on a satin pillow to help keep your curls in place.

, Salt water and chlorinated water are very drying to hair and can cause major color fading or discoloration. If you're going into the water, put on a swim cap first.

",How to Sew Hair Extensions to a Clip,"


Make sure the weft is similar to your own hair's texture. Buying an extension that is the color you desire also is important if you do not plan to dye the weft.
Choose an appropriate length, too. Although you can cut the weft to the length you desire, it's easier to just purchase one that is the length you prefer.;
, Combing through the hair weft first prevents problems with snarls as you work with the hair.

, Sew or cut a piece of hair to match the width of your weft clip. Start at the top of the hair weft and continue to cut down the length of the hair.


Your packages of weft clips can contain many different width sizes to work with. You can create a customized look by combining several weft clips together to make a wider hair extension. For example, use 4 weft clips for an 8-inch (20 cm) piece of hair, 3 weft clips for a 5- or 6-inch (13 or 15 cm) section, and 2 for a 2-1/2-inch (6.5 cm) section.

, The front of the clip should face you. You'll know you have it right if the clip is convex to the surface and you can see a bar across the comb.

,, Beading thread is best, but you can also double up regular cotton thread.

, Knot the thread securely to the weft clip when you are finished.

, Spread it out over a drop cloth or old magazine. You can use regular hair dye that you can buy at a mass retail outlet or beauty supply store.

, You can do the whole piece or just apply strips of color throughout. Let the color sit on the hair weft for 15 to 20 minutes.

, Home haircut kits often come with the type of scissors barbers normally use, which are long, thin, and pointed. These scissors are fine for cutting someone else’s hair, but you may find them unwieldy to cut your own hair with. Instead, try using shorter-blade scissors,such as the following:


Mustache scissors
Cuticle scissors
Children’s scissors
Whatever type of scissors you choose, be sure the blades are sharp so they cut your hair cleanly., The comb will be used to part and straighten your hair, eliminating tangles that will make it difficult to get the cut you want. A long comb of the kind barbers use instead of a shorter pocket comb is recommended.If you can’t find this kind of comb, you can use a pocket comb for the actual combing and your fingers to grab your hair when cutting it.

, Although old-style barbers typically cut dry hair, modern stylists usually find it easier to work with wet hair when cutting, particularly when cutting thick hair. You can do one of two things:


Wash your hair, or at least wet it thoroughly in the shower. Let it dry to the point of dampness before cutting.
Wet your hair as you go, using a spray bottle., You’ll want to be able to see what you’re doing as much as possible. A large-sized mirror on your bathroom wall or medicine cabinet would help you see what you’re cutting in front or on the sides.


If possible, set up a second mirror so you can see the back of your head, either hanging from the wall opposite or as a hand mirror held by an assistant.

, Run the comb back through your hair at the outside edge of each eyebrow to make the part, then comb the hair between the part and the ear down. Do this on both sides. This sections off the hair on the top of your head.

,,, This will set the limit for your scissors to cut. The further away from your head you slide the comb or your fingers, the less hair will be cut.

, Cutting with the blades perpendicular to the comb removes a volume of hair without damage, as long as the comb is between the tips of the blades and your scalp.


Every few cuts, stop and look at your progress. If something doesn’t look even, go back and cut a little more until it is.

, Cut the hair the same way you did around your ears: Lift the hair away from your scalp with the comb and cut perpendicular to the comb with the scissors. Stop every few cuts to check your work and correct any errors.

, Use the comb or your fingers to raise the hair on top of your head straight up and cut off from 1/4 to 1/2 inch (6.35 to 12.7 mm). Work slowly and carefully, as you did when cutting the sides.


Cuts to the hair on top of your head are more noticeable than cuts to the hair on the sides of your head. A few notches on the side of your head can be taken as an attempt at a punk look, while a few notches on the top can be taken as the start of male pattern baldness.

, After trimming the sides and top, the only two parts you have left to tackle are your sideburns and the back of your head.


You can trim your sideburns with either a safety razor or electric shaver with a pop-out trimmer. If you want long sideburns, trim from the bottom of your ears; if shorter, you can use the depression below your cheekbone or the tragus (the thick flap of skin at the front of the ear) to determine where the bottoms of your sideburns should be. Place your fingers underneath each sideburn to check that they’re even.
You can use a beard trimmer or edging wand to cut the “wings” that form on the back of your neck as your hair grows there. You want to start with a grazing cut at the top of the neckline, then cut progressively closer as you work toward the nape of the neck. (This is where you want to have a second mirror available to see what you’re doing.) "

, African hair loves nothing more than pure water itself. With natural hair, water is its best ally. Natural hair can be washed daily to hold the most moisture. However, be careful about the shampoo. Shampoo should be limited because of its drying effects. Others limit shampooing to 1-4 times per month. There are enough cleaning agents in conditioner that can sufficiently clean the hair.

Examine the haircut.",How to Cut a Fade Haircut," Fade haircuts are typically short, even buzzed, near the nape of the neck. The hair gradually gets longer on the back and sides of the head, and it's longest at the top of the head. Any type of gradual transition from short to long is considered a fade, so before you begin, it's important to know how short you want the shortest part, and how long the longest part should be. Consider these distinctive fade haircut styles:


A Caesar fade: The Caesar fade is cut very short in the back and on the sides with a slightly greater length on top. The hair on top is combed forward, rather than parted, and the short bangs are typically swept to the side.
A high and tight: A high and tight haircut is virtually shaved on the sides and in the back, with a short cap of buzzed hair on top. It's a popular military style.
A Princeton: This type of haircut is an inch or two long on top with a gradual fade to a shorter length in the back and on the sides.
A fauxhawk: This cut is like a Princeton, but with a sharper fade. The top is quite long and the back and sides are buzzed or shaved.;
, Everyone has a different preference for where the hair should fade from longer to shorter. The fade typically starts at the ears and becomes shorter down to the neck. Fading at the ears flatters most head shapes, but you should take the following factors into account to personalize the cut:









If the person's hair is finer in some places than in others, the fade should begin where the hair texture changes (as long as that's close to the ears). This will make it easier to created a blended look.
If the person has a cowlick that would make it difficult to fade at a certain point on the head, plan to start the fade just above or below it.

, Using clippers for a close cut results in an even, neat effect that's more difficult to attain with scissors. Using a different guard setting for each length - #3 for the top, #2 for the sides, and #1 for the neck area - is the best way to create a high and tight or another shorter style. This method is often called the 1-2-3 method.








, Set the clippers to the #3 guard length and buzz the entire head, including the top, sides and back, so that each part of the hair is a uniform length. Work against the grain of the hair to achieve an even cut.








, Beginning in the back, cut the hair in vertical strokes from the neck toward the crown, stopping just short of the crown so that the hair on top of the head is left long.









As you near the crown with each stroke, pull back a bit so that the hair lengths fade together smoothly. Do the same on the sides of the head, taking care to pull back at the same height around the head.
Blend any uneven lines by going back over them with the #2 guard.

, Start at the nape of the neck and work in upward strokes toward the middle of the back of the head. Pull back a bit to blend the shorter hair with the longer hair. Continue around the head, pulling back at the same height in each area.








, If there are any spots that are uneven, too short or too long, go back over them with the appropriate clipper guard. Shave the hair from the neck to create neat edge at the bottom of the hairline.








, More complicated fade haircuts like the Caesar and the Princeton require the use of more than one tool. The concept is the same - longer on top, shorter on the sides and in the back - but the method for achieving longer fade looks is completely different.









Wetting longer hair may makes it easier to work with. Have the person whose hair you are cutting shampoo his or her hair and pat it dry with a towel before you get started.

, This time start by trimming the bottom of the hair, starting at the nape of the neck and moving upward. Use a comb to lift sections of hair between your forefinger and middle finger. Your fingers should be aligned vertically with the head. Use the scissors to trim the portion of hair sticking out from between your fingers. Continue gathering small sections of hair and trimming them to the same length until the back of the hair has been trimmed from the nape of the neck to just below the ears.









If the person whose hair you are cutting wants buzzed hair at the bottom of the fade, use the #3 guard on the clippers to trim the hair from the nape of the neck to just below the ears and the line between them around the back of the head. Use upward strokes and pull back gradually just before you reach the ear line.

, Using the same method you used to gather sections of hair between your fingers and cut the hair protruding from them, work around the sides of the head and the area above the ear line on the back of the head. This time, side your fingers away from the head slightly so that less hair protrudes from them.









Angle the scissors slightly so that they follow the slant of the head. Pointing the tips of the scissors toward the head, rather than slightly away, will result in a choppy-looking cut.
When you're finished with the second part of the fade, examine the hair. It should be shorter around the neck and up to the ear line, and slightly longer above the ear line and just below the crown. Correct any spots that look choppy by carefully trimming sections of hair with the scissors, always angled to follow the slant of the head.

, Lift sections of hair straight up from the top of the head so that the tips of the hair protrude from between your forefinger and middle finger. Snip the tips of the hair with the scissors. Continue trimming the hair at the top of the head in this fashion until you've trimmed it all to the same length.









Examine the fade from the crown area to the back of the head. Is the fade smooth? If not, use the scissors to even things out. Remember to hold your fingers vertically, rather than horizontally, to prevent a staircase effect.
Check out the front of the hair. Are the bangs trimmed to the correct length? Take extra care to trim the bangs and sideburns neatly.

, Comb the hair, then have the person check out the sides and back to make sure he or she is happy with the way it turned out. If necessary, wet the hair again and use the scissors to even it out in places where it looks choppy.

What they probably all have in common is a few chemicals that actually make dry, rough hair worse: sulfates. Buy shampoo that is completely free of this chemical.









Commercial shampoos are made with sulfates because they act as an effective cleanser. They strip the hair of its natural oils to give it that ""squeaky clean"" quality. The problem is they make hair too clean, and it damages the hair. In fact, the same chemicals are used in dishwashing and laundry detergents.
Health food stores and natural beauty product stores sell shampoos without sulfates. Look for a bottle labeled ""sulfate-free"" to be extra sure it doesn't contain the chemical.
Some people with curly hair choose to forego using shampoo entirely. They find that their dry hair doesn't need to have its natural oils washed away, and water alone does the trick for washing out dirt.;
, Since sulfates wash the oils away from out hair, conditioners resupply moisture and shine by adding silicones to the mix. The problem is that silicones build up in the hair over time and cause it to start looking dry and dull. Buy a new conditioner that doesn't contain silicones; you may see results the first time you use it.









Hair balms, creams, gels, and other products also often contain silicones. Examine all of your products and toss or donate the ones that have ingredients that could be harmful to your hair.

, Trimming away the split ends and other damaged sections of hair can go a long way toward making it look and feel healthy again. Get rid of the damage caused by your old shampoo and conditioner products. It's time to start fresh with a new routine.








, Now that you aren't putting sulfates and silicones in your hair, you don't need to wash it every day. In fact, washing your hair that often can really dry it out, increasing volume and frizz. To keep your hair manageable and healthy, wash it two or three times a week.








, Have you been washing your hair with hot water for years and years? High temperatures can really do a number on hair that's already rough and dry; the hot water causes the hair shaft to get frayed. Instead, go as cold as you can stand. When your hair is dry, it'll look sleek and shiny.









If you hate taking cold showers (who doesn't) try washing your hair separately, in the sink. That way you can use ice-cold water without getting chilled.

, Here's the routine you want to avoid: roughly toweling your hair, violently brushing out tangles, then blasting it with the hair dryer. Hair that is already dry does not respond well to this rough treatment. Instead, use the following routine to dry your hair:









Pat it dry with a soft towel. Don't wring it out or twist it up in the towel; gently squeeze out the excess water, then pat it dry.
Apply leave-in conditioner or anti-frizz serum. Make sure it's free of silicones. Run some through your hair with your fingers while it's still damp, and use a wide-toothed comb to gently work out any tangles.
Let your hair finish air drying. Put away the hair dryer and let it dry the natural way. It'll take longer, but after a few weeks your hair will regain its natural health and shine.

, Blow drying, flat ironing and curling your hair every day, or even a few times a week, makes for a lot of long-term damage. Try to adopt a styling routine that makes the most of your air-dried hair.









When you do want to dry your hair, choose a cooler setting on the hair dryer and use a diffuser.
If you want to curl your hair, try curling it without heat.

, Getting your hair trimmed and shaped every few months will keep it looking fresh and healthy. Just make sure your stylist knows not to use shampoo and conditioner with sulfates or silicones, and ask her to use a cooler hair dryer setting and employ the diffuser when you're getting your hair styled.








, If your hair is consistently dull and rough, you may not be getting the nutrients you need to keep it healthy.Incorporate more of the following foods into your diet:









Fish, avocados, and nuts that contain omega-3 fatty acids. These are essential to hair and nail health.
Fruits and vegetables with vitamin E and A, such as spinach, kale, carrots, and sweet potatoes.

, Dehydration is another cause of dull, dry hair. Drink at least 8 glasses of water a day to restore your hair's shine and vibrancy.

Take a shower.,
Squeeze a few drops of eucalyptus oil into the palm of your hand.,
Work the oil into your beard.,
Leave the oil in for at least half an hour.,
Comb your beard.,
Dilute the eucalyptus oil with a carrier oil.,
Apply less oil.,
Rinse the oil out after use.,
Look for products containing eucalyptus oil.,
Make your own beard oil at home.,
Condition your beard with eucalyptus oil regularly.",How to Use Eucalyptus Oil for Your Beard," The best time to use a beard oil is when your skin and hair are still damp. Start by climbing into a warm shower and cleaning your beard thoroughly with shampoo. The heat will help open up your pores, allowing you to extract more benefit from the eucalyptus oil.Your facial hair should be damp, not soaking wet. Be sure to towel off beforehand.
If you’re between showers, just wash your face with warm water to open things up before you begin applying the oil.;
, For shorter, newer beard growth, 2-3 drops should be enough. For longer beards, use a dime-sized dab to ensure maximum coverage. Rub the oil between the palms of both hands.Remember: less is more. Essential oils are very potent, so you’ll only need to use a small amount., Stroke the hair from root to tip using the length of your hand. Massage the oil directly into your skin with your fingertips—this is where its unique properties will do the most good. Use additional drops as needed to cover areas where growth is the thickest.Use your fingers or a beard comb to spread the oil deep into the inner reaches of your beard.
You may experience a cool, tingling sensation when undiluted oil comes into contact with your skin.

, As the oil sits on your face and hair, it will begin to infiltrate into the pores and follicles, nourishing them deep down. In the meantime, avoid scratching, wiping or pulling at your face. At around the thirty minute mark, you can either pat your beard with a dry towel to remove excess oil or leave it and go about your day.With the exception of those with sensitive skin, eucalyptus oil is mild and safe to use topically without having to be rinsed clean afterwards.
Feel free to leave the oil in until your next shower.

, Use a fine-tooth comb (or better yet, a specialized beard comb) to brush out your facial hair. This will give your beard a softer, fuller texture and appearance while also helping to better distribute the oil within. Afterwards, your beard will look and feel better than ever.Like your head hair, your facial hair needs to be groomed regularly in order to stay healthy.A basic hairbrush will also work for detangling and styling longer beards.

, While it is wholly natural and safe to use, eucalyptus oil can be be a mild irritant to people who suffer from sensitive skin. To remedy this, add a few drops of eucalyptus oil to roughly an ounce of a non-irritating oil like olive, coconut or sesame oil. You can then enjoy the benefits of the eucalyptus oil without the uncomfortable side effects.Essential oils like eucalyptus and are astringent, meaning they enhance the tightness and firmness of skin, but may cause redness, stinging or itchiness in high concentrations.
Oils like olive and coconut are also known for their ability to moisturize skin and hair, making the mixture doubly effective., Rather than saturating your beard with excessive oil, use a conservative amount and focus on spreading the oil more evenly throughout your facial hair. Take a few extra minutes to stroke and comb your beard with your fingers until the hair is covered with a light coating of oil. Use more oil only as needed.For better coverage, work single drops of oil through one section of your beard at a time.
Your beard should not glisten or feel matted or heavy after you’ve treated it with oil., After half an hour has elapsed, splash some cool water over the lower half of your face to remove oil lingering on the skin. If necessary, scrub your beard again using a mild conditioning soap approved for facial hair. You won’t have to worry about washing away the oil, as it will have already been absorbed into the follicles.Dry your beard and face with a towel. Leaving your skin damp for too long can cause irritation to worsen.
Cold water will help your pores contract, preventing other possible irritants from getting in.

, Many packaged beard oils and conditioners list eucalyptus oil as a primary ingredient. You don’t have to limit yourself to just oils, either. There is also a wide range of shampoos, conditioners, pomades and waxes available that include essential oils.With frequent use, these products can add smooth luster to your beard while keeping it looking thick and full.Most products are made up of a combination of oils, each formulated to promote a specific set of attributes.
Trade in products that use harsh chemicals for more wholesome essential oils.

, Stir 15 to 30 drops of eucalyptus oil into your carrier oil of choice. Place the homemade oil mixture into a jar or squirt bottle and store it in the bathroom where you shower for ease of application.In addition to eucalyptus oil, you can include other essential oils in your own proprietary blend. Argan oil, for instance, can strengthen individual hair follicles, while tea tree oil relieves itch and grapeseed and jojoba oils soften and hydrate.For a more soothing beard oil that will feed and deep-conditioner your facial hair, try adding a few ounces of coconut oil to eucalyptus, argan and tea tree oil., Get in the habit of rubbing a few drops of eucalyptus oil into your beard after every shower. Essential oils are gentle enough to be used as part of your daily hygiene routine, and they’ll provide benefits that most shampoos and conditioners won’t.Stocking up on a ready supply of eucalyptus oil will keep you from running out after a couple short weeks.

This makes them more receptive to treatment and styling., Use a beard shampoo if you have it. Otherwise, you can get away with using a face wash, as long as it’s not too harsh (if it’s made for dealing with acne, don’t use it for your beard). In either case, use a small amount, and rub it gently into your beard so it lathers. Massage the product into your skin and rinse well., Dry off your beard right after you get out of the shower. Don’t be too rough with the towel, or you might rip out some hairs and end up with a less than full looking beard. It doesn’t need to be bone dry, but it shouldn’t be drenched either., While the two products have a similar purpose, they shouldn’t be used interchangeably. Balm allows you to sculpt and style your beard in a way that oil can’t, and so is usually better for longer beards. Balm has less of a sheen than beard oil as well, resulting in a more toned-down look.

Beard oil is better for daily upkeep, but won’t work as well on longer beards, since it lacks a balm’s sculpting power., While different brands of beard pomade will have their own special ingredients, they’re always either water or petroleum-based. Avoid the water-based balms, since they tend to be runnier, especially if exposed to liquid after application., Many pomades have a distinct scent, usually due to the unique combination of ingredients used. They usually include essential oils from different sources, and some will have strong smelling ingredients like coffee or citrus. Try to find a shop that will allow you to smell samples, so you know you’re choosing a smell that suits you.

If you have sensitive skin, go for unscented beard pomades to limit the chances of an allergic reaction.

, Use your fingertip to scoop out some pomade from its container. Don’t use too much pomade, since this can clog your pores.

Your fingers should be clean before applying beard pomade, otherwise any residue on your hands could end up in your pomade and in your beard.
A fingertip sized amount f beard balm is usually what you’ll need. However, depending on a number of factors, such as the thickness and length of your beard, you may need a less or more balm. You’ll find the right amount of balm to use through trial and error., Using beard pomade is very similar to using hair gel. Make sure it’s well spread out over the palms of your hands and between your fingertips. This will give you more control when you apply the product, ensuring it covers your beard evenly., Much like applying hair gel or pomade, you want to use your fingers much like a comb, running them through your beard. Do this from multiple angles to ensure the balm is evenly distributed throughout the beard.

Massage the balm into your skin as well; this will help keep your beard lush and healthy.., It’s possible to get overzealous with your balm and apply just a bit too much. You’ll know this is the case if your beard is looking extra shiny and greasy. Unfortunately, you’ll need to fully rinse your beard and start over, this time using a bit less balm., While not strictly necessary, this step will give your beard more fullness and help you apply the balm more evenly throughout your facial hair. The brush will help straighten out your beard hairs and coat them with balm evenly. The comb will give you more control over your beard, letting you sculpt and shape it."

, Do the same thing to the other side, using your fingers and the clamps to create waves all the way to the top of your ear.








, Your hair should completely dry in the clamps. Don't take them out while your hair is still wet, or the waves will fall out.

, The finger wave is typically only done to either side of the front of the hair. The rest of your hair should also be styled to create a polished look. Choose one of these options:









If you have long hair, create soft curls. After you've put the clamps in and while your hair is still damp, roll the rest of your hair up in curlers.

Do a bob. If your hair is short, you can curl the rest of it under using a few large curlers.

Make a chignon. This is a pretty way to style your hair, too.

, Gently un-clamp them to reveal your new finger waves. If your hair is totally dry, they should stay in place.









If you put curlers in your hair, take those out as well.
Don't comb your hair or the waves will get loose.

, Make sure your look stays in place by using hairspray to secure it. Spray the front and sides of your hair.








, Do 30s-style makeup, and put on a 30s-style outfit. Your look is now complete.

",How to Straighten Wavy Hair," To straighten your hair, you'll be using a flat iron to apply heat to take out the waves in your hair. You should consider using a ceramic iron, as non-ceramic ones can damage your hair more easily or cause it to revert back to normal.Including your flat iron, you'll also need:


Flat iron
Hair clips or ties
Hair spray (optional)
Hair straightening product (cream, mousse, etc.)
Heat protectant
Volumizer (optional);
, Flat irons come in many varieties and price ranges. You might have a simple flat iron with only high and low settings, or a space-age iron with a digital display for temperature. Temperature variable flat irons, where you can more precisely adjust the temperature, are an investment you will not regret, as these allow you to apply the right heat setting to your hair with greater accuracy, yielding better results.Flat irons come in different sizes for different purposes:½"" Flat Iron: pixie cuts and bangs1"" Flat Iron: short and fine hair1¼ Flat Iron: shoulder length and/or medium thick hair1½"" Flat Iron: thick, coarse, curly hair shoulder length or longer2"" Flat Iron: very long, very thick hair, Your hair should be clean before straightening to prevent oil and dirt from interfering with the process. Use a gentle shampoo while bathing to clean your hair, and consider using a conditioner intended for smoothing and detangling to make your hair more manageable.Use a towel to remove as much excess moisture from your hair as possible to speed the drying process.

, You should follow the directions on these to ensure the best results. Generally, you should apply your straightener and heat protectant before you use any heat tools on your hair, but after it has been towel dried damp.


Be sure you get all parts of your hair, including the roots, by massaging your product into your scalp.
For most straightening products, a dime-sized amount should be sufficient for your hair., Avoid using a flat iron on damp hair as this can cause water locked inside to boil, leading to hair damage. To prevent your hair from harm, you should blow dry or air dry your hair until it is completely dry.Use the cool setting of your blow dryer intermittently to prevent overheating your hair and damaging it while drying.
Keep your blow dryer angled downwards while drying your hair to limit frizzing.
, Tangles can make it difficult to separate your hair for straightening. Tangles can also make it difficult to keep straightened hair separate from the hair you've already straightened, which is important as straightening your hair too much can lead to damage.

, Always exercise caution while using your flat iron. Make sure not to leave it in a place where it can burn anything, including yourself. You should aim for a straightening temperature of 365°F (185°C) to gain the most styling benefits while minimizing potential heat damage.As long as your hair is of average thickness, even simple ""high-low"" model flat irons should work for your hair. Set the iron to ""high"" and work quickly to prevent fry., Section your hair so that you can easily keep hair you've straightened apart from the rest. Your goal should be regular sections that are easy to work with. For most people, three sections should be enough, but if you have thicker hair, you will likely need more sections.Divide your hair horizontally along the back of your head from ear to ear.
Further separate your hair by parting your hair vertically at the middle of your horizontal part.
Gather all hair above the horizontal line out of the way and to the top of your head.
Sub-divide sections for especially thick hair., Divide a two inch (5 cm) segment of your hair from the section you are currently straightening. Then take your flat iron and clamp it close to the roots of the segment, being careful not to burn your scalp in the process. Steadily slide the iron along the entire length of the segment until you reach the ends.If after the first pass, your hair doesn't look straight enough, you should repeat the process.
Be careful not to apply your iron too many times; this could lead to heat damage., Once your segment is sufficiently straightened, you should release it and allow it to hang out of the way. Then divide another two inch (5 cm) segment from your section until that section is done.


Repeat this process with the each section of your hair, until all parts of your hair are straight.
Use a mirror when you believe you are finished to check that your hair has been completely straightened.

, A volumizing mousse or spray will help your straightened hair look fuller and give it more body. You might also want to spritz your hair with hairspray. This will hold it in place and prevent it from getting wavy again.,"
"
Wash and condition your hair.,
Comb through your hair while wet.,
Apply styling product to your hair.,
Continue to scrunch your hair.,
Comb through any messiness.,
Blow dry or air dry your hair.",How to Style Wavy Hair1," Before you begin to style your hair, you'll want to wash it so that it is in it's natural state. If you try to style your hair wavy after you have already styled it another way, it may be more difficult. Use a shampoo and conditioner that enhances wavy hair.


When you visit your local cosmetics or grocery store, look for a shampoo and conditioner that is suited for wavy or curly hair. The bottles will usually have something on them that explains what hair type they are for. Using a shampoo specifically designed for your hair will help you enhance your natural wave.
If you can, refrain from washing your hair every day. Waiting two or three days to wash your hair will allow the natural oils in your hair to be restored, resulting in less dry, frizzy hair. You can condition your hair more frequently, as your hair could always use extra moisturizing.;
, After you get out of the shower you can squeeze out your hair, but refrain from towel drying it. It will be easier to style your hair if it is mostly wet, and towel drying your hair can add frizziness. Use a wide tooth comb and start at the ends of your hair, working out any tangles you may have.It's important to use a wide tooth comb here as other tools can cause your hair to snag or pull, which will damage your hair. Using a brush will most likely do this, so avoid brushing your hair when it is wet. A regular comb (not wide tooth) is less likely to pull your hair, so you can use that if it is what you have. However, a wide tooth comb is the best choice.

, After you have combed through your hair, you can now apply a product to enhance waves. Try to choose a product with little or no alcohol (as this can create that crunchy feeling in your hair). You can use a mousse, paste, or spray (whichever you prefer). Squirt the mousse or paste into your hand and apply it to your hair by scrunching from the ends of your hair towards your roots.


You can also put the product directly in your hair. Squirt it into your hand and finger comb it through your hair. Then scrunch your hair as previously described. If you have spray, spritz it evenly throughout your hair and proceed to scrunch your hair.
Look for a product that is described as curl enhancing or wave enhancing. Avoid using hairspray as this can create a crunchy, frizzy look.
Try not to add product to your roots as this will create build up and can make your hair look too stiff. You will achieve the most natural wave if you apply product closer to the ends of your hair, as waves generally tend to be looser at the top and tighter at the end.

, After you have applied your product, take some time to scrunch your hair, gathering your hair at the ends in your hands and scrunching upwards to your roots. Once all the product is in your hair, scrunch with a microfiber cloth. Do this until you've scrunched all of your hair, and you have your desired waviness.Avoid scrunching your hair with a towel as this can create frizziness. If you don't have a microfiber cloth, you can use an old cotton t-shirt. You want to avoid using your hands too much as they can also create frizziness in your hair.

, Now that you've finished scrunching your hair, use your fingers to comb through any messy waves you may have created. You don't want to use a comb or brush while your hair is styled like this as it can brush out the waves you created, making your hair look bushy. Fix any fly aways or tangles you created by finger combing your hair.

, You can dry your hair naturally or with a blow dryer. Drying your hair naturally will take longer, but it will prevent your hair from damage caused by heat and may help avoid frizziness. If you are going to blow dry your hair, make sure you use a diffuser. Turn the temperature on a lower heat and gently blow your hair dry with your diffuser attachment, setting the ends of your hair in the diffuser and pushing the diffuser upwards to your roots."
"
Repeat all the steps from the previous method.,
Apply heat protectant to your hair.,
Section off your hair.,
Curl sections of your hair.,
Continue to curl and then spray.,
Comb through your waves.",How to Style Wavy Hair2," Before you begin using heating tools, you'll want your hair to already have some wave in it. You can create this natural wave by applying product to your hair, scrunching it and drying it with a diffuser. Or, to make it simpler, simply wash, and condition your hair and let it air dry naturally.


You don't have to apply styling product and scrunch it into your hair for this method -- it just may help you attain better waves. However, before your hair dries, try applying some curl or wave enhancing serum or spray. You don't have to scrunch this through your hair, but simply spritz it in your hair and comb it through with a brush or your fingers. This will give your hair a little extra wave, making it easier to curl.

, After you hair is dry, take a heat protectant spray or serum and spritz throughout your hair. Heating tools can damage your hair by drying it out, but applying a protectant will reduce that damage. After you have applied it to your hair use a comb or brush to evenly distribute it through your hair.

, Section your hair in about three or four sections (depending on the thickness and length of your hair). You can section it by the bottom third, middle third, and top third of your hair, or you can section it off by splitting it down your part and pulling it in front of your shoulders. Use a clip to loosely pin up the hair you aren't working with.


If you are able to leave your hair down, do so. Pinning it up may cause some of the curl to fall out, or it can create creases in your hair. If you are going to clip it up, do so loosely, so that the hair is in a very loose bun or loop.

, Use a one inch curling iron, or a wand, and begin to curl sections of your hair. Instead of clamping your hair in the curling iron, wrap your hair around the curling iron. Point your curling iron or wand down, and start at the root of your hair, wrapping a one inch section of your hair around the curling iron until you reach the ends of your hair. Then, hold for five or so seconds.The reason you want to wrap your hair around the curling iron instead of clamping it in the iron is because this will give you a more wavy hair look. Curling your hair like usual can create bouncy curls that look less natural. Wrapping your hair around the curling iron also creates a looser look at the top of your hair and a tighter wave at the bottom, which gives you a more natural wave look.
To create waves that curl backwards, meaning they curl away from your face, place the curling iron or wand behind the strand of hair that you are curling. For example, grab a piece of hair about one inch (you can do less or more if you want tighter or looser waves) and hold it out. Then, take your curling iron, pointing downwards, and stick it behind that section of hair. Begin to wrap your hair around the curling iron or wand, starting at the top and wrapping it until your ends reach the tip of the curling iron.

, Once you have curled all of your hair, take hairspray and hold it about six to 10 inches away from your hair. Spray evenly throughout your hair. Don't spray too much, though. You don't want your hair to have that crunchy feel. Try to spray closer to the ends of your hair rather than your roots.

, Now that you've curled all of your hair, you may want to comb your waves or curls out a little bit. Look at your waves and decide if you want them looser. Then, take your fingers and run them through your hair. Comb them through each wave gently until you have your desired wave. Then, use your fingers to fix any fly aways.If you brushed some of your pieces out a little too much you can always re-curl them. You can do this with your wand or curling iron, or you can simply take your fingers and twist your hair back into the curl. If you used hairspray it will hopefully twist back pretty easily.
Try not to use a brush or regular comb on your hair while it is wavy. These can brush out your waves making your hair look bushy, and then you'll likely have to restyle your hair. If you wake up with a lot of tangles in your hair, simply run your fingers through your hair and consider re-curling some of the pieces that have fallen. You can also use an anti-frizz serum to help prevent any fly aways.

Wash your hair in the evening.,
Comb through your hair.,
Create a braid in your hair.,
Take your braid out after you've slept.,
Finished.

",How to Style Wavy Hair3," Use a wave or curl enhancing shampoo and conditioner and wash your hair as usual. Make sure you do this in the evening, shortly before you go to bed, as your waves will set overnight as your hair dries. The benefit of this styling technique is it requires little work!If you normally shower in the morning, you can do this routine as you get ready. However, your braid needs time to dry and an hour or so may not be enough time to allow your braid to dry and to create waves in your hair. To speed up the process use a blow dryer on your hair while it is braided. Ultimately, doing this at night will give you the best results., Once you have showered, squeeze out excess water from your hair. Then take a wide tooth comb and comb out any tangles or messiness in your hair. If your hair is dripping wet you can squeeze out some of the moisture with an old cotton t-shirt or microfiber cloth.It's important to brush your hair before you braid it, because you don't want to brush it after you take the braid out. This will likely brush some of the waves out.
To comb your hair, start at the ends of your hair and work out any tangles. Then, move your way up through your hair until you reach the roots.

, Now, take your hair and braid it into one long braid (or you can do two braids -- this will create tighter waves). You can do a loose braid or a tighter braid -- it all depends on how tight you want your waves to be. Also, remember that you will be sleeping on this braid so do what feels most comfortable to you. If you want waves that start higher up your head, french braid your hair.


Keep in mind that a tighter braid may make your hair look more crimped than braided, so doing a looser braid is the safer option. If your hair isn't very wavy once you take your braid out, you can always try it again another night. You can also touch up your waves with a one inch wand or curling iron.
To braid your hair, separate it into three equal sections. Then, take the left section and place it over the middle section. Then, take the right section and place it over the left section that is now the middle section. Finally, place the middle section (now the left section) and place it over the right (now middle) section. Continue to do this until you reach the ends of your hair.
It's best to braid your hair while it is wet so the braid dries in your hair. However, some people have such thick hair that it won't dry completely in a braid overnight. If this is the case with your hair, try air drying it a little bit before you go to bed and before you put it in a braid. Then, once it is somewhat dry, braid it and go to sleep. When you wake up your hair will hopefully be completely dry.

, The key to this hairstyle is allowing your hair lots of time to dry in the braid. Go to bed and then don't remove the braid until you wake up the next day. Once you wake up, undo your braid. Your hair should be somewhat wavy. Then, spritz your hair with a little bit of hairspray to help hold your waves and you're done!If you are disappointed with the waviness in your hair, you can always touch it up with a curling iron or wand. You can also spritz your hair with water and apply a styling product to your hair to help add bounce to your waves.
Another option you have is to straighten your braid once it is dry. Simply leave your braid in, making sure it is completely dry. Then, take a flat iron and run it slowly over your braid a few times. It's helpful if you have braids small enough to fit in a flat iron, so if you need to, take your braid out and re-braid your hair into five or 10 braids. Once your braids have cooled, take them out and spritz them with a little bit of hairspray.,"

Tie back the rest of your hair.,
Blow-dry your bangs.,
Add waves with a curling wand.,
Texturize your hair.",How to Style a Bang Wave1," It’s easier to work with your bangs if you keep the rest of your hair out of the way with a hair tie or clip. You will also be styling your bangs differently than you style the rest of your hair, so it’s easiest to section them off. Brush out both your both bangs and any other short layers that frame your face.

Your bangs should be damp when you begin styling them. You can either style them right after you shower, or just dampen them again with a spray bottle.
For African American hair or any hair that is naturally more coarse or dry, skip the water and apply a heat protectant and a moisturizing cream or oil product instead.;
, Even if you want to let the rest of your hair air dry, you should use a blow dryer on your bangs for best results.First, apply a heat protectant. To make sure your bangs have a lot of movement, blow-dry them all toward one side of your face, then the other, and finally straight down.This technique will ensure that your bangs don’t look too stiff or straight, which would clash with the loose waves in the rest of your hair.

, If you have very short bangs, you may want to skip this step. Waves will cause your bangs to appear even shorter, so those with very short bangs are all done styling after blow-drying. If you have short to medium bangs, you can use a curling wand to add a bit of extra wave. Grab a small section of your bangs and twist it around the curling wand, holding it in place for only two or three seconds. Unwind your hair and adjust the curl with your fingers. Do this for the rest of your bangs.The longer you hold your hair against the hot curling wand, the tighter it will be. Because you want your bangs to be wavy but not curly, only hold it for a few seconds.
After you uncurl the hair from the wand, you can still form it and soften it while it’s warm. You can pull the bottom of the strand to loosen the wave, and tousle the curls together to make your bangs look softer.
You can also curl your bangs with the straightener method if you do not have a curling wand.

, Once you’ve finished drying your short bangs, let the rest of your hair down. To blend your bangs and your wavy hair, spritz your entire head with some texturizing spray or salt spray, and then style it with your fingers. Once you’re satisfied with how it looks, you can secure your style by spraying a bit of hairspray."

Choose a haircut that is long on the top and short on the sides.,
Select a cut with long layers for women.,
Try blunt cut bangs if you are a woman with long hair.","How to Manage Thick, Coarse, Wavy Hair1"," This hair style works well for men with short hair, and can work just as well for women with short hair. If you have short hair, this will flatter your hair type, because it gives you a clean look while showing off how thick your hair is. With this cut the back and sides of your hair are cut down closer to your head but not quite as short as an undercut. This cut will give you lots of styling options:You can do a trendy updated pomp. With this style, your hair is styled upward from the forehead and gives you a taller look. Apply gel to your damp hair and style up with a round barrel brush and blow dryer. Apply a clay based finishing product, like a pomade, to give your hair a matte look instead of a shiny finish.
You can go for a messy style with your new cut. You can use a matte hair product from Sebastian, Axe or Bed Head. Once your hair is mostly dry, rub the workable wax in your palms, and give your hair the beginning of a side part by styling your hair more to one side. Grab smaller pieces of hair and gently twist them in different directions. Do this around your head, and it will give your hair a piecey, messy look.;
, If you have medium, shoulder length hair, this could be a great cut for you. Long layers can frame your face while giving your hair more motion and less poof. You can start the layers around your cheekbones and have them continue down your hair. This hairstyle is great because it can be low maintenance, and you can easily go the natural wavy route following method 2 with this hair style. This is a great haircut for people with long face shapes. However, avoid extremely long haircuts with the long layers and this face shape.Wear your hair half up and half down. Leave out the layers in the front that frame your face. Pull half of your hair back into a barrette or ponytail. This is a very flattering style for people with thick, wavy hair, because it will show off your hair’s natural volume. Use this hairstyle on a day that you don't want to thoroughly style your hair. , This cut could be very flattering for your thick, coarse hair. Your hair is a great match for this cut, because when you have thick hair the strands will hold better. However, consider your face shape before you get blunt cut bangs:


Go with this cut if you have a long face shape. Blunt cut bangs will shorten a long face if it is paired with long hair. Be careful with blunt cut bangs if you have a round face shape. If you get this cut, tell your hair stylist to cut the bangs longer on the sides and shorter in the middle. This gives your hair some angle. Avoid getting blunt cut bangs if you have a heart shaped face. Consider getting long layers instead.Blunt bangs do a great job framing square face shapes.Put your hair in a thick side braid if you have blunt cut bangs. This is a good option on a day that you don't have much time to style your hair. This will flatter your thick hair and at the same time tame it in a braid. "

Take your bun out of your hair and tousle your hair.",How to Make Your Hair Wavy," Depending on how much hair you have, you can use any number of partitions. Two is probably enough. Split your hair up into two sections (upper and lower is usually useful) and tie one section off and out of the way.


You can also split your hair between left and right if you'd like, though a top/bottom separation is usually easier to layer together.;
, The section should be almost one inch wide. As you wrap it around the iron, make sure you're keeping the hair flat -- not twisting it as you wrap.









Leave the last 1-2 inches of hair off the curling iron, so that they stay straight while the rest of the hair is in waves. This leads to a more effortless look.

, Depending on your final look, you may want to adjust how tight your curls are. The way you hold the curling iron will determine how wavy or curly your hair gets. You can even try 2-3 different methods for a textured look when you're done, making it look a bit more natural. For example:


Tilting the wand upwards while you wrap leads to more relaxed curls.
Tilting the want downward leads to a tighter curl.
Tilt the want sharply downward, almost vertical, for even tighter curls.
Twist the hair slightly as you curl it, pulling it tight, for very tight curls.

, Take a brush and brush out the lower half of your hair, loosening the curls a bit for gentler waves. This isn't strictly necessary, but it will lead to wavier, and less ""curly"" hair.








, This adds body and lift to the curls, helping them turn into big, beautiful waves. Work in small sections, teasing up and down and adding a bit more hairspray when needed.

, Keep experimenting with your curling iron and teasing brush to find the look that works best for you., Most blow dryers come with a diffuser attachment that you can put on the barrel of your blow dryer. A diffuser disperses the heat over a wider area of your hair instead of shooting the air in one stream. This tool will help turn your hair wavy and not frizzy.


The best diffusers are round and concave in the middle and not flat like a duck bill. This shape will help your curls dry in their more natural shape because your curls can rest inside the round diffuser and dry in their natural clumps. , You need to wash your hair for this method because you need to blow dry your wet hair with a diffuser to make your hair wavy. Typically, people with wavy hair also have dry hair. You can buy a moisturizing shampoo and conditioner to wash your hair. Or you can use whatever shampoo works best for your hair type.Consider cleansing your hair with a no-poo, low-poo or a co-wash instead of using a shampoo. No poo or low poo are shampoos with no detergents in the cleanser. Because detergents and sulfates found in normal shampoos can dry out cuticles and produce frizzy hair, many people with natural curl have started cleansing their hair without shampoo.
If you choose to use shampoo, get one that's sulfate-free. Sulfates are a cleansing agent that dry out hair, and they wreak havoc on a wavy head.

, You will want your hair damp before you get started. If you want to avoid frizz, use a soft towel made out of microfiber or a soft t-shirt, and blot the moisture out of your hair. Use your soft towel and blot at the roots of your hair first.
Take your hair by sections and pat your wet hair between the folds of the towel.
Let your hair air-dry for a half hour or more so that it's more damp than wet when you start blow drying. Or you can wrap your head in a soft towel for 15-20 minutes to wick away the moisture from your hair.
Do not squeeze your hair too hard or wring out your hair with the towel as this will damage your hair. Wet hair is more prone to breaking, so be careful when you are handling your wet hair, and do not to put unnecessary strain on your locks., Depending on your preference, put mousse, gel or a styling cream in your hair. You can also use a heat protectant spray or cream on your hair to protect it from heat damage. If you have naturally wavy hair, then your hair is probably also dry, and a thick styling cream that moisturizes will work well for your hair.


To apply, rub the cream or mousse in your palms, and instead of running it through your hair from the roots to the tips, gently scrunch you hair in sections from the bottom upward using your hands to lightly distribute the cream to the natural sections of your hair. If your hair is short, do the same thing and coat your clumps of curls, or would be curls, from the top by scrunching your hair with the product on your hands. This technique will help your curls stay bouncy instead of weighing them down.If you have naturally dry hair, avoid hair products with alcohol that dries out your hair., Flip your hair upside down, and use the diffuser to dry your waves and your hands to define the curls. Point the blow dryer up from the bottom instead of drying from the top down. Take a section of hair and put it in the round concave of your diffuser. Your hair should start to form natural waves in the heat of your diffuser. Then drop your hair from the diffuser, and with your hand shaped like a claw, take the section of hair and slowly scrunch up your hair from the bottom. While your hair is scrunched in your hand, aim the blow dryer at the spaces between your fingers.









Let the hair fall down again when it's mostly dry, and repeat with another section. Continue section by section, blow drying your hair evenly until it is about 90% dry. Then let your hair air dry the rest of the way after you blow cool air on your waves.

, Set the blow dryer to cool, and blow dry your hair with cool air for 30 seconds to a minute to help set the style of your hair. Most blow dryers have a cool setting, or they have a button you can hold down that will make the air cool. The cool air will help seal the cuticles of your hair so that the waves stay in place., Flip your head over and spritz your hair with spray throughout to preserve your waves. Use your hand like a claw and scrunch your hair up in sections to help hold the wave in your hair. You want to use a hair spray that has low, flexible, or medium hold so that you avoid crunchy, stiff hair. Flip your hair back up and arrange it how you like.


Keep your spray bottle at least 6 inches (15.2 cm) away from your hair so that you aren’t spraying too close to your head.
There are hair sprays that add strength and shine to your hair without weighing it down. Dove and Garnier have great light hold, anti-humidity, and shine-enhancing hair sprays that will keep your waves in place.

, You want your hair damp for this method because you'll sleep on the braids overnight to make your hair wavy. Go with your normal hair washing routine to prep your hair for braiding.

, You want your hair to be damp before you put it in braids so that they will dry overnight. Be careful not to over dry your hair because it won’t create as many waves., Starting with the right or left side of your head, use clips or hair ties to part your hair into 2 to 3 inch (5.1 to 7.6 cm) sections. Once you have a top corner section clipped, move methodically from one side of your head to the other until your sections are clipped, and then start a new row below the first row. Continue until one-half of your head is sectioned off.

, For the waviest hair effect, do french braids in your hair. However, you can also sleep on normal braids to make your hair wavy. Start at the base of your head and taking your hair into three sections, braid your hair down to the bottom. If you can, ask a friend to help you so you can braid all around your head. Braid until you are at the very end of your hair, and tie off each plait with a non-rubber elastic band if you have them.








, Most people will need about 6 hours of time for the braids to dry. Give yourself plenty of time to sleep on your braids the night before you want wavy hair, especially if you have thick hair. If your hair is still wet in the braids in the morning, you can blow dry your braids. Be careful with blow drying your braids; however, it could make your hair frizzy. It is better to let the hair dry naturally.

, Undo one braid at a time, starting on one side of your head and moving up and over to the other. Gently let your hair unravel by brushing the strands out slightly. Protect your waves, and do not rake your fingers coarsely through your hair.








, Use your fingers to smooth down or fluff up your hair as desired. Gently remove any tangles with your fingers. However, do not brush your hair- if you do, your hair can lose its wave and become frizzy.








, You’ll need damp hair for this method because you'll sleep on the tiny buns overnight to make your hair wavy. You can also use a spray bottle and dampen your hair well instead of washing it.

, Remove excess water from your hair before you put in the tiny buns. You will want your hair damp before you get started and not soaking wet. If your hair is too wet it won’t dry as well overnight., Using a smaller section of hair will result in smaller buns and tighter waves while larger sections will create looser waves. Choose the style that you prefer, or mix it up and do small waves up front and bigger waves in the back. Go methodically through your hair and clip your hair into 3–4 inch (7.6–10 cm) sections making rows from left to right until you get to your part in the back. Then make another row under your first row until you get to the bottom of your head and your hair is in regular sections on one side of your head.


After you finish making the tiny buns on your one side, you can move on to the other side of your head and section your hair methodically again.Separating your hair like this will make your waves more regular. If you want more of a messy look, you can create haphazard tiny buns around your head.

, Just as you would if you were doing a normal bun, twist the section of hair until you are at the end of your hair. Once the hair is twisted, make little circular coils with your hair at your scalp until your hair is in a little mound. Secure with a couple of bobby pins or non-rubber elastics on either side of the coil so that it is firmly in place.








, Ask a friend or family member for help pinning the tiny buns on the back of your head. If you don’t have a partner, you can part your hair down the part in the back and sweep your hair forward on both sides so that the little buns are at the sides of the back of your head. Use two mirrors to help you pin and place your little buns if you are doing the back of your head.








, Most people will need at least 6 hours for the braids to dry depending on your hair type and length. Give yourself plenty of time to sleep on your braids the night before you want wavy hair, especially if you have thick hair.

, Start with the sections in the back and carefully unpin each bun so that the hair is loose. Work your way forward on your head until all of your hair is loose. Gently let your hair unravel by shaking your head to loosen the hair or lightly touching your curls. However, do not rake your fingers through your hair too much- you want your waves to stay in tact as much as possible.








, Gently use your fingers to loosen your waves and remove any knots. Try not to brush your waves because you could end up making your hair frizzy.

, Spritz around your head a few times making sure to spray about 12 inches from your head. Then you can also use your hand like a claw and scrunch your hair in sections to help hold the wave in your hair.

, Or spray the midsection and ends of your hair with a spray bottle so that it is damp. You want your hair damp for this method because you need your hair to dry in the bun in order to make it nice and wavy.

, Point your blow dryer down at the top of your head and blow dry the roots of your hair at the part. Then lift your hair in sections and blow dry the roots of your hair. Leave the midsection and ends of your hair damp.

, Don’t worry about making a precise part, but grab your hair so that you have roughly half of your hair in each hand. Twist each side of your hair in one direction until it is all the way twisted to the end of the hair. If you want your curl to curl inward, twist the right side of your hair counterclockwise and the hair in your left hand clockwise. If you want your hair to curl outward, twist each side in the opposite direction.

, Once each strand of hair is twisted to the bottom, twist the two strands together so that they weave in and out like a braid. Continue braiding all the way down the back of your neck until you get to the end of your hair. Your hair should be in one long twisted strand. Make sure to hold tight to the end of the strand so it does not come undone.








, Coil your twisted hair around in a circle on the back of your head until it is a tight mound. Your bun should be low and hanging a little bit above the nape of your neck. Secure your bun to the back of your head with a hair tie or with a couple of jaw clips.








, Depending on how thick your hair is, your hair will take a different amount of time to dry. For people with shorter or thinner hair, it may only take a couple of hours for their hair to dry. While for people with thick hair, it may take all day for their hair to dry.

, Gently unloose the bun from your the back of your head, being careful not to pull too hard. Arrange your hair how you like with your fingers. Avoid brushing your hair or running your fingers through it too much because touching your waves can make them fall.

Dry and comb your hair.,
Apply leave-in conditioner.,
Consider a curl-enhancing product.",How to Make Hair Naturally Wavy1," Regardless of which of the below methods you choose, getting your hair wet first is an important step. Curls will look better in clean hair.


Use shampoo to make sure your hair is clean.
When using conditioner, do not apply it to your scalp but instead focus on the ends of your hair. This makes your hair lighter so that it is not weighted down.;
, Eliminate excess water by squeezing it out or using a towel. Leave your hair slightly damp. The curls will last longer this way.









If you have very thick hair, use a blow dryer to remove some of the water. Your hair should be damp, but not sopping wet.
Removing tangles from your hair will allow you to create smooth waves rather than knots which may catch or look unappealing.

, Leave-in conditioners make hair smoother, stronger and more flexible. Begin by working a small amount, about 1 tsp, into your hair. Too much conditioner can leave your hair weighed-down.









Apply conditioner to sections of your hair to ensure it is evenly distributed from root to tip.
You can add more conditioner as needed., If you have very straight hair that struggles to hold a curl, adding a texturing spray, a small amount of mousse, or some hairspray may help your hair hold a curl for longer.









Often it works best to apply this to the under side of your hair so the crown of your head does not look greasy or heavy.
Lean over so that your hair is flipped upside down and use your fingers to work a small amount of gel or spray into your hair.

Clip the rest of your hair out of the way.,
Blow-dry your bangs.,
Curl your bangs away from your face.,
Use your fingers to loosen your bangs.",How to Style a Bang Wave2," Because your bangs will be side-swept at this medium to long length, it’s much easier to separate your bangs from the rest of your hair. You can focus your hot tools and products on just this section, and this is especially helpful to simplify the process.Your bangs should be damp when you style them. Dampen them with a spray bottle, or style your hair when you get out of the shower.
For African American hair or any hair that is prone to drying out, skip the water and apply a heat protectant and a moisturizing cream or oil product instead., Brush out your bangs to ensure there are no tangles. As you blow-dry, hold your hair taut with the brush so that your roots dry straight.Loose waves should begin about 1/3 or half way down your hair, so you don’t want any curl near your roots.

For medium to long bangs, you can part them in the middle and wear half on each side of your face, or you can sweep them all to one side. Make sure you blow-dry your bangs accordingly.

, You can use whichever curling tool you prefer for this step: a curling wand, a curling iron, or a straightener. Start about 1/3 or half way down the strand of hair, so that the wave doesn’t begin too close to the root. Now you have the most important part about styling wavy bangs. Curl your bangs loosely away from your face.If you curl them towards your face, they will be a major nuisance. By curling them away from your face, they won’t be in your face and they will blend beautifully into the rest of your hair.

, After you’ve added a loose curl with your hot tool of choice, loosen them gently with your fingers. Untie the rest of your hair, and run your fingers through it to make sure the bangs blend in. Add a bit of texturizing spray if you desire, and finish with a bit of hairspray to hold your waves throughout the day."

Take the time to thoroughly blow dry your hair.,
Use a large barrel brush to style your hair.,
Blow dry your hair in sections if you have long hair.,
Blow dry cool air on your hair to seal the cuticle.,
Wait 10 minutes and then spray your hair with a light hold hairspray.","How to Manage Thick, Coarse, Wavy Hair2"," If you have short hair, you can wait 15-20 minutes. If you blow dry your hair when it is wet or damp it will be more apt to poof up. Because you have thick hair, you should be patient with the time it takes to do your hair. Find ways to make the process work while you work. For example, make breakfast, or do chores while you are waiting for your hair to dry., When you blow dry your hair, make sure your hair is completely dried before you go out, especially if it is humid out. A high powered blow dryer will help you dry your hair more quickly. Good examples of blow dryers for thick, coarse, and wavy hair include the BaByliss Pro TT Tourmaline costing approximately 100 dollars or the Conair 1875 Ceramic Quiet Styler for around 30 dollars.







, The best kinds of brushes for thick hair have reinforced bristles or boar bristles.These brushes have thicker bristles that are spaced wider than a regular brush and are able to get into your hair, and all the way to your scalp.


You can also buy cushion brushes with thick bristles for brushing that isn't styling., This will help you thoroughly dry all of your hair. Split up your hair into four sections or quadrants. Clip up the first quadrant of your hair on top of your head, and blow dry the bottom section. Using your round brush, curl your hair in toward your face. Then unclip the top section and blow dry your hair in the same way. Repeat the process on the other side of your head.









Depending on how soft and curved you want the ends of your hair to appear, spin your brush and curl your hair more or less.
Avoid using a paddle brush, they have shallower bristles and create more frizz.

, Set the blow dryer to cool, and blow dry your hair for a minute or two until all of your hair has cooled. The cool air can also make your hair less poofy after a couple of minutes.Most blow dryers have a cool setting. Other blow dryers have a button that you push while you blow dry that makes the air cool.








, You will want to give your hair time to cool and settle even more before you spray your hair. Use a hairspray that does not make your hair stiff or crunchy. Make sure the hairspray has a low/flexible hold. You can find hair sprays that add strength and shine to your hair, and keep it tamed. Depending on your hair or desired look you can do different things:









If you have short hair, hold your spray a six to eight inches above your head and spray once or twice on both sides.
If you have medium length hair, flip your hair over and spray lightly throughout your hair to give it a tousled look. Flip your hair up, and spray once on each side.
For long hair, spray lightly around the ends of your hair to help hold the style in place.

Read the ingredients on your shampoo.,
Wash your hair less often.,
Keep your hair well moisturized.,
Create curls in your hair with a styling product.,
Air dry your hair or use a diffuser to dry your hair.","How to Manage Thick, Coarse, Wavy Hair3"," When you change your washing and hair care routines you will bring out your natural curl. The detergents found in shampoos dry out cuticles and produce frizzy hair, so many people with wavy, thick, or coarse hair have started cleansing their hair without shampoo. Avoid shampoos with sulfates which will dry out your strands and create more frizz.


Skip the shampoo altogether. Wash your hair with a no-poo, low-poo or a co-wash instead of using a shampoo. Use the co-wash method. Co-wash means cleansing your hair with conditioners that use oils instead of detergents to cleanse your hair.You can buy sulfate free and no-poo shampoos at stores like Target (L’Oreal Ever Creme Sulfate-Free Moisture System) as well as stores like Sephora (DevaCurl).

, Because wavy, coarse, and thick hair has a spiral shape, the natural oils produced by the scalp take longer to get to the tip than with normal hair and should, therefore, be washed less often.If you wash your hair every day, try cutting back to washing 2-3 times a week, and see if you notice that you have more curl and less frizzy hair.


Keep track of your washes on a calendar to make sure you are not over washing your hair.
Consider using a clarifying shampoo once a week to wash if you are noticing build up in your hair. Everyone's hair texture and oil level is a little bit different, so experiment and see what works for you. It might take a couple weeks before you figure out the best balance of shampoo and no poo washes.

, This will keep your coarse hair more flexible and manageable. Use a moisturizing conditioner and a leave-in conditioner. Use conditioners for wavy or curly hair, because these conditioners add extra moisture and shine. Evenly spread your conditioner in your hair if you have less than 3 inches (7.6 cm) of hair. Apply your conditioner to the midsection and ends of your hair if you have long hair.


If you are co-washing, only apply your conditioner to the midsection or tips of your hair. Avoid the roots of your hair with your conditioner, because it may lead to build up in your hair.
Look for a conditioner that does not contain silicone. Silicone over time will leave residue that will dull your waves and weigh them down., Make sure you use a thick cream that moisturizes instead of a mousse with alcohol. For women, TIGI, AG Cosmetics and Kerastase have great products that are both a styling cream and a leave in conditioner and some products that even protect against heat damage, too. For men, there are great styling creams that are advertised for you, for example, Malin and Goetz and Fellow Barber sell creams to make your hair less unruly and more manageable.








After you get out of the shower, blot your hair at the roots with a microfiber towel. Wait 15-20 minutes if you have shorter hair and 30-40 if you have longer hair. Once your damp hair is half dry, apply the cream to your hair and create your curls.
If you have short hair rub the cream in your palms and then evenly distribute through your hair. Do not squeeze your hair but gently rub your hands through your hair, twisting your hair in small chunks to give it wave.
If you have long hair, rub the cream in your palms, and create curls with your fingers by gently twisting your hair and lightly spreading the cream around the curls with your hands. Start at one side of your hair and methodically create the curls around your head. , Drying your hair without the diffuser will blow out your curls, so make sure you use the attachment. This will make your hair more wavy and less frizzy. The best diffusers are concave in the middle and not flat. The wide shape will help your curls dry in their more natural shape because the curls rest inside the round diffuser. 








Attach the diffuser to the barrel of your blow dryer. Most blow dryers come with a diffuser attachment that you can put on the barrel of your blow dryer.
Dry the roots of your hair first. At medium heat, start drying at the nape of your neck and put the diffuser directly at your roots. Gently hold the ends of your hair away to let them start to dry naturally. Go around your head, drying the roots until they are dry. Once your roots are dry, let your hair dry naturally. Apply a light hairspray to your curls after your hair has fully dried. Dove and Garnier have great light hold, anti-humidity, and shine enhancing hair sprays that will keep your curls in place.

Divide your hair into sections.,
Braid one section at a time.,
Secure the braid.,
Braid the rest of your hair.,
Dry your hair.,
Undo the braids.,
Apply hairspray.",How to Make Hair Naturally Wavy2," The hair should still be damp as you do this. The size of the braid will determine how wavy your hair will be. The bigger the braid, the less wavy your hair will appear.









If you want a tight frizz, divide your hair into many small sections to braid.
If you want loose waves, divide your hair into four or five sections.

, Take one section of hair and divide it into three equal parts. Hold the left section in your left hand, the right section in your right hand, and the middle section between two fingers of your dominant hand. Cross the hair over the middle strand.








First bring the right strand over the middle strand. What was the right strand is now the middle strand.
Now bring the left strand over the middle. What was the left strand is now the middle.
Repeat this process until the whole section has formed a braid.

, At the end of the braid, use an elastic band or butterfly clip to keep the braid in place. You want the braid to be secure enough that sleeping on it or blow-drying it will not cause it to come loose.








, Repeat the process for each section of hair. Remember that only the braided part of your hair will be wavy.









Begin as near the crown of your head as possible, to ensure that the waves don’t begin halfway down your head.
Braid as far down the section as you can so that the tips of your hair are not straight when you undo the braid.

, In order for your waves to stay, you’ll want the braids to dry completely before undoing the braids.









Use a blow-dryer to dry the braids.
Sleep on your braids and undo them in the morning.

, Carefully unbraid your hair to release the waves. Gently run your fingers through to separate the strands. Do not brush or comb your hair as this may create frizz or undo your waves entirely.








, If your hair tends to lose curl easily, add a light covering of hair spray to fix the curls. Choose one with a relaxed hold so that the hair does not become crunchy or sticky.

Finished.

",How to Make Hair Naturally Wavy3," The more sections you create, the more waves you will have. It is a good idea to have a top layer of sections around the crown of your head and a second layer around the bottom.









If you plan to have your hair parted after your waves are done, make sure to have that part in place before dividing your hair into sections.
10-12 sections is a good number to start with. After you have experimented you may find you like more or fewer sections depending on hair length or texture.

, You will create small buns one section at a time. Beginning with a section near your face will allow you to clearly see what you’re doing. Work your way backward.


Start with a section near the crown of your head. If you start with a lower section, hair from an upper section is likely to get in your way.

, Turn the section of hair in one direction to create a tight twist. When you hold the strand out from your head it should look something like a rope.









A tight twist will create a firmer wave.
Remember not to pull your hair too tight, as the hair may tear and your head will hurt.

, Coil the strand around itself at the base, so that it look something like a cinnamon roll or snail shell.








, How large the buns are will depend on how long your hair is and may determine what you use to secure it. Larger buns may require an elastic band around the circumference of the bun.









Use bobby pins to hold smaller buns in place. Use two at perpendicular angles to ensure an even hold.
Use duckbill clips instead of bobby pins to hold curls.

, The curls will need to dry completely before you undo the buns. Sleeping on your wet hair is often the best way to do this. Light blowdrying may also help, but the heat is unlikely to penetrate to the center of the bun.

, When the hair has dried completely, undo each bun carefully. Run your fingers gently through your hair to make loose waves, but do not brush or comb it.









Use a hair spray or scrunch fixative gel into your hair to ensure that the waves will stay all day.

Cut cloth strips.,
Separate a section of your hair.,
Roll one section of hair.,
Tie the rag curl.,
Set the curl.,
Try using foam curlers.",How to Make Hair Naturally Wavy4," To make rag curls you will need small pieces of fabric, about four or five inches long and about an inch wide. How many you need will depend on how tight of a wave you want.









Begin with twelve strips, six for the top layer of your hair, six for the bottom.Cutting up an old pillowcase or old shirt can be an economical way to get fabric.

, You will have six rag curls that go around the crown of your head, then another six that go a little below. This means you’ll have two sections of hair on each side and two sections at the back in your first layer of curls.









Pull a small handful of hair away from your face. If you divide the side of your head into quarters, it will be one quarter of that hair.

, Place the rag at the tip of your hair and begin rolling under. At first it will be tricky and the tip will want to come out. Keep tucking it back in and roll your hair upward.


Watching what you’re doing in the mirror will help as you’re first learning.

, Take the two ends of fabric and tie them together to secure the curl. You will want the knot to be snug enough that it will not come out as you sleep, but not so tight that you cannot untie it the next day.








, Allow the hair to dry overnight by sleeping with the damp rag curls. In the morning, undo the knots to release loose waves.









Run your fingers through your hair to turn ringlets into waves. Do not use a comb or brush as this creates frizz.
Apply hairspray to set the waves if you have hair that easily loses body.

, If you struggle with using rags to curl your hair, purchase foam curlers instead. The process is exactly the same, only instead of tying a rag to set the curl you will instead clip a plastic cross-bar or special pin.


Some people find sleeping on curlers to be uncomfortable or difficult.
Remember that the size of the curler will determine how loose or tight the waves are. Big curlers make loose waves.

Look for hydrating ingredients like Argan oil, keratin, avocado oil, vitamin E, Moroccan oil and coconut oil.Avoid shampoos and conditioners that contain alcohol, which can dry out and damage your hair.;
, Wavy hair requires more moisture than straight hair to combat frizz. After shampooing, apply a rich deep conditioner for a boost of hydration. Don’t skimp on the conditioner – apply plenty of it. Then run a wide-toothed comb through your hair to distribute the conditioner evenly. Leave the deep conditioner on for at least five minutes.Look for deep conditioners that contain ingredients like shea butter, glycerin, coconut oil and Argan oil.
If your hair gets weighed down too much by deep conditioner, avoid applying it to your roots. Try applying it from the mid-shaft down to the ends.

, Right before you get out of the shower, rinse what’s left of the conditioner out of your hair with the coldest water you can tolerate. Avoid using the wide-toothed comb during the rinse, since at this stage it can damage your strands., Switch from terrycloth bath towels to microfiber towels for your hair. Microfiber towels absorb water better and faster than traditional terrycloth towels, and they don't disrupt the hair's natural wave. Flip your hair upside down, wrap it in the microfiber towel and gently squeeze the water from your hair.


Start at the roots and work your way down to the ends.
Be gentle with your wet hair. Never rub at or use rough motions on your hair with a towel, which will disturb the hair cuticle and create frizz.

Swimming and spending a lot of time in the sun (or in the cold) can place your hair under a lot of stress. Provide it with it's daily needs by buying a simple leave in conditioner. If you are really serious about having beautiful, frizz-free hair, also consider a deep conditioner/ hair mask, which should be applied approximately once a week.;
, If your hair is thick or you want more control over those waves, consider going to your nearest hair-dresser and getting some layers. Layers lighten your hair and make it more manageable. You may find that your hair tangles more at the bottom than the top, this is due to unhealthy ends and a good trim can clear up all split unhealthy ends, therefore resulting in healthier, manageable hair. If the layers are done right, it will create a beautiful beachy look when styled. If the beachy look isn't really your thing layers will simply make your hair easier to style as you wish.








, Other than conditioning and cutting your hair, there are other ways to help maintain it. Treat your hair with the respect it deserves, don't style it in harsh ways that may cause it to tangle. Before you go to sleep, gently brush out all tangles and tie it in a loose ponytail or plait. When you wake up it should still be fairly easy to manage.









Some pillow cases can be harsh on your hair, to help maintain it while you sleep invest in a satin or silk pillowcase to prevent knotting. A lot of girls do not realize how precious their hair really is. Remember, each strand is no thicker than a tip of a pin, so treat it gently, especially when it is wet (This is when it is most vulnerable).

, The great thing about having wavy hair is the vast variety of different ways you can style it with minimal effort. A loose, wavy, side bun creates an elegant yet simple look. Depending on the way your hair sits, sometimes you don't have to style it at all and it will still look fabulous.

Continue this process on your remaining strands of hair.,

Apply hairspray to your locks.",How to Make Beach Waves in Your Hair With a Flat Iron1," Your hair will curl most effectively if it's dry. If it's soaking wet, you'll just end up damaging your hair and the curling process won't work. It can be just a little bit damp as well.






;
, You need an ordinary duel-sided flat iron to curl your hair. A 1 inch (2.5 cm) iron will be perfect for the job. Just give it a minute or two to fully heat up. If it has settings, pick a setting in the middle so the iron curls your hair the right amount -- if the setting is too high, your curls may end up looking a little bit dented.

, Sectioning your hair can help you isolate parts of your hair. This can make it a bit easier to curl your hair, especially if there's a lot of it, but it can take longer. If you're sectioning your hair, you'll need to clip or pin back the top part of your hair so you can reach the bottom strands first. If you're not, then you can start with any of your strands. As you curl more hair, you'll be sectioning less and less of it.

, You can start about 3-4 inches (7.6-10.1 cm) down your hair. If you curl it from the very top, your hair will look too poofy.

, Once the hair is in your iron, just fold it backward, away from your face, and hold the position for a few seconds.








, Now, either glide the iron down your hair or just release it and move it down 2-3 inches (5 - 7.6 cm) before you fold it forward, in the opposite direction that you folded it the last time.








, Continue moving the iron down and moving it forward and backward until you approach the bottom of the strand. You can leave a 2-3 inches (5 - 7.6 cm) of hair untouched at the bottom to create a natural and flowing look.








, Just repeat this process on all of the 1-2 inch (2.5 - 5 cm) strands of your hair until you've created beach waves on all of the strands. If you've sectioned off your hair with a clip or tie, just take more chunks of hair out of the clip until they're all down.









To avoid having all of your curls clump together, you can alternate between starting by moving the iron forward first and backward first as you make your way along the strands. That way, each strand will be curled in the opposite direction. You also don't have to start curling each strand in the exact same place.
When you reach the outer parts of your hair, you can clip the top part of the hair you're not ironing to the side -- so if you're curling the top-most right strand, you can clip the top left strands to the side of your head so they don't get in the way.

, Look at the sides of your head and put up a mirror to the back of your head to make sure that you've evenly curled your hair. If one side is a lot curlier than the other, just try to make some more beach waves on the other side for balance.

, This will help you preserve the beach waves for longer.

Use a wide-toothed comb on wet hair.After washing your hair, never use a regular hairbrush on it.,
Invest in a high-wattage ionic blow dryer.The heat and ionic technology work hand-in-hand to cut drying time in half and seal the hair cuticle so that it lays down flat.,
Buy a smoothing serum.Smoothing serums combat dry and frizzy hair by smoothing out the hair cuticle, forcing it to lay down flat.,
Get a brush with a mix of boar and nylon bristles.Boar bristles help distribute natural oils from the scalp to the ends of your hair.",How to Reduce Frizz in Wavy Hair2," This will cause a lot of breakage. Instead, use a wide-toothed comb to gently detangle your strands. If you don’t have a wide-toothed comb when you get out of the shower, use your fingers to comb through your hair. A wide-toothed comb can help you separate your waves and define your hair style, as well.


Use a wide-toothed comb in the shower to evenly distribute conditioner through your hair.
If you use any hair products on wet or damp hair, use a wide-toothed comb to disperse them evenly.

, A sealed, flat hair cuticle will never look frizzy. Use the blow dryer on its medium heat setting. Avoid the high setting, which will make the hair cuticle swell. Try to get an ionic blow dryer that is at least 1500 watts.


Don't shut off the blow dryer until hair is completely dry.
Don’t blow dry your hair in the bathroom. The steam from your recent shower creates a humid, frizz-inducing environment. Do it in another room or wait until the bathroom has returned to a normal temperature., Serums also create shine and protect your hair from environmental damage. These products should be applied to damp hair right before blow drying. A tiny drop of serum can tame fly-aways and frizz on dry hair, too.


Invest in a smoothing serum that lists Argan or Moroccan oil in the ingredients. These hydrating ingredients will provide frizzy hair with an added dose of moisture.
Make sure your serum doesn’t have alcohol listed as an ingredient. Alcohol is drying and damaging, which creates frizz.

, This natural oil, called sebum, deeply hydrates the hair shaft, which can drastically reduce frizz. The nylon bristles help to detangle your hair gently while the boar bristles moisturize it by distributing the sebum. Brush from root to tip with each stroke to properly distribute the oils.

Immediately after you brush wavy hair with boar bristles, it will probably puff up a bit. Gently twist your stands, which will relax them and they'll smooth out naturally.

Get regular haircuts.If you haven’t had a haircut in a few months, you probably have split ends.,
Sleep on a satin pillowcase.Cotton bed linens create friction during the night as you toss and turn.,
Avoid touching your hair during the day.Tousling and running your fingers through your hair causes frizz because it disrupts the smoothness of the hair shaft.,
Reduce hair washings.Natural oils from your scalp smooth and moisturize your hair, which prevents frizz.,
Use a deep-conditioning mask once per week.Wavy hair tends to get dehydrated fast, which makes it prone to frizz.",How to Reduce Frizz in Wavy Hair3," This is normal. However, split ends can cause a lot of frizz. Get your hair trimmed every six to eight weeks to avoid splitting and breakage. Book your appointments well in advance so that you won’t forget.

, This friction causes frizz, along with tangles, breakage and split ends. Satin has a much smoother texture, so sleeping on a satin pillowcase will reduce the friction that causes frizz. Satin also helps hair maintain moisture, which helps combats frizz.


Cotton and other fabrics tend to dry the hair out.
Wrapping your hair in a satin or silk scarf before you go to sleep will provide the same benefits as the satin pillowcase., The more often you touch your hair throughout the day, the frizzier it will become. Whenever possible, avoid touching your wavy hair to maintain your smooth style.

, Shampooing frequently strips your hair of those natural oils. Whenever possible, wait at least two days between shampoos. This will give your scalp time to create more natural oil. Four shampoos every week should be enough. On the days when you don’t shampoo, rinse it and then apply conditioner as you normally would.

If you have fine hair, you probably need to shampoo every other day.
If you have very thick hair, you can probably go three of four days without shampooing.

, A weekly deep-conditioning mask can help to rehydrate your dry strands by delivering a large dose of much-needed moisture. These masks will also keep hair feeling soft and restore damaged hair cuticles.

Look for deep-conditioning mask products that contain glycerin, proteins, shea butter and other hydrating ingredients to prevent frizz.

Change your blow-drying techniques.,
Backcomb.,
Use a texturizing sea salt spray.,
Leave plaits in overnight.,
Substitute coconut oil for gel.,
Scrunch with a towel or T-shirt.,
Curl your hair, then brush the curls out partially.",How to Scrunch Hair Without Gel & Mousse2," After you shower, dry your hair with a diffusing hairdryer nozzle. Dry your hair upside down for added volume. Once dry, turn your head upside down. Scrunch and shake your hair up with your hands.


A diffuser attachment for a hair dryer (which looks like a bowl with little spikes pointing up inside) helps create a wavy/curly effect on hair without the frizz. You place your hair in the bowl, the spikes help guide the hair into ringlets, and the holes in the bottom of the ""bowl"" let the air from the hair dryer.

, If you want to go for a messier look, try backcombing. Section your hair and, using a backcombing brush, gently tease the hair backward toward the scalp.

, Also sold as beach spray, this gives a much more natural look than gel. Gently spray it onto all of your hair on both sides and on top, then mess up your hair. It will set and is easy to brush out, but will definitely stay put in the wind.

, French braid your hair before going to bed or in the morning. Keep it in for as long as possible, then take it out before styling your scrunchy hair.


For even more scrunchy hair, make multiple French plaits in your hair (e.g. one on either side and one at the back).
You can also use a pony-tail holder to make a bun on top of your head. Braided buns work even better.
If a braid doesn't make your hair as scrunchy as you like, get lots of rubber bands and clip your hair in tiny buns in little sections. Twist your hair and clip until all off your hair is in buns. Leave it overnight and take out the bands.

, Rub a small amount of the oil into your hair before scrunching as described in the first section above. Start with the ends, not the roots. Don't massage coconut oil into your scalp.

, Some people find that these work better for scrunching than using your fingers alone. Using a cotton garment less 'fluffy' than a towel is thought to reduce frizz.

, Use hot curlers or a curling iron to create curls. Once this is done, use a damp hair pick or brush to partially remove the curls. You can leave this as-is or scrunch as described above.


The hair pick is more effective than the brush.

, Sectioning your hair can help you isolate parts of your hair. This can make it a bit easier to curl your hair, especially if there's a lot of it, but it can take longer. If you're sectioning your hair, you'll need to clip or pin back the top part of your hair so you can reach the bottom strands first. If you're not, then you can start with any of your strands. As you curl more hair, you'll be sectioning less and less of it.

,, Curl it forward gently, away from your face, leaving just a few inches at the bottom. Just turn the iron one time and pull it straight out. You can hold on to the end of the hair with your other hand for more control.

Heat your curling iron.,
Start with clean, dry hair.,
Brush your hair so it is tangle-free.,
Divide your hair into sections.,
Clamp a piece of your hair near the root.,
Bend the hair into an S shape.,
Move further down your hair.,
Set your hair with some hair spray.,
Wear it down or up.,
Add a barrette or flower clip.",How to Make a Marcel Wave," To get long lasting Marcel waves, you will need a hot curling iron. Turn on your curling iron about 15 minutes before you want to use it. This will help to ensure that it is hot when you begin making the Marcel waves.;
, The look will last longer if you start with clean hair. Wash and dry your hair before you get started. Make sure that your hair is completely dry before you begin. Use a hair dryer if necessary.


If you have fine or thin hair, then you can add a little mousse or hairspray before you get started. This may help to add some extra volume to your look., Using a curling iron on tangled hair may result in a messy look. To ensure that your waves look as lovely as possible, make sure that you brush all of the tangles out of your hair. Run your fingers through your hair to make sure that it is tangle-free.

, The waves will look better and last longer if you divide your hair into sections and only work on one small section at a time. To do this, you may need to pull back some of your hair and work from the bottom layer of your hair.


Try clipping up most of your hair on top of your head. As you finish a layer, let down a little more of your hair and keep doing this until you have finished waving all of your hair.
If you have very short or fine hair, then you can probably just work on all of your hair at once rather than dividing it into sections.

, To start creating Marcel waves with the curling iron, clamp the iron onto a piece of hair that is a couple of inches away from your root. Remember to clamp only a small section of hair at a time for best results.If you clamp too much hair, then the waves may not set or hold properly. Try to clamp only about ½” to 1” piece at a time.

, For Marcel waves, you do not roll all of the hair onto the iron as if you are curling it. Instead, just roll the iron towards your root slightly and hold the other end of the hair around the barrel so that the hair is bent into an S shape.Hold the hair this way for about 15 to 30 seconds and then release.
Your hair will now have its first Marcel wave.

, Next, move the curling iron a couple of inches past the first wave on the same piece of hair. Then clamp the piece with the curling iron and bend the piece into an S shape as you did the first time. Hold it for 15 to 30 seconds and then release.Continue clamping and bending the first piece of hair until you reach the bottom of the section. Then, start at the root for a new section. Continue doing this until all of your hair has Marcel waves.

, Marcel waves are meant to be voluminous, so you may not want to use too much product. However, using a bit of hairspray can help the look to stay longer. Try misting your hair with a light layer of hair spray to finish your look., The Marcel wave can add glamour and texture to an updo, or it can create volume and texture for your hair when you wear it down. Style your hair however you like.


A popular updo for the Marcel wave is a chignon or low bun.
This look was especially popular in the 1920s for women with bobs, but it looks great with just about any length of hair., The Marcel wave looks great on its own, but little accents can also intensify the glamour and romance of this look.Try adding a cute barrette, a flower clip, or some other fancy hair accent to take it to the next level.
