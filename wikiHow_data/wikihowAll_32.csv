Think about biotin supplements as a way to make your nails long and strong.,
Moisturize your nails, especially during the winter months.,
Don't expose your nails to nail polish remover repetitively.Every time you wipe off nail polish, you weaken your nails.",How to Grow Your Fingernails3," Biotin is a supplement used for a wide range of cases, from diabetes to hair growth. Biotin is also effective in treating brittle nails, making them stronger and less likely to split or break.Biotin can be found in natural foods, although it is commonly taken as a supplement.


Biotin won't necessarily make your nails grow faster or longer. Again, there is no scientific evidence to suggest that nails can be spurred to grow faster or longer by diet or lifestyle. What Biotin will do is make sure that your nails crack less often and that they are fuller. Nails that crack less often have a better chance to grow longer the natural way.
Naturally occurring Biotin absorbs into the body relatively poorly. It can, however, be found naturally in many foods:

Wheat germ
Whole-grain cereals
Whole wheat bread
Eggs, dairy products
Nuts
Swiss chard
Salmon
Chicken



, When your fingernails leave the cuticle, they are already dead cells, meaning that they won't repair themselves. This means that you have to take care of them yourself.


Every time you wash your hands, finish your sanitation regime by applying hand cream to your hands and nails. This will keep your fingernails from becoming too brittle, from cracking, or from splitting.
Wear gloves during the winter months if you go outside. Use rubber gloves if you're cleaning indoors or doing dishes, for example.

, Take a break from applying nail polish (and hence nail polish remover) to your hands every other week or every third week. You'll emerge with stronger nails.


Try looking for a polish that doesn't need to be refreshed every week. If you can't find one, try looking for a polish that can be colored over when your fancy strikes you a different way or you are tired of that color.

Constant activity will stimulate growth because of increased blood flow.,
Increased protein intake will stimulate growth.,
Rubbing garlic on your nails will help them grow faster.",How to Grow Your Fingernails4," The myth out there is that piano players have strong, long nails. Doctors say that while possibly increased blood flow stimulates growth (it hasn't been proven yet), increased impact on the tips of nails means more breaking and splitting, which means nails that need to be trimmed., The myth here is that because nails are made of protein (keratin), giving them more protein in a diet will help them grow. There is no evidence to support this, however.The truth is that a protein deficiency will cause nails to be weak and underdeveloped. However, the difference between a normal protein diet and a high protein diet cannot be seen or felt in the nails.

, The myth here is that because garlic contains selenium, a deficiency of which can lead to weaker nails, rubbing it on your nails will have the opposite effect. As you can probably tell, this is the same thinking as the previous myth: if not having enough of something is bad, having too much of it is good. The only problem is, the world doesn't always work that way. Sadly, the garlic rub myth has no evidence behind it.

Allow time for it to dry.,
Peel the mask off.,
Splash cold water on your face.",How to Make a Homemade Pore Strip1," You'll need a packet of unflavored gelatin, as well as 1 to 2 tablespoons of milk. Gelatin is what makes Jello thick and jiggly, and you're making it much thicker here, so it creates a thick film on your face you can pull off.You're looking for a consistency similar to that of thick yogurt.

Wash and condition your hair.,
Towel dry your hair.,
Apply leave-in conditioner and other products.,
Start drying your hair with the diffuser.,
Work your way down to the tips of your hair.,
Apply products afterwards.",How to Use a Hair Diffuser1," Using your regular shampoo and conditioner, take a shower. You can wash your hair as your normally would. If you're looking to reduce frizz, however, consider making a few alterations to your chosen products.



Try all-natural products that cleanse with oils, rather than soap agents, to help your hair look healthy and glossy when it's dry.
Avoid using harsh shampoos made with sulfates, which can dry out your hair and cause it to look dull and frizzy.;
, Pat it dry gently with a soft towel. Squeeze out the excess water, but don't use the towel to twist or wring out your hair. Handling your hair roughly can cause the hair shaft to fray and make it look frizzy.








, For best results, add a leave-in conditioner after drying. This will moisten your hair immediately after a shower and prevent frizz during the drying process. A few other kinds of hair products can also help with the diffusing process.








There is one exception to this rule. If your hair is wavy, it might be best to skip the leave-in conditioner. This can weigh down your hair, decreasing the curls and volume you're trying to achieve through using a hair diffuser.Styling lotion for curly hair can also be helpful. If you have wavy hair, go for foam and mousse.Some advise what is called the ""rake and shake"" method to try and bring out natural curls before diffusing. Divide your hair into five sections: one in front and two sections on either side of your head. Work in leave-in conditioner and hair products section-by-section. When you finish a section, hold it by its end and gently shake it out in a way that allows natural curls or waves to begin taking shape., Fit the diffuser on the end of your hair dryer. Always turn it on either medium or low heat. While this means it'll take longer to dry, your hair will not dry out or get as frizzy during the drying process.








To start, tilt your head to one side. Take the diffuser and place it near your hair's roots. Hold it there until your roots are dry.Use circular motions as you dry the hair near your scalp. Use the diffuser's prongs to gently massage your hair, promoting volume as well as natural waves and curls., Continue massaging your hair with the diffuser, using a circular motion, until your hair is dry down to the tips. Use the diffuser to gently push up on your curls as you work your way down. This helps retain your hair's natural shape and give your hair bounce.









Keep in mind, if your hair's naturally curly you may want to use the diffuser differently. Many women with natural curls feel their hair dries better if they stop after drying the roots. If you feel a diffuser makes your natural curly hair frizzier, try letting your ends air dry. See if this leads to better results.Do not use your hands as you diffuse your hair. Touching can create frizz and cause natural curls and waves to lose shape. It may feel like it's taking a long time relying on the diffuser alone. However, keeping your hands out of your hair will lead to better results., When your hair is dry, consider adding some products after the process. Heat can be hard on hair. Hairspray, pomade, or other products can help reduce damage.









Gently mist your hair with styling spray once it's dry. This will help your hair retain its shape all day.If your hair feels crunchy or dull after drying, there are a variety of products you can use to combat this. Consider pomade or shine serum, both of which you can purchase at a local salon. Rub some of the pomade or serum into your hands and then gently work it into your hair. Pull your hands through your hair, as if you're trying to pull your hair into a ponytail, and then continue pulling until you reach your ends."

Prepare the oatmeal.,
Fill the bathtub.,
Add the oatmeal.,
Soak in the tub.,
Dry your skin.,
Repeat as necessary.",How to Use an Oatmeal Bath,"


You can buy already prepared colloidal oatmeal for the bath, or you can make your own. To make your own, purchase rolled oats, not the instant cooking variety, from your grocery store. Place 1 cup (236 ml) of rolled oats into a food processor, blender or other grinding device. Grind it until it has become a fine powder.;
,


Resist the urge to fill the tub full of hot water. Hot water will only exacerbate the itchiness of dry skin as it removes essential oils and moisture from the skin. Instead, fill the tub with water that is warm. Add enough water so that most of your lower body will be submerged, but don't overflow the bathtub.

,


As the tub is filling, add the colloidal oatmeal to the tub by pouring it slowly into the stream of water from the faucet. This will ensure that the oatmeal is evenly dispersed throughout the tub.

,


Carefully lower yourself into the warm water with the oatmeal in it. It can be slippery from the oatmeal so go slowly. Soak in the tub for 15 minutes or so, and then carefully get out of the tub.

,


Rather than vigorously drying your skin with a towel, pat yourself dry. Rubbing can further irritate skin and it will remove any moisturizing benefits from the oatmeal bath.

,


If necessary, you can take oatmeal baths up to 3 times per day. Your doctor may recommend taking them more often, depending on your particular condition.

Wash your hair.,
Turn your head upside down.,
Add curl cream or mousse if you want.,
Start diffusing.,
Flip your hair back.,
Create volume.,
Use the diffuser until your hair is about 80% dry.,
Add curl or wave-preserving hair serum.",How to Use a Hair Diffuser2," Before you style your hair using a diffuser, you should wash your hair. You can use your regular shampoo and conditioner. As the heat from a diffuser can be hard on your hair, take extra precautions when conditioning.









Leave your regular conditioner in for 3 to 5 minutes instead of washing it out immediately. This will keep your hair a little softer and more moisturized going into the diffusing process.Make sure to rinse out shampoo and conditioner completely. Leaving in any residue can dry out your hair and cause damage. Rinse until you no longer see any suds leaving your hair., Once you're done washing your hair, turn your head upside down. To start drying, gently shake your hair back and forth. This will allow your natural curls and waves to take shape.









To continue drying, squeeze excess water of your hair. Do not rub dry with a towel. This can leave hair frizzy and difficult to manage.If your hair is still dripping wet, it's better to blot dry with a towel then rub.
Use a wide tooth comb to brush your hair, working out any tangles., It's optional, but a curl cream or mousse can help enhance your hair's shape during the diffusing process. You can find such products at a local salon.








Any products you use should have some kind of moisturizing agent. This is because heat can dry out your hair. Look for lotion-based mousse, foam, or gel to use in your hair before you begin diffusing., Keeping your head upside down, work the diffuser around the back of your head using circular motions. Focus on the roots at the top of your head. Diffusing from behind will add body to your hairstyle.







, Check to see how your hair is setting. If you like how your hair looks, you can stop diffusing at this point. However, if you want more volume try using the diffuser on the front of your hair and along your part line.








As with simply drying your hair with a diffuser, natural curls may be best left alone. If your hair is normally curly, try drying the roots and letting the ends air dry.Use the same circular motions as you continue diffusing your hair. As always, keep your hands out of your hair during this process. This can interfere with the style.

, You can use a diffuser to add volume to your hair. To do so, you'll need to grab some hair clips.









Place clips in your hair near the roots. Keep them at an angle. This will lift the top section of your hair, encouraging volume as you dry.You can either continue to use the diffuser or allow your hair to dry naturally with the clips in place. Different types of hair will respond in different ways. You may have to do some trial and error to see which methods best bring out volume in your hair. Try diffusing your hair with the clips in one day. The next day, allow your hair to air dry. See which results you prefer., Allowing some of your hair to dry naturally will keep it moisturized. It can also encourage volume. Once your hair feels about 80% dry, stop using the diffuser. Allow your hair to air dry the rest of the way.







, Use mousse, leave-in conditioner, or another hair product to keep your style in place. Apply it to your hair using a scrunching motion, rather than combing it in, to keep the style intact.









Your hair should have natural bounce after diffusing it. Don't apply too much hair spray or another heavy product, since this could weigh your hair down.
Once again, apply product by acting like your pulling your hair into a ponytail. Then, run your fingers all the way to the ends of your hair.Pay attention to product instructions. Many products advise that you apply at the roots to prevent your hair from looking greasy or weighed down."

Start with wet hair.,
Apply product.,
Use the diffuser to encourage waves.,
Add product when you finish.,
Finished.

",How to Use a Hair Diffuser3," Many people with hair on the straight side are surprised by the natural waves that appear when they use a hair diffuser. Start by getting your hair completely wet. Either wash and condition your hair or run it under the shower, then gently dry it with a towel until it's damp, but not soaking wet.

, After you've washed your hair, you'll need to apply product to help while using the diffuser. You'll need some kind of volumizer as well as a heat protectant.









Products designed to give hair volume can be applied to your roots. You can find volumizing shampoos and conditioners at the super market. Your local salon will likely also sell leave-in products designed to encourage volume. Read the instructions on the products you buy carefully. Some are spray-on and some should be massaged into your scalp.Mousse can work well when you're trying to make straight hair curly. Consider adding a small bit of mousse to your hair, focusing specifically at the roots.As heat can damage hair, a heat protectant is important. This is especially true if your hair is thin. Blow dry sprays and oils are usually sold at local salons. You usually do not need to use more than a drop of such products.If your hair is especially prone to frizz, see if you can find a protectant with a moisturizing agent.

, To do this, use your fingers to lift your roots upward. Push your hair upward into the diffuser, scrunching it into the prongs. Then, continue to dry your hair all around your head using this same process.







, You should always add product when you finish diffusing your hair. The heat process is hard on hair, for one. You also want to add some kind of hair spray to make sure your style stays intact throughout the day.









Gently mist your hair with your favorite brand of hair spray. This will help solidify your new style. Avoid using too much spray. This could cause a strong odor and could also make your hair look stiff.Use pomade or serum to make your hair look soft and natural. Smooth it gently over your hair, running your hands from your roots to the tips of your hair.,"

Change your hair style if it's not working.",How to Avoid Hat Hair," Adding moisture to your hair before you wear a hat is important because it will help combat the static that is usually created with a hat. Squirt a small dollop of leave-in conditioner in your hands and then apply it to your hair, using your fingers to run it through your hair., Because your hat is likely going to flatten your hair, you'll want to build volume with products in your hair. Apply a nickel size amount of volumizing mousse to your hair, building volume at your roots and scrunching your hair to keep it from lying flat.


This doesn't always work, especially if your hat is a material that will weigh your hair down. Too much product on your hair will make your hair feel sticky after you have taken your hat off. Use volumizing products sparsely, only using a little bit to add some moisture to your hair.

, The biggest mistake you can make when it comes to hat hair is wearing a hat when your hair is still wet. This will cause your hair to flatten out and take the shape of the hat. To avoid hat hair, allow your hair to dry completely before you put on your hat. You can blow dry your hair with a diffuser to create even more volume in your hair.

, This may feel strange, but if you part your hair differently than you normally do, you can then flip your hair back to its original part after you take your hat off. This will help create volume in your hair, because you've mainly flattened out your hair in one part. When you flip your part over to it's original part, it should have more volume., After you hair has dried, spritz hairspray into your roots. This will help the static in your hair as well as maintaining the volume you created in your hair. Start by lifting sections of hair around the roots and spray a small amount of hairspray underneath those sections. Then, to create more volume, push the hair at your roots upwards with your fingertips, so that it is lifted from your scalp. , Some hair styles will almost always be affected by a hat, no matter how hard you try. But, you can go for a hair style that looks cute even when you take your hat off. Some styles that work well with hats are braids, twists, low buns, low ponytails, and even wavy hair. A hat may seem limiting, but you really have many options for styling your hair.


Wavy hair is a bit harder to maintain with a hat. If you have long hair, style your hair as usual, creating tighter waves at the bottom part of your hair. When you take your hat off, the top of your hair may be flat, but the bottom should still be very wavy. Wavy hair often looks good like this, with the bigger, more voluminous waves at the bottom., A hat that is 100 percent cotton or wool will be much better suited for your hair as it won't create so much static. A hat made from synthetic material will create more static and so it should be avoided. Choosing a hat like a beret or floppy style hat is the best way to avoid hat hair as these hats won't cling to your head. Beanies and trapper hats are usually the worst for your hair as these usually force hair flat against your head.If you are wearing a hat for warmth, you can get away with a hat that is cozy against your head and still have decent hair at the end of the day. You may just have to do more work to restyle or revamp your hair when you take your hat off.
A baseball cap is also okay for your hair as it usually rests on your head, but not too tightly. Because it does have a firmer rim, a baseball cap is probably not the best for when you want to wear your hair down. A braid, ponytail, or low bun can look very stylish and attractive with baseball caps. If you choose to wear your hair down, just know that you may have a hat crease in your hair if you wear it for a long period of time.

, Even with very short hair you may still be worried about getting hat hair, but you can follow these same tips to help avoid or lessen hat head. Before you put your hat on, spray some frizz controlling spray on your hair, and rub the inside of your hat with a dryer sheet. This will help remove static in your hat that can create hat hair. Then, fix your hair as follows., To prevent a permanent crease from being made in your hair or from totally flattening it out, remove your hat when you are inside. This will not only help you maintain the volume and moisture in your hair, but you can also use it as an opportunity to restyle your hair.


When you go inside, try to visit a bathroom and take your hat off in front of a mirror. Then, try not to run a brush through your hair if you are in an especially dry environment as this can create more static. Instead, use your fingers to brush through any tangles or messy looking parts of your hair. To add extra volume to your hair, after you have brushed it out with your fingers, flip your hair over. Then, flip it back over quickly. This will help add volume to your hair and keep it from looking matted down.

, Once you have brushed through your hair, you may need to add products to it to help style it. Dry shampoo is a great product for hat hair, because it can help lift hair from your roots, especially if your hair is feeling greasy. A texturizing spray also works great to add volume to flat hair.Spray dry shampoo along the hair that frames your face and then along your roots. Run your fingers through your hair to smooth out the shampoo and to create volume. Dry shampoo often leaves a powdery, white substance, so make sure that you have smoothed it into your hair as much as possible.
To apply the texturizing spray, flip your hair over and spray evenly throughout your hair for a few seconds. Then, brush the product gently through your hair and shake your hair out a few times as the product dries. Flip your hair back over and smooth it out with your fingers if it looks a little messy.
If you have very short hair that doesn't require much styling, to help with hat hair, you can apply a small amount of gel to your hands and run it through your hair. You can also use dry shampoo or texturizing spray -- you just won't need to use as much.

, These are similar to drying sheets, and can be used to remove static from your hair. Take a sheet and gently swipe it over the areas of your hair that are especially staticky. Each styling sheet has smoothing product, so as you wipe it on your hair it should remove some of the static.


The styling sheets can be found at a drug or cosmetics store. They come in a box with individually packaged sheets, so you can grab one package and bring it with you to fix flyways.

, In dire situations, take a bathroom break to restyle your hair. All you need is a travel size container of your preferred styling product. Wet your hands and run them through your hair to make your hair somewhat damp. Then, apply mousse, gel, or any other styling product you use to your hair. Shake your hair out if you want to create extra volume. To finish your style off, apply anti-frizz serum or hairspray to tame fly away strands.


This may be difficult for long hair, especially if you need a blow-dryer to style it. In that case, consider finding a hairstyle that looks good without heating products. Make sure you allow your hair to dry before you put your hat back on.

, If your hair remains limp and flat no matter what you do, take off the hat and put up your hair in a more hat friendly hair style. These can still look cute, and in a way are more practical because you won't have to bother with your hair continually throughout the day. Store a hair tie in your purse so you can do this on the go.


Since hat hair tends to affect only the top of your hair, you can tie up just the top and leave the rest hanging down.
Once you return home you can try to restyle your hair, or lessen some of the frizziness that has happened during the day.

If using a spray, hold it at least 8 inches (20cm) away, spray at the roots, then brush it through your hair. Spray lightly, since the spray can give your hair a weird texture or a greyer color.


Natural alternatives include corn starch (for light hair), cocoa powder (dark hair), or cinnamon (reddish hair). Note that the last two are scented, and that cinnamon may ""burn"" a sensitive scalp.
Many people apply this before they go to bed, so it can soak up oil overnight.

, If only your bangs are oily, wash and shampoo them in the sink without wetting the rest of your hair. This handles the problem without exposing drier parts of your hair to damage from over-washing.

, Styling products, especially gels and mousse, are thick and greasy. Even lighter styling products can become oily if left in too long. Try to achieve what you can with a pea-sized amount of the product at a time, and/or keep the product away from your bangs.

, Makeup is oily. The more you wear on your forehead, the more it will rub off onto your bangs.

, Touching your hair adds a tiny bit of oil from your fingertips. This may seem small, but it adds up over time. If you constantly sweep your bangs back, fasten them with a clip so they stop falling out of place. If you have a habit of twirling your hair or running your hand over your head, learn how to stop.

, Wash your face whenever oils build up, so they don't transfer to your bangs. Oil removal wipes are an easy way to do this on the go.


When you're sweating, remember to wipe off sweat from your forehead and hairline.
At times when your skin is particularly oily, keep your bangs pinned up or to the side.

Use dry shampoo after a trip to the gym. Dry shampoo can also come in handy when you've exercised and don't have time to take a shower before returning to work or school.
Use dry shampoo after a long airplane flight or a travel day. It's convenient to carry a small bottle for times when you don't have access to a shower.
Don't use dry shampoo more than a few times in a row before washing your hair with regular shampoo and water. Since dry shampoo doesn't clean skin flakes and other debris from your hair, it's necessary to use water regularly.

Baking soda. This also helps to minimize odors.
Cornmeal
Corn starch
Ground oatmeal (if you use this, grind it to a fine powder in your food processor)
Talcum powder or baby powder

, Depending on what you have in your cabinet, mix equal parts of as many of the above ingredients as possible. The mix of course ingredients and powders helps absorb as much oil as possible.









If you're missing an ingredient, substitute a like ingredient. For example, if you don't have baby powder, double the baking soda. If you don't have ground oatmeal, double the Cornmeal.
Make sure the ingredients are well mixed. If you want to make sure they're ground even finer, you can run them through your food processor together. (Be sure to clean it well if you use baby powder.)
To make scented dry shampoo, mix it with dried flowers or herbs (e.g. roses, lavender, hibiscus, violets, mint) in a jar, close the lid, and set it in a dark cupboard for 2-4 weeks. The scent will mix with the dry shampoo so that when you use it, your hair will smell good.

Wash your hair.
Allow your hair to air dry, to observe hair's natural moisture level.
Use water-based conditioners and oils that penetrate the hair shaft. For example, shea moisture, oil and coconut oils, products that make hair feel wet. Work out how much your hair can handle before it begins to look limp or clogged rather than benefiting from the additions.
Using the information you've discovered, begin to formulate a daily and weekly hair routine that leaves hair feeling completely moist and soft.;
, Some hair will break, especially if it has been chemically treated a lot. If you have a lot of breakage, shampoo your hair with a moisturizing shampoo, such as Design Essentials shampoo.It can also help to discuss the issue with your trusted hair stylist.

Plastic bristles do not spread oils as effectively as those made from plant or boar fibers., Washing your hair more often than this will strip your hair of its natural oils. Washing less often will cause buildup to collect on the scalp and slow hair growth. If you have particularly oily hair, you can wash once a day with a gentle, sulfate-free shampoo.When you shampoo try to give yourself a scalp massage to clean off dead skin cells and encourage circulation. Spend a couple of minutes rubbing the shampoo into your scalp firmly.Everyone needs a different type of shampoo. Consult a hair stylist for recommendations about what might work for you.

, Conditioner can help moisturize your scalp. This is particularly important after you shampoo, because shampooing can dry your scalp out. Be sure to condition your scalp every time you wash and to massage the conditioner deep into the scalp., Essential oils, like tea tree oils, should be massaged into your scalp before you go to bed and washed out when you wake up. If you perform this ritual once every two or three days, it will help stimulate hair growth.Essential oils can be too powerful to apply directly into the scalp. Make sure that you purchase a mixture that is already diluted.

It is a myth that wearing a hat will cause you to lose your hair. In fact, not wearing a hat in the sun can cause a snowballing problem, because as your scalp is damaged by the sun, your hair will thin, exposing your scalp to more sun damage., Products that hold your hair in place, like hair spray and gel, are difficult to remove with a simple washing.

Have a balanced diet.",How to Create a Good Hair Care Routine (for Men)," They're not all created alike. Choose products that work well with your hair type so your hair will look the best it can be. If possible, go for sulfate-free shampoo and silicone-free conditioner; these ingredients are hard on hair and cause it to look dry and dull over time. Check the label. Here's a short guide to what products work well with what hair types:For dry hair that's prone to getting frizzy, look for moisturizing or hydrating products that contain oils, butters and other nourishing ingredients.
For oily or fine hair, look for clarifying products that contain ingredients like tea tree oil and chamomile.
For hair that breaks and frays easily, look for restorative products that contain proteins like collagen and keratin.;
, You might think it's healthy to wash your hair daily, but that's actually too often for most people. Washing your hair too often strips your hair of protective oils naturally produced by your scalp, leaving it more prone to getting frizzy and frayed. For most men, two to three shampoos a week works best.









If your hair gets greasy fast, consider doing a water-only wash on the days when you don't shampoo. Water will cleanse your hair without stripping away the oils.
When you first start washing less, your hair will keep overproducing oil for a week or so until things balance out. Just be patient, and soon your hair will stay clean longer.

, Hot showers are great, but the heat of the water dries out hair. It's better to use warm or cool water to wash your hair. If you have to have a steaming hot shower, try finishing with a warm or cool rinse so your hair will look healthy and shiny rather than frizzy and dull when it dries.

, Hair is weak when it's wet, since water causes the keratin molecules in hair to stretch. That's why doing a rough towel dry treatment can break your hair. Instead, use a towel to dab your hair dry and get rid of the excess water, then let it finish air drying.








, If you like a neat, orderly style, using a gel or pomade while your hair is still wet can help your hair look freshly groomed throughout the day. Use only a dime-sized amount of product if you have a short haircut, since using too much will make your hair look greasy.









Gel is generally lighter and easier to work through your hair. Look for one that's alcohol-free, since alcohol dries out hair.
Pomades and creams are great for curly hair, since they're thicker. They're also more difficult to wash out, so use sparingly.

, If you used a product, use a comb to distribute it throughout your hair. Then create a neat part on one side or the other and style your hair however you like. It's generally best to comb your hair in the direction it grows: comb the hair in the back and sides down, and comb the hair on top forward. If your hair is long in the front, finish by sweeping it in the opposite direction of your part.








If your hair is curly or kinky, use a wide-tooth comb to get rid of any tangles - or forego combing altogether. Using a fine-tooth comb will cause your hair to frizz.
You don't always have to comb your hair forward. Experiment with different looks; try tousling the top instead of parting it, or combing the top straight up to spike it.

, Using a blow dryer is a good way to dry your hair as quickly as possible, but doing it every day will eventually start causing hair damage. If you're concerned about thinning hair, ditch the dryer and let your hair air dry instead.


When you do blow your hair dry, point the dryer in the direction of hair growth to help your hair lie flat.
Or if you want more volume, point it against the direction of hair growth as you dry it.

, If your hair is longer than an inch or two, you'll need to take a few extra steps to make sure it stays in good condition and looks great.


Deep condition if your hair gets frizzy. Buy a deep conditioning product and use it once a week to keep your hair in good shape.
Use a wide-toothed comb instead of a brush. Brushes break long hair; remove the tangles with a wide-tooth comb instead.
Consider a hair oil. Using a small amount of oil in your hair while its wet will act as a leave-in conditioner. A little goes a long way.

, A great routine won't make a difference if you're working with unkempt hair to begin with. Some men get it trimmed once a month, while once every three months is sufficient for others. Find your routine and keep up with it.

, Massage increases blood circulation, which stimulates hair growth. It can help you keep the hair you have and grow new hair as well. Use your fingers to rub your scalp in a circular motion, focusing on the areas where your hair is thinning.









Some oils are believed to help further stimulate growth. Try massaging with coconut oil, tea tree oil, or almond oil before you shampoo, then wash out the oil.

, Your hair will be more likely to break and fall out if you scrub it with shampoo, use hot water to rinse it and then scrub it again with a towel. Handle your hair with care at every step in your routine.

, There are a few essential nutrients that help hair stay thick and strong. make sure your diet is well-balanced to nourish your hair from the inside out. Using topical products will only get you so far if your diet isn't healthy for your hair. Here's what you need:


Protein. Eat meat, eggs, nuts, beans, and other sources of protein to keep your hair healthy.
B vitamins. These are found in meat, eggs, and leafy green vegetables. If you're a vegetarian, you may want to start taking a B vitamin supplement.
Omega 3 fatty acids. Salmon, sardines, avocados, and walnuts have loads of this important nutrient.

Follow the hair care advice received from your stylist and if you have any questions, be sure you fully understand how to care for micro braids both while you have them and after they’re removed.

,
Wash your hair and scalp regularly with the proper shampoo for your hair type, and always use conditioner while your hair is micro braided.,
Spray on a light leave-in conditioner, braid spray or hair oil to keep the micro braided hair moisturized.,
Utilize a light scalp conditioner, especially around the edges of the scalp where the most damage can occur when hair is micro braided.,
Visit your stylist or a salon professional if necessary to help maintain your braids or if you feel that damage or breakage has occurred.

",How to Care for Micro Braids2,",


Many stylist recommend waiting four weeks before the first washing, and then washing and conditioning at least once a week while you have your micro braids.

, Use enough so that the hair doesn’t feel brittle or dry when you touch it.

,


You can also use Aloe Vera gel, olive oil, liquid vitamin E or products containing these liquids to keep the scalp well lubricated.
Be careful not to use a heavy conditioner that can cause a flaky scalp, which is hard to treat when hair is micro braided.

,"
"
Remove the micro braids carefully or have them removed by a professional.,
Use a protein treatment after you’ve removed the braids to help put strength back into your hair.

,
Restore moisture to your hair immediately after removing your braids by using a deep conditioner and moisturizer, because the hair is often very dry after micro braiding.

Prepare your packages of braiding hair.,
Get a strand of braiding-hair ready for braiding.,
Section off your hair on your scalp for braiding.,
Start your first braid.,
Braid your section of hair.,
Braid additional sections of hair.,
Perfect each braid.",How to Braid African American Hair1," Start by washing your hair as per usual, and then use a deep conditioner to help soften your strands. When you’ve rinsed your conditioner out, use a Wide-tooth comb to brush out all the tangles, starting from the ends and working towards the roots. Use your hairdryer on ‘low’ to blow out your curls, so that they are almost completely dry. Brush out your hair once more to make sure there are no knots, and then you’re ready to start your braids.;
, Box braids use ‘braid hair’ - synthetic hair strands that are very long - to fill in the space on your scalp and give you plenty of fullness in your braids. Choose your braid hair in a color similar to your own, and get at least two large packages. Then, take each chunk of hair out of the packages individually, and hold them in the center, cutting off the elastic bands holding it together. With a grip on the center and the two tail ends of the hair hanging down, begin pulling the strands on one side of the hair. This will give the ends of your hair a more natural look, otherwise the packaged hair is blunt-cut straight across and your braids will look a bit unnatural when you’re finished.









When you’re pulling the hair, gently tug at small strands rather than big portions of hair.
Run your fingers through the hair when you’re finished evening out the ends, to remove any knots that might have shown up.

, Section off your first piece of braiding hair into a strand that is about 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) wide. Then, separate off ⅓ of this section; you should be holding two sections with one that is twice as thick as the other. Wrap the smaller strand around the larger one, so that the tail ends are facing opposite directions (like ‘><’). Take the smaller strand, and grab it at the center where it is intertwined with the first strand. Carefully twist the strand over and under, so that the two tail ends form a single piece that sticks out between the original tail strands.


You should be left with three strands of approximately equal size, which you can hold in one hand.

, Use a rat-tooth comb to carefully section a small piece of hair on your scalp, approximately 1-inch by 1-inch. It will probably be easiest to start on one side of your head near your hairline and work your way back, but you can start wherever you are comfortable. Use a bit of oil or gel to prepare this section, making it easier to manipulate.

, Hold your braiding hair in your hand so that one strand is between your thumb and index, a second strand is between your index and middle finger, and the third strand is hanging behind the first two. Grab the section of hair closest to your scalp with your thumb and index finger, as close to the roots as possible. To start the braid:









Reach your empty hand around your head, and grab the third strand of braiding hair hanging behind the ones gripped in your hand.
Simultaneously pull the 3rd strand of hair under, and incorporate the hair from your scalp into the section between your thumb and index, and twist it over in the opposite direction.
Pull the third loose section of hair into the middle, between the other two sections. You should now have three separate strands of hair that are held tight to your scalp, with your natural hair incorporated into one of the sections.

, With your braiding-hair as close to your scalp as possible, begin braiding tightly in the traditional pattern; alternate placing the left-most strand over the middle section, and then the right-most strand over the middle section. When you reach the end of your braid, the strands should taper out into a smaller and smaller braid. You don’t need to use an elastic band to hold it in place, as it should hold on its own.








, Repeat the same steps as aforementioned to braid the rest of your head:


Section a 1-inch by 1-inch piece of hair from your scalp, and apply oil or gel
Prepare your braiding hair and part it into three strands
Use the twisting method to combine your natural hair into your braiding hair
Complete the braid using a regular three-strand method until you reach the ends, As you braid, it is important to take the time to make sure they are all smooth, flexible, and even. If you notice any bulging strands or lumps in your braid, you’ll need to take it out and start over from the beginning. If your natural hair is sticking out from the strands of your braiding hair, you’ll need to remove your braiding hair and add oil or gel to moisturize it and reduce frizz.


You may have to re-braid the same strand multiple times in order to get it ‘just right’.
If your braid is uneven, you may have started with sections of differing thickness. You’ll have to take out your braiding hair and re-split it into three even sections."
"
Condition your hair liberally.,
Apply a moisturizer (which does not contain petroleum jelly, petrolatum or mineral oil) to your hair.,
Squeeze out excess water with a microfiber towel.,
Comb your hair carefully.,
Treat your hair from within by taking a multivitamin.,
Incorporate healthy habits.",How to Grow Long Hair if You Are a Black Female1," Black women tend to have curly new-growth. These curly roots make it difficult for your hair's natural oils to move down the hair shaft and moisturize the length of your hair.


Try co-washing (conditioner washing, using just conditioner instead of shampoo and conditioner). Some women do it weekly, some after 5 days, but not daily because product can dry your hair out. Some women also find that wash days take a lot of work and their hair takes forever to dry. Try co-washing weekly, and shampoo as needed but don't wait any longer than 4 weeks - so shampoo at least once a month. There are some women who do wash their hair every day, but with just water.
Deep condition with every wash. Deep conditioners containing olive, avocado or sweet almond oil work well. Play around with different products and see what works best for your hair personally. Don't be afraid to move out of the ""ethnic"" hair aisle.

Apply heat to your hair and wear a shower cap while you wait--heat activates the conditioner. You can sit under a hood dryer or wrap your head in a towel that has been soaked in hot (but not so hot as to burn you) water; or you can also let your body heat condition your hair.
Avoid getting deep conditioner on your scalp. The conditioner can clog your pores and cause alopecia, clogged and inflamed hair follicles, hair loss.

;
,


Wet your hair with water. Start about 1"" (2.5 cm) away from the roots and apply the moisturizer all the way to the ends!
Moisturize daily or as your hair requires - you want your hair to feel soft and pliable. You may have to experiment to find what works for you.
Seal the moisture in. This can be done by using a natural oil like coconut oil, olive oil etc right after applying the moisturizer (which can be water) so even applying oil on damp hair without a moisturizer can work. Do it in sections, it is easier.

, If you have a terry cloth towel you must be sure to not stroke your hair with it, or else strands of hair will latch onto the textured fabric of the towel and as you bring your hand down you'll hear a lot of popping, which is the sound of the hair breaking off. To use the terry cloth, take a section of hair and with the towel over your hand grab the section and squeeze. You should feel the towel get drenched. Unclench the towel covered hand; don't slide it off.

, Excessive brushing can strip the protective cuticle layer off of your hair.


Comb your hair with a wide-toothed comb. Divide your hair into sections. Start combing at the ends and work your way up to the roots.
Don't be afraid to put down the comb. Sometimes if you hit a knot or if the hair has a very kinky texture, you just have to use your fingers and detangle manually. If there's a knot that you can't get out of your hair, add something to soften the hair like water or leave in conditioner to help take out the knot. If the knot still won't come loose, use a pair a good hair scissors to cut it out.
If you are trying to smooth your hairline, brush gently, use a soft boar bristle brush. If your edges still float or curl up off of your head, try wetting the hairline and taking a scarf or a durag and covering your head. Let it dry until you have a tamed hairline.
Experiment with whether it's best to do this when your hair is completely dry and moisturized, or if it's better to detangle while your hair is wet (you might find it's very easy for your hair to break or be pulled out from the roots if you detangle when dry).

, Use a hair vitamin that will increase your hair growth rate and lengthen your natural anagenesis (growth phase).

,


Drink at least eight cups of water and eat healthy foods such as fish, fruits, vegetables and nuts.
Exercise regularly to increase circulation to your scalp.
Manage your stress with relaxation exercises or meditation. Stress can cause your hair to fall out.

Finish your cornrow.,
Cornrow the rest of your hair.",How to Braid African American Hair2," Because you’ll likely be leaving your hair in cornrows for several weeks straight, you want to make sure that you start with clean, well-conditioned hair. Wash your hair with your regular shampoo, and then use a deep conditioner to soften it. You’ll also want to use a hair oil of some sort while you braid, to keep your hair smooth, frizz-free, and easy to control and manipulate.

, Cornrows can be braided in any direction, so it is important that you decide where your part will be before you start braiding. The two most common part-styles are either in rows from your hairline straight back to the nape of your neck, or braided in a circular motion around your head from a center part. You’ll need to use a rat-tooth comb to part your hair in the desired pattern, and to split your hair into sections for braiding.








, Fill a spray bottle with water and a little bit of olive oil, and shake it well. Then, spray down the section of hair you are working with. Use your comb to separate off this section of hair in a row down your head. The smaller the part, the smaller the braid; the larger the part, the larger the braid. Use butterfly clips to hold your remaining hair in place out of your face.

, Take the sectioned part of hair in one hand, and pull a small piece from the very top (near your hairline) away from the rest of the bunch. Separate this small piece of hair into three sections of equal size. Start braiding these three pieces in the traditional braiding pattern; cross the right-most section over the middle section, then cross the left-most section over the middle section, back and forth.








, The cornrows are created by braiding your sectioned hair in a french braid really close to your head. As you work down your parted section of hair, continue your braid the same way you started it. However, as you braid, grab small portions of hair from the un-braided part and incorporate them into each strand you cross over the middle section. You are essentially creating a very tiny french braid.









As you add in hair, pull the braid tight and keep your fingers close to your head.
Don’t braid your hair away from your head, as this will make your cornrows loose and appear funny.

, When you get to the nape of your neck, you may or may not run out of hair. If your hair is short, you will finish your cornrow by twisting the ends of the braid together to secure them and prevent unravelling. If your hair is a bit longer, you will continue your cornrow past the nape of your neck in a regular braid. Twist the ends to secure the braid, when you’re finished.


You can choose to use small, clear elastic bands to hold your cornrows in place, if you’re worried about the braids coming loose.
Some people choose to put beads on the ends of each braid as a decorative detail.

, Work across your scalp, sectioning out even pieces of hair and braiding them into cornrows. The process can be quite time-consuming, so don’t be alarmed if it takes several hours to complete. Make sure that each cornrow is the same size and follows the same pattern, so that it appears even and intentional across your head.


If your hair is sticking out from your braids, it is likely not moisturized enough and your braids aren’t tight enough. Add more oil or gel to remedy this.
You might need help from someone to make sure that all your rows are even and parallel, especially on the back of your head.

Decide on the size of your twists.,
Prepare your first section.,
Start twisting your first section.,
Finish your first twist.,
Repeat the twisting process on the rest of your hair.",How to Braid African American Hair3," Just like with other braiding styles, your hair needs to be well-moisturized and de-tangled prior to starting your two-strand twists. Wash your hair as per usual, and then use a deep conditioning cream to moisturize it. Your two strand twists will be easier to style if they are wet or at least slightly damp, so do not blow dry or air-dry your hair completely before styling. Use a comb to remove any tangles or knots that might be present.

, There are many options when it comes to braiding your two strand twists. The most obvious decision you’ll need to make is deciding how large you want your braids to be. You can do ‘micro twists’ which use dozens of teeny-tiny braids, or you can do jumbo twists that use 1-inch sections or larger of hair. Small twists will last much longer than large twists, but the process is obviously more time-consuming. Decide what size you want based on your personal style and the amount of time you have to work on your hair.

, Use a rat-tail comb to part a section of hair to your desired size. The section of hair should be a square in shape. Rub a bit of style gel or cream through your hair, and mist it with a little water and olive oil to reduce frizz and make it easier to manipulate. Use your comb to brush through this section several times, to make sure that the hair is completely smooth and tangle free.








, Split your section of hair into two equal strands. Begin winding them tightly away from your head in a rope-like pattern; you’ll simply wrap the strands simultaneously around each other to create a twist. To keep it tight, you’ll want to pull the twist tight to your scalp as your work.








, When you near the end of your strand and begin running out of hair to twist, you will need to switch to doing a one-strand twist to secure the ends. To do this, take the two strands and combine them together (there shouldn’t be much hair left to do this with). Then, wrap this section around your finger many times, in the same direction you were twisting the two strands of hair. This will curl the ends of the hair in the same direction, securing them in place.








, Continue working your way across your scalp, creating your two strand twists. The process is the exact same for each twist, just make sure that you section off equal amounts of hair so that all your twists are the same size.

Braid: do a simple braid from the top and when you finish, tie the end. You can also add a hair band.

Twists: Divide your hair into rows. Then divide each row that you just made into 2 separate sections.

Starting at your hairline, twist the 2 sections of the first row together.
Keep twisting your hair as you move toward the back of your head, grabbing a little more hair each time you go a little further down the row.Bantu knots: Divide damp hair into sections, using a comb to create really precise parts.

Twist each section of hair into a ""rope,"" working some gel or pomade into your hair as you twist it. Keep your hair taut until you've twisted the entire section into a rope.
Turn the rope a few more times until it starts to curl in on itself. Doing this will create a firm coil at the base.
Wrap the rope of hair around the base to create your knot. You can secure it by either tucking the ends under the knot, using pins or using elastics.Be gentle and watch out for traction alopecia. It's the constant force being put on the hair follicle from wear styles that are too tight resulting in breakage and bald spots. The first sign will be pain at the site and inflammation of the hair follicle it'll feel like a bump. Take the hair out where you're suffering from the inflammation and let the hair 'breathe'.
Continue to care for your hair while it's in protective styles. The hair will still dry out and the scalp may need some TLC as well. Get a spray bottle and fill it with water, aloe vera juice, some natural oils (anything that will help to restore moisture) and spray it all over. If you have ample time, put your whole head under the shower head toward the beginning of the day and let your hair air dry the rest of the day. If protective styles are being worn for extended periods of time co-washing can also be done, but an application bottle may be needed to try and reach under braids.

, Natural hair can be long and beautiful if you know what you are doing. To straighten natural hair while protecting it from heat damage, blow dry your hair with a comb attachment and wet setting before you give it a quick sweep with a flat iron.

, It straightens your hair or loosens the curl with no chemicals. They start from about 1 day to 6 months. Afro hair is washed less often so the treatment will last more than the time said.

, Relax your hair no more than once every 8 to 10 weeks, or 4 or 5 times per year. Remember that relaxers are harsh chemicals that can potentially damage your hair, it's good to limit them to prevent overlapping and over-processing.Start by applying a scalp protector or petroleum jelly to your scalp and to your hair shaft. Apply the relaxer to your roots according to the manufacturer's instructions. Make sure to follow the leave-in time that's recommended on the product.
Wash out the relaxer in warm water with a neutralizing shampoo. Wash and rinse 3 times. The fourth time, leave the shampoo on for about 10 minutes before you rinse it off for the last time.

, Both shampoo and relaxers will remove needed nutrients and shielding from your hair, leaving it dry and fragile. Protein reconstructor will help to prevent damage and will make your hair more resilient.

, When you have split ends and you don't cut them, they will continue to split all the way up your hair shaft, which will cause breakage. To keep your hair growth steady, avoid taking off more than 1 to 2"" (2.5 to 5 cm) at a time.

Detangle your hair.,
Part hair into three sections.,
Blow dry each section.",How to Straighten Your Hair Without Chemicals1," Brush your wet hair with a wide-toothed comb, a boar bristled brush, or other gentle, soft bristled brushes. These types of brushes allow you to remove tangles without breaking hair. Curly hair tends to tangle as it dries, so continue to brush throughout the drying process.;
, Place one section on either side of the head and one in the back. It’s best to dry the lowest layer of hair, closest to the head, first. Use hair clips to keep the upper layers of each section of hair separated. Brush each section gently taking care not to snap hair strands in order to remove tangles before you begin drying.

, While brushing with one hand, follow your brush with the electric dryer. Move the blow dryer to-and-fro from the top to the bottom of each section in even motions. Once each section of the bottom layer of your hair is dry, let down another layer of hair from each section. Continue this process until all the layers of your hair are dried.


You may also want to consider using cool air to straighten hair. This takes a little longer than blow drying with heat, but it prevents potential damage to hair that occurs with the application of heat."

If you're not willing to cut your hair short, consider trimming away split ends, a common problem in damaged hair.


Repeat the trim every 4–6 weeks, removing all the split ends you can find. Leaving damaged ends in place will not help your hair grow out.;
, To begin your hair care mission, apply a scalp preparation to remove buildup from sebum and hair products. This will create a healthy environment and provide nourishment to the scalp and follicles.


Besides removing sebum buildup, a good scalp preparation product provides hair-strengthening vitamins and soothes dry, irritated scalp. Ask a salon to recommend a product similar to Scalp Prep.

, Every week, seal away the ends of your hair with shea butter. For further protection, sleep on a satin pillow, or with a satin or mesh scarf over your hair. Cotton or fleece pillowcases will pull your hair out and cause breakage.


If you have extra-porous hair, shea butter may makes your hair feel limp and greasy. Try a light moisturizer instead, or a light oil such as jojoba oil.

, Leave-in conditioner restores natural oils without requiring water. Put this in your hair daily to encourage health and shine.

, Mild, all-natural shampoo and conditioner can help your hair recover from chemical overload. Washing once a week is recommended for most people with damaged African hair.


Let your hair air-dry, or pat it dry with a towel. Do not rub or blow-dry damaged hair.

, Hair damaged by coloring or relaxer is often low on protein. Once every two weeks, apply a protein treatment to restore strength. Follow label instructions for best results.

, Every week, massage a moisturizing conditioner into your hair. Hold your hair over steam to encourage the conditioner to penetrate your hair's inner layers. Put your hair up and leave it in for at least a couple hours, or overnight.


A hot oil treatment can provide similar benefits.

, Cornrows, plats, or twists help reduce damage from exposure. Even if you wear your hair down during the day, put your hair in one of these styles before going to bed.

, Work out tangles gently, without yanking your hair. Damaged hair breaks easily when combed dry, so add a small amount of conditioner or water.


For best results, use a brush with rubber bristles, such as a Denman brush.

, If using chemicals is an absolute must, wait for as long as you can between treatments. If possible, wait for 2 inches (5cm) of new growth before the next application.

, Henna is an all-natural treatment that will color your hair and help condition it at the same time. Try this instead of damaging your hair with hair dye and bleach.

, A quality heat protectant will reduce damage from heat. Add this to your hair before blow-drying, using a flat iron, or any other styling treatment that involves heat.


Look for a heat protectant that also provides nutrients to improve shine and texture.

Choose a flat iron.,
Set your iron to the right temperature.,
Start with dry hair.,
Separate hair into layers.,
Iron each strand.",How to Straighten Your Hair Without Chemicals2," The most important element to choosing your straightening tool is to find one that feels natural and makes straightening easier for you. However, a good rule of thumb is to select flat irons that are thinner for short hair and thicker for long hair. Before choosing a flat iron, consider the thickness or type of your hair. Thicker hair may require a wider flat iron to straighten a relatively small section, as this hair type makes it more difficult for heat to penetrate the layers of hair. If you have very dry hair, choose a lower heat setting to avoid frying hair., Flat irons can heat up to 400 degrees Fahrenheit (204 Celsius) or higher. If your hair is thick or coarse, you’ll want to choose a high heat setting between 350 and 400 Fahrenheit (176 to 204 Celsius). If your hair is fine or damaged, use lower heat between 250 and 300 Fahrenheit (121 to 148 Celsius)., You can either blow dry or allow hair to air dry as you wish. Many people are under the mistaken assumption that blow drying damages hair. If you use a protectant spray, blow drying can actually make your hair healthier and easier to manage. This is largely due to the fact that blow drying prevents tangling that may occur when hair is allowed to air dry, and by brushing as you dry, the cuticles of hair are flattened making hair appear sleeker., Make sections on both sides of the head and down the back. Lift and separate the top layers of each section, and clip them to your head, leaving only the very bottom layer of hair free in each section., Starting with the bottom layer, select strands that are slightly thinner than your flat iron. You don’t want hair to get pulled or broken by attaching to other parts of the iron. Gently move the iron from the top of hair, as close to your head as possible, all the way to the tips of hair. Continue until each strand is straightened. Typically, you'll need to go over each strand at least three to four times, depending how curly your hair is."

Wrap your hair around your head.,
Brush your hair dry.,
Avoid a round brush.,
Use oversized rollers.,
Dry your hair in a bun.",How to Straighten Your Hair Without Chemicals3," This may seem like an unlikely way to straighten hair, but it actually works very well. Allow your hair to air dry almost completely. Then part hair into four or five sections. Pull each section tight and wrap it around. Then, pin it in place. Allow your hair to dry for several hours or overnight. When let down, hair will be dramatically straighter, and you can use a flat iron to straighten further, if you desire.


Depending on length and thickness you may need more or less sections, but the goal is to have a section you can wrap and pull tightly around your head and hold in place with a single pin.
Use bobby pins or other straight clips to avoid making kinks in the ends of your hair., Like blow drying or cool air drying, this technique relies on pulling the curls to gently straighten them. Brushing hair dry does not offer a perfectly straight finish, but it does significantly relax curls without heat or chemicals. Directly from the shower, pat hair dry with a towel. Once you’ve absorbed most of the excess moisture from hair, use a wide-toothed comb to brush out tangles. Then, brush hair continually until it dries., These types of brushes were often recommended for styling in the past, but unless you want to add a curl under or out to the ends of your hair, they don’t really deliver a straight, flat look. Instead, use a paddle brush with lots of soft bristles. These types of brushes are available in most pharmacies, beauty supply stores, and even in the big-box stores. They can range in price from ten to fifty dollars, but the quality tends to be fairly even. Save a few dollars, and buy the ten dollar model.

, Find hair rollers that are large enough to accommodate the length of your hair. If you have shorter hair, use a smaller roller, and if you have long hair, an extra-large roller will be necessary. The goal is to pull the hair tight over the roller without twisting or wrapping. Let the hair dry naturally, use cool air, or a blow dryer. When you take hair down, you’ll have a sleek, manageable locks.


You can start with damp hair or dry hair. If you put dry hair in the rollers, you will need heat to break the curls.
Brush any tangles out, and separate hair into three sections, one to each side of the head and the back.
Depending on the size the rollers, further section hair to lay flat against the roller, and clip or pin each roller in place.
Allow to air dry, cool dry, or use heat to straighten already dry hair. If you air dry, the process will take an hour or more. Cool drying typically cuts that time in half, and heated blow drying will usually only take ten or twenty minutes., This method works best with long hair. Like pinning hair around the head, this technique helps keep hair from kinking as it dries. The results are not as straight as some of the other techniques, but this is a great option for travel or to save time. You’ll wear damp hair in a bun until it dries, and when you let it down, your hair will have soft, manageable waves.


Pat dry hair with a towel, and gently brush it out with a comb
Brush hair back. Holding the hair like a ponytail near your scalp, twist it with the other hand. Then, roll the twisted hair into a bun.
You can hold hair in place using an elastic or several pins depending on preference.
Wear the bun to allow your hair to dry on the way to work, on a plane, or overnight."

Apply milk for natural sleekness.,
Use a coconut milk and lemon treatment.,
Try a castor oil leave in treatment.",How to Straighten Your Hair Without Chemicals4," This simple, one ingredient treatment will add moisture to hair and make it easier to straighten. You’ll need whole milk, a spray bottle, and a way to heat the milk. You start by boiling milk to release preservatives. Then, you’ll cool the milk before applying to hair. By leaving this treatment on for thirty minutes once a week, you’ll see significant improvement in the overall condition and manageability of your hair. If you have wavy hair, using a milk treatment may completely straighten it. For tighter curls, the milk provides a more relaxed wave, and improves the effect of other straightening methods.


Boil milk and pour into a spray bottle. Then, place the spray bottle in the refrigerator to cool.
Section damp hair and spray milk evenly covering every strand, and comb through hair.
Let the milk sit on hair for half an hour to 45 minutes. Then, wash and condition hair., These two ingredients are added to numerous products to improve shine, clean oil and buildup from the scalp naturally, and help hair retain moisture. A simple at-home treatment that combines the two will turn kinky, frizzy curls into sleek, manageable tresses.


Start with enough coconut milk to completely coat your hair. Overestimate to make sure you have enough.
Mix the fruit of one lemon into the coconut milk. Let the mixture cool in the refrigerator for about 20 minutes.
Starting with damp or dry hair, coat thoroughly and leave in for about an hour. Then, wash and condition as usual.
Lemon juice can also lighten your hair, so this may not be an ideal treatment, if you are trying to maintain your dye color., Castor oil is a great natural treatment for a number of health and beauty concerns. From dry skin to upset stomach, castor oil does it all. It’s also a simple way to relax curls. Castor oil seeps into hair follicles and naturally reduces kinks and curls, leaving hair sleeker and straighter.


Apply castor oil to damp or dry hair, and wrap hair in a towel. Use pins or clips to hold the towel in place.
Leave on at least an hour, but let the product sit over night for best results.

Research keratin treatment ingredients.",How to Straighten Your Hair Without Chemicals5," Even if you’re trying to avoid using chemicals, there are excellent products available to help you achieve the sleek look you’re after. One of the most important aspects of styling hair of any type is protecting it from the damage of heat. Heat protectants are available in a variety of forms, but they all coat hair and allow you to style without damaging your locks.


If you’re blow drying and flat ironing, you may need to reapply your protectant before you begin ironing.
Curly hair typically responds best to a cream-based or moisturizing heat protectant.
If your hair is frizzy, look for heat protectants that add weight to hair and avoid volumizing products.You can even make your own protectant spray at home to ensure the product is 100% natural.

, These are great products to keep hair smooth and shiny after styling, but it’s very important that they not be used to protect hair from heat. In fact, serums will boil when heated, and they can significantly damage hair. Instead, choose a natural smoothing serum that utilizes mineral oils to avoid adding unnecessary chemicals to your hair., In most cases, curly haired people need to find a shampoo that will clean their hair without drying it out. Look for shampoos that use gentle cleansers. The right conditioner is essential when it comes to straightening hair and maintaining a sleek, natural appearance. The chosen conditioner should add weight to hair, so the style holds. Look for shampoos and conditioners that are specifically geared toward straightening hair.


It’s best to find two shampoos that provide the result you’re looking for. Overtime, hair chemistry changes. When you notice your hair no longer feels better after cleaning, switch shampoos to reset your hair’s balance.If your hair is very damaged, consider adding a deep conditioner to your hair care routine once a week or every other week., Some of these products claim to be natural, but they contain harsh, damaging chemicals. However, if you choose keratin products with the right ingredients, they can offer easier to manage hair. Most of these treatments don’t actually straighten hair, and those that do typically rely on the harsh chemicals. However, keratin treatments do make hair more manageable, significantly reduce frizz, and soften curls that are kinky or tight. Essentially, keratin products make it easier to straighten your hair.


Before you buy, make sure the keratin treatment does not use formaldehyde, ammonia, peroxide, or thioglycolate.
Find products with silicone polymers. These will not damage hair, and they help the keratin lock onto the strands of hair for improved effect.
Many keratin products contain amino acids that are also great for hair. These are natural and preferable to chemical solutions as they improve your hair’s health while making curls more manageable."

Take special care of your ends.,
Apply shampoo carefully.,
Consider replacing shampoo with conditioner.,
Dry gently.,
Detangle hair carefully.",How to Stop Breakage and Damage to African Hair1," You may need to try several varieties of shampoo or conditioner before your hair health improves. Products made for African hair are a good place to start, but your search doesn't end there:


Avoid products with sulfates, alcohol, or glycol, which strip oils or dry out hair.
Look for moisturizing shampoo or conditioner, or ""leave in"" options that don't need to be washed out. Look at the description and directions on the bottle to identify which products are ""leave in"".
It can take several weeks to notice major changes. Give a product time to work before you give up on it, unless you notice drastic negative effects.;
, Washing is required to remove dirt and old oil, but too much can leave your hair fragile. People with fragile, African hair may want to wash only once every one or two weeks. If your hair is relatively healthy and you've found products that don't damage your hair, you can consider increasing this to twice a week.

, Rub coconut oil, jojoba oil, or another natural oil treatment into your hair, to restore and retain moisture. Leave the oil in for thirty minutes, then wash your hair as usual. This is especially important if you're using a shampoo that leaves your hair dry. Follow the same treatment before exposing your hair to chemical relaxers, heat appliances such as blow dryers and flat irons, or other stressful styling treatments.


For easy application, fill a spray bottle with conditioner, natural oil, and water. Shake well and spray onto your hair before shampooing, or daily if your hair is extremely dry.
Alternatively, apply a leave-in deep conditioner in the evening. Leave in overnight and wash or style your hair the next morning. Conditioner is essentially a cream that smooths the cuticle, softens hair, add sheen, and restores moisture.

, The ends of your hair have gone through more tugging and tangling than the rest of your hair. Give them some tender, loving care with an extra application of oil. Shea butter is especially effective at sealing in moisture.

, Rub shampoo on the scalp only, lathering very gently. This will unclog your pores, and clean your hair with a minimal amount of lather dripping down your hair. Rubbing shampoo directly on the ends can make them brittle.


For an even gentler treatment, dilute one part shampoo with two or three parts water.

, If your hair is still damaged after a few weeks, skip shampoo entirely and wash your hair with a cleansing conditioner instead. This will clean your hair without stripping it of moisture and protective oils.


Some people can wash as frequently as every other day with this treatment. Reduce frequency if you notice dry hair.
Some people prefer using a homemade conditioner for this purpose. You can use eggs, mayonnaise, yogurt, honey, olive oil, vinegar, or avocado. Rinse thoroughly after applying to remove any odor.

, After washing your hair, never rub it with a towel. Just gently squeeze sections of your with the towel, almost as if you were scrunching. There should be no pulling or yanking.


Replace the towel with a cotton T-shirt instead of extra-gentle drying.

, Lubricate the strands of your hair with oil before you begin detangling. With a wide-toothed comb, start detangling at the tip of the hair strand, working your way slowly to the root. Do not yank your hair. Slowly work out tangles and knots, or you will end up ripping your hair out.


After a certain thickness or length, it may help to section your hair and detangle each section separately.
Do not over-brush. Detangle slowly and only when necessary.
If detangling is painful, brush the outside of your hair with a wide brush first. Comb the lower layers of hair with a fine-toothed comb, if possible without tearing your hair.

Choose a moisturizing conditioner.,
Purchase a leave-in conditioner.,
Consider a steam treatment.,
Trap heat overnight instead.",How to Deep Condition Your Hair if You are a Black Female1," Moisturizing conditioner is ideal for most African hair, especially if the hair is dry and brittle, and breaks easily when brushed. (If the hair stretches before breaking, read the instructions for protein conditioning, below.) The ""moisturizing"" label on the front is a good start, but it's best to look at the ingredients list and instructions:


Ingredients that contain protein should be avoided in a moisturizing conditioner. This includes amino acids, casein, cholesterol, collagen, keratin, oat flour, and panthenol.
If the directions say to leave on for 2-5 minutes and rinse, this is not a deep conditioner. Look for a product intended to be left on for at least 15–20 minutes.;
, A leave-in conditioner will keep your hair in good shape between washing sessions. Buy one in addition to the other treatment(s) you selected.


A moisturizing leave-in conditioner is usually the best choice for African hair.

, Now that you've selected your product, decide which type of treatment to use. One option is a steam treatment, which lifts and opens the cuticles on the hair strand, allowing your hair to absorb more conditioner. This is ideal for dry, brittle hair, but more than two steam treatments a month may cause hygral fatigue. Here's a step by step explanation:


Wash you hair and gently squeeze it until damp, but not soaking wet.
Rub in deep conditioner. Focus on the ends, which are the weakest point, but condition all the way to the roots as well. Do not apply on the scalp.
Sit under the hair steamer for one complete cycle. If you don't own one, wrap hair in a hot, wet towel and cover with a plastic bag or shower cap for 15-20 minutes.
Rinse out conditioner with cold water. This closes the cuticle layer again, laying them flat to seal conditioner in and let strands glide past each other with minimal tangling. This also gives the hair a nice sheen.
Apply a moisturizing leave-in conditioner, then style.

, Many people find this method uncomfortable, but it's a good choice if you have dry, coarse, brittle hair. Also, this method can be used more often than the steam treatment without causing damage. Apply as follows, starting in the late evening:


Wash hair and squeeze until damp.
Apply moisturizing conditioner. Never use a conditioner that contains protein, as this can harden the hair and break it if left in longer than instructed on the label.
Cover with the thermal cap. If you don't have a thermal heat cap, use a plastic cap covered in a beanie or bandana.
Sleep with the cap on.
Cold rinse in the morning and apply a moisturizing conditioner before styling.

Wash your hair every 1 to 2 weeks with a moisturizing shampoo and conditioner.,

If you need to wash your hair more often, consider using just conditioner. This is known a ""co-washing"" and is safe to use regularly, because it doesn't strip hair of its moisture.
Consider rinsing your hair with cold water. This will help seal the hair cuticles, and make it appear smoother.;
, If you pile your hair on top of your head as you massage your hair and scalp, you will create tangles and make it more difficult to detangle later on. Instead, massage the hair, starting from close to the scalp and going down to the ends of the hair, to prevent your hair from tangling. Never use your fingernails to scrub your scalp.


Focus the shampoo on your scalp, and the conditioner on the ends of your hair.
It may be helpful to wash the hair in sections, especially if you have longer or thicker hair.

, Silicones are great for making hair smooth, but they can only be washed out using sulfates. Sulfates are harsh cleaning agents that strip hair of its moisture, leaving it dry and brittle. If you don't wash the silicones out, you will end up with build-up in your hair, which can leave it looking limp and greasy.


Just because a product says that it moisturizes, doesn't necessarily mean it's true. Always look at ingredients on the back label rather than empty promises on the front.

, After you have rinsed the shampoo out, divide your hair into sections, and apply the conditioner. Then, gently comb your hair with a wide-toothed comb. This will allow for a more-even distribution of the product. It will also make your hair easier to detangle later on. Rinse the conditioner out after a couple of minutes (or as per the conditioner’s directions).

, If you live in an area with hard water, consider getting a shower filter. Hard water contains minerals that can lead to build-up, and make your hair dry, brittle, and unmanageable. You can also use a chelating or clarifying shampoo once a month instead to clear up buildup and improve the state/manageability of your hair.

, Apply the deep conditioner to damp hair, then tuck your hair under a shower cap. Leave it there for 20 to 30 minutes before rinsing it out.


Heating caps can be used to boost the performance of the deep conditioner.
If you do not have a heating cap, tuck your hair under a plastic shower cap, then drape a towel over your head, like a hood. Use a blow dryer to heat the inside and outside of the towel.

, The leave-in conditioner will moisturize your hair, and the oil will help ""seal"" the moisture in. Make sure to cover all your hair with the leave-in and oil.


You can use just about any natural oil, including: Argan, almond, castor, coconut, jojoba, and olive.
You can also use natural butters, such as shea butter.

, Heat ½ to 1 cup (120 to 240 milliliters) of oil in a double boiler, then apply it to your hair. Tuck your hair under a shower cap for about 20 minutes, then rinse it out with shampoo. You can use any type of natural oil, such as: Argan, avocado, castor, coconut, jojoba, and olive.


Don't use a microwave, or you'll destroy the oil's nutrients.
Warm oil is easier for hair to absorb than room-temperature oil.

, Apply some leave-in conditioner, oil (such as coconut oil), and setting cream to your hair, then twist it. Cover your hair with a scarf or bonnet, and fluff it out the next day. On the third or fourth night, you can re-twist your hair. Spritz your hair with water to re-activate the leave-in conditioner, and reapply the oil and cream. Use a little bit less product than the first time, since the same products are already in your hair from before.

, If you have finer hair, you can use it as often as once a week. You can use either a store-bought protein mask, or make your own.


Consider massaging egg whites into your hair and letting it sit for ten minutes under a shower cap. Wash it out with cool water, not hot. Egg white contains vitamins which will make your hair healthy and strong.

, These are the oldest parts of your hair, and need the most moisture. Dry hair is brittle hair, and brittle hair tends to break easily. If you don't take good care of the ends of your hair, it will just keep on breaking; it won't ""grow"" very fast.

, Fine-toothed combs can snag and break hair, while brushes can lead to frizz. When combing your hair, remember to start from the tips, and work your way up. Never comb straight down from roots to ends.


You can also gently comb your hair out using your fingers.

, Try to use a lower temperature, if you can, as heat protectant sprays can only do so much. It may take longer to get the results you want, but it will be safer for your hair.


When heat styling, don't go above 380°F (195°C).
Great styles that enable you to cut down on harsh heating tools include: roller sets, braid-outs, twist-outs, bantu knot outs, buns, and ponytails.

, This is the safest way to dry your. Consider putting your hair into twists or braids first. When you take them out, after your hair dries, you'll end up with beautiful curls. Avoid drying your hair out in the sun, however, as the sun's rays can be just as harmful to your hair as your skin. If you must dry your hair out in the sun, consider using a UV protectant spray for hair first.

, Never rub your hair with a towel, as this can lead to frizz and breakage. Instead, gently pat it dry, preferably with a microfiber cloth or towel. You can also use a t-shirt instead. To preserve your curls, consider wrapping your hair in a microfiber towel or t-shirt instead.

, If your hair is long, or not already in a protective style (such as braids or twists), consider putting your hair into a high ponytail or high bun. This will help preserve curls and prevent your hair from getting tangled and roughed up as you toss and turn throughout the night.


You can also use a silk or satin scarf or bonnet instead.
Cotton pillowcases are not recommended because they draw the moisture out of your hair. They also tend to be coarse, and can lead to snags, frizz, and breakage.

, At the same time, however, avoid braiding your hair too tightly, as this can weaken the hair follicles and lead to hair loss. Also, remember to care for your hair and scalp. You should wash and condition your hair at least every two weeks.


After taking your braids out, be sure to detangle your hair before washing it. If you don't do this, your hair will get matted.
Consider giving your hair and scalp some time to recover from the pulling involved with braiding/twisting every once in a while.

Determine your hair type.,
Wash your hair only when you must.,
Let hair dry on its own.,
Use conditioner each time you wash. Shampoo strips your hair of natural oils.,
Apply hair oil daily.,
Moisturize.,
Consider protein conditioner.,
Grease your scalp when dry.,
Remove products with neutralizing shampoo.",How to Grow African Hair Faster and Longer1," A salon employee or online advice can help you find the characteristics of your hair. This will help you choose the right treatments and products. Here's the basic breakdown:


Wavy hair (type 2), generally thin and easy to handle
Curly hair (type 3)
Coily hair (type 4), usually very fragile and hard to grow out;
, Washing hair too often strips it of natural oils. Try washing it once a week. Switch to once every two or three weeks if your hair starts to break easily.


Try to find a shampoo that doesn't leave your hair feeling too dry.
To reduce damage, wash hair in lukewarm water and rinse in cool water.

, The heat from blow drying can cause damage, leading your hair to break before it grows to the desired length. Instead, plait your hair, wrap it in a silk scarf, and let dry overnight. Alternatively, towel dry your hair by wrapping it in a towel and simply rubbing your head for a while.

, Restore these with conditioner suited for African hair. Periodically deep condition your hair as well.


You can use leave-in conditioner in between washes.

, Rub natural oil into the middle and ends of your hair to make it soft and supple. This will help prevent it breaking before it grows too long. Jamaican oil, castor oil, Moroccan oil, or lavender oil are all good options.


Covering your hair with a satin scarf can help your hair take in the oil.

, Water strengthens dry hair and may stimulate your hair roots. You can apply water, moisturizing conditioner, or a mixture of half olive oil or half coconut oil. For extra moisture, apply each one, in that order. The oil will help seal in the moisture.


If you use gel or mousse in your hairstyle, try hair jam instead. This will hold your hair, then eventually melt into oils to add shine and moisture.

, These can strengthen some types of hair, but may damage dry hair. Try brushing your hair: if your strands stretch significantly before breaking, you may need more protein.


Do not leave in protein conditioner longer than instructed on the label, or it may turn hard and brittle.

, About every other day or when your scalp feels dry, apply coconut grease to the tip of your pointer finger. Apply at the top of your part and sweep back until all the grease has been applied.


Stop if you notice dandruff, as oil can feed the fungus that causes it.
If you have a perm, grease only once a week, or apply hot oil instead.

, Once a month, use a neutralizing shampoo to clean all products out of your hair. If you use a lot of sprays, gels, and other styling products, use it every other week.

Protect your hair while sleeping.,
Change your style before it tangles.",How to Detangle African Hair," Using your fingers, divide your hair into convenient sections. If you have long hair, twist it into four or more sections. If you have shorter hair, use hair clips instead. Either way, treat your hair as gently as possible.


Although working with sectioned hair takes longer, it greatly reduces the amount of tangling that can happen.;
, Wash one section at a time, and clip or twist it again once done. Smooth your hair back over your scalp until it feels fully wet. Gently apply the shampoo or other washing treatment in a smoothing motion from scalp to tip. Massage the scalp with your fingertips, then wash thoroughly with water. Tilt your head back and wash in the direction your hair falls to reduce tangling.


Try a gentle washing method, such as co-washing, homemade cleansing mixtures, or shampoo that doesn't contain sulfates, paraben, or silicone. Sulfates, paraben, and silicone are damaging to hair and cause frizz and hair damage such as split ends and dry hair.
Do not pile hair on top of your head while washing. This will only cause more tangles and breakage. If your hair is very tangled when wet, consider taking a wide tooth comb in the shower to help loosen knots carefully. Being too rough or using a brush may split ends shorter or cause damage.

, Section by section, saturate your hair with a conditioner that has plenty of ""slip."" A conditioner with good slip makes it easy for your hair strands to slide past each other, practically undoing tangles by themselves. Detangler conditioners, hair mayonnaise, or other creamy conditioners generally work best. You may need to try several to find one that works on your hair type.


Whenever applying conditioner, focus on the ends of the hair, the oldest and most easily damaged area.
You can make your own detangler conditioner from Aloe vera. Cut the Aloe vera leaf in the middle, scoop out the gel and blend it until it is foamy and slightly gel-like.
Olive oil or another medium or heavy natural oil can work as well.

, Cover your conditioner-coated hair with a plastic cap. Leave on for 10–20 minutes to allow your hair to absorb the oils.

, Let out one section of your hair. Detangle as much as possible with your fingers. Do not use force.


If your hair starts to dry out, add more water. The weight of the water pulls your hair downward, lengthening curls and making them less likely to tangle.

, If your fingers can't do the job, move on to a seamless wide-toothed comb or a widely spaced, rubber bristled brush (such as a Denman brush). Start from the ends, gradually combing from higher points as the hair detangles.


After detangling each section, the hair should be braided, twisted, or hair clipped in such a way that it won't tangle back up.

, Detangler conditioner is usually too thick to leave in comfortably. Rinse out and apply a lighter, leave-in conditioner instead. Style your hair as you do normally.


Most conditioner labels say to rinse out with warm water, but some stylists get better results with cold.

, Regular deep conditioning restores natural oils, keeping your hair smooth. For best results, deep condition right after detangling.



Hot oil treatments are another good option.

, Put up your hair at night and wear a satin or silk hair bonnet. At minimum, sleep on a satin or silk pillowcase instead of cotton, which can tear out your hair or tangle it.

, While braids, twists, and other protective styles reduce exposure to damage, they can't do so forever. Leaving them in for too long can cause stubborn tangles.

Minimize any styling that tugs at your hair.,
Choose a protective style.,
Use relaxer sparingly.,
Ask for a keratin treatment at the salon.",How to Stop Breakage and Damage to African Hair2," Any chemical treatment that changes the color or structure of your hair weakens it and leads to breakage. Box dyes are especially damaging to African hair. Visit a salon instead for dyes that are less harmful, but still not completely safe.

, Heat can dry out your hair, sometimes irreparably damaging individual strands. When you do use heat treatments, take the following precautions:


Apply heat protectant before you begin. Spray on, brush to distribute through the hair, and wait for it to dry.
When blow drying, pull the hair downward with a vented, round brush. Direct the heat downward to flatten the cuticle, instead of lifting and frizzing it.
Set your blow dry to blow cool air for a safer, but longer, drying process.
When visiting the salon, ask your stylist for low-heat options.

, Limit the use of glued-in extensions, tight braids, tight cornrows, and hard, gel hairstyles. These place excessive amounts of stress on the hair. Loose braids and cornrows are fine.


Wear styles that keep your hair out of your face, so you’re not constantly moving it, tucking it behind your ears, or arranging it with pins. The less you have to handle your hair, the longer it will stay healthy.

, Choose a style that keeps your hair ends tucked away where they won't get damaged. You can do this with cornrows, braids, two-strand twists, bantu knots, or finger coils. Loose, larger braids and knots are less likely to break.


Remember, keep the style loose to minimize tension on your hair.
Even if you don't like this as a permanent style, use it overnight to protect your hair in your sleep.
You may even be able to mist or wash with conditioner without removing the style.

, Relaxing and straightening treatments tend to contain harsh chemicals. Use them only when your hair is healthy, and stop if you notice damage. Here's a rough guide to determine how often you can get away with relaxing:


For coarse hair — relax every 2-3 months.
For fine hair — relax every 3-5 months.
For super fine/soft hair —relax hair every 6 months

, Keratin is the natural protein found in hair. In this treatment, the protein will penetrate the hair under the cuticle to make it strong and smooth.


Home-use products that contain keratin are more budget friendly, but may not be as effective.

, A healthy diet ensures that you hair has all the nutrients you need. Getting your daily supply of vitamins, minerals, and protein is especially important for healthy hair growth.


Talk to your doctor before you consider supplements. Vitamin supplements or biotin may help in some cases, but they can have serious side effects. A doctor can check whether you're deficient in these substances, and prescribe a safe, effective dosage.

, This will keep your hair smooth and reduce damage and tangling.


You can add a few drops of olive oil to the hair at night for extra conditioning. This makes your hair more manageable, shiny, and easy to comb.

, Your clothes could be causing your hair to shed and break. In the winter, that cute wool cap and coat are rubbing against the ends of your hair, splitting and damaging them. Line your cap with a satin bonnet and tuck in the ends to protect them.

However, they can also dry out your hair. Brush your hair and watch how the strands snap to find out whether protein will help or hurt:


If your strands stretch, then break, you need more protein.
If your hair snaps off easily without stretching, look for conditioners that do not contain protein.

, Protein-heavy conditioners may be sold as ""hair mayonnaise"" or ""protein conditioner."" For a more accurate choice, check the ingredients. Conditioner ingredients with protein include amino acids, casein, cholesterol, collagen, keratin, oat flour, and panthenol. Of course, anything with the word ""protein"" in it is another good choice.

, Wash your hair, then gently squeeze it to remove excess moisture. Do not rub with the towel, which can cause damage.

, Rub the product into your hair. The ends are usually most in need of strengthening, but rub all the way to your roots as well. You do not need to apply this to your scalp.

, There are three different ways to ""cook"" a protein treatment into your hair:


Cover with a thermal cap.

Or cover with a plastic cap covered by a beanie or bandana. (This is essentially a homemade thermal cap.)

Or cover with a plastic cap, then sit under a bonnet dryer. The plastic cap is necessary to avoid damage.

, Always follow instructions that come with your protein treatment. Leaving it in too long will create hard, brittle hair, defeating the purpose.

, Seal in the product with a cold rinse.

, Protein can dry out your hair, so restore lost moisture with a moisturizing conditioner. Make sure this contains no protein.

, Beat the egg, then massage it in thoroughly. Cover your hair with a plastic bag or a shower cap. Leave this in for about half an hour to feed your hair vital nutrients. Wash the egg out of your hair.


Because eggs contain protein, this treatment may not be ideal for weak hair that stretches and breaks when brushed.

, You can use just about any kind of vegetable oil, but coconut oil and jojoba oil are recommended. Pour enough oil to fill about ¼ of a tea cup (about ⅛ measuring cup or 30mL). Massage this into your hair, replace the shower cap, and move on to the next step. This will soften your hair to a healthy, supple texture.


You can use sunflower oil or other cooking oils, but these may smell bad.
You can even use an avocado if you have no oil.

, This will ""cook"" the oil into your hair, restoring shine and flexibility. At the salon, all you need to do is sit under the dryer. At home, sit on a chair and let your head hang backwards with your hair over a bucket of boiling water. Either way, this takes about 30 minutes.

, Add a few drops of vinegar to the water to reduce dandruff.

, You need low heat setting to dry African hair so that hair does not become brittle. To dry quickly and effectively, clip your hair into several segments. For each segment, comb out and blow dry lines of hair one by one. Finish the whole segment before moving on to the next.

, Leaving your hair down can make your hair vulnerable to breakage. Put your hair in a bun, braids, or other style the keeps your ends tucked away. Fasten your hairdo with bobby pins, since elastic bands can rip out your hair.

, Trim the ends of your hair every two weeks, or whenever they start to split. If your hair is healthy, you may only need to remove 1–2 inches (2.5–5cm) every three or four months. It may seem odd to trim your hair to help it grow, but it really does help. Split ends rapidly lead to breakage, making it very hard to grow your hair out.

Use a finishing product.",How to Straighten Your Hair1," Straightening your hair works best on freshly washed or day-old hair. When washing your hair, tailor your shampoo and conditioning products to your hair type. For thick, frizzy hair, use a smoothing shampoo and conditioner. For thin, flat hair, use volumizing products. Once hair is washed, give it a quick towel dry, then blow-dry with a hair dryer. This will help to pre-straighten your hair, so you will have less work to do with the straightening iron.


Dry the roots of your hair with the hair dryer first, then work through the lengths of your hair.
Turn your head upside down while drying to add more volume.
Use a paddle brush to work through tangles and hold hair taut as you dry.;
, Investing in a good heat protection spray which you apply every time you straighten is one of the best things you can do for your hair, without forgoing straightening altogether. The heat protection spray locks in moisture and prevents hair from becoming dry and frazzled. Apply the heat protection spray evenly over dry hair, holding the can about six inches away from your head.Don't apply the heat protection spray to your roots, as this can cause them to look greasy.
Heat protection sprays can be found at most drug stores and hair salons. It may be worth investing in a brand name product which will do a better job of protecting your hair. Try asking your hair stylist for recommendations.

, Dividing your hair into sections will ensure that you straighten your hair properly, without missing any strands. The easiest way to section your hair is to divide it into three layers.









Create the first layer by taking the front sections of your hair and scooping them back with your thumbs to grab all of the hair on the crown of your head. Separate this layer by twisting it and securing it with a hair tie or butterfly clip.Create the second layer by scooping up the hair that remains above your ears and securing with a hair tie or clip.
The third layer consists of any hair which remains unclipped, which should be the hair at the back of your head, growing around the nape of your neck.
If you have very thick hair, you can divide your hair into extra layers. If you have very thin or fine hair, you may not need to divide hair at all, or you can just split it into two sections.

, Most good quality hair straighteners give you the option to adjust the temperature of the irons. Using the right temperature for your hair will ensure you get the best results and will prevent you from doing unnecessary damage to your hair. The temperature your straightener should be set to will depend on your hair type:Fine or damaged hair should use a temperature of between 200 and 300 °F (93-149 °C).Hair of average thickness which is in pretty good condition should use a temperature of between 300 and 350 °F (149-177 °C).Very thick or coarse, frizzy hair should use a temperature of 350 to 400 °F (177-205°C)., Straightening your hair with a straightening irons does not involve anything very complicated, but there are a number of helpful tips you can follow in order to achieve the best results:









Use the right size strands. For best results, straighten your hair in strands that are 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) wide and no more than half an inch thick. IF you use sections that are much bigger, your hair won't straighten properly, but if you use smaller sections, it will take too long.
Hold the hair taut. Use one hand to hold the section of hair taut as you clamp the straightening iron around it and smooth it through the hair. If it's not completely straight the first time, don't worry, just pull the straightener through again.
Begin straightening about an inch away from the roots. This will leave a little volume in your hair and make sure it doesn't look too flat.
Use smooth rather than jerky movements. Try to run the straightening iron over the hair in one smooth, fluid movement. If you move it jerkily, you will end up with horizontal lines across your hair.

, If this happens, it means that your hair is not fully dry. Stop, turn off the hair straightener and use a hair dryer to get your hair completely dry before you resume straightening. Using a straightening irons on damp hair is very damaging and will leave your hair in bad condition, so avoid whenever possible.








, Once you have straightened the bottom layer of hair, unclip the next section and begin to straighten it using the same technique as before. The top layer of hair should be the last section of hair you straighten.








, It can be easy to overlook a strand or two throughout the straightening process. Don't forget to check the back. If you spot any waves or kinks, just go over them with the straightener one more time.


You can check the back of your hair by standing with your back to a mirror while you hold a second mirror in your hands. You should be able to see the reflection of the back of your head in the hand-held mirror.

, You may need to position the straightening iron in a certain way to get it out of your face or to help it style a certain way. Twist the iron slightly when you get to the end of each strand to create little flicks at the bottom.









It’s very important to do these touch ups before applying any finishing products because some styling products (such as hairspray) are flammable and can catch fire under the heat of a straightening iron.

, You can use a silicone-based serum to add shine, or spray your hair with hair spray to hold your hair in place. Just don't add any mousse or water-based product as this will dampen the hair and cause it to turn wavy.

",How to Straighten Your Hair With a Flat Iron," Wash your hair, then blow dry or allow it to air dry until slightly damp. Blow drying may make your hair a little straighter already, saving you some time.;
, Remove all tangles. The heat protectant will distribute more evenly if you brush or comb thoroughly beforehand. There should definitely not be any tangles left by the time you start straightening, or the process will leave crimps and knots.

, Spray lightly onto your entire head of hair. Quickly comb your hair a second time to distribute the heat protectant evenly.


Damp hair absorbs heat protectant more effectively, but you can still apply it to dry hair.
You may use argan oil or other natural heat protectants instead, but set the iron to low temperature to protect your hair further. This will make it less effective.

, Blow dry or allow to air dry completely. Never straighten your hair while wet, as the iron may burn or damage wet hair.

, Plug in the flat iron and let it heat up for three to five minutes, while you get started on the next step. Choose a temperature setting based on your hair:


For thin hair, use the lowest heat setting.
For average hair thickness, use medium heat (about 300–350ºF / 150–177ºC).
For thick hair, use high heat (400–450ºF / 200–232ºC). To be safe, you may want to start lower and work your way up until you can straighten the hair in one pass.
If you aren't using heat protectant, use low temperatures only. Be aware that there is a high risk of burning.

, The thicker the hair, the more sections you need. People with thin hair can skip this step or divide it into two to four sections, while people with thick hair may need many more. Clip every section out of your way, except for one section of the lowest layer.


You'll be working with locks of hair 1–2 inches (2.5–5 cm) thick. Each section can include several locks of hair, as long as it's convenient and easy to separate and hold one lock at a time.
Section off the top section of your hair by lifting it and tying or clipping it in a half ponytail. You'll need total access to the lower layers of hair.

, Starting with the lowest layer of hair, separate a lock of hair 1–2 inch (2.5–5 cm) wide. This should be small enough that you can fit the flat iron around it easily, and straighten it in one pass.

, Place your flat iron 1–3 inches (2.5–7.5 cm) above your scalp. Close the two heated sides together, with the hair between them. Straightening too close to your may damage the roots or burn your scalp.


Be sure not to clamp too firmly, as this will create a ridge at the top of your hair. Leaving the iron in one place for too long will also cause a ridge.
If there is excess hair falling out of the iron, open the iron and try again with a smaller amount of hair.

, Slowly run the iron down the length of your hair. Keep the same amount of pressure on the hair at all times. Don't twist or move the iron from its path, or you may end up with crimps in your hair.


It is normal to see steam coming from your hair and the iron Your hair is not burning; this is just the heat protectant evaporating a little.
If you see a lot of steam, or smell burning hair, move the iron more quickly.
If your hair is particularly curly or frizzy, start with a few short strokes near the top, before dragging slowly as described.

, If the lock of hair isn't straight after the first try, go over it a second time. If this keeps happening, use smaller locks of hair or raise the iron temperature.


Multiple passes with a low-temperature iron can cause more damage than a single pass with a high-temperature iron.

, Once you've finished one section, unpin the next and repeat. Work from the lowest layers of hair up to the surface.


Pay extra attention to the very back of your head. It's easy to miss a kink hiding out of your sight.

, If you're left with a few flyaway hair strands, try smoothing them down with one of the following:


Rub in a drop of hair oil, about the size of a pea or even smaller.
Spray a little hairspray over the flyaway strands, and comb them down. You may apply hairspray over all your hair to protect from wind and moisture. Hold the can 12 to 14 inches (30–38 cm) away from your hair.

, Plan on straightening your hair in at least three layers. If you have very thick hair, or just a lot of it, you will have to work in thinner sections., Take a small, 1 to 2-inch (2.54 to 5.08-centimeter) section of hair, and clamp your iron over it, as close as you can to your scalp without burning yourself.

, Instead of pulling the iron straight down, pull it upwards towards the ceiling by a few inches/centimeters. When you get halfway across your hair, pull the iron away from your head. Pulling the iron upwards helps create volume, while pulling it away makes it easier on your arm.If your hair is too hot for you to touch, use a hairbrush to handle it. It might also be a good sign that your hair straightener is set to too high of a temperature; you might want to lower the temperature a little.

, Once you are done, you can move on to the next layer, or gently tease your hair first.

If you do take a shower, make sure you apply conditioner.If you are going to wash your hair right before straightening it, consider washing and conditioning your hair with products that contain smoothing agents, such as argan.This will help prepare your hair for straightening better than regular shampoo and conditioner.;
, It is important to make sure your hair is tangle free before you wrap it. Use a wide toothed comb or hairbrush.








Be patient but gentle. Get any knots out without pulling hard by starting at the bottom of your hair and working up the strands gradually, getting a few inches clear of knots at a time.

, Put a small amount of oil into your palm and then work it into your hair. This will help to lock moisture into your hair.








Avoid water-based moisturizers. They can make your hair become wavy or curly again.

Wash with a gentle shampoo to avoid stripping your hair before you use heat on it and make it more prone to damage. To ensure that your hair is properly hydrated, follow up with a straightening conditioner. They typically contain moisturizing ingredients, such as argan oil, coconut water, and macadamia oil, that help smooth your hair.Thick hair tends to be dry, so if yours is particularly dehydrated, wash with a moisturizing shampoo for added hydration.
If your hair is very dry or damaged, you may want to use a deep conditioning mask before you straighten your hair. They are thicker than traditional conditioners, and typically sit on your hair for 10 to 20 minutes before you wash off the formula.;
, When you’re done washing and conditioning your hair, use a towel to dry it until it’s only damp. Partially drying your hair before you blow dry means less time that you’ll have to use the heat on it, which is important when you’re going to be using a straightening iron.








For the best results, use a microfiber towel to dry your hair. The material is more absorbent and softer than traditional cotton so it doesn’t rough up your cuticles as much while you’re drying.

, Heat can be very damaging to hair, so it’s important to protect your locks before you blow dry and straighten them. A heat protectant product coats the hair so it doesn’t burn as easily and dry out. You can find heat protectant sprays and lotions, but creams typically work best for thick hair.








Argan oil can work well as a heat protectant too.
A little bit of heat protectant goes a long way, so don’t apply too much. Use just enough to lightly coat the length of your hair. You don’t need to apply it to the top of your head or scalp.

, Thick hair usually requires a little extra work to straighten, so it helps to blow dry it first. For the smoothest hair, though, use a round bristle brush as you dry your locks. Work the brush through your hair to pull it as straight as possible so you won’t need the straightening iron to do as much work. Make sure your hair is completely dry before reaching for the straightening iron.








You should never use your straightening iron on damp hair. That can cause serious damage and breakage because the moisture on your hair can actually boil it.
To keep from overheating your hair, switch between your blow dryer’s hot and cool settings as you dry it.
Choose a brush with natural bristles or a combination of natural and synthetic bristles. Using a brush with entirely synthetic bristles may cause frizz.
If you’re concerned about using too much heat on your hair, you can also allow your hair to air dry. But be sure that it’s completely dry before you straighten it. If your hair is extremely thick, curly, or wavy, though, blow drying with a round brush may be necessary to get it as straight as possible.

, Straightening or flat irons come with plates in a variety of sizes. Typically, the thicker that your hair is, the larger the plates you should use. For thick, coarse hair, your straightening iron should have 1- to 2-inch plates. That will allow you to cover a larger surface area in less time.For thick hair above the shoulders or shorter, choose an iron with plates that are between 1- and 1 ½-inches wide.
For thick hair that’s shoulder length and longer, opt for an iron with plates that are between 1 ½- and 2-inches wide.

, Some straightening irons only come with low, medium, and high heat settings. However, it’s best to choose an iron that allows you to choose a precise temperature. That’s because you want to use the lowest amount of heat possible to straighten your hair, so it helps to be able to select a specific temperature setting.For thick, coarse hair, you usually need to set the straightening iron between 350 and 400 degrees, so make sure that yours is adjustable to that range.
When you’re straightening, start at 350 degrees and see if the iron can successfully straighten your hair at that temperature. If it’s not hot enough, adjust by 10 or so degrees, stopping when you find the temperature that is hot enough to do the job.

, The plates in a straightening iron can be made of several different types of material, and some do more damage to your hair than others. The best option for straightening thick hair are plates made of ceramic, titanium, or tourmaline because they heat more evenly so they don’t damage the hair as much. They also release negative ions that can help make your hair smoother and shinier.Avoid straightening irons that are made of ceramic- or teflon-coated plates. They don’t heat evenly, so they can easily dry out thick hair.

, A straightening iron typically requires several minutes before it heats up to the right temperature. Plug your iron in, and adjust the heat settings according the instructions. Most irons will alert you when they’ve reached the proper temperature by either beeping or lighting up in a certain spot.








Wait until your straightening iron is fully heated before using it on your hair. Using it at too low a temperature can be bad for your locks because you’ll need to go over the same sections of hair more than once to get it completely smooth.

, When you’re straightening your hair, it’s best to work in small sections so you can be sure to smooth all of it. That’s especially true with thick hair, which tends to be more difficult to straighten. Start by dividing your hair in half and clipping the top section to your head. Divide the lower half into sections that are approximately 1- to 2-inches wide, depending on the size of your iron’s plates.








Dividing your hair into sections can help keep you from accidentally running the iron over sections that you’ve already straightened and exposing them to too much heat.
The thicker your hair is, the more sections that you should create for straightening.
Once you finish with the bottom section of hair, unclip the top half and begin smoothing it.

, Starting approximately a half inch below the roots of your hair, quickly glide the straightening iron over each section of hair. Keep your pace steady, so the iron doesn’t linger in any one spot longer than another.








Keep in mind that you may have to go over some sections of hair more than once to completely straighten them.
It helps to use a hand mirror to look at the sections at the back of your head to ensure that they’re as straight and smooth as you’d like.

, For the sections of hair at the crown of your head, you need to adjust your straightening movements. Lift the sections away from your scalp so you can get the straightening iron as close to your roots as possible, and pull the iron outward from your head to get the smoothest finish.








Press firmly as you move the iron over your hair and out from your head to ensure that your hair is as straight as possible.

, To finish off your straight style, you should apply a silicone-based shine product after you straighten your hair. For thick, coarse hair, a serum works best. Apply two to three drops to your palm, and work it between your hands. Lightly smooth it over the length of your hair to coat the strands so they catch the light.








Be careful not to apply too much shine serum. It can wind up making your hair look greasy.
The roots are usually the healthiest part the hair, so they don’t usually require extra shine. Apply your shine product only to the length of your hair.

",How to Straighten the Back of Your Hair," If your hair is fine, you should choose a lightweight, volumizing shampoo and conditioner.After you leave the shower, a volumizing mousse with heat protection is an excellent choice to defend your hair from heat damage. If your hair is thick/coarse, choose a smoothing shampoo and conditioner.Though not absolutely necessary for straightening your hair, when you exit the shower, you should consider a smoothing serum with heat protection to keep your hair undamaged.


Using heat protecting hair product will help prevent your hair from getting damaged when using a hair straightener.
You can determine which smoothing serum will work best for your hair by doing a quick Internet search for ""smoothing serum with heat protection.""
All natural ingredients are oftentimes gentler on your hair than chemical based products.;
, Make sure you do this thoroughly until your hair is fully dry. You can aid the process by using a bristle brush, brushing while drying so as to straighten your hair as much as possible.Too much heat can damage your hair, even in the blow-drying stage.

, Two layers should suffice, but if your hair is especially thick or long, or if you just want to be extra meticulous, feel free to add more.You can do this by clipping your top layer to the top hairs of your head. The bottommost layer will be where you begin straightening. A part in the middle will help you bring the hair over your shoulder and around the side of your head where you will be able to straighten it more easily.


It may be helpful to approach your mirror on an angle, so that you have a better view of the back of your head where you are layering.

, You will have the best results if you choose a flatiron that suits your hair type. Narrower plates will help you iron smaller sections with greater precision, while wider plates will assist you in covering more area in less time.



Short, thick, and fine hair: narrow plated flatirons, ranging from half-an-inch to one-inch thick, will enable you to work smaller sections with greater ease.

Long, thick, and fine hair: wider plated flatirons will cover more surface area, making one-and-a-half-inch to two-inch thick irons potentially your best option., The heat of your flatiron should correspond to the temperature best suited for you hair type, and you should wait until your flatiron is fully heated before using it. You should always follow your flatiron's instructions, but generally you should straighten hair at the following temperatures:


Fine or damaged hair: 250-300 degrees
Medium or average hair: 300-350 degrees
Thick or coarse hair: 350-400 degrees

, Take your hair one segment at a time, splitting each segment into inch wide strands.Utilizing your center part to bring your hair over your shoulder or to the side where you can most easily work it, straighten your hair one segment at a time. Do so by taking your fully heated flatiron horizontally, slowly sliding it from the root of your hair until you reach the end of your segment.


Check each hair segment after straightening by angling your handheld mirror so that you can see the reflection of the back of your head.
It is especially important to get as close to your scalp as possible to ensure the entire length of the strand is straight. Take your time and be careful; you don't want to burn your scalp.
Keep in mind that the slower you slide the iron down each strand of hair, the more likely your hair could become damaged. You can help prevent this damage by using a heat protecting spray.
If the ends of your hair flip out, which is quite common for shorter hair when you iron straight downwards, it may help to try flipping your iron inwards instead of straight down.
Run the comb through your hair after ironing. This will help with split ends and knots.

, Brush out your next layer of hair once you have unclipped it from the top of your head. This will help you avoid running into any knots when you start straightening your hair.


Parting your next layer down the middle, same as the first layer, can help make it easier to pull your hair to the side you can most easily work on it.

, Again, in manageable, inch wide segments, straighten your hair from root to tip. Hold your iron horizontally, and be sure to use smooth, steady motions, without pausing too long in any one place to prevent heat damage.

, As with the middle layer of your hair, brush out the top layer as straight and tangle free as possible. Part your final layer down the middle. When your hair is ready, use your flatiron to straighten inch wide segments of hair from root to tip, taking care to get as close to your scalp as possible.


When you feel you are finished, brush your hair lightly again and check it thoroughly with a handheld mirror. If you find your straightening job wasn't quite good enough, isolate the trouble areas with clips or ties, and flatiron again.
Keep in mind that the more heat applied to your hair over time, the higher the chance your hair will be damaged by the heat. Consider applying spray-in heat protectant when isolating trouble areas.

Only apply conditioner to the ends and mid-lengths of your hair. If you apply it to the roots, you hair will look flat and greasy.
Use a wide-toothed comb to work out any tangles while the conditioner is in your hair. The conditioner will make it much easier and will minimize hair breakage.

, Once you step out of the shower, wrap your hair in an absorbent, microfiber towel and leave it for a minute or two. Then unwrap your hair and use your towel to gently dab or blot your hair to get rid of any excess moisture.


Don't rub your hair with the towel, as this will cause your hair to break.
Remember that you are not trying to dry your hair with the towel, it should still be pretty damp when you're finished towel drying.

, Use a wide-tooth comb or paddle brush to part and comb your hair. Make sure to be gentle because damp hair is very fragile. Remember to work from the ends upwards, rather than from the roots down, as this will cause less breakage.









Defining your part while your hair is still wet will help it stay more naturally after it’s been dried and straightened.
If your hair is very knotted, try spraying it with a detangling mist or a leave-in conditioner.

, Apply a small amount of straightening serum or cream to the ends and mid-lengths of your hair and massage it in. This will help to make your hair extra smooth and sleek after drying.









If you can find a straightening product which contains a heat protection element, all the better.
Again, avoid applying these products to the roots, as they will weigh hair down.

, A good hair dryer is essential when you are trying to blow dry your hair straight. The more power and heat a hair dryer can provide, the easier and faster you can straighten your hair. If you need to invest in a new hair dryer, there are several things you should consider:


Wattage. The wattage of a hair dryer is an indication of how powerful an air flow it has. The higher the wattage you can get, the better. Most salon hair dryers have a wattage of around 1800, though a wattage of 2000 may be necessary for very thick or curly hair.Speed and Temperature Controls. Having a hair dryer with adjustable speeds and temperatures is a major bonus, as you will use different settings to achieve different styles. For example, a cool setting can be used to finish your hair with a blast of cold air, which helps to set the style while adding shine.Weight. The last thing you want is a heavy hair dryer which is going to tire out your arm when you're just halfway through a blow dry. Look for a hair dryer which weighs less than two pounds. The weight should be indicated on the box.Attachments. If you are using a hair dryer to blow dry your hair straight, you will definitely need a nozzle attachment which concentrates the air flow and prevents hair from frizzing. Check to see if a nozzle attachment is included with your hair dryer or if it needs to be purchased separately., Turn your hair dryer on (to a high speed and heat, if possible) and begin roughly drying your hair. Concentrate on drying your roots, using your fingers to lift and separate your hair. You shouldn't use a brush just yet.








Make sure that the hair dryer is pointing downwards. It should be blowing hair down from the crown of your head, rather than upwards.You should continue rough drying your hair until it is about 60% to 80% dry, but no more., Dividing your hair into sections before you finish blow drying is a good idea, as it will help you to focus on straightening one layer of hair at a time. Split your hair into three layers - one at the crown of your head, one at the middle sections and one at the nape of your neck. Use butterfly clips or hair ties to keep the top two layers out of the way for now.









If you have bangs, leave them down and dry them first, before you dry the bottom layer. This is because bangs will dry quickly and they will be harder to straighten once dry.

, The type of hairbrush you use while blow drying your hair will have an impact on how your hair turns out. If you want to add volume while you straighten, or add a slight curl or flick to the ends, use a thick round brush. But if you want poker-straight locks, a paddle-brush is your best option., Take a section of hair between two and four inches wide and hold it taut with the hairbrush. Keeping the hair taut while drying is the most important technique in achieving straight hair.








You also need to make sure that you are directing the air flow downwards - the nozzle of the hair dryer should be pointing towards the ends of the hair as you dry. This keeps the hair cuticle down, giving you a smoother, sleeker result.Once you have completely dried each section of hair, finish it off with a blast of cool air to help set the style and add shine., Once you have completely dried the bottom layer of hair, remove the butterfly clip holding the middle layer. Dry this layer of hair using the same technique as before. Once the second layer is completely dry, let down the third and final layer and finish off your blow dry.









Once your hair is completely dry, it should look straight and sleek. If it's still a little wavy, you may need to dry it further, really using the brush to pull the hair straight.
And if all else fails, use a straightening irons to go over any particularly stubborn bits.

, To set your style and give your hair a little extra shine and control, apply a pea-sized amount of finishing product to the ends and mid-lengths of your hair. A shine serum or a shine spray will both do the trick. If you're worried about your hair falling flat or losing its shape, mist it with a light layer of hairspray, holding the can about six inches away from your head. This will ensure that your hair stays straight all day (or night!) long.

Choose a brush.,
Brush as you blow-dry.,
Style your hair (optional).",How to Straighten Your Hair Without a Flat Iron1," Getting your hair wet is the first step to straightening it, so start by washing and conditioning your hair. To improve hair moisture and prevent frizzing, use a deep conditioner, or leave your regular conditioner in your hair for an extra two or three minutes.


Optionally, use a shampoo formulated to straighten hair.
If you've already washed your hair recently, just dampen it with water. Too much washing can strip away protective oils and can lead to frizzy hair.;
, Gently pat your hair dry until it is no longer dripping, but still damp. This will speed up the blow-drying process, thus reducing damage to your hair.

, This will help your hair stay straight while it dries, especially if it's naturally prone to curling up under cool air. Apply a dime-sized amount from the roots to the ends. Use more if you have thick, long hair. You can choose from any of the following treatments:


Anti-fizz serum
Leave-in conditioner or leave-in hair balm
Moroccan oil
A mix of 4 oz (120 mL) camellia oil and 1 oz (30 mL) avocado oil

, Part your hair into 3–6 sections, depending on how thick your hair is. Keep all but one section out of your way using crocodile clips.

, Blow dry with cool air if you want to protect your hair, but be prepared to dry for up to an hour. For faster drying and a longer-lasting effect, use hot air. Hot air can damage your hair over time, especially if used frequently.


If using hot air, apply heat protectant to your hair first. If possible, choose one based on natural oils, not silicone.

, Find a flat paddle brush or a round brush. Avoid wide brushes, as these are difficult to handle.

, Take one thin lock of hair, slightly narrower than your brush. Blow dry this with the nozzle pointed downward. Brush slowly in long, straight strokes as you dry that section. Keep the brush under the hair and the dryer nozzle hovering over the hair. Move the brush and dryer at almost the same speed, with the dryer trailing behind just a short distance. Repeat if necessary until the hair is completely dry and straight, then move on to the next lock of hair.


Start with the lower layers of hair, around the nape of your neck and your ears.
You can also blow-dry your hair in front of a fan, rather than tiring out your arm with a blow-dryer. Keep in mind that it may be more difficult to control a fan than a blow-dryer.

, Smooth more anti-frizz product into your dry hair to keep it smooth, straight and glossy.

Choose the right flat iron.,
Wash your hair.,
Dry your hair.,
Find the appropriate heat setting.,
Straighten your hair.",How to Straighten Permed Hair1," If you just want to temporarily remove your perm, a flat iron is the best route. It will not permanently remove the perm, but will allow your hair to temporarily straighten.Make sure you select the right flat iron for your hair type.


If you have short, thick, or fine hair look for an iron with narrow plates. Ideally, the size of the plates in your flat iron should be between half an inch to one inch long.For longer hair, look for an iron with longer plates. Pick an iron with plates between one and a half to two inches wide.Regardless of your hair type, make sure that your flat iron isn't too heavy. If it weighs more than a couple pounds, you'll end up getting sore while using it.;
, Before you apply the flat iron to your hair, wash and condition your hair. Make sure you pick a shampoo and conditioner that will help with the flat-ironing process.


When it comes to flat-ironing your hair, be gentle. The heat is hard on your hair so baby it a little during the washing process. Choose a smoothing conditioner and a gentle shampoo.
Make sure both your shampoo and conditioner have moisturizing properties. Due to its heat, a flat iron can dry out hair.A heat protector, in addition to shampoo and conditioner, can also help. Add a hair care oil, which you can find at a local salon, to your hair after shampooing and conditioning. You don't need to add more than a drop. Make sure not to add the oil too close to your scalp as this can make your hair look greasy. Keep the oil 2.5 to 3 inches away from the scalp., Once you've washed and conditioned your hair, you need to let it dry. You can blow dry your hair or, if it's thin and tends to dry quickly, just let it air dry. Just make sure your hair is completely dry before using a flat iron. If your hair is still wet, the flat iron could cause your hair to boil which can result in hair damage., The heat setting you select on your flat iron is important. If it's too hot or too cold, it may be ineffective or even cause damage.


Not all flat irons allow you to adjust the heat. If your hair is undamaged and of average density, it should be safe for you to use a flat iron without adjustable heat. However, if you have special needs regarding your hair splurge on a more expensive flat iron where you can control the heat.If your hair is fine or damaged, keep the heat between 250 and 300 degrees Fahrenheit.If your hair is of medium thickness, set the heat between 300 and 350 degrees Fahrenheit.If you have thick hair, set the heat between 350 and 400 degrees Fahrenheit., Once the flat iron is warmed up, you can begin straightening your hair. This process can take some time, so be patient.


Section your hair before you begin straightening. Separate your hair into 2 to 4 sections, depending on thickness. Thicker hair will need more sections than thinner hair.
Start with the section near the nape of your neck. Start straightening about half an inch away from your roots. This will give your hair some volume after the process.Move through your hair with the flat iron one section at a time. Go slowly, keeping a steady pace. Ideally, you'll want the sections of hair to flatten out on the first try. Going over the same section more than once can dry out hair and lead to damage.Use tension when pulling the flattener across your hair. You do not want to cause yourself pain, but applying a bit of pressure can help get your hair smooth and flat on the first try."

Attach the monofilament to the hair wefts.,
Apply the halo extensions.",How to Make Hair Extensions1," To make halo hair extensions, you will need a pack of hair wefts (human or synthetic), a tube of bonding glue, a pair of scissors and some clear monofilament (fishing line).;
, Take the hair weft and measure it against the back of your head.


For these type of extensions you only want the hair covering the back of the head, you don't want it coming around the sides or behind your ears.
Once you've measured the correct width, use your scissors to cut them to size. Then cut two more identical wefts of hair to the same width.

, Take your bonding glue and squeeze a thick line under the rubber ridge (and directly onto the hair) on one of the hair wefts, then place the second hair weft on top. Do the same with the third piece, then leave the bonding glue to dry.

, Take a long piece of monofilament and measure it to find the right length.


To do this, place the monofilament across the top of your head (like a headband), then stretch the end pieces to the back of your head.
Wherever the ends of the monofilament stop is where the hair extensions will start. This is really a matter of personal preference, but most people want their extensions to start somewhere around the occipital bone (google it if you're not sure where that is).
Cut the monofilament to your preferred length, but leave an extra couple of inches on either side for tying knots.

, Take one end of the monofilament and tie it to one end of the hair weft using a couple of simple but tight knots. Do the same on the other end. Seal the knots in place with a dot of bonding glue, then wait for the bonding glue to dry.

, To apply the halo extensions, sit the ring of monofilament and hair on your head -- with the hair to the back and the monofilament across the top of your head.









Take your hairbrush and start brushing to bring your natural hair over the extensions and to cover the line of monofilament.
You can secure the extensions in place with a couple of bobby pins, but this usually isn't necessary. "

Measure and cut the hair.,
Layer two or three wefts on top of each other.,
Sew the extension clips to the hair.,
Apply the hair extensions correctly.",How to Make Hair Extensions2," To make these clip-in extensions, you will need one full pack of hair wefts (human or synthetic), a pair of scissors, a needle and thread (in a color that resembles the color of the hair), a pack of extension clips (available in most beauty supply stores) and a tube of bonding glue.

, Take the hair weft and measure it against your head. You want it to stretch from just behind one ear to just behind the other, in a U-shaped pattern. Use your scissors to cut the hair weft to the correct width.

, Usually, a single layer of hair weft is not enough for people with normal to thick hair.


If you are using the extensions to make your hair look longer two layers will probably be enough, but if you want to make your hair look thicker you will need three layers.
As a result your will need to measure and cut one or two more hair wefts, identical to the first one. There will be enough hair in a single pack of hair wefts to do this.
You can either sew the layers together along the weft lines (by hand or using a sewing machine) or you can stick them together using bonding glue.
If you decide to use bonding glue (which is probably the easier option of you're not an experienced sewer), run a thick line of bonding glue just beneath the weft line on the first piece of hair, then stick the second piece on top, ridge side up.
Do the same with the third layer of hair (if using), then wait for the bonding glue to dry completely.

, Next, take your needle and thread and sew the extension clips to the weft line.


In terms of placement, you'll need to put one clip on either side of the extensions, right at the edge, and one in the middle to prevent the extensions from sagging.
Make sure to sew the clips to the side of the extensions with the rubber ridges and make sure to sew the extension clips with the comb side up -- otherwise you won't be able to put them in your hair!You don't need to use any fancy sewing techniques; just thread your needle (tying a knot at the end) and pass it through the first small hole on the extension clip and through the ridge of the hair weft.
Bring the needle and thread up over the top of the extensions and pass it through the second small hole. Continue in this manner until you reach the last hole on the clip. Pass the needle and thread through, then tie several small knots in the thread to secure before cutting off the rest.

, Now that you have your very own hair extensions, it's important to know how to apply them correctly.


Pin up all of the hair above your ears. Take a comb and tease (or backcomb) the hair at the roots, then spritz it with hairspray. This will give the extension clips something to hold onto.
Open the clips on your hair extensions and fasten them onto the exposed roots -- one behind each ear and one in the middle.If you decided to make a second set of extensions for added thickness, let down an extra inch of hair and repeat the process of teasing and hair spraying before applying the second set.
Let down the the top section of hair and brush or comb to combine your natural hair with the extensions. If your extensions are made from human hair, you can now style your hair as normal using a flat iron or curling tongs.

Choose between human and synthetic hair.,
Carefully match the hair wefts with your natural hair color.,
Use clips, thread and bonding glue close to the color of the hair wefts.,
Style the extensions and your natural hair in the same way.,
Take good care of your hair extensions.",How to Make Hair Extensions3," When buying hair wefts at the beauty supply store you are usually faced with two options: human or synthetic.


Synthetic hair is the cheaper option, which is good for people who are on a budget, or who need a large quantity of hair. However, it's important to be aware that synthetic hair cannot be styled using heated appliances like flat irons or curling tongs -- so if you have curly hair you will need to buy pre-curled synthetic hair, or be prepared to flat iron your hair each time you want to wear your extensions. Synthetic hair can't be dyed either, so it's important that it closely matches your natural hair color.
Human hair tends to be more expensive than synthetic hair, but is usually of higher quality. Human hair can be dyed to match your natural (or colored) hair and can be styled with flat irons, curling tongs and hair dryers, making them very versatile. With human hair, you usually have a choice between virgin (unprocessed, undyed) hair, and hair that's been treated, colored relaxed, etc.

, It's pretty obvious that the closer the color of your extensions are to the color of your natural hair, the more natural they will look.


To ensure you get the right color, take some time to browse around and find the right color for you. Ask a representative from the beauty supply store to help you match the extensions to your hair -- they have a lot of experience and will be able to recommend the best color for you.
Even if you have highlighted or multi-toned hair, you should be able to find something that matches. Many hair wefts combine two or more colors to cater for people with dyed hair.
You should go shopping for hair extensions during the day and match the extensions to your hair in natural lighting conditions -- artificial light can be deceptive and may cause you to choose the wrong color.

, Nowadays, many girls are making their own hair extensions and the beauty supply industry has started producing products to cater for this.


It is possible to buy hair extension clips in a number of different colors -- red, blonde, brown, black, etc. -- so no matter what color extensions you wish to make, you can find clips to match. This is important as black clips could be really obvious on blonde hair extensions, and vice versa.
You can also find bonding glue in a couple of different colors, so the color of the dried glue is not visible through the hair. For example, you could use white bonding glue on blonde hair, but you would need a darker colored glue for black or dark brown extensions.
When sewing the extension clips to the hair wefts, you also want to find a thread color that closely matches both the color of the clips and your hair.

, Another obvious yet important thing to mention is that both your natural hair and your hair extensions will need to be styled in the same way in order to blend into one another. There's nothing more obvious looking than straight extensions in wavy hair, or vice versa.


Most hair stylists advise women to curl their hair if they're going to put in their own extensions, as this allows the hair to blend more easily. In other words, it's harder to see where the natural hair ends and the extensions start when the hair is curled.
Another tip is to curl (or straighten) your extensions before you put them in your hair. This makes them easier to work with and allows you to achieve the style that you want. Remember that you can only use heated appliances on human hair, synthetic hair can only be styled using no-heat methods, such as hair rollers.
Blend the hair and the extensions together. Once you have applied the extensions to your hair, you can make them less noticeable by using a wide-toothed comb or brush to gently brush your hair, combining your natural hair with the extensions.

, Keeping your hair extensions in good condition will help them to appear more natural and last longer.


Just like natural hair, your extensions will need to be washed and conditioned. Wash them after you have worn them once or twice, especially if you used a lot of hairspray. However, you shouldn't wash your extensions more than twice a week as this will simply dry them out.
Avoid brushing your extensions too roughly as this can cause hairs to fall from the track, thinning the extensions. Use a little leave-in conditioner to help loosen tangles and brush from the ends of the extension upwards, as this causes the least damage.
Allow extensions to air dry after washing, rather than drying them with a hair dryer. Don't attempt to towel dry them or wring out moisture by twisting them, as this only damages them. You can also prevent human hair extensions from becoming damaged by spraying them with heat protectant before straightening or curling."

If you're unsure if they can handle the heat or you want to curl your weave, test curl a tiny portion of your hair to see if it melts.If testing to see if the synthetic hair will melt, ensure that you choose a hair that is slightly hidden so that if it does melt, it won't be noticeable.;
, Decide how large you'd like your curls to be and divide your hair into sections. If you'd like small curls, divide your hair into many sections. If you want big curls, divide the hair into a few sections. Use a clip to secure the hair to your head.

You can also use an olive oil in place of the cream moisturizer.

, Determine how large you'd like your curls and lay out several sizes of perm rods. Divide your hair into a small section and roll it up and onto a perm rod. Cap the end so the hair stays tightly wound on the rod. Do this until you've rolled all of your hair onto perm rods.









Try to vary the sizes of the perm rods to get different sizes of curls. For a more natural look, keep the curls near your neck and the back of your head larger and looser. Use smaller perm rods for the curls near your face so they're smaller and tighter.

, Fill a mug 2








If your water cools, rewarm it and continue dipping the perm rods.
Always use caution when handling hot water. If the mug is too hot to handle, wait till it's comfortable to pick up with your bare hands.

, Keep the hair in the perm rods and let them cool and dry completely. They may dry quickly or take a full day to dry, depending on how much hair you wrapped on each curling rod. If you want to sleep with the perm rods in so your curls set overnight, just wear a protective cap.


If you're short on time, you could blow dry the hair. Just ensure that the blow dryer is on the lowest setting.

, Once the hair has dried completely around the perm rods, gently remove them. The curls will probably be tight and springy when pulled. If you'd like them to stay tight and close to your head, just leave them alone. If you'd like the curls to look softer or fluffier, run your fingers through your hair.









You can also separate curls into smaller ones. This can make them look softer and add volume to your hair.

Turn on a flat iron to the lowest setting (usually around 250-300 degrees F) and once it's warm, run it through the strand. Continue running the flat iron over the section of hair until the section is smooth and straight.Each section will end up being a curl. For many small curls, keep the sections small. You should also make sure the sections aren't too large or the pin clips won't be able to hold the hair.

, With the flat iron on the lowest setting, run it through the straight strand of hair. Wind the hair backwards away from your face so that the strand curls onto the flat iron. Do this slowly so that the hair curls. Keep the temperature of the flat iron low so that it doesn't melt your synthetic hair.The curl doesn't have to be perfect. You're just getting a basic curl shape that you'll wind and pin to your head.

, While the curl is still warm, wrap it tightly around your index finger. Gently slide the curl off of your finger and hold it between your thumb and index finger. The curl will look like a flat, circular twist of hair. Bring the curl to your scalp and pin it to your head using a small metal hair clip.If you want the curls to hold longer, you can spray the curl with hair spray before you wrap and pin them.

, Straighten, curl and pin the rest of your hair. You may find it easier to curl and pin the hair closest to your temples (if curling a weave). This will keep the hair out of your face. Once you've pinned all of your synthetic hair, let them rest in the pins overnight or at least for several hours. Remove the clips and run your fingers through the curls.To get a more natural look, you can run your fingers in between curls to divide them and give your hair more body.

",How to Care for Your Easi Hair Clip on Hair Extensions,";
,


Create a part where you wish to add the color highlight and clip your hair out of the way.

,


With the clip side of the piece facing you, put both thumbs on each side of the clip and the index fingers at the front side of the piece. Snap the clip open by applying pressure toward yourself with the index fingers. Similarly, close the clip by applying pressure away from yourself with the thumbs.

,


Place the clip on your own hair just below the part. Moving the clip upward, catch your own hair in the clip and snap it shut. The easiLites have been designed with the clip sew with the open side facing up, so that the clip can be slid in and slid out with ease. This makes attachment to your own hair or a wig easy, without risk of snags.

,


Since the easilites are made of 100% Human Hair, they can be flat-ironed and curled with heat

,


Just like your own hair, human hair will accumulate residue through normal wear. However, you do not need to wash the hair everyday to keep consistent results. The hair should be washed as infrequently as possible or when you notice that the hair appears dull or acquires an odor. If you are wearing the hair all day, every day, you can wash them after 3-4 wearings.

, If hair is excessively tangled, a spray on conditioner should be used.

,, Do not twist, scrub or rub the hair. Use the shampoo sparingly

, Be sure to rinse until all shampoo is removed, as improper rinsing could result in damage.


Just like your own hair, human hair extensions need to be conditioned after shampooing to maintain a healthy shine and promote styling ease.

, Gently work into the hair and let sit for three to five minutes.

,,, Using a large toothed comb, move in a downward motion away from the clips and to the ends. Do not use a bristle brush on wet hair as it may pull out or break the hair.

,


If the hair is excessively dry, a ""professional"" conditioner may be necessary. Consult your stylist about this.

,


Steam rollers and/or wet setting are the safest way to curl your human hair.
Blow dryers, curling irons and other thermal tools may be used on low settings. Remember, the hair may scorch if the setting is too high.
If you choose to use electric rollers, always make sure that the ends are wrapped into the rollers to avoid ""fishhooks"".
For cutting, or any chemical processes such as perming or coloring, take the extensions to a professional stylist.

, So, remember to always take your new hair to a salon professional if you need it customized. This will give you the best results!

Remove the extensions when you’re ready.",How to Do a Quick Weave," Hair extensions are typically made of human hair that are sewn into wefts, or tracks, either with a machine or by hand. They come in endless colors, textures and lengths. Choose a color and texture that matches your hair, so the extensions will look as natural as possible. If the extensions match your hair and are applied correctly, no one will be able to tell the difference between your natural hair and your extensions.


Dying or adding highlights to the extensions can help you get the perfect color or shade. If you are stuck in between two shades, select the lighter one.
Virgin or Remy wefts are made from either untreated or minimally treated human hair. These options are expensive, but they result in the most natural look. Synthetic options are less expensive, but they often cannot be styled or washed. They may not look as natural as human hair options.
In addition to weft extensions, you’ll need hair bonding glue. The glue should match the color of your hair extensions. Do not attempt to use any other type of glue to put in extensions.
A bonded hair weave will typically last about six to eight weeks if it's properly maintained. Since you're glueing the extensions to your hair, be prepared for your existing hair to suffer some damage.;
, If you bought straight extensions, and your hair is naturally curly, you'll need to start by permanently straightening your hair before you apply the extensions. The texture should be as close as possible to achieve a natural look.

, This helps to keep your hair in place during the process and protect it from getting damaged. For short hair (above shoulder-length), slick your hair back with a hair setting solution, then comb the hair as close to your scalp as possible. For longer hair, pull your hair into a tight, low ponytail and slick your hair back with a hair setting solution. Allow the setting solution to dry completely.








, Use a comb to part your hair in a rectangle shape on the top of your head. Part it on either side and across the back, right where your head juts out the most. Secure the hair within these parts with a hairband to keep it out of the way.









All of the wefts will be applied below this rectangular part. You need enough hair within the rectangle to cover the top of the wefts that you'll be putting in just below the part. Otherwise, the extensions will be visible.

, Use your comb to create another part that starts about three inches from your bottom hairline and extends from one side of your head to the other side, curving around the base of your head. The lowest extension will be applied just below this part.


Make sure the part is very neat. If it's not straight, the weave won't stay in as neatly and it will look messy.
Make sure the part starts three inches above your hairline. If you put in the weave too low it will be visible when you style your hair in an updo.

, Hold the weft against the U-shaped bottom part to measure how much you need. Curve it so that it lies against the part. The sides of the weft should land half an inch from your hairline on either side of your head. If the weft extends past your hairline it will be visible when you style your hair in an updo. Use a pair of scissors to cut the weft to size.


Double check that the weft is the right length by measuring it against your part once you’ve cut it.

, The weft will naturally curl inward, and the glue should be applied to the inside of the curve. Apply it very carefully and slowly in a straight line across the edge of the weft. Take the time to make sure it's applied quite neatly. The glue will come out of the bottle quite thickly.








, Use a blow dryer to heat the glow and soften it until it’s sticky to the touch. It shouldn’t be runny or slimy, but when you touch it it should be tacky. Gently touch the glue along the edge of the weft to make sure the entire line of glue is sticky.









If the glue is too runny, it could drip into your hair and cause damage. Make sure it's not wet, but just tacky enough to adhere to your hair.

, Very carefully position the weft so that the glue is facing your hair. Starting half an inch from your side hairline, press the weft against your hair about 2 or 3 centimeters (0.8 or 1.2 in) below the part. Keep pressing the weft into your hair, little by little, until you reach the other side.









Be very careful not to apply it to your scalp. If the weft adheres to your scalp, it will inhibit hair growth and lead to bald spots there. It is very important to make sure the weft is applied a few centimeters below the part and attached only to your hair, not your skin.
Remember it must be applied half an inch from your side hairlines. If the weft is applied too close to your hairline, it will be visible.

, Wait about three minutes to let the extension completely dry once you're finished applying it. Give it a tug to make sure it's firmly in place. If part of the weft isn't properly adhered to your hair, apply a little bonding glue and press it down until the entire weft is attached.

, Now that the first weft is in place, it's time to apply the next one. Measure two and a half inches above the top of the first weft and make another U-shaped part around the back of the head. Secure the hair above the part, then follow the same process to measure, cut, and glue in the next weft:









Measure a new weft and cut it so either side falls half an inch from the side hairlines.
Apply glue to the weft in a straight line, then use the blow dryer to heat it slightly so it's tacky, but not runny.
Apply the weft to your hair a few centimeters below the part, making sure it doesn't touch your scalp.

, Continue applying wefts every two and a half inches until you reach the top part, the rectangle you initially created. When you reach this top part, Measure, cut, and apply one final weft. This time the weft will extend from one side of your forehead around the crown of your head and up to the other side. Make sure it's half an inch from your hairline on either side.








, When the wefts are all in place, take down the rectangle of hair that you secured at the top of your head. Use a comb to blend your own hair with the extensions. You are now free to style your hair as you normally would. You can also get a haircut to help blend the extensions even more.








, After several months, your extensions might naturally begin to come loose, and you'll be ready to take them out. You can by removal cream designed for this purpose to take them out easily. Apply the cream around the bonded areas, let it sit for the amount of time indicated on the packaging, then use a comb to help the extensions come loose.


If you don't want to buy the removal cream, try using olive oil. Apply the oil and let it soak in for 20 minutes, then use a comb to gently remove the wefts from your hair.
If the oil doesn't work, you could also try peanut butter or dish soap to do the trick."

",How to Care for Human Hair Extensions," Because your extensions are sewn in, you can wash them along with your natural hair in the shower. Be gentle, though, so that you don’t loosen your extensions. If you’re too rough with them, they won’t last as long.


Be sure to use a moisturizing formula shampoo. The more that a shampoo moisturizes, the better it will be for your hair.;
, Sulfates are the cleaning detergents in shampoos that cause them to foam. Sulfates are effective cleaners. However, they can dry out the natural oils in your hair that serve to protect it. Your body is constantly creating new oils for your natural hair, but your extensions do not have a direct supply, so you need to be very careful about drying them out.


Sulfates can cause split ends to form in your hair.
Sulfates can make your hair look dry or frizzy over time.

, Each strand of hair has a protective cuticle layer. Not only does the cuticle layer protect the hair strand, it also reflects sunlight which gives your hair its shine. Throughout the day, the cuticle layer gets broken down, leaving your hair looking limp and dull. Conditioners give your hair back its body and shine by releasing positively charged particles that latch onto the negatively charged parts of your hair and repair the cuticle layers.Make sure to work the conditioner all the way into the roots of your hair.
If you have braids or curly extensions, you should use a leave-in conditioner on them during the day.

, Don’t wash your extensions every day. Just like your normal hair, they’ll become dried out if you over-wash them. On days that you don’t wash your hair, give it a gentle rinse and use some conditioner.


How often you should wash your hair depends on its thickness, oil content and how much product you use in it.
For example Someone with thick, dry hair who doesn’t use too much product wouldn’t have to wash as often as someone with thin, oily hair who styles it daily.

, Blow-dry your hair completely before going to bed. You should never go to bed while your permanent hair extensions are wet. Wet hair extensions will bunch up causing tangles to form. As you move around in your sleep, the tangles in your extensions could get stuck and pull on your natural hair, damaging it.


You can use an ionic hair dryer to limit your hair’s exposure to heat.Ionic hair dryers release negative ions that attack the water molecules in your hair. The water molecules then divide allowing them to evaporate quickly.

, Put a teaspoon of moisturizing shampoo in about a half cup of lukewarm water and mix them together. When you’re finished mixing, fill your sink with warm water and pour in the diluted shampoo.


Make sure to use sulfate-free shampoo.

, Slowly dip your extensions into the water. Comb through your extensions a few times before submerging them to get rid of any tangles. Let them soak for about ten minutes.When detangling your extensions. Comb down from the end, then from the mid-length and finally all the way down from the roots.
Don’t swirl your extensions in the water to get them clean. You'll only cause tangles to form.
Try your best to keep the top weft and the clips dry. The top wefts of your extensions can swell causing them to look uneven and the clips may rust.

, Gently take your extensions out of the sink and rinse them under the running faucet. Make sure the running water is cold so that it locks moisture in the extensions. Wring out any excess water and spread the extensions out flat on top of a fresh towel., Apply some conditioner directly to your extensions. Comb the conditioner into them. Make sure to comb in the conditioner from the top weft of each extension down. Place the extensions back on the towel and fold it over. Let them sit for about an hour.


Make sure to only comb the hair in one direction at a time or it could lose its shape.
Never comb extensions that are soaking wet or they will become tangled.

, Rinse the conditioner out of the hair. Apply a separate leave-in conditioner. Lay your extensions flat onto a new, dry towel and fold it over. Leave them to dry naturally overnight.


When your extensions are dry, comb through them one more time to straighten them out.

, Because you don’t wear your clip in hair extensions to bed, you don’t need to wash them as often as permanent ones. However, if you wear them all the time, you might have to wash them a bit more.

, Not only does brushing remove any tangles from your extensions, it also spreads the essential oils in them evenly across the strands. Brush your extensions every day to smooth them out and give them a healthy luster.Be sure to use a soft bristle brush and be gentle.

, Mix some of your favorite essential oil with some water in a spray bottle. Keep your spray bottle with you throughout the day and spray your extensions whenever they start to dry out.Coconut oil and rosemary oil are great to use on your hair.

, Heat protectant spray adds moisture to hair while stopping natural moisture from escaping it. Make sure to add some heat protectant spray to your extensions before you dry them or before you go out on a hot day.


Heat protectant spray makes a shield around the cuticle of a hair strand and allows it to keep its shine.

, Both chlorine and salt water can be very damaging to your hair. If you plan on taking a dip wearing your extensions, you should always wear a latex swim cap. Wash your hair immediately after swimming in chlorinated water just in case any chemicals happen to get past your cap.

, You should replace your sewn in hair extensions every eight to ten weeks. If you keep them in longer, the hair growing underneath them will come in matted.You can keep a clip in hair extensions as long as they look healthy and keep their shape.


Always get sewn in hair extensions taken out by a trained stylist.
Store your clip in hair extensions in a breathable material like cotton to maximize how long they can last.

, Shampooing frequently may be damaging to your hair regardless of the type as it can dry it out. When you do use shampoo, concentrate on your scalp to avoid dryness. Only lather your hair once unless you’re using heavy styling products. Once your scalp is clean, gently wash the shampoo through the ends of your hair.An average person may wash her hair about every 2 or 3 days. Watch for signs that you should wash your hair such as an itchy scalp, flaking, or if your hair is visibly oil.Sebaceous glands secrete an oily substance to help moisturize your scalp and hair and are most likely responsible for making your hair feel dirty. Wash your hair when it feels dirty or follow these tips:

If you have thick hair, tight curls, or kinks, you just need to wash your hair about once a week or until it feels dirty. Daily washing will make your hair feel dry. You may use a dry shampoo or conditioner between washes to help refresh your hair.If you have medium curls, kinks, or waves, you may shampoo every few days as your curls will look fine with a small amount of the natural oils from the sebaceous glands. Use low shampoos or a shampoo bar. You may also need to use conditioner in between shampoos if you are active and workout a lot. You may also just use water to massage your scalp in between your shampoos as well.If you have fine curls or waves, you probably use styling products everyday that makes your hair feel oily. You may shampoo every day to keep your hair looking clean and use a good conditioner to keep it moisturized.The quality of the water of your city will affect your hair., Do not apply shampoo onto a dry head of hair.

Conditioner at the scalp can weigh down your hair making it look flat while the rest of your hair stays puffy. Try to keep conditioner for as long as you can because it will moisturize as long as it is applied.Apply a liberal amount of deep conditioner to wet hair after it has been washed and cleaned. Focus on the ends of your hair as they can be dry and fragile.

You may place your hair in a plastic shower cap and cover with a towel to keep the heat from escaping your head. After 10 to 20 minutes, rinse the conditioner out but do not shampoo because you want any oils to remain in your hair. Conditioner will continue to work until the next time you use shampoo to wash your hair., Plopping is a technique that uses an old t-shirt instead of a towel to dry your hair. Using microfiber towels as gloves is a technique that is exactly as it sounds. Towel drying can easily cause frizz but these techniques can eliminate that as well as reduce tangles and prevent your hair from breaking.Plopping requires you to place an old t-shirt on a flat surface positioning the end with the sleeves facing you. Bend over and lay your head at the center of the t-shirt making sure that there’s material in front of and behind your hair. Try to position yourself so that your hair scrunches hair straight down. Cover the back of your neck with the bottom of your t-shirt. Then, gather the front material of your t-shirt and keep it tight against the sides of your head as you take the sleeves and wrap them from the front to the back of your head. You may twist the sleeves and side material to help keep it tight against your head. Tie the sleeves at the front of your forehead to keep the plop tight. Tuck in any loose material and leave to dry.Once the conditioner has been rinsed off, turn your head upside down and scrunch your curls with microfiber towels. You may be able to purchase actual microfiber towel gloves online or your local beauty supply store. Scrunching your hair removes excess water while still adding volume. It also reduces frizz and keeps the definition of your curls., The sheer force of a hair dryer can ruin your curls and create a lot of unwanted frizz. Diffusers reduce the velocity of the air produced by your hair dryer. They may also be used to add volume to your hair.Make sure your diffuser fits firmly onto your hair dryer. While your hair dryer may have come with an attachment, you can also buy a universal diffuser online or your local beauty supply store.Apply your styling products before drying your hair with the diffuser. Your hair should be about 75% dry before using the diffuser to finish drying.Use the medium setting of your hair dryer if you do not have time to use the cool setting. The cool setting prevents heat from damaging your hair.Using the bowl of the diffuser, move your head upside down or tilt to the side to place sections of your hair directly into the bowl to dry.Dry straight to the roots of your hair by moving the diffuser closer to your head. Be mindful not to ruin clumping or the formation of your curls. Work the sections of your hair until it’s only 10% wet then adjust your curls. Use a small amount of product, like pomade or curl cream, and dry the remainder of your hair to lock in the moisture of the product.For more volume, shake your roots with your fingers., Avoid your hair from looking greasy and protect your curls from heat and frizz by choosing the right products. For fine curls, use an anti-frizz milk or lotion that’s lightweight. For coarse or heavier curls, use a thick treatment oil to allow moisture to penetrate your frizz-prone locks., Avoid brushing dry curls as it can lead to breakage by stretching your hair and disrupting your hair’s cuticle. While your hair is still wet after a wash, you may use a combination of towel drying and brushing, combing, or finger-combing your hair. Then, add either a conditioner or anti-frizz product and style with your fingers.If you must comb dry hair use wet fingers. Even on a humid or windy day, water is enough to tame any frizz because frizz is the result of dryness."

, When you towel dry your wet curly hair, it’s important to absorb water by blotting and not rubbing your curls. Use a cotton or microfiber towel, hold it over your hand, then scrunch and blot water out from the ends up. Don't create frizz and friction by rubbing a towel back and forth on your curls. The more you manipulate your hair, the less weighted down your curls will be.

, Leave-in conditioner is a great way to detangle curly hair, since you want to avoid combing it excessively. Look for one formulated especially for curly hair and detangling. Most leave-in conditioners are fairly light-weight, so spritz it on liberally.

Avoid silicone, which can prevent moisture from penetrating your hair.
Some shampoos and conditioners are specially formulated for curly hair. It's not necessary to use one of these, but it's worth giving them a try to see if they help define your curls.
Leave-in conditioner is a good option for curly hair, since it helps the curls stay smooth and moisturized throughout the day. Otherwise, try not rinsing out your conditioner completely, leaving just a bit in.
Don't overdo the amount: 1-2 quarters worth of shampoo and conditioner should be adequate.;
, Shampoo strips your hair of its natural oils, which are necessary for curls to appear vital and frizz-free. Conditioner is less harsh, yet also has a certain amount of cleansing action. Try washing with a conditioner regularly (however often you need), and using shampoo just once a week., Here's the secret to taming your frizz: use the coldest water you can stand when you wash your hair. Hot water is hard on the hair shaft, while cold water seals the cuticle, making curls look sleek and shiny when the hair is dry.


If you can't bear the idea of taking a cold shower, try washing your hair in the sink instead of running the cold water over your entire body. When you're in the shower, use a shower cap to protect your curls from the warmer water.

, It will make it less frizzy, and won't damage your hair like towels.Afterwards, put your head upside down and shake it, letting the curls take their natural shape.


Microfiber towels are also gentler on curls and may be more absorbent than a T-shirt.

, Experiment to find what works for you: an inexpensive anti-frizz serum may be adequate, or you might want to splurge on a more expensive curl-styling cream that moisturizes and adds definition. After washing, add a bit of product to wet hair and work through with a wide-toothed comb, working from the ends to the roots (this prevents breakage).Top that off with a curl-defining gel; you can rake, scrunch, or smooth it in. Make sure each curl gets a little of product from root to tip. When you're finished, use your fingers to scrunch the curls to give them extra definition.

, The healthiest way to dry curls is to let them dry on their own time. Don't wring out or rub your hair; this causes hair to become rough and frizzy.


Avoid using a hair dryer unless it's a special occasion. Air drying is the better for daily care, since it doesn't damage your hair.
Curly hair can often take a very long time to dry, since it's so thick and dense. If you don't have the patience for air drying, use a hair dryer with a diffuser on the coolest setting.

, The diffuser attachment spread out the heat so that it doesn't flow in a direct stream on one part of your hair. Work your way around your head with the diffuser, using its prongs to lift and dry your curls around the scalp, down the back and sides, and down to the tips. When you're drying the ends of your hair, position the diffuser upside down underneath the hair and gently push your curls up to add volume. Continue until your hair is slightly moist, rather than completely dry.








Using a hotter setting on your dryer will result in shinier curls.
If you'd rather have waves instead of tight curls, don't push your curls up with the diffuser; point it straight at them instead.

, Use a medium-hold spray to keep your look in place throughout the day. Stay away from spray with alcohol, though, as it dries out your hair.


Alternatively, put a little serum or wax on your curls to create definition., Wet brushing causes your hair to break off and adds unnecessary stress to the hair follicle. A wide-toothed comb is easier and you can also use it to distribute conditioner evenly while you're still in the shower. Avoid brushing curly hair when dry because it will make your hair poof and frizz.


If your hair is short, you may find that brushing dry curls gives you more volume, but overall it will create frizz.

, This bun is a variation on the classic, showcasing your hair's naturally beautiful texture. It's perfect for styling when you don't have much time: all you need is an elastic and a few bobby pins.









Starting with dry hair, pull all your hair to one side and divide into two equal sections (keeping them to the one side).
Twist each section starting from the roots and working all the way to the tips. You should twist both sections in the same direction.
Working in the opposite direction to the twists, wrap the two sections together from root to tip. In other words, if you twisted each section clockwise (to the right), your ""rope"" will be formed by wrapping the pieces together in a counterclockwise motion (to the left).
Secure the end of the wrap with an elastic. An elastic that is close to your hair color will be less visible in the final bun.
Coil the rope-braid around into a bun at the base of your head, slightly to one side, and secure with bobby pins., This look has a romantic grace and looks more complicated than it is. The only styling tools you need are an elastic headband that fits around your head and a few bobby pins.









Pass the headband over your hair so that it fits around your head, passing just under the occipital bone, which curves in at the back of your head.
Tuck your hair into the band in 1-2 inch (2.5-5 cm) sections, starting from behind your ears. After passing a section through, you'll then re-tuck it so that it gradually forms a roll. Work your way towards the back of your head, until all the hair is tucked.
Secure the roll with a few bobby pins if needed.
The band will be exposed at the top of your head., This updo gets your curls noticed effortlessly and is fancy enough for dressy occasions.









Gather your hair at the top of your head, using a comb to smooth the sides and back.
Fasten it in place using an elastic band.
Bring the ponytail forward and tuck the ends under, then use a few bobby pins to keep your curls in place.
Pin some strands around the ponytail elastic to hide it from view.

, When you want to wear your hair down, this is an excellent way to get a little style with minimal effort.









Braid a 1-2 inch (2.5-5 cm) section of hair starting from above your left ear. Angle the braid to wrap back around your head and secure with a small, clear elastic.
Repeat with a strand from above the right ear.
Wrap the left braid back and around, towards the right ear. Secure with a few bobby pins.
Repeat with the right braid, crossing it over the first braid and tucking the end underneath it. Secure with bobby pins., Curly hair can be notoriously difficult to cut, and hairdressers need to understand the needs of different kinds of curls in order to give you a great cut. The good news is that proper cutting is half the battle in styling curly hair. With the right cut, you may find you suddenly love your curls.


Ask a friend with curly hair to recommend someone. Or, if you see someone who looks fabulous in their curls, don't be afraid to ask where they get their hair cut – chances are, they'll be flattered!
Try doing an Internet search of salons or individual hairdressers in your area that specialize in curly hair. Read reviews and check prices.
Look for photos of haircuts that you find flattering to bring to the salon.

, It's important for the stylist to see your hair in its fluffiest, curliest state: this helps them best assess what kind of cut you need.


Wash your hair that morning or the night before, and let it air dry.
Avoid using oils or silicone products., Although the salon process usually goes in reverse (first color, then cut), it's important for curly hair to get cut first so that you have the overall shape., Every curl has its own shape and weight, and this is evident only when your hair is dry. The hairdresser needs to see the character of each curl to understand how to cut individual pieces for the overall desired effect. Often a curl-by-curl cut is the best way to go., If you want long curly hair, ask your stylist to add long layers, which prevent it from getting too heavy at the end.Make sure, though, that they are long enough to have some weight. Short layers without adequate weight will bounce up and out, creating a big look., Curly hair tends to be more fragile than straight, and the caustic chemicals in hair dye can wreak havoc on it, compromising curl structure and resulting in lots of frizz. If you want to color your hair, choose a gentler color and proceed gradually.








For example, instead of going from dark brown to platinum blonde, consider adding in some highlights to start.

, You'll need to see your hair curly in order to assess the success of the cut, so you should have it dried with a diffuser, or better yet, sit under a hooded dryer. Resist the urge to have them blow it out straight.

, Improper brushing leads to frizzy hair, and frizzy hair leads to frustration and distress. The direction in which your comb your hair as well as whether or not your hair is wet will make a difference. Here are some tips for combing your curls properly:









Do not comb your hair from the roots down. Instead, start combing your hair in short sections, starting from the ends. Combing your hair from the roots down puts at lot of stress on your curls, creating snags, tears, and tangles.
Avoid combing your hair if it is dry. Instead, work on soaking-wet hair, and use a wide-toothed comb or your fingers. Apply some conditioner or detangler into your curls, and gently detangle them by running your comb or fingers through them. Be sure to start from the roots first.If you must brush your hair when it is dry, do so using a wet, wide-toothed comb or wet fingers.

Work in palm-sized sections until you’ve coated all of your hair with the cream.Choose a curl cream made with Moroccan or Argan oil if you need help taming frizz.

, When applying curl cream or styling gel, the praying hands technique can help you get even coverage. Apply a small amount of product to your palms and rub them together. Take one section of hair and clap your hands together, with the hair in between them, starting at the roots. Pull your hands down toward the tips of that section of hair. Continue in this way until you’ve covered all of your hair., Go ahead and part your hair the way you want it to fall once it’s dried and styled.

Let your hair air-dry and then gently unravel the twists.The tighter the twist, the tighter the resulting curls will be.

",How to Take Care of Naturally Curly Hair," A mistake most people make is shampooing everyday. It may seem like a good idea, but it strips your scalp of the natural oils it needs to be healthy. Naturally curly hair requires all of the moisture it can get to stay healthy due to the shape/form, and excessive shampooing can leave your hair dull and dry. Remember that you can still shower without shampooing. If you like to shower everyday, you can switch off. One day you can shampoo and condition, and the other you can just condition.;
, Studies have shown that conditioner's impact your hair more than shampoos do. It's definitely recommended that you find a shampoo for your hair type, as it will help your curls turn out better.

, However, don't trim it until needed.

, As often as you want, warm up coconut or olive oil, rub it all around your hair/scalp, braid your hair, then shower the next morning.

, Brushes can be very damaging to curly hair. By replacing your brush with a comb, not only will you make untangling easier, you'll protect your hair.

, This locks in the products and keeps them in your hair.

, After getting out of the shower,use a good scrunching gel and scrunch your hair.

, Replacing your towel means reducing frizz and getting better sculpted curls.

, If you ever need to dry your hair quick, you should buy a diffuser for your blow dryer. Diffusers evenly distribute the air and heat and don't give you the frizzy look blow dryers usually give you.

, The night before, take a shower and put it in a messy bun while still wet. The next morning spray your hair with water and scrunch.

Never brush wet hair -- use a wide-toothed comb or your fingers out of the shower.;
, Towel drying your hair can destroy your curls and contribute to frizz. If possible, let it air dry. You could also use a diffuser or a soft t-shirt to gently dry your hair.

, Braids can protect your hair on days when it faces a lot of exposure, such as wind or humidity. This will prevent noticeable frizzy hair, though your curls may seem flat when you later put your hair down. The biggest contributors to frizz are:


Heat
Humidity
Wind

Rub a small dollop of gel between your palms.,
Slick down each section of hair.,
Let air dry.",How to Use Gel to Fix Curly Hair1," If you have fairly dry, tight curls, choose a moisturizing gel — or at least a lightweight gel, which tends to be less drying. If you have looser curls, pick any clear gel. Dark brown gels may leave a visible residue, depending on your hair color.


Gels that contain high levels of alcohol can dry out and damage hair. That said, most gel should not cause problems as long as you wash it out thoroughly before going to bed.If you notice problems, switch to a different brand or reduce the frequency of use.;
, Gel applies best to damp hair, so wash your hair as usual before you use it. If you have extra-frizzy hair, you can help tame it with a cold-water rinse, or by weighing it down with leave-in conditioner.

, Don’t skimp on this key product. Curl creams help tame frizz, create texture and define spiral curls. Curl creams also keep your hair soft, while many other styling products may result in “crunchy” curls. Look for curl cream products that create a tight, intense curl; avoid the creams marketed for wavy hair.


Some creams claim to be root stimulators, which can also help you take your curls to the next level., Curl-defining creams and pomades are applied to dry, just-styled hair. They help separate your ringlets while also fighting frizzing and adding a bit of texture. Put a pea-sized amount on your fingertips, then rub your fingertips together so that you can work with both hands. Gently apply to small sections of hair with your fingers, lightly squeezing and scrunching your ringlets to encourage separation and definition.


A small amount of styling gel can be applied in the same way to get a similar result with a stronger hold.

This makes it more prone to frizz and damage, leading it further out of control. Some people would kill for curls like yours, so enjoy them instead of trying to get rid of them.

, Use a curling iron to get the best curls you can for special occasions. You can take your natural curls and elevate them into bouncy, movie-quality locks that are impossible for naturally straight-haired people to get right., The more you touch it, the more the curls will come apart and break. Try to keep your hands off it for best results, as touching your hair introduces dirt and oils that weigh down your hair and flatten your curls.

, Curly hair cannot be cut the same way as straight hair. You stylist needs to know how to work with your curls to get the best head of hair possible. Bring in pictures of hairstyles you would like to emulate, and don't be afraid to switch stylists if you are unhappy with the cut., Lightly comb your hair, then wrap it up in a towel while you sleep. This will help it retain its shape the next morning and keep your beautiful curls intact.

",How to Style Naturally Curly Hair," Not all curly hair is the same. Curly hair can range from loose waves to tight, kinky curls.Hair that is wavy will tend to fall flat on the crown. This is the ideal spot for shaping your wavy hairstyle.
Kinky hair needs to be cut without pulling on the strands. Cutting the hair while it still forms a curl is the easiest way to get the desired shape.;
, You should arrive for your haircut with clean, dry hair. Since the best way to cut curly hair is dry, you should have already taken steps to clean your hair before showing up.


Try to have your hair in the best moisturizing condition. Consider doing a deep moisturizing treatment the week of your appointment. This will enable your stylist to see your natural curl in a healthy, ideal state and sculpt your hair with a clear idea of how it will look.

, Unlike with straight hair, curly hair should be cut dry before any coloring or highlighting is done. Coloring or dyeing may leave the hair damp and not as curly as is typical.

, If curly hair is all one length it gets weighed down and the top is flat while the bottom flares out in all sorts of directions. The layering doesn't have to be to intense, but the longer the hair is, the more layers should be added.

, Curly hair lacks keratin, which is the ""ingredient"" in straight hair that keeps it frizz free and straight. To help reduce frizz and add shine, find a shampoo and conditioner pair that is made for curly hair. Check the label and make sure keratin is a top ingredient.

, When you are showering don't rinse your hair thoroughly after applying a conditioner. It is okay to leave some of the residue on your hair to help keep it conditioned throughout the day.


Leave-in conditioners are also a great option. Especially on days that are very dry it is good to carry a leave-in conditioner. They can help keep your hair moist throughout the day.

, Do not use a towel. A towel can create too much friction and static. This can result in frizzy hair. After taking a shower put a shirt on over your head. You can simply keep your forehead in the neck opening of the shirt and wear it on your head. You hair will rest in the body of the shirt.

, Before deciding how to wear your hair, it is a good idea to check the weather each day.The daily changes in the dew point outside can have a huge impact on your hair and the amount frizz you may need to prepare for.

, Headbands, updos and braids can be a great solution when you are short on time or your hair is just not cooperating. If you have curly hair it is a good idea to look into getting a hair accessory you like to tame your hair, or learn how to do various braiding patterns to keep your hair under control.

, If you want to tame curly hair, don't brush it. This may seem like the opposite thing to do when trying to eliminate frizz, but it really works. When you brush naturally curly hair, the brush is essentially splitting apart those curls and turning them into individual hair strands. If you take a shower, then let your hair air dry without brushing it, those curls will stay compact and less frizzy.

, You may choose to use a humectant product that attracts and absorbs moisture when the weather is dry to fight frizz, and an anti-humectant that repels moisture when the air outside is damp. You may find that you need to have alternative products on hand for those days when the weather is not on your side. The dew point, or the point when water vapor would condense, has the strongest impact on your curls.During the winter months dew points will drop as low as below 30 degrees depending on your location. Avoid using humectants, your hair will need all the moisture it can get. Use leave-in conditioners and light hold products.
When the dew point range 30-40 degrees you will need to do some experimenting to see what products work best. Humectants may or may not benefit your hair.
The best dew point for manageable curls is between 40-60 degrees. Regular moisturizing treatment should help keep hair in the best condition. Humectants can be helpful in keeping hair moisturized as well.
A high dew point is anything over 60+ degrees. You may want to avoid using a leave-in conditioner. Stick to firm hold products like pomades to keep your hair manageable. You also may want to avoid humectants as there is lots of moisture in the air.

, When your hair is wet put a dab of product in the palm of your hand. Start by applying product to back of the head where the hair is thicker, than work your way to the sides and top. You can add small amounts of product as you go.


You may want to drape a towel over your shoulders if you have longer hair to keep your clothes clean.

, Your hair may still appear wet and seem crunchy. Resist the urge to touch your hair. Touching your hair will cause friction between the hairs and create frizz in your hair.


Use a diffuser to dry your hair faster. Set the diffuser to high heat and low speed.The high heat will help to dry the hair quickly. Keeping the speed on a low setting will prevent the hair from being blown around.

, Once the hair is completely dry, scrunch curls to break the gel layer. Grab and handful of your curls and scrunch them using the same motion you would to crumple a piece of paper. Do this until the hair feels soft again then stop. Excessively touching the hair will be more likely to give you frizz.

, If there's one curl that isn't following directions, just pop out your curling iron and fix it. But, remember heat is very damaging to curly hair, so you should always use a heat protectant and avoid using heat whenever possible.

, If your product seems to be wearing off, try spraying them with a mixture of water and leave-in condition. This will help to reactivate the product in your hair and keep your curls bouncy for the rest of the day.,"

Decide what wax you want.,
Consider three other factors when choosing your wax.,
Choose your style of wax.,
Use wax in a tin as it will be less malleable; this wax works best above room temperature.,
Simply scrape off the wax with the nail of their thumb or forefinger.,
Flatten the ball between your fingers and rub the wax back and forth.,
Begin to work the wax into your moustache, start from the center and work your way out to the tips.,
Depending on the length of your whiskers and the style you are aiming to achieve, you may need to add some more wax.,
Look at the results.,
Consider going organic.,
Know why it's best to remove moustache wax.,
Massage a small amount of the remover into your moustache.",How to Use and Choose a Moustache Wax," There are many varieties and sub-varieties.


You can find waxes that are: Organic, Petrochemical-Free, Tinted, Soy Free, or Vegan, as well as Traditional Petrochemical Varieties.
Waxes can also be purchased in different holding strengths: light/medium, medium, strong, or extra strong.;
, They are the quality of the ingredients, the scent of the wax, and the color of the wax.



The quality of the ingredients. Many waxes contain synthetic ingredients like petroleum jelly. Petroleum jelly shouldn’t be a deal-breaker, but you may want to stick with waxes made of natural and organic products. The best waxes usually include a mix of beeswax and natural oils and butter.

The scent of the wax. Wax scent is a personal preference so you should buy it accordingly. Some men are sensitive to smells; if you’re one of them, you’ll want to look for waxes with a light scent or no scent at all.

The color of the wax. Waxes come in different colors, so it’s always a good idea to choose one that matches your beard and mustache color.

,



Traditional Wax. Traditional Wax usually comes in a tube and is more likely to contain petrochemicals (Petroleum Jelly, Mineral Oil, etc.). The ratio is typically 1:1 Beeswax and Petroleum Jelly. This formulation was very popular back in the day before people began taking a serious look at the possible negative health effects prolonged exposure to such chemicals may cause.

The hold of traditional wax can be light to medium, and for some men, this is all they need. The consistency of the wax is soft and very malleable.
This wax has also been reported to cause clogged pores, acne, hives and skin irritation. The long term side effects are tough to gauge and an independent study has yet to emerge. Just keep in mind this will be under your nose all day.



Modern Moustache Wax/Trainer. A lot of new waxes on the market can be found packaged in a rectangular or round container. Wax in a tin is a good sign that the ingredients used are natural or organic. However, there are some exceptions. We recommend that you read the ingredients label carefully. If you cannot find a label there is a high possibility that the product contains something questionable. Contact the supplier if in doubt.

, Some waxers use a hair dryer set to low heat to blast it for a few seconds to soften the wax. If you do choose to heat it be careful. You never want to heat the wax to a liquid state. Others prefer running the closed tin under the hot water tap for a minute or two. The more experienced and familiar you become with wax the less you will need to use these methods.

, To do this place your forefinger on the surface of the wax, then lift and tilt your hand. This will put your finger at a 90-degree angle and the tip of your nail should just graze the surface. Now slide your fingernail across the wax, from one end of the tin to the other. A shaving of wax will build up on the back of your nail. With your thumb and forefinger work the wax into a pea size ball.

, The wax should become warm and very workable.

, Repeat this process on the other side of your stache. Now, with a comb or children’s toothbrush, rake the wax through the whiskers. Finally, it is time to mold and shape. Make sure your beard is completely dry. Adding wax to a damp or wet beard reduces its effectiveness.

, It may take you a few times before you have a good idea exactly how much wax you’ll need for your beard. A good rule of thumb is that you should start with a small amount and only add more if needed. If you are just trying to keep the hair out of your mouth, use the comb or brush to part the hair. When this is done on a daily basis the whiskers will become trained.

, The freshly waxed moustache may appear greasy at first but as it dries and stiffens this will change. A good wax will not be visible in your bristles or flake. If you are experiencing any of these issues discontinue use.

, The benefits of using an organic wax over a petrochemical based one is not only will it give you a great, safe hold but often the ingredients in organic waxes will penetrate the hair shaft giving your stache a deep conditioning, thus strengthening the bristles over time. Petroleum Jelly does not penetrate the hair shaft, but coats it, creating a moisture barrier.

, If you don't, build-up will occur which may in turn cause blocked pores and weigh down. Traditionally, removing moustache wax was done with hot soapy water. But, due to the fact that most soap these days are not actually soap but detergents, hair damage is inevitable. Detergents cause dryness and split ends. So, as an alternative opt for a liquid, oil-based moustache wax remover and conditioner.

, Make sure to coat all the bristles. Allow the oils a minute or two to bind with and loosen the wax, then comb or brush out from the center towards the edge of the mouth. At this point, you can choose to rinse your moustache with warm water or leave in the oils for an overnight deep conditioning .

You want to find a beard trimmer that will provide enough power to give you an even shave while keeping charged and not costing a lot of money. Some beard trimmers, like the Philips Norelco Beard Trimmer 7300 have many different length settings and include a vacuum feature to help with cleaning up.
Trimmers made by Wahl provide you with power and a long-lasting battery to get an even shave. A trimmer like the Wahl 9854-600 gives you three different beard comb lengths to choose from.
Most men only require a few options when it comes to trimming your beard. If you’re looking for a simple trim which evenly cuts your hair, you can save a few pennies on a less expensive trimmer.
Some trimmers are also waterproof. These trimmers can help you save time by allowing you to shave in the shower. Waterproof trimmers can be easier to clean.;
, Everyone has a different standard of what looks good in facial hair. The best way to find the length that works for you is to completely shave your face and let your facial hair grow out. Then, once you’ve reached the desired length, think about what kind of trimmer you need to maintain it. Take note of your desired length.
If you like your beard to be fuller and have a nice fade as it goes down your face and neck, then a powerful trimmer with three guard settings will work great.
If you like something shorter and more cropped, or even a 5 o'clock shadow, you don’t need a trimmer with a lot of options or tons of power. You’ll mostly be shaving without a guard using just the blades on the razor head.
If you like having a specific facial hairstyle such as a goatee or a chinstrap, you may want a trimmer that has several different trimmer heads and guards. You need something that allows you to swap out your standard trimmer head for a smaller set of blades to get more precision.

, Now that you know your options and your desired beard length, you can get a proper trimmer that fits your needs. With beard trimmers, you usually get what you pay for. This doesn’t mean you have to spend a lot of money, but buying a trimmer that boasts plenty of attachments and features for a smaller price tag might not yield great results.


If you know you only need a few guard options, your trimmer may not cost a lot. Something around the $20 range that offers a few guard options will most likely be reliable.
A trimmer that boasts variable speeds, long-lasting battery, several guard and trimmer head options for $20 probably won’t keep your beard looking trim very long.

, Take pride in your beard trimmer. You spent time and money finding the right one for your face. There may be a lot of little pieces and components that come with your trimmer. Get a dedicated container, if it doesn’t come with one, to store your charger, oil, heads, guards, and anything else.


It may sound silly, but taking the time and pride to keep your beard trimmer well-kept and organized, can mean the difference between a great-looking trim and an unkempt beard.
Keeping everything organised ensures that you won’t lose that one guard you go to most or the oil to keep your trimmer clean. It also ensures that when it’s time to go on a trip you have everything ready, including your charger.

, If you have a beard trimmer which needs oil to stay working properly, make sure that your trimmer is oiled up. Drop a few drops of oil over the blades and then run your trimmer.









Use the oil that comes with the clippers or WD40. After you've applied oil to the blades, wipe off any excess oil with a soft, dry cloth.
When oiling your clippers, you should make sure that you’ve brushed off any excess hair that might be in the blades.
Turn your clippers on and drip the oil onto them allowing the moving blades to saturate
Run the blades for about 20 seconds.
Thoroughly wipe the blades down, making sure that the tops of your blades are dry so hair doesn’t stick.

, Start long and finish short. If you have a sizeable beard and want to trim it down to a respectable, but still present length, start with your number 3 guard comb. Go over your entire beard. 








You want to shave up against the grain. Your facial hair will grow out and down. Point your blades up and shave up against the grain.
Place the flat part of the beard comb against your face to get the best results.
Shave both your neck and your face.
If you’re not seeing any change in length, you may have to switch to a lower guard like a 2.

, Once you’ve gone over your face and neck and have a good length, trim your neck. With a lower guard, like a 1, buzz the hair from your Adam’s apple to just under your jawline.









Again, shave in an upward motion.
If you want to go shorter than a 1 guard, remove the guard and shave with the blades on your trimmer.
You can also leave about two inches under your jaw unshaven with your 1 guard. Then fade the area by shaving that area with a 2 guard.

, Make sure that you get an even shave everywhere by looking in the mirror for any stray hairs. You also want to shave any areas below your Adam’s apple with your 0 guard, the blades on your trimmer.









If you want more of a fade, or trimmed your neck with your 0 guard, grab a razor and completely shave the area below your Adam’s apple.

, If you want to sport a 5 o’clock shadow, shave without a guard. For a 5 o’clock shadow, simply shave your entire face and neck with the blades on your trimmer head. This will leave you with stubble.









You can also clean up any problem areas by shaving with a straight razor after you’ve gone over with your beard trimmer.
To keep the bottom of your mustache clean and your mouth free of hair, use the trimmer without a guard. Smile with your mouth closed and trim the hair just above your upper lip in an even line.

, Your beard trimmer will release a lot of small clippings, especially if you have a lot of hair. It’s best to place a wastebasket below you when shaving to reduce the mess.


After you’ve let your clippings fall into your wastebasket, grab a damp paper towel and wipe up any stray clippings.

, Remove any guards you have on your trimmer. Place the guards you used in the sink. You can rinse your guards with soap and water because the guards are plastic.









Rinse the guards with warm water to remove any hair that may be sticking.

, Grab the brush that came with your beard trimmer and remove the clipper head from the handle. Brush away any hair that is caked to the trimmer.









You can remove the blade head of your trimmer by pushing up with your thumb. You will hear a popping noise once you’ve disconnected the blades. Then you can pull it off of your handle.
Grab a cotton swab and use it to clean between the blade grooves.
Once you’ve removed all the hair, place the blade head back on the clipper and run your clippers for a few seconds. This will shake any loose hairs off.
Unless you have a waterproof trimmer, never run it under water. This can break the trimmer and rust the blades.

, If you just oiled your beard trimmer before shaving you don’t have to oil it again. But oiling your trimmer after your shave is a good maintenance habit. Hold your trimmer over your sink and drop a few drops of oil onto the blades. Then run your trimmer for about 20 seconds.


Oiling your trimmer allows the blades and motor to stay lubricated, ensuring the longevity of your trimmer’s life.
Wipe your clippers down with a cloth or paper towel to remove any excess oil.

Depending on your skin type, you should be able to exfoliate your face up to three times per week.Rub an exfoliating sponge or loofah in tiny circular motions on your face using exfoliating cleanser, avoiding the sensitive skin below your eyes.
Rinse your face with warm water and apply facial moisturizer that contains alpha- or beta- hydroxy acids to aid in the exfoliation process.
You can make your own natural exfoliating cleanser by mixing 1 tsp (5ml) of baking soda with 1 tbsp (15ml) of liquid soap.

, This will help keep your skin smooth and encourage hair growth in the right direction. The smoother your skin is, the less likely it will be for you to get ingrown hairs.Apply moisturizers labeled as non-comedogenic to minimize clogging your skin pores.

, Wash your skin no more than five minutes prior to shaving. This will help prevent more ingrown facial hairs because moist, wet hair will cut easier with less irritation to the skin or the follicle.Dry, tough hair sometimes digs sideways or retracts back into your skin when it is pulled upward from its follicle.

, If you want to use a regular razor instead of an electric one, use a single-blade razor instead of a double-blade razor. These kinds of razors will give you a closer shave with a smaller chance of developing ingrown facial hairs.Double-blade razors will cause the first blade to lift your hair, while the second blade cuts your hair at a deeper point.

, This will give you a straighter, more consistent cut when shaving. Doing so will also help prevent future ingrown facial hairs because hair that is cut consistently in the same way with sharp, sharp blades is less likely to turn into an ingrown hair.


Dull, dirty, and rusted blades may cause a bacterial infection if ingrown hairs or other cuts are already present.
Rinse your blade after each shaving stroke to clean shaving foam and hair pieces from the blade.

, Apply shaving gels or shaving foams with lubricating ingredients that lack alcohol. Products that contain alcohol will dry your skin and close your skin pores., This is an important step because repeating strokes in the same areas will result in shorter hairs which increase your chances of developing ingrown hairs. This is especially true regarding the delicate skin on your face., This includes refraining from pulling your skin taut while shaving. This helps prevent the hairs from being cut too short. If you cut the hairs too short, they will be more likely to develop into ingrown hairs.Shave your hair in the same direction in which it grows. This will train the hair to grow straight out instead of sideways or back into the skin in addition to preventing it from being cut too short.
Use downward strokes on your upper lip, cheeks and chin and use upward strokes on your neck.

, If you shave using an electric razor, it can help reduce the number of ingrown hairs you get on your face since an electric razor does not shave as close to the skin as regular blades., Press a warm, wet washcloth to your face before waxing or plucking. This will help open up your pores which will, in turn, prevent ingrown hairs from developing., This is an important step to adhere to during the moment of hair removal. If your facial muscles are tense, it will be harder to remove the individual hairs because the follicles will constrict.

, Apply cold water, aftershave, or witch hazel to your face immediately after hair removal. These elements will help soothe and repair your skin after plucking or waxing, especially since the skin on your face is so delicate.


Wait two to three hours after removing hair to apply cream or heavy moisturizers to your face.
Applying creams or heavy moisturizers immediately may clog your pores.

, Ingrown hairs can lead to an infection, but at the very least they look bad and can become very tender or uncomfortable. This is especially troubling when they appear in noticeable places on your face.


Ingrown hairs need to come out. Once you notice an ingrown hair, stop shaving or waxing the area at once so that the hair has an opportunity to grow for a little bit. You should never break the skin or dig into it in order to reach an ingrown hair. Instead, you should let it come to the surface on its own so you don’t do more damage to your skin. The safest way to extract an ingrown hair is by pulling it out with tweezers. However, you have to wait for the hair to reach the surface on its own before you can do so.
Apply a hot compress to the area a couple of times a day to encourage the hair to reach the surface.

, Sometimes the worst part about an ingrown hair is how it looks, especially when it is on your face for the whole world to see. Ingrown hairs can really irritate and damage healthy skin. Treat the damaged skin with some soothing aloe vera or a gentle moisturizer., In rare cases, you may need to go see your doctor for some antibiotics if your ingrown facial hair becomes infected. Since the ingrown hair creates an opening in your skin, it is possible for bacteria to seep into the hole and cause an infection. Whenever you have an ingrown hair, you should be vigilant in watching for signs of redness, swelling, and discomfort that last more than a few days. If the pain and swelling does not dissipate within three to four days, call your doctor and tell them about your symptoms. "

Use tweezers to reduce facial hair.,
Try a disposable or reusable razor for use in wet shaving.,
Try threading.,
Use lasers.,
Try electrolysis.",How to Reduce Unwanted Facial Hair1," This is one of the most common ways people remove facial hair. It works best when you don't have that much hair to remove. One or two dark hairs on the chin? Tweezing is the best way to go.


Sterilize the ends of the tweezers with rubbing alcohol before and after plucking to avoid infection. Stretch the skin gently around the area that you want to pluck. Grip the hair near the root, and then firmly pull the hair.
Plucking facial hair is inexpensive, but time consuming. It can also be painful and lead to ingrown hairs if the hair breaks off underneath the skin. You can avoid ingrown hairs by pulling the hair gently as opposed to yanking it out with the tweezers.
Hair regrowth after plucking can occur in 3 to 8 weeks.;
, Apply a shaving gel or foam to the chin or upper lip. Glide the razor across the skin in the direction that the hair grows.


You can also use an electric razor for wet or dry shaving. Be careful or you could cause small cuts. It can be hard to use a razor on some areas of the face, like the chin.
Hair regrowth after shaving is fast, though. Hair can return in anywhere from a few hours to a few days. , Threading is becoming an increasingly common way to remove facial hair. It's often used to shape the eyebrows, but people who do threading can also remove your facial hair with the procedure.


The cosmetologist will twist a cotton thread around the hairs on the desired area and then pull them out in rows.
One benefit of threading is that, unlike waxing, it doesn't inflame sensitive skin. The hair will grow back in a couple of weeks.
Some salons now offer threading. Look in the phone book or ask your favorite salon.

, Laser hair treatments are very useful for getting rid of that unwanted hair. The laser gives off beams of heat and light to the roots of the hair and stops the hair from growing after a period of time.


To get the end result it will take 9 or more months but is much more worth it. It is more expensive at first, but in the end you save money. One of the downsides to laser hair treatment is that it can be very painful. A plus side is that it can permanently remove the hair.
You will probably need to go for repeated treatments to fully destroy the hair. Laser hair treatment works best on people with light skin and dark hair.

, Electrolysis should be done in the salon. This is a tedious process that is best for small areas of hair removal, such as above the lip.


Electrolysis is done with a small needle. An electric current is delivered into each hair root, one-by-one, permanently destroying the hair.
White or blonde hair can be removed with electrolysis, unlike laser treatment, which works better with darker hair and light skin. You will need to go for the treatments until the hair is destroyed.

Clean your skin.,
Place a warm washcloth over your face.,
Dry the skin thoroughly.,
Apply a small amount of powder to the skin.,
Use slanted tweezers.,
Draw lines to help guide you.,
Pluck the hair with the grain.,
Use a mirror in a well-lit spot.,
Check your work.,
Splash cool water on the skin.,
Apply aloe vera.,
Apply a cold compress.,
Apply a cortisone cream.",How to Pluck Facial Hair," It is important to start with clean skin because dirt and bacteria can get into the pores where you have plucked the hair and cause breakouts. Additionally, you will probably be touching your face with your hands, so it’s good to start with a clean palette.


Use a mild facial cleanser and lukewarm running water. Begin by splashing a bit of water on your face so it is wet. Then apply a dime-sized amount of cleanser. Use your fingertips to gently massage the cleanser onto your face using circular motions. When you are finished, rinse the skin thoroughly using fresh, lukewarm, running water.
If you don’t have time to wash your face properly, you can also apply a bit of toner or micellar water to a cotton ball and gently swipe it all over your face to remove some of the bacteria and dirt on your skin.
Don’t forget to wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water before touching your face!;
, Your pores will already be a bit more open if you have washed your face. However, applying a warm wet washcloth to the skin will help open up the pores even more. You want your pores to be as open as possible. This will make it easier to pull out the hair.


If you have just showered, you can skip this step as your pores will be open from the heat of the shower.
Make sure the warm washcloth is not too hot. You want to open your pores, but you don’t want to burn your skin.

, Wet skin can make it difficult to grasp the hairs; therefore, it is important to make sure you dry your skin well. Use a clean towel, and gently pat your skin dry.


Avoid rubbing your skin to dry it. This can cause irritation and redness.

, Applying a talcum powder to the skin where you plan to pluck will help remove any excess moisture, but it will also make it easier to see the hair.


Just take a tiny amount of powder and gently rub it onto the skin using your fingers. You don’t need to rub it in completely, just enough so that it sticks.
Talcum power comes in lots of products, but you may know talcum powder as “baby powder.” If you don’t want to use talcum powder, you can use a different product such as corn starch or even a bit of powdered foundation that will make the hair stand out from your skin.

, You may not realize it, but there are actually three different types of tweezers. Slanted tweezers are great for plucking hair. The end of this tweezer will be flat, but will be slanted down at an angle. This is ideal for plucking hairs, especially if they grow close to the skin.Other types of tweezers include needle-nosed tweezers and a hybrid version which is pointed at the tip, but also has a slanted edge. You may be able to manage plucking a stray hair with these in a pinch, but having a pair of slanted tweezers for regular use will be ideal.
To be extra careful, you can clean your tweezers with a bit of rubbing alcohol before each plucking session.

, If you are trying to pluck all the hairs in a particular area (e.g. your chin or above your lip), this may not be necessary. However, if you’re plucking an area where you want to leave some hairs behind (e.g. eyebrows), drawing guidelines can help keep you from overplucking.


There are different ways to do this. For example, if you are trying to shape your eyebrows, use a brow pencil and shape your eyebrows the way that you want them to look. Then, all you have to do is pluck the hairs that stand outside of the desired shape.
You can also use a makeup pencil that contrasts with your skin. For example, if you are trying to shape your sideburns into a particular shape, you can use the pencil to draw the guidelines. Then, simply pluck the hairs that are on the wrong side of the line and leave the rest.

, When you’re ready to pluck a hair, use the tweezers to grab the hair as close to the base as possible. Then, pull the hair quickly from the skin in the direction it grows. This will make the hair come out as easily as possible.


If you pull the hair in the opposite direction that it grows, you will probably experience more pain than necessary as it is more difficult to pull the hair out this way.
Do your best to grab the hair as close to the base as possible without pinching your skin. This will make the process as painless as possible. Additionally, if you don’t grab it from the base, the hair may simply break off when you pull leaving you with stubble.

, You may think you should use a magnified mirror so that you can see every little hair, but this can lead to overplucking. Instead, use a mirror that is in a very well-lit area.If you can’t see the hair easily in front of a well-lit mirror, then neither can anyone else.

, If your plucking the hairs while sitting or standing very close to a mirror, there is a danger that you will lose sight of the bigger picture (your face), and overpluck. This is especially true if you are plucking your eyebrows, and you want them to be even.


Pluck a few hairs and then lean back to take in your whole face. When it comes to plucking eyebrows and sideburns especially, less is more. Check after every few hairs to make sure you aren’t overdoing it.

, This will help soothe your skin where you have plucked the hairs, and it will also help to reduce redness and inflammation. You don’t need to wash your face with soap again, just simply splash the cool water on, and pat the skin dry gently.


If you don’t want to dry the skin with a towel, you can also let it air dry.

, Aloe vera is commonly sold in stores to treat sunburns, but it has many other uses. If you have a bottle of Aloe vera, rub a tiny amount onto the skin where you have plucked to help get rid of any pain and redness.If you have an Aloe vera plant at home, you can cut off a tip of one of the leaves and use the clear gel that comes out. This is the same thing they sell in stores, but it doesn’t have any of the added chemicals and colorings of commercial products.

, If you are feeling a lot of pain after plucking, applying a cold compress to the area will feel soothing, and may also be helpful in reducing any inflammation.


If you are using a cold compress or ice cubes, be sure to wrap them in a towel. Applying something that cold directly to the skin can cause an ice burn, which is just as painful and dangerous as a burn caused by heat., If you are worried about swelling, you can apply an over the counter cortisone cream to the area. This will help reduce swelling.Be careful when applying a cortisone around the eye. If it gets in your eye, it could cause irritation.

,
Wait until it is dry.,
Repeat the method if necessary.",How to Straighten Curls on a Wig2," It is the best method for both straightening and curling a wig.It is also the best method for synthetic wigs that may be more delicate to heated styling tools.

, Allow the hair to fall straight down without resting on anything. Tripods work brilliantly if you fit a mannequin head on them.

, Boil about 1.5L for a long wig and 1L or less for a short wig.

, The heat of the water will soften the plastic fibers and will pull them down.

,, Use a wide soft-bristled brush. For extremely curly wigs, it will take more than one treatment and a lot of time.

, It does no damage to the wig and can be done while the wig is still wet. This is a permanent style; you will need to re-curl the wig if you don't want it straight anymore. You're basically remolding plastic into a new shape, so will need to mold it back if you want the curls again.

Try waxing.,
Use depilatories.,
Try bleaching.",How to Reduce Unwanted Facial Hair2," You could either use an at home waxing kit or get the facial hair waxed away in a salon. Waxing removes hair from the root, so it's an effective way to get a smooth face. It irritates some people's skin, though. Warm wax should be applied to the desired area using the applicator that comes with the kit and then allowed to cool. Use your fingers to pull the cold wax off of your skin in the opposite direction of the hair growth. Regular waxing can reduce regrowth because this technique interrupts the development of hair follicles.
If your skin is sensitive to wax, you could try sugaring, which is a natural method similar to waxing. Add 2 cups of granulated sugar and 1/4 cup lemon juice to 1/4 cup water. Boil until it turns into a paste. It needs to simmer about 25 minutes and turn amber brown. Let it cool. Dust your skin with corn starch or baby powder. Apply the mixture in the opposite direction of hair growth. Put a rag on it, and then pull it off.

, Depilatories are chemical products that remove unwanted facial hair from the surface of the skin. The chemicals dissolve the hair into a gel-like substance.


Apply the depilatory to the skin. Leave the product on the skin based on the timing instructions that come with the product. Once the product has been on the skin for the required length of time, wipe it off of your skin with a clean cloth.
Hair regrows a few days after using a depilatory. Depilatories can be purchased across the counter. One problem with depilatories is that they have a strong chemical smell.

, Bleaching doesn't remove unwanted facial hair. However, it can make it harder to see. The trick is making sure the product matches your skin tone. If you have heavy hair growth, this is not a good solution for you. Bleaching regularly can irritate the skin. So you should test it out on a small patch of the skin before using it more heavily.
If you do bleach, stay out of the sun for at least an hour. If you don't, the skin could have a bad reaction.

Make a paste with Tumeric.,
Try an egg mask.",How to Reduce Unwanted Facial Hair3," You can make a gelatin face mask at home to remove unwanted facial hair. All you need is a tablespoon of unflavored gelatin, 2 to 3 tablespoons of milk, 3 to 4 drops of lime juice or 1 to 2 drops of lavender essential oil.


Mix the products together, then microwave them for about 15 seconds. Apply the mixture to your face, and let it sit for a few minutes. Then, peel it off.
Make sure you don't get the mixture near your eyebrows or eyes. When you peel the mask off, you should find that unwanted facial hair (and blackheads) come off with it.

, Fruit-based scrubs can help you remove unwanted facial hair without the harshness of chemical products.


For the lemon/orange peel scrub, mix together 1 teaspoon each of powdered orange and lemon peel, ground almond, and oatmeal. Add 2 teaspoons of olive oil and 1 teaspoon of rose water. Mixing these items should create a paste. Put the paste on your face for about 5-8 minutes. Rub the paste into your skin with small circular movements. Then rinse your face with water. You will need to do this 2-3 times a week to see results.
For the apricot scrub, grind half a cup of dried apricots in a blender until it's a powder. Then add 1 teaspoon of honey. Apply to face for 5-10 minutes. Rub into skin with small circular movements, and then rinse with lukewarm water. You also need to use this scrub 2-3 times a week to see any difference.

, Tumeric has been used for a long time in India to improve the look of the skin. You can make a homemade paste out of it. All you need is 1 to 2 teaspoons of Tumeric, and milk or water. Mix them into a paste. Put it on your face for 15 to 20 minutes. Let it dry. Then, wash it off with warm water.
This paste will work best for people with fine facial hair. If the hair is denser, you could add oatmeal to the paste.

, Another natural remedy for removing facial hair can be made with eggs. You need 1 egg white, 1 tablespoon of sugar, and 1/2 tablespoon of cornflour.

Drink spearmint tea.,
Use a hair growth inhibitor.,
Although there's not much evidence of long-lasting effect, make a drink out of black cohosh herb.,
Deal with hormones.",How to Reduce Unwanted Facial Hair4," Spearmint tea affects the amount of male hormone in your body, so if you drink it enough, you might see less facial hair growth.


Studies published in scientific journals like Phytotherapy Research have found that women who drank spearmint tea reduced the amount of testosterone (male hormone) flowing through their blood streams. This reduction in testosterone led to less unwanted hair growth.
Consume 2 cups of spearmint teas for a minimum of 5 days per week. , Visit your dermatologist to get a prescription for a hair inhibitor. Hair inhibitors are plant-based products that change the structure of hair follicles so that the hair grows thin and soft and eventually it does not grow at all.


Apply the cream to the areas of your face where you want to reduce hair growth. The cream will remain on your skin. Follow the instructions that accompany the product to determine frequency of use.
Hair growth inhibitors can be used in conjunction with other hair reduction methods such as threading, waxing and tweezing.
Results may take 4 to 6 months. It costs about $100 for a supply that will last you two months. , This herb slows down facial hair growth. In addition to turning it into tea, you can find it in capsule form. With any natural herbs, it's a good idea to check with your doctor first.


To make the tea, you need 20 grams of dry black cohosh root, 4 1/4 cups of water, and a teaspoon of honey. Boil the water and root, and then let it simmer for 30 minutes. Strain it.
Put the honey into the concoction. Drink three times a day. You will need to refrigerate the liquid. Higher dosages of the tea can cause side effects, and it shouldn't be used if you have liver disease or cancer, so it's best to see a doctor before you try this regimen.

, Sometimes hair will grow more because of a hormone issue, such as during menopause. This is a condition that should only be diagnosed by a doctor.


Sometimes doctors will prescribe birth control pills to help address such issues.Some underlying medical conditions can cause facial hair growth, such as polycystic ovary syndrome.
Eat foods with phytoestrogen. If you eat foods with this ingredient, it can help cure an estrogen imbalance, although again you should check with a doctor. More estrogen can slow down hair growth. Licorice, alfalfa, fennel and flaxseeds are natural products that contain phytoestrogen.
Basically, phytoestrogen mimics the role that estrogen plays in the body.

Shave it just beyond your jawline.",How to Maintain Stubble," Though men may like the designer stubble look for several reasons, you should especially consider it if you’re prone to shaving irritation and ingrown facial hairs. Maintaining the hairs at a short length can help clear up skin, and it can also give baby-faced men a more rugged, handsome look.;
, Some men may think they can’t pull off stubble due to sparse or patchy facial hair growth. When shaving every day or two, this can be hard to determine since some hair may simply grow more slowly. Stop shaving longer than you normally would—up to a week even—and decide then if you believe your hair growth can warrant a stubble look.

, If you’re looking for a truly low-maintenance facial hair style, then the stubble look may not be for you. Though you don’t have to tend to stubble every single day, you’ll still have to clean it up approximately three times a week, and the process can potentially take longer than regular shaving alone.

, Let your stubble grow to the point of being a short beard. As with a regular hair cut, you can always take more off, but you can’t put back what is no longer attached. Grow your beard to a length that you know is slightly longer than you’d ever want to keep your stubble.


How long this will take depends entirely on your particular beard growth. For some men this may take three or four days while for others it could be over a week.

, Start with a slightly longer setting on your trimmer such as a 4. This will take all of the hair down to an even length. Especially for men with dark, thick beards, this setting will probably be too scruffy for the look they want, but it works for some—think Hugh Jackman., Once you have an even length to work with, begin trimming your stubble down in increments to find the right length for you. The length you decide on will ultimately depend on your hair density, hair color, and how clean of a designer stubble look you want.Remember that you may also choose to keep the stubble on different parts of your face at different lengths to achieve a cleaner look. You may decide that the best look for you is using a 3 setting along your jaw and mustache but a 2 setting on your cheeks to create a more blended look that fades rather than ends dramatically.Don’t worry if taking the length down makes spots like your cheeks feel patchy. Some men such as Ryan Gosling rock the designer stubble look with barely any hair extending onto their cheeks. You’ll clean up those patchy spots in the next step.

, Once you have the length of your stubble where you want it, you can take care of stray hairs or asymmetrical spots by cleaning up around the edges. For this, you can take the setting guard off your trimmer to use it as a set of electric clippers, or you can use a plain old razor.Common areas to clean up while edging include the sparse hairs some men get high up on their cheek bones or upper lip hairs that might take away from the definition one wants in his mustache.

, For many men, deciding how they want the stubble look to transition to their neckline is the hardest part. If you decide on a slightly longer, more rugged look with your stubble, then you probably want to keep some stubble on your neck as well. For a cleaner look—or if the hair growth on your neck is too patchy—then you can clean it up in an easy way.

, If you decide to keep some of the stubble on your neck, then fade it out. Shorten the length to a 2 setting past your jawline and then to a 1 setting around your Adam’s apple.This allows you to fade the hair out in a natural way without leaving a sharp contrast between stubble on your face and a smooth neck.

, If you keep a shorter, cleaner stubble look and don’t want the hair to extend to your neck, then you can shave it smooth just beyond your jawline. Take your fingers and feel for the spot just behind your jawbone under your chin where the skin gets soft and you can push at it; this is the spot where you want to create your natural edge for your neckline.By shaving starting at this point, you allow the stubble to extend down the visible portion of your jawline and the sharp contrast line stays hidden under your chin.

Do any final edging.",How to Manage Your Beard," A healthy diet generally promotes healthy skin and hair, and this includes your beard., As the hair transitions from stubble to a full-fledged beard, you are likely to encounter several weeks of itch.The itching is unpleasant, but don’t despair because it will go away. You must persevere!


You can also purchase a conditioning lotion tailored to help soothe beard itch during this uncomfortable period., The best thing you can do to achieve a full-bodied beard is let it grow. It may mean a bit of a wild man look for several weeks, but attempting to trim or shape a beard too early can result in thin or patchy areas that can set you back a month or more.Since beards certainly don’t grow at the same rate, it’s hard to put a time frame on this, but you should wait until you have about 1” or 1.5” of growth before you do any trimming or shaping., You wouldn’t use face wash or regular soap on top of your head, and you shouldn’t on your beard either. Use shampoo to clean your beard about every other day, but you can tailor this to oily or dry skin types as well.








Using a moisturizing shampoo will keep the hair healthy and stop the hair from becoming brittle., Even if you don’t use conditioner for the hair on your head, you should make a habit of using it on your beard. Beard hair is much more prone to getting wiry or brittle, and conditioner will help keep the hair soft and healthy.You may even want to consider a leave-in conditioner that you don’t have to rinse out., Beard oils are specially formulated conditioning oils that help promote a healthy beard. Apply a dime-size portion after your morning shower and work it thoroughly through your beard.Some men even like using a boar bristle brush to work the beard oil fully into their beards., Noncomedogenic simply means that the product won’t clog your pores. If you use any type of styling products on your beard such as mustache wax, look for this word on the product to help avoid developing blemishes or ingrown hairs on the skin beneath your beard., Just as a stylist combs out your hair before taking scissors to it, you want to do the same with your beard.You may specifically prefer a wider-tooth comb or a boar bristle brush for combing out your beard.








, Especially when you’re going for a longer or tapered beard, you’re better off trimming the bulk around your chin with scissors, but you can still use a beard trimmer on the sides and around your cheeks.Start with a longer setting on your beard trimmer. Nearly all beard trimmers are going to have a guard with adjustable lengths. Since it’s always easier to remove a bit more rather than grow some back, start with a longer setting on the trimmer and move down incrementally until you find the setting you want.No matter whether you’re trimming with scissors or a beard trimmer, always trim your beard when it’s dry.

, When it comes time to pull out the scissors, start from the bottom and trim slowly in small groupings rather than shearing too much.Use a comb in coordination with the scissors to trim at equal lengths.
Though you start at the bottom, you may find it helpful to trim up one side of your beard to shape it, then duplicate it on the other side afterward as opposed to shaping the whole thing at once., Sometimes the difference between a kempt beard and a grizzly one is a matter of cleaning up the edges. Shaving any stray upper cheek hairs, cleaning up your neckline, and trimming any accompanying mustache (if you have one) are all important in managing your beard.


The standard way to determine your neckline is to look at your profile in a three-way mirror and imagine a slightly curved line the runs from just behind your earlobe down to just above your Adam’s apple.Shaving anything below this line will create a suave, natural neckline.

If you want bushier sideburns, then you may need to grow your hair even longer. Facial hair grows at a regular, but somewhat slow rate, so it may take as much as a month or more to get your facial hair to the right length for sideburns.


Try growing your hair into a beard first to get the length and then you can shave the facial hair into sideburns later.
If you just want short, stubble length sideburns, then you might be able to get these within a few days to a week. Grow your facial hair until it reaches the length that you desire.
Keep in mind that if you are young, such as in your teens or twenties, then it might take even longer to grow your facial hair. Try to be patient while you wait.;
, Keeping your facial hair and skin moisturized as you let it grow may result in better looking sideburns. Try applying a few drops of beard oil on your facial hair while you are growing it out.


If you don’t have beard oil, then just using a facial moisturizer or a few drops of olive oil may be enough to keep your beard and skin moisturized.

, When your facial hair starts to get long, you will need to start combing it to keep it looking neat. Use a beard comb or a natural bristle brush to groom your facial hair as it grows. Try to comb or brush it once per day.

, Sideburns are distinct strips of facial hair at the sides of your face hair that connect to the hair on your head. When your facial hair has reached the length that you desire, you can shave off the hair on your chin and off most of your cheeks to create the sideburns.


To get sideburns, shave the hair off of your chin and off of the lower part of your cheek.
Then, shave around the hair that extends from the area just about your ear to create a strip. You can make this strip as thin or as thick as you like. Some people even create designs with their sideburns, but this is more advanced.
When you are finished, you should just have strips on both sides of your face that extend from the hair above your ear to about the middle of your cheek.

, Trimming your sideburns leaves plenty of room for experimentation and individual expression. Are you looking for bushy sideburns, or something modern and trimmed? Are you looking for a straight, or tapered bottom? If you have a model in mind, take a precision trimmer and cut around in the likeness of your example. You can even cater the look of your sideburns to the shape of your own face.


For long and thinner faces, bushier, jawline sideburns will help soften the angles of your face shape.
Rounder faces may benefit more from shorter sideburns.

, Once you've found a sideburn style that you really like, you will just need to maintain your look. Try to trim the areas around your sideburns at least once every three days. You can use a razor blade or use an electric razor to trim around your sideburns.You will also need to trim the length of your sideburns to prevent them from becoming too long. Many electric razors have an adjustable hair length setting for trimming facial hair without shaving it all off.

, Regular exercise may help to boost your testosterone naturally and this may lead to better facial hair growth. Try to do some cardiovascular exercise for at least 30 minutes every day and incorporate some weight lifting into your routine a couple of days per week as well.For cardio, you can run, walk, ride a bike, swim, dance, or use an exercise machine, such as an elliptical walker.
Find something that you really enjoy doing to make it easier to stick with it.

, Following a healthy diet may also help you to lose weight, which can help to boost testosterone and improve your ability to grow facial hair.


Include plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins in your diet.
Avoid fatty, greasy, fried, and sugary foods.
Take a daily multivitamin to provide extra nutritional insurance.

, Making sure that you are well rested is important for your overall well-being, but it may also help to improve your testosterone levels.Aim for at least seven hours of sleep every night.


To sleep better, try to go to bed at the same time every night and wake up at the same time every morning.
You can also try using a relaxing bedtime routine, such as taking a bath, drinking a cup of herbal tea, or listening to some relaxing music.
Avoid using your phone, watching TV, or using a computer at least one hour before bedtime. The light from these screens can interfere with your ability to fall asleep and stay asleep.

, Stress can also affect your testosterone levels, which can interfere with hair growth and even cause hair loss.Make sure that you keep your stress levels under control to ensure optimal hair growth. You can do this by including a relaxation technique in your daily routine. Some things you can do to manage stress include:



Practicing yoga.

Meditating.

Doing deep breathing exercises.

Performing progressive muscle relaxation.

, If you are concerned that your testosterone levels are too low, then you may want to see your doctor. Your doctor can perform a simple blood test to determine your testosterone levels.In some cases, slightly low testosterone levels may not cause any symptoms and it treatment may not be necessary. If your levels are low enough to cause symptoms, such as a lack of facial hair, then your doctor may recommend medication to bring up your levels.Your doctor may also recommend some lifestyle changes to boost your testosterone, such as losing weight or quitting smoking.

, If waiting for your facial hair to grow and making lifestyle changes does not seem to make a difference, then you might want to talk to your doctor about using a hair growth product such as minoxidil.This product is most often recommended for use on your head, but some people have had success growing facial hair after using minoxidil on their faces.


Keep in mind that minoxidil has some side effects and you have to use it for a long time to make it work.It can take months before you see any results.
Talk with your doctor before you decide to try minoxidil for growing facial hair.
Do not try to use minoxidil to grow facial hair if you have not yet started to get facial hair, such as if you are a teenager or in your twenties. Talk with your doctor if you are concerned about a lack of facial hair.

, For those with severely low testosterone, or for men who are making the transition from female to male, testosterone therapy may be the only way to grow facial hair.If you suspect that you have low testosterone or you know that you cannot grow facial hair, then talk with your doctor and ask about testosterone therapy.

, Getting a facial hair transplant can transform your face and allow you to grow sideburns or even a full beard. However, keep in mind that this option is quite expensive. It is also a surgical procedure, so it should be a last resort option.


Talk to your doctor if you are considering a facial hair transplant.

Commit to the growth.,
Try to leave the hair alone as it grows.,
Experiment with beard oil if desired.,
Try supplements.",How to Grow Facial Hair1," You might be frustrated that you are not able to grow a beard that is as full as you would like it to be. But the real problem might not be lack of growth, but lack of time. Beards can take up to four full weeks (and in some cases, even longer) to fully grow in. Many people give up before that time, and assume that they can't grow a full beard, when in reality, they gave up too soon.Growing a beard is a project you need to commit to. Don't give up after several days! If after four or five weeks you still don't have results you're looking for, then it is time to try some alternative methods.
Do not shave your facial hair at the first sign of itching. It is normal for new hairs to cause your skin to feel itchy, but as they get longer, they will soften, and the itching will stop.Use an over-the-counter steroid cream like hydro-cortisone. This may help relieve some of the itching.Waiting for hair to grow can be a frustrating experience, especially when your beard and mustache goes through a scraggly period, that may have people commenting. As your hair begins to grow in, it may seem patchy and incomplete. However, as the hairs become longer, the slower-growing follicles will have time to sprout their own hairs. Gradually, the patchy gaps will eventually be hidden, both by longer hairs and the slower, shorter hairs growing in as well.;
, Let your hair do its thing. This means that you should not try to shape it too early in the growth process. When shaping facial hair, it is a common mistake to take off more than the intended amount. For this reason, it's best to just leave it alone while you are growing it out. Don't worry, there will be plenty of time for you to style it later, after you're happy with the growth.


As your hair grows, comb it in the direction you want it to grow. This will help it turn out looking the way you want.
After about four weeks, you might want to have a barber or stylist do some professional shaping. Carefully explain that you are growing out your facial hair, and you just want shape--not a reduction in hair.

, Beard oil hydrates both your facial hair and the skin underneath. Since it contains moisturizing properties, it also acts as a styling agent. A beard oil is great because even if you have less hair than you would like, what you do have will look great.Experts recommend applying beard oil right after your morning shower. Your pores will be clean and better able to absorb the product. Just put a small amount of oil into your hand and rub it into your face and beard or mustache.
Beard oil makes your facial hair look great, and also helps to keep it looking clean and smelling fresh. There are many different brands available, so try a few to find the one you like best. Try visiting the men's floor at your local department store--they might have some free samples.

, There are certain nutrients that you can add to your daily routine that can help encourage faster, more effective hair growth. Consider adding supplements to your morning regimen--just ask your doctor before making changes to your health care routine.


Promote thicker hair with folic acid. This is necessary for the growth and repair of hair. Most drug stores and health food stores will sell folic acid supplements.You can also try increasing the amount of folic acid in your diet. Folic acid can be found in whole-grain breads and cereals, leafy green vegetables, peas, and nuts.Increase your biotin intake. Biotin is an important water-soluble B vitamin, necessary for the the formation of fatty acids and glucose, as well as for metabolizing amino acids and carbohydrates. A biotin deficiency can lead to hair loss, so making sure you are getting the recommended amount is well worth the effort.Biotin is found in liver, oysters, cauliflower, beans, fish, carrots, bananas, soy flour, egg yolks, cereals, yeast, and other foods. While you can take vitamin supplements that include biotin, eating fresh foods is a great option, if it is available to you."

Start with a clean-shaven face.,
Apply shaving cream.,
Make a circle beard.,
Rinse off your face.,
Create a neat goatee.,
Disconnect your mustache from your chin beard.,
Trim your mustache using scissors or an electric razor.,
Wash your face again.",How to Grow a Van Dyke Beard1," Whether you’re a beard-styling champion or first-timer, your face is your canvass - start fresh. Shave completely and then wait a week for your hair to even out. Your face is ready for the Van Dyke when your stubble has grown out to about ¼ inch.For some people it may take more than a week for the hair to grow back in. If you’re patient, you’ll be rewarded with a better-looking Van Dyke.






If you’re reluctant to start from scratch, you can create the Van Dyke from facial hair that already exists. However, it’s much more difficult to control the final outcome when you aren’t working with fresh hair.;
, Go ahead and apply it all over your chin, above your lip, and up to your sideburns.

, Begin by shaving your sideburns and cheeks. Start near your ears and remove your sideburns, as well as most of the hair on your cheeks, leaving approximately 2 inches (5.1 cm) to both sides of your mouth. Shave the hair from the bottom and sides of your neck, stopping just above your Adam’s apple. Leave your mustache and soul patch intact. The end result is what’s called a “circle beard,” a still common style that was popular in the 90s.

, Wash away any excess hair or shaving cream. The precision work is about to begin, and you need to be able to see what you’re doing. At this point, it’s helpful to use just enough shaving cream to guide your razor, without covering up all your hair.

, Carefully trim the hair from your neck until you are left with a small, neat beard, resembling a goatee. Scissors or an electric razor will help you control the overall shape and definition of your chin hairs. Classically, the Van Dyke beard is somewhat pointed; wax will help your hair retain its shape.

, Leave the skin around your soul patch (if you grow one) completely smooth.

, Measure twice, cut once, as a single errant swipe could force you to start clean. Like the chin beard, the classic Van Dyke mustache is pointed and very neat.

, Make sure you didn’t miss any visible hairs. Run your hand over your cheeks and around your beard to feel for rough spots, and go back over any you find with a razor.

Practice proper skin care.,
Watch your diet.,
Get moving.,
Rest up.,
Relax.",How to Grow Facial Hair2," Your skin is your body's largest organ, and has many important functions. One of those functions is helping you grow hair. Caring for your skin is one of the most effective ways that you can support the growth of fuller facial hair.


Exfoliate your face. Hair follicles can become blocked with dirt and prevent your hair from growing. Once a week, wear an exfoliant mask with eucalyptus. It's great for your skin, and can help promote hair growth.Use hair-healthy grooming products. Shampoos, or lotions with a vitamin B complex, will help.
Massage your hair follicles. A gentle massage can help stimulate your hair follicles. Use your finger tips, and gently massage your face in circular motions for about two to three minutes. Try applying a facial moisturizer to create a smoother massage., What you eat can have a major impact on all aspects of your physical well-being. This includes healthy skin and healthy hair growth. There are many vitamins that have been found to promote hair growth--including facial hair. Pay attention to your diet, and make sure that you're getting enough of these particular nutrients.


Incorporate hair-healthy vitamins into your diet. While you can always apply hair-growth treatments to your face, and hope for the best, working from the inside out is always the better option.Take in vitamin A. This vitamin stimulates the production of sebum, which keeps your hair follicles and skin hydrated.You can find vitamin A in eggs, meat, cheese, liver, carrots, pumpkin, broccoli, and dark green leafy vegetables.Get plenty of vitamin E, which has long been recognized as key for healthy skin, and can increase blood flow, which leads to an optimal environment for hair growth. Foods rich in vitamin E include oils, leafy vegetables, nuts, and beans, and most people get plenty of vitamin E when eating a normal diet.Boost circulation with vitamin B3. Healthy circulation may have a positive effect on hair growth. Reports find that B3 is even more effective when taken with biotin.Take in vitamin B5. This is also known as pantothenic acid. It not only helps the body use fats and proteins, necessary for healthy hair, it also has been reported to help reduce stress; and stress can definitely inhibit hair growth.Vitamin B5 occurs naturally in brewer's yeast, broccoli, avocado, egg yolks, organ meats, duck, milk, lobster, whole-grain breads, and more., There are many health benefits of exercising such as increased circulation, which promotes hair growth. No matter how you choose to exercise, just try to get your heart rate up for about one hour everyday. Making this part of your routine can help encourage healthy hair growth.Choose an activity that you like. If you like sports, organize a weekly game of basketball or soccer with your friends. Bonus: involving others will make you more likely to stick to your exercise plans.
Change your habits. You can find a lot of ways to get more movement in your day. For example, try taking the stairs at work instead of the elevator.

, Get plenty of sleep. Your body uses sleep as time to grow and repair. Teenagers need around eight to nine hours of sleep every night, and adults need about seven to eight hours of sleep every night. Be sure to plan your schedule so that you are giving your body enough time to function properly, and grow your hair.Try to go to bed and wake up at the same time each day. This can be hard on the weekends, when it is tempting to sleep in. But having a regular sleep schedule is great for your overall health.

, Manage your stress. One of the noted side-effects of stress is hair loss. This means avoiding stressful situations, and finding time throughout the day to relax. There are several techniques you can use to lower your stress. Try talking to a friend or family member if you're feeling stressed--they can often be a comfort.Focus on your breathing. Taking several deep breaths in and out during a stressful situation is a great way to calm your heart rate and clear your mind.
Be patient. Remember that not everyone's facial hair grows at the same rate. Worrying about it isn't going to help, and can in fact make the situation worse. Try to focus on other things throughout the day.

Try using Rogaine.,
Ask your doctor about testosterone therapy.,
Consult with a plastic surgeon.",How to Grow Facial Hair3," Rogaine has an ingredient called minoxidil that helps to stimulate fresh hair growth. It is one of the most popular hair growth methods for men. You can purchase Rogaine over-the-counter at most drug stores. Just remember, it is formulated for hair growth on top of the head, not the face, and usage is not FDA approved.It is dangerous to ingest minoxidil, so be careful when applying Rogaine near your mouth. Be sure to consult with your physician before using Rogaine for facial hair growth.You may experience side effects such as eye burning or irritation, dandruff, or itchy skin., Testosterone, which is the male sex hormone, can be applied through injection, through topical applications, or taken orally (though this is not recommended due to adverse effects on the liver).Low testosterone levels could be responsible for stunted facial hair growth.For best results, testosterone therapy should be closely regulated. Too much testosterone can backfire, and actually inhibit growth of hair.If you have low testosterone, there will likely be other symptoms, such as erectile dysfunction and decreased muscle mass. Your doctor will want to run some tests to make sure your levels are actually low. Don't count on a prescription based solely on your hair growth.
Using testosterone may take up to a year to produce results., For some, nature was just not kind, and no matter what you try, whiskers refuse to call your face ""home."" When all else fails, a plastic surgeon can help by transplanting hair follicles from your scalp into your face. Hair transplants can be very effective, but they can also be costly, in terms of time and money.


This is generally done on an outpatient basis, and will result in some mild skin irritation. It can also take quite a long time—one to two years—for the procedure to deliver the results you want.Ask your general physician to recommend someone she trusts to perform the transplants. Make sure you have a consultation beforehand, and ask plenty of questions about the procedure.

Comb your beard.,
Keep the lines defined.,
Employ wax to fancy it up.",How to Grow a Van Dyke Beard2," A small beard comb works wonders when it comes to identifying and removing stray whiskers . . . and food crumbs. The Van Dyke is a refined look; inattention will show!

, The shape of your chin beard has a huge effect on your overall appearance, so keep the lines clean as time passes. While new beard growth is inevitable, daily attention to your face, and precision upkeep of your mustache, soul patch and chin beard area with a pair of sharp scissors and a beard trimmer will help you extend the mileage on your Van Dyke.

, Beard and mustache wax - especially when applied with a twist of your fingers - can turn your Van Dyke into a show stopper at a party or special event. Be sure to wear clothes as stylish as your beard.

Try ""beard lube"" to combat itchiness or dryness.",How to Grow a Beard," The worst way to grow a beard is to just stop shaving, or to never start. This results in patchy, uneven, and thin beards that just flat-out won't look good on your face. If your facial hair isn't growing in evenly all around your face, keep shaving regularly, and be patient until it does.


If you're not sure how evenly your facial hair is growing in, shave your entire face and look for stubble. Does it grow on the tip of your chin as quickly as over your lip? Does it grow under your neck at the same rate as it does on your sideburns? If so, you're ready for growing a beard.If your beard doesn't grow evenly, there's a bit you can do to speed up the process and ensure that your hair will eventually grow in as thickly as possible.
Genetics has a lot to do with your ability to grow facial hair. Some people simply won't be able to grow full beards.;
, If you're currently going through puberty, or have gone through puberty but haven't started growing your facial hair yet, there are some simple things you can do to stimulate testosterone levels and encourage hair growth. The effect won't necessarily be fast, but you'll get hair growing if you do some combination of the following:









Exercise. Doing intensity training, cardio, and some strength training a few times a week encourages testosterone growth in males, helping to get facial hair growing. Warm up for three minutes, then do on/off sets, with 30 seconds of all-out exercise, then 90 seconds of moderate exercise. Do sets of seven of these circuits.
Get your Vitamin D levels up, either by taking a supplement, or by spending some more time out in the sun, absorbing Vitamin D naturally.
According to some recently published research, ashwagandha is an herb that stimulates testosterone in men. It's also known as adaptogen, and is commonly sold as a supplement.

, As you're trying to stimulate facial hair growth, it's also important to take care of your skin and address issues that can keep hair from growing evenly and looking good. Talk to your doctor about problems with rosacea, acne, or dryness before you decide to grow a beard.


See your dermatologist while you are still shaving regularly. Apply the prescribed or over-the-counter medication for at least one month before growing facial hair.
Keep your face moisturized, to keep the follicles healthy and stimulated. Use a natural foaming cleanser on your face to keep the skin healthy.

, Just as you need a clean canvas to start paining, when you decide you're ready to start growing a beard, you need a clean face. Start from scratch, trimming any facial hair you do have off, then shaving close to the skin. This will ensure that everything will grow as evenly as possible as you're starting your new beard.









Consider springing for a razor shave at a barber shop. This is typically the closest and most even shave you can get, to start out.
After you shave, just stop for a period of about four weeks and do nothing, other than wash your face regularly and take care of your skin. Your facial hair should start to come in normally.

, Lots of guys stop growing out facial hair and start shaving because it gets itchy. Understand that itchiness will last for approximately four weeks, before you'll eventually get used to it, once the beard softens slightly.


Use a moisturizer, or a natural beard oil on your beard follicles to soften the hairs and to keep the beard from itching too much. While there will always be some itchiness associated with the growing of body hair, it's possible to control somewhat. Read the third section for more information about beard care.

, Everyone's facial hair grows at different rates, and it will take a while for some guys to grow beards, while others will seem to sprout whiskers in between morning shaves and evening showers. At whatever age and maturity level you're at, it's important to stay patient and wait for your beard to grow at its own pace.









For some guys, growing a beard out will happen in two or three weeks, while for others it may take as long as several months to get real results.

, While lots of men like to grow out their beards in cold months for insulation purposes, it's a common misconception that beards are more uncomfortable in hot weather. In actuality, beards help protect from UV sun rays, and work to cool the skin during hot weather, trapping sweat close to your face, cooling as it evaporates.While the itchiness associated with beards is typically less desirable during hot weather, it's not something that will do much to keep you warm.









Beards offer a variety of other health benefits, including trapping dust to help you avoid asthma attacks and upper respiratory infections, and act as windbreakers, helping to shield your face from cold weather blasts.

, After waiting for your initial grow-out period, when you've got the beard to its desired length, it's important to start trimming and shaping it. Most men should trim their beards about once every two weeks or so, depending on your speed of growth, and the kind of beard you want to have.


If you hope to end up with a Gandalf-style wizard's beard, it's still good to shape and trim using a beard trimmer, or scissors, to keep things growing evenly.
If you want a very short beard, and have especially coarse hair, you might find you need to trim it more regularly, like every two or three days.
Always keep your neck trim, up to your chin-line, or at whatever point along the neck looks best to you. If you don't trim the neck hair, beards typically look pretty cave-man-like., While it's possible to trim longer beards neatly with a pair of hair-cutting scissors, it's very difficult to keep a beard orderly without an electric trimmer, or at least regular hair clippers. The only difference is typically the size of the guards and of the clipper itself.









Use a regular beard trimmer for shorter beards or the first few months of beard growth, and try a more hefty hair trimmer for thicker beards.
A common mistake is learning to use a trimmer for the first time and shaving off too much. If you have some stubble, practice with the trimmer before you shave, to get a feel for how it works, and which guards are most appropriate for you.

, There are many ways to style and shape your beard, but a lot of the choice will depend on your face, and your personal sense of style. If it looks good to you, go for it. But in general, if you have full cheeks, plan on keeping it shorter on the sides. If you have a narrow face, you can keep some length to fill it out.


Decide on a cheek line. You will need to choose how high the beard should go on your cheeks. Most people leave this section to natural growth, but if it seems to be creeping up to your cheek bones, you should trim the upper section.

, On most trimmers, you can use a tapered setting, which will allow you to trim the beard in even strokes, tapering it down to your neck as you go, without having to change the height of the trimmer itself. You can taper the cheeks, the neck and the chin, if you desire, for a nice, clean look.








, If you want to go with a more complicated beard style, there are lots of options available for you to style. Try any of the following beard styles:


Goatees involve trimming off the cheeks, leaving your chin beard and your mustache.
Pencil-line beard involve leaving only a thin line of beard along your jawline, connecting to your mustache. This typically looks best with extremely short hair, or a bald look.
Pharaoh beards typically involve shaving everything but the chin, and growing out the chin, sometimes braiding or beading the beard as it grows.
Wizard beards, or Civil War type throwback beards will take some time to cultivate, but essentially involve growing the beard out as long as possible, but still trimming the neck periodically, as well as the mustache, so it gets out of the way of your lip., It's important to trim your beard when it's clean, to make sure the hairs are softened and untangled for an even trim. Wash your beard in the shower with warm water and soap.


You can use a hair shampoo or a special beard shampoo, depending upon how your skin reacts, but it's normal for most guys to just use the same soap they use on their faces in the shower.
People with longer beards may prefer a special shampoo, such as Bluebeard's brand. It leaves less residue than facial washes and some shampoos.

, Most trimmers will come with beard combs, but you can also use the same variety of brush or comb you might use on your hair, and comb your beard downward, with the grain, to make sure it lays nice and flat against your face. This is also a good way of seeing whether or not it needs a trim.









Sometimes beards are called ""flavor savers"" for a reason. It is possible to get food, lint, and other junk stuck in your beard, if it grows especially long. Comb it regularly to keep it from becoming a bird's nest.

, If you have sensitive skin, try several moisturizers before you start growing your beard, and continue moisturizing your beard follicles and your face after you grow a beard, to keep your skin healthy underneath. A healthy beard needs a healthy base from which to grow.


Lubriderm and other lotion brands are perfectly fine for using on your face and making sure your skin doesn't dry out.

, While they're not super-commonly used among men with beards, there are a variety of beard oils on the market, which can be combed into clean beards to keep them looking shiny, moisturized, and clean. It can be a desirable look, and it may give relief to men with sensitive skin who suffer from itchiness.









Take a small dab of oil on a comb and lubricate the comb with the oil before combining your beard naturally. This is the best way to distribute the oil evenly throughout the hair.
Coconut oil is excellent for the hair and makes for a perfectly natural substitute.

If you want to avoid some initial awkwardness, consider growing out all your facial hair first, and then trimming the rest of the beard off when the mustache is ready, or progressively trimming everything except your mustache to make the transition less abrupt.



Trim and maintain your beard while you nurture your soon-to-be mustache.;
, Any time you're sculpting facial hair, it's a good idea to invest in a beard trimmer to make the job easier. It's easier to shape your mustache accurately with an electric trimmer than with a basic razor you'd use to take all the hair off completely.


Usually, you can get a decent rechargeable beard trimmer for $15-20, available at most retail stores. They'll come with a variety of guard shapes and sizing options, making it easy to keep your mustache in shape.

, Most basic mustaches extend just about down to the sides of the mouth, leaving the hair atop the lip untouched. All it takes to shape a basic mustache is shaving off any facial hair you don't want. This usually means everything on your cheeks, under and along your jaw, and around your mouth, except your top lip.


After trimming the basic shape you want, leave your mustache alone. Shave or continue trimming the other areas of your facial hair growth regularly to keep your mustache standing out above the rest of the hair in your beard.
It's sometimes common for some kinds of hair, to let some of the beard grow back and have a mustache that's a little longer than the rest. It's half-beard, half-mustache. Best of both worlds.

, Though your facial hair may grow quite quickly, it may take several weeks to over a month to grow in fully, depending on the type of mustache you want to sport, and the speed that your beard comes in. It can take a while, so try not to rush it.


Contrary to popular belief, trimming your beard regularly does not cause it to ""grow back thicker."" It's not always bad advice though: This is often a way to convince guys with bad-looking facial hair to shave off that peach fuzz and wait until it starts coming in a little thicker.
You can use some basic good-health techniques to promote facial hair growth to speed up the process. Maintaining a diet high in protein, saturated fat, and Vitamins A, E, and C, getting enough exercise and rest, and–above all–keeping your face clean and well-groomed, can help promote facial hair growth in men.

, Not all styles of mustache should be used for all types of faces and hair. Pay attention to the way that your facial hair grows, and where it's the most thick. No point in trying a fu-machu if your hair doesn't stay thick all the way down the side of your mouth.


To see how a mustache might look, try editing a picture of you in photoshop, adding a fake mustache. You can also ask friends and family how they think you would look. If you can do neither, simply look in the mirror and imagine yourself with the mustache of your choice.

, Shorter mustache styles are best for men with very coarse, thick, and dark hair. Since the style and the hair will be short, these styles will show up better the thicker and coarser the hair. Try out the following short mustache styles:



The pencil: Famously sprouted by John Waters, R Kelly, and innumerable silent film villains, a pencil mustache looks as if it were drawn thinly on top of the lip with a make-up pencil. To trim one, follow your upper lip line with a trimmer, carefully removing the hair between your nose and your lip, until a thin line is left. The mustache should end at the corner of your upper lip, or just beyond.

The fu manchu: This classic features a slim pencil-like mustache that starts at the upper lip, but continues down the sides of your face until reaching the bottom of your jaw, and sometimes beyond. Grown slightly bushier and wider, this same basic mustache shape is known as the ""handlebar"" or the ""horseshoe.""

The boxcar: A boxcar is a fairly simple mustache, but one that ends just a bit before you reach the corner of your lip. To trim it, leave your mustache alone, but trim a straight line perpendicular to the corner of your lip, so the hair ends just before it. It should look like a perfect rectangle. Don't go to short or you'll end up with a Hitler 'stache.

, If you want to try out a bushier, burlier mustache, it usually works best with generally straight hair that's still somewhat coarse. Especially thin hair will grow long, but won't ""bush up,"" and might just end up hanging over your lip like walrus tusks (which feels annoying). If you've got the right kind of hair for it, consider the following longer mustaches:



The English or Imperial: An English-style mustache is your ticket to looking like you stepped out of a Victorian novel. To style this mustache, you need to stop trimming your mustache just above the corner of your mouth and let it grow out some, to a point. Then, using mustache wax, twirl the longer hairs at the corner up, into a curl.

The Walrus: A walrus is a mustache for outdoorsmen, rhinoceros hunters, and men who know how to throw tomahawks. Think Teddy Roosevelt. To grow a walrus, do absolutely nothing but shave your cheeks, leaving your mustache alone. No trimming until it drives you absolutely nuts (which might not take long). Not for beginners.

The Selleck: Named for the famous TV personality Tom Selleck, this mustache is also known in some quarters as the ""pornstar."" Shaped essentially like a walrus, pointing down at the corners, gently, the Selleck is full from lip to nose, but trimmed to avoid hanging over your lip.

, While it might be cool to slap silly names on mustache styles, the truth of the matter is that growing a mustache is largely about getting creative in the mirror with your beard trimmer. If it looks good to you, it's not wrong. Try combinations of the following the next time you shave to see what works. You can always shave it off.


Goatees are basically fu manchus or handlebar mustaches that connect on the chin. Just shave your cheeks and under your neck.
Mutton chops connected directly to the mustache give you a vaudevillian or Civil War vibe, like you just waltzed out of a photograph, or Brooklyn.
Try a straight mustache, with some deep-set five o'clock shadow and a soul patch if you want to look like an out of work actor.

, Although some mustache devotees argue about the merits of trimmingyour mustache may be in need of grooming every so often. Certain mustaches will require more work than others. But a combination of washing, waxing, combing, trimming, or shaving will most probably be part of your regiment every day if you want your fully grown mustache to live a full, well-worn life.


Depending on your mustache, trim it with mustache scissors every day to once a week. After a month of trimming the mustache weekly, you should have a pretty good idea of how much facial hair to chop off each time you trim.

, Try to wash your face with natural foaming cleanser each morning and before you go to bed. This will keep it clean and prime it for brushing and waxing.


Having facial hair of any sort can keep your natural body oils and dirt trapped against your skin, which can lead to breakouts in some men. It's important to keep your facial hair clean and well-groomed to keep your skin healthy.

, Some styles of mustache involve a bit of training and a lot of wax, while others can be kept in place with a comb. If you're building a bountiful handlebar or a polished pencil, you'll probably need to comb, twist, trim, and even shave every day to keep your particular style looking good.


After you wash your face or get out of the shower, apply a bit of mustache wax to the middle of your mustache with a finger. Next, lightly work the wax outwards, covering your entire mustache. Then use a comb to get the 'stache fully saturated.
To comb a mustache, use a beard comb, which should be smaller and with finer teeth. Add a small dab of natural beard oil to wet the tiny teeth of the comb, which will help lubricate the hairs and train them into place.
Start combing at your philtrum (the cleft under your nose), combing outward toward the corner of your lip, and down.

This is subjective due to the simple fact that all men’s hair grows at different paces. However, a few months of growth should give enough thickness to the hair that it will be able to keep your face and neck insulated during harsh winter temperatures.;
, This step takes patience, as there may be an itchy phase as your beard hairs grow out longer and your skin gets dry.This usually occurs during the first week or two of growing.


There is no proven way to make facial hair grow faster. Do not believe the myth that shaving more often makes a beard grow in quicker and thicker.A beard sometimes doesn’t always fill in the way you want it to. Genetics decide the beard so if your dad can’t grow one, you’ll probably have trouble as well.

, Leave extra space below the jaw, giving a nice ending to the beard that’s pleasing to the eye every way you turn your head.


A common mistake new “beardsmen” make is trimming too high up on their jaw. It makes some men appear to have “double chins” because the beard doesn’t cover below the jaw line.
This will give the beard a more natural look as opposed to sharp-edged.

, Drop some beard wash in your hands and rub them together. Slowly rub the beard and make sure all hairs have been covered. Rinse the beard out with warm water. Dry the beard by patting it with a towel.


The best place to wash your beard is in the shower, although it can also be done at the bathroom sink.
Do not use shampoo. The hairs on your head are different from the hairs on your face. The chemicals in regular shampoos can damage these hairs and ruin the “body” of the beard. Use beard wash instead.
Be gentle with the towel otherwise hairs may be pulled out.

, After the beard is dried off, rub the jojoba oil in your hands and apply slowly to the beard, running your hands through each strand of hair.


All-natural jojoba oil is useful for giving the beard some handling while styling it after it’s washed.
This will also add some playfulness to the beard.

, Grab your fine-tooth comb, and comb your facial hair down and out. Make sure to go slow so no hairs get pulled out. You can form the shape of your beard after you have combed it.

, While the beard is completely dry, slowly pull outward with the comb so all hairs are loose. Pull downward once on all sides of the beard, allowing for the natural shape of the beard. This will expose all the extra scraggly hairs that do not fit into the beard. Take the scissors and slowly chop away at each individual hair until it corresponds with the shape of the beard.


After the few months of initial growth, trims should occur about once a month to maintain a clean look.

, Walking in the winter weather should be a bit easier with a beard covering your face. Growing and maintaining a beard should be something to be proud of, and a clean appearance at work will surely make your employer happy as well. Just be sure to routinely wash and trim your beard.

Avoid the urge to shape your beard too soon.,
Choose a beard style.,
Trim your beard.,
Shampoo and condition regularly.,
Use a protective oil.,
If all else fails, wait a couple of years.",How to Grow a Thicker Beard1," You should avoid going near your newly-grown beard with a scissors or beard trimmers until it's been growing for a minimum of four weeks. Individual hairs grow at a different rate, so some sections of your facial hair may take longer to grow than others. Have patience and wait to see how much you can grow before shaping and trimming. The more hair you have, the easier it is to work with.;
, Once you have allowed nature to run wild and have been growing your beard for 4 to 6 weeks, you can start thinking about what style of beard you wish to adopt. You could leave it as it is - wild, rugged and undeniably masculine. Or you could go for something a little more polished, like a goatee and mustache combo or a refined chin strip or soul patch. Then you have the less common, but nonetheless manly, muttonchops and chin curtains. The choice is yours.

, Once you have decided on a style, you can undertake the delicate process of trimming your beard. If this is your first time, you may want to consider going to a barber to have it done professionally, though finding a barber with any significant experience in handling beards is becoming harder and harder nowadays.


If trimming your beard yourself, use a good trimmer to define your neckline, before shaping the rest of the beard. It is usually best to leave the cheek line natural, to avoid a weirdly shaped beard., Your beard will need some regular love and attention to keep it in tip-top condition. Try shampooing it daily (or almost daily) with a gentle shampoo to keep the hair clean and remove any lost pieces of food (it will happen), and use a little conditioner from time to time to help strengthen the hair and keep it looking full and thick.

, If you're exposing your beard to any harsh elements or chemicals - for example, while skiing or swimming in a chlorine-filled pool - you should apply a light layer of oil, such as jojoba or grape seed oil, which will protect your beard by locking in moisture and preventing the loss of natural oils., If your beard doesn't work out as well as you expected and you decide to let it go, don't lose hope. You can try again in a few years, as the development of facial hair continues to increase over time. This is why you usually see the fullest beards on older men.

Eat foods that might help your hair grow quickly.",How to Grow a Handlebar Mustache," First, choose a wax for your hair. There are many kinds of mustache wax available. If your mustache hair is thick and wiry you should buy a stiff wax. Inversely, if your mustache hair is thin, you can buy a softer wax.You will also need a fine-tooth comb to help you brush out your mustache and a small pair of hair-trimming scissors. These can be found at most beauty supply stores.


When in doubt, buy two containers of wax, one with a medium stiffness and one with a strong stiffness.
Experiment with comb types. Some people prefer fine tooth combs, others use unconventional combs such as head lice combs.;
, Most handlebar mustaches use hair from the entire upper lip. If you’re just starting out it’s best to play it safe. Don’t shave any part of your face that may help your mustache look fuller. This can include the areas next to the corners of your mouth.It may take up to three months for your mustache to become thick and glorious. Don’t give up!
Don’t trim your mustache, even the parts right above your lip.

, Once your mustache is long enough to comb, start training your hairs to keep the shape you like. Part your mustache down the middle of your lip and gently comb each half away from your nose. Add a small amount of mustache wax or hair putty before combing to help your hairs stay in place.


If you use a tub of wax, warm a small amount between your fingers before applying it. Evenly coat all of your hairs by combing the wax through your mustache.
If you use a stick of wax, apply it directly to your mustache before combing.

, It takes time to grow a decent handlebar mustache. While you wait, start shaping the new hair by twisting the ends. Your mustache won’t be long enough to get a good curl but you’ll be able to get an idea of how it might look. In this stage you can start trimming the sides to create different shapes.


Never trim the hairs directly above your lip. If they stay short, you won’t be able to brush them into your mustache.
Give uncooperative hairs time to grow out. Once they’re longer they’ll be easier to manipulate.

, Once the tips of your mustache have gotten long enough to curl you can start planning the way you want it to eventually look. Consider how long you want your moustache to grow. If you want a large curl or a bigger mustache you need to let the hairs grow. If you like the look of a smaller mustache you can begin trimming the ends when they get too long.Never trim the bottom of the mustache near the lip. These hairs need to be long so that they can be combed away from your mouth.
Handlebar mustaches look good on both clean-shaven and bearded faces. They pair well with well-groomed, classic barbershop hairstyles or bald heads.

, This helps train your mustache into the shape you like. Once you’ve had your mustache for a few months, you can skip this step. After you shower towel dry your mustache. Use a comb to part your mustache down the middle of your lip. Mold your damp mustache into the shape you like by curling the ends around your fingers. Next, carefully dry the curled edges to set the curls.


Keep the hair wrapped around your finger as you dry it. This will help control the curl and let you know if the air is too hot.
Use a low setting on your blow dryer. If the air is too hot it can damage your mustache.

, If your wax comes in a stick, apply the wax directly to your mustache and brush through it with a fine-tooth comb. If the wax comes in a tub, warm a small amount of wax between your fingers before applying. Carefully spread the warmed wax into your mustache. Make sure that all of the hairs are evenly coated and comb the mustache into place.The wax should be almost invisible against your hair. If it isn’t, you may need to buy tinted wax.
If you add too much wax simply brush some of it out with the comb.

, After combing, re-shape the curls of your mustache by twisting the edges around your fingers into a curl you like. Once the wax dries your mustache will keep its form. If your mustache is still having trouble keeping its curl, heat a curling iron to medium heat and wrap the hair around it for ten to fifteen seconds. Make sure not to burn your face.Some people prefer large, looping curls, while others like to wax their mustache ends into straight lines. Experiment to find what works for you.
Some people use a stronger wax on the curled tips of their mustache to help them keep their shape.

, Check your mustache for flakes of dead skin or waxy residue. Brush your mustache with a stiff, dry toothbrush to remove the debris and exfoliate your skin. Next, wash your mustache with shampoo. This will remove the wax and skin oils from your mustache.


Some people choose to wash their mustache in the mornings. If you sleep with wax in your mustache, it may leave a colorful residue on your pillowcase.
If shampoo isn’t powerful enough to remove the wax from your mustache use dish soap instead.

, Your mustache can pick up all sorts of things throughout the day. Right before you have a meal, spread a small amount of mustache wax on the bottom strands of hair. This will help them stay clear of your mouth and insulate them from liquids.


When eating crumbly foods, wipe your mouth often to keep your mustache free of crumbs.
Avoid eating soups and other messy food in public until you get the hang of eating with a large mustache.

, Some foods contain the same nutrients found in hair. Many experts believe that if you eat these foods your body will be able to grow your hair and fingernails more quickly.Foods such as salmon, yellow peppers, avocados, and egg yolks are thought to speed hair growth.


If your mustache hair is growing quickly then the hair on your scalp will grow quickly as well.
It can take one or two months to see results.

Eat well.,
Take a vitamin supplement.,
Exercise.,
Get plenty of rest and relaxation.,
Stay hydrated.",How to Grow a Thicker Beard2," Taking care of your body by eating well can favorably influence beard growth. As hair is mainly made up of protein, your beard will benefit from protein-rich foods, such as oily fish, lean beef and chicken. You should also try to increase your intake of healthy, saturated fats, such as those from nuts, fish and eggs. These will promote increased levels of testosterone, which is essential for thick, healthy beards.


Green leafy vegetables, such as spinach and kale, are also a good addition to your diet, as they will help your body to metabolize estrogen (the female hormone), leaving a higher level o testosterone in your system.You should avoid high-sugar junk foods, as these provide no nutritional content and will contribute to weak, brittle hair.

, Vitamin supplements can be a great way to optimize hair health and stimulate beard growth. Perhaps the best supplement for maximizing hair growth is biotin, a dietary supplement found in pharmacies and health food stores. Dermatologists recommend taking 2.5 mg of biotin every day, for best results.Other vitamin supplements which have been said to improve beard growth include vitamin B1, B6 and B12, along with beta-carotene, flax seed oil and nettle oil.
There is also a multivitamin called VitaBeard which is specifically designed to promote healthy facial hair, allowing beards to grow faster and stronger. It also helps to minimize itching, as it regulates skin's oil production. VitaBeard is available to buy online at beardvitamin.com.

, Regular, moderate to intense exercise can contribute to a thick, healthy beard as it helps to stimulate testosterone production and improves circulation. Good circulation is important as it carries the required vitamins and nutrients to the skin and hair through the bloodstream. Try to combine both cardiovascular and muscle-building exercises in your workout routine, for best results., Sleep is important as it allows cells to repair and regenerate - which is essential for healthy hair growth. Your overall health and well-being depends on getting enough sleep, so you should try your best to get 7-8 hours of good quality sleep each night. You should also try to minimize your stress levels as much as possible, as high stress levels have been linked with hair loss.

, Your beard is not like a plant - drinking more water is not going to make it grow faster. However, keeping yourself hydrated is essential for optimum body function, which will improve your overall health. Water flushes out toxins from the body and keeps skin hydrated from within - and neither of these things can hurt your chances of a healthy beard.

Choose a bearded role model.,
Ignore the myth that shaving your beard will make it grow back thicker.,
Grow for 4-6 weeks.,
Learn to deal with the itchiness.,
Wash your beard with anti-dandruff shampoo.,
Realize that the rate of growth and thickness of your beard will depend largely on genetics.",How to Grow a Thicker Beard3," Growing a beard is a commitment. It will take time and dedication. There may be days when you feel like giving in and picking up the razor again. For times like these, you may find it helpful to keep an image of a bearded role model in mind. Think of a man with a gloriously full, thick beard who's image will provide you with inspiration and motivation when you need it most. Get a picture of this man and hang it in your bathroom. He'll provide you with the strength you need to persevere and achieve the manly beard you've always dreamed of.


Some good examples of fabulously full-bearded men include: musicians like John Lennon and Jim Morrison, philosophers like Karl Marx and Sigmund Freud, former American presidents Abraham Lincoln and Ulysses S. Grant and mythical Gods such as Zeus and Poseidon.

, You've probably heard the advice that shaving your beard will cause it to grow back twice as thick as before, but there is no real truth to this theory. After shaving your beard, your hair will experience a slight initial growth spurt, but will quickly return to a growth rate that's even slower than it was before, therefore rendering the growth benefits of shaving negligible.


In addition, your beard may appear to be thicker when it starts growing again, but this is only because the hair nearest the root is darker and coarser than the ends. Once the length of the hairs increase, you will no longer notice a difference.As a result, your best bet is just to leave your facial hair be. Lock your razor into a drawer and let nature take its course.

, It will typically take between 4 to 6 weeks for you to grow your facial hair into a proper beard. It will be hardest in the beginning, when your facial hair may be patchy and uneven and you'll have to deal with smirks and snarky comments from friends and family who don't understand your quest for bearded glory.


For this reason, it may be best to start growing your beard while on vacation or a break from work. This will give you a running start at growing your beard, away from the critical eyes of others.

, The major hurdle where most aspiring beard-owners fall is dealing with itchiness. Itchy, irritated skin can be a major problem while your beard is growing in, but don't let it get the best of you - fight back! Wash your face daily with a mild cleanser to keep skin clean. Use a soothing moisturizer to hydrate dry, flaky skin and reduce redness.


If the itching is really getting on your nerves, get your hands on a 1% hydrocortisone cream which should significantly relieve the need to scratch.
Remember that the itchiness is temporary - it will go away as soon as your beard reaches a certain length - so be strong!

, Washing your beard a couple of times a week with an anti-dandruff shampoo can also help to relieve itchiness and get rid of any dry flaking skin, which can make your beard unsightly. If you like, you can also use a small amount of conditioner to keep your new beard feeling soft and healthy., Unfortunately, there is no magical serum that will allow you to grow a wonderfully thick, full beard. The type of beard you will be able to grow will depend largely on genetics (thanks Dad!) and the natural levels of testosterone that your body produces. As a result, you will need to work with the facial hair you've been given, doing whatever you can to maximize its health and encourage growth."

A fine-toothed comb can be helpful when grooming a mustache.;
, The conditioner softens the hair, making it easier to trim. Allow the hair to fully dry before you begin trimming. Never trim a wet beard or mustache.









Wet hair appears longer, so once it dries you may find you’ve trimmed too much off., Boar bristle brushes will help distribute natural oils properly. Then use the brush against the grain of your beard to make the hairs stand up. This makes trimming easier and allows you to easily spot inconsistencies in length.









If you have a particularly coarse beard, conditioning may not soften the hairs enough for trimming. Apply beard oil if you need to soften it further.
After applying beard oil, always comb through with a beard brush to properly distribute the oil.

, Start off with a bigger guard, especially if you aren’t familiar with your trimmer yet. This will keep you from accidentally trimming it too short. Start near your ear on one side and work your way down to the chin. Then repeat on the other side, checking frequently to make sure both sides are balanced.









Your trimmer should come with instructions and a trimming guide, so refer to these for details about your specific model and its guards.
After using the trimmer, look for any stray hairs that you missed and take care of them with your scissors.

, The hairs that fall down over your lip are the ones you need to trim off. Begin in the middle of your mustache and trim your way to one side of your mouth, then the other. You can use a trimmer or scissors for your mustache, but unless you have a very steady hand, opt for scissors.Scissors offer more control because they can only trim few hairs at a time.
Check to make sure both sides of your mustache are evenly trimmed and look balanced.

, The lines on your cheeks and the neck line will probably need daily maintenance. You can use a beard trimmer with the guide removed to keep the lines well-defined, but be very careful if you do. Most people just use a regular razor for this part.

, Once you have the headband on, you won't be able to part your hair. It won't be a good idea to part your hair after you get the waves in. Doing so might disrupt the wave pattern.

, The headband should be no more than an inch (2.54 centimeters) thick. If you have one of those really wide headbands, then try folding it over inward. You can also make your own by wrapping a piece of elastic around your head and knotting it.

, The section should be no more than a few fingers wide.








, Pull the section up, over, and under the headband. Gently slide it back towards your face to make room for more sections.








, You will be adding hair to the section after each time you wrap it around the headband.








, Be sure to tuck it under the headband. Also, try to keep the hair fairly loose as you wrap it. If you wrap the hair too tightly, it will end up being curly instead of wavy.








, Keep gathering and wrapping sections of hair around the headband until you reach the back of your head. Repeat the gathering and wrapping process for the other side of your head, and stop when you reach the back of your head. You will likely have a long tail left over. That is okay. You will tuck it in during the next step.








, Reach around to the back of your head and find the extra hair strands that you didn't tuck in. Twirl them into a rope. If you have enough room in your headband, you can try wrapping that rope around the headband.

You should also tuck or pin any flyaway strands or loose strands the managed to escape the wrapping process.

, If the headband is tight, it may leave an imprint on your forehead the next day. To prevent this from happening, simply slide the headband up on your forehead until it reaches your hairline.








, Start by pulling out any bobby pins. Gently slide the headband up and out of your hair. If it does not come off easily, you may have to unwind the strands of hair from around it. Do not pull too hard, however; if you do, you may end up stretching the waves out. Once you have the headband and bobby pins out, you can comb your fingers through your hair to soften the waves.









If your hair doesn't hold styles too well, consider setting your waves with some hairspray or styling cream.

If you have very long hair, you'll want a bigger sock, so choose a men's sock if you can locate one. Then simply snip off the toe using a pair of scissors. You now have a tube of cloth that's open at both ends., Start by folding the end over, then fold it over again. After a few folds you should be able to roll the sock to form a tight donut shape. This is all you need for beautiful beachy waves in the morning.


If you're having trouble rolling the sock, try fitting it over a banana or another long object. Starting at the top, roll the sock down until it forms a donut shape, then slip it off the banana.

, Flip your head upside down and use a comb to help gather your hair at the very top of your head. The higher, the better, since you'll be sleeping with the bun and it'll be more comfortable at the top of your head than in the back. Use a ponytail holder to secure the ponytail in place.

, Your hair needs to be damp, but not sopping wet, in order for this technique to work. Soaking wet hair won't fully dry during the night, so just spritz your hair with water slightly dampen it. If you just took a shower, wait until your hair is 80 percent dry before you put it up.It's handy to keep some water in an old spray bottle so you can evenly spritz your hair to dampen it.
If you don't have a spray bottle, use your fingers to flick some water onto your hair, then use a comb to distribute it evenly.

, Pull your ponytail through the hole in the ""donut"" and slide it down a few inches. Make sure no strands of hair are left out; everything should be pulled through the center of the sock.

, You're going to roll the sock down your ponytail in order to create a bun, so start by tucking the ends of your ponytail all around the sock. The entire sock should now be covered by the end of your ponytail.

, Using both hands, roll the sock, and your hair with it, slowly toward your head. Keep going until your entire ponytail is rolled up in the sock, and the sock is resting against your head at the base of your ponytail. You now have a pretty sock bun. You could wear it out of the house if you felt like stopping here!


If your hair feels dry at this point, give the bun an extra spritz. Remember not to get it too wet, though, or it won't dry during the night.

, Go to bed as normal, keeping the bun intact all night long. If you positioned it right at the top of your head, it shouldn't be too uncomfortable. If it feels too tight, try loosening the area at the base of the bun, rather than taking the whole thing out.

, Unroll your hair and the sock, then set the sock aside. Take out your ponytail holder, too. Let your wavy hair cascade down your back and around your shoulders. Your look is complete!

It will make a big difference in how well your waves hold.;
, By carefully pressing out the water, you’ll avoid the frizz created from a normal towel. Scrubbing or wrapping your hair with a towel can rough up the hair shaft and give you a head full of frizz.








Wet hair is fragile hair, so be extra gentle whenever you’re working it.
If you can’t squeeze out all the water with your hands, invest in a microfiber towel or use a smooth cotton shirt to dry your hair. You can use these to press out the excess water while avoiding the rough texture of a normal towel., Use a wide-tooth comb, or just your fingers, to brush your hair out gently.Once it’s combed to your satisfaction, grab a sea salt spray to add some texture to your damp hair.

You can also skip the product completely, if you choose. Braiding wet hair can create gorgeous waves without any sort of spray or mousse, just experiment with your hair to see what works best!

, Because your hair is naturally more dry, washing it regularly can strip it off it's precious natural oils.Additionally, getting afro-textured hair wet will make it form tighter curls than you want to create. Instead, you'll want to create your braids using a moisturizer or oil on dry hair., The amount of sections depends on how thick your hair is, and how loose you want your waves. The more hair in a section, the looser your waves will be. If you have very thin hair, you may only need to one or two sections. If you have very thick hair, you might want to separate it into more sections.









Clip the hair you are not currently braiding out of the way.

, Tight braids will create more of a crimped look, so braid loosely to create soft waves.Remember, wherever the braids start, the waves will start.

If you’d like volume and waves at the top, start the braid near the root.









Traditional three strand braids work perfectly fine. However, you can experiment with french braids and fishtail braids to see all the different kinds of waves you can create.

, You can use any kind of moisturizing, leave-in hair product that you like. Products containing olive oil, coconut oil, shea butter, and glycerin are all good choices.

, Try to braid each strand to the very end in order to avoid having pin straight tips when you awaken.Additionally, tying the end of the braid too tightly can create an unsightly indentation in the hair. Secure the elastic firmly enough so that it holds the braid if you toss and turn during the night, but not so tightly that it crushes the strands.









Using cloth elastics rather than rubber elastics can help avoid the indent, and also prevent from potential damage.Go to sleep! Your braids will dry overnight.

, If you have very thick hair, used big sections of hair, or braided your hair when it was really wet, the braids may be a bit damp when you wake up. If necessary, run a hairdryer over your hair until the excess moisture is gone.

, After you’ve removed all of the hair ties and undone all of the braids, run your fingers through your hair. This will help smooth out the waves and blend the sections back together. Don’t brush your hair! This will just create frizz, and will ruin the waves created by the braids.







, Aside from brushing, you can style your hair as you normally would. Wear your loose waves down, throw them in a ponytail, or tie them half up, half down. Your waves will add volume to any hairstyle. Once you're satisfied with your hairstyle, spritz your tresses with a hairspray. This will help your waves last throughout the day.

, You can actually use a flat iron to lightly curl your hair into beachy waves. Start at the top of a one-inch strand and work the straightener down to the end. While you are pulling the straightener down, twist the straightener around the hair (not the hair around the straightener)., Take a large, two-inch section of hair. Clamp the curling iron at the bottom of the section and roll it up to the root. Leave it in place for 10 seconds then release. The smaller the section and the longer you leave in the curling iron, the tighter the curls will be. If you are trying to achieve surfer waves, use large sections of hair and only leave the iron in for 10 seconds or less., Take a curling wand and wrap it around a one-inch section of hair. Make sure the wand is pointed down toward the floor. The larger the wand, the longer you leave the hair around it, and the size of the section of hair, will determine how tight the curls are.Curling wands work great for long or short hair.

Always apply a heat-protecting mousse, spray, or product to your hair any time you're going to use a heat tool like a blow dryer or flat iron.
To gain more volume with your short hair, hang your head upside down and let your hair fall toward the ground as you blow dry it.

, Flat irons, or hair straighteners, are actually excellent tools for creating waves in short hair, but it’s important to choose the right one, otherwise you risk damaging your hair.Pick an iron that has a fully ceramic or titanium plate, as these will create the most even heat.
Make sure your iron also has a temperature gage, otherwise you risk burning and damaging your hair on the high setting (and the low settings are usually too cool to be effective).
Look for a flat iron that also has beveled or curved edges rather than squared edges. The rounded edges will help create a smoother curl.
You can also use a curling wand to give your hair waves, and the process will be quite similar.

, Set your iron to 300 F (149 C) and allow it to heat up to that temperature. Never set your iron above 400 F (204 C)., It will be easier to work with your hair if you divide it into a top, middle, and bottom section. If your hair is too short to clip or tie back, use a few bobby pins to keep it in place.


To begin, comb through your hair with a wide-toothed come. Tie back the top two thirds of your hair and begin working with the bottom section.
If any hair is too short to curl with the iron (less than an inch (2.5 cm) long), simply tease it to give it volume and move on to a section that has hair long enough to work with., Beginning with the bottom section, divide your hair into one-inch (2.5 cm) strips to achieve curls in short hair. Using strips that are too large may result in waves that are undefined.
/images/thumb/d/dd/Get-Waves-in-Short-Hair-Step-2-Version-4.jpg/v4-550px-Get-Waves-in-Short-Hair-Step-2-Version-4.jpg
/images/thumb/d/dd/Get-Waves-in-Short-Hair-Step-2-Version-4.jpg/v4-300px-Get-Waves-in-Short-Hair-Step-2-Version-4.jpg









Start with the one-inch strip of hair that frames your face. Hold the flat iron vertically and grab your hair with it close to the scalp.
Twist the flat iron 180 degrees toward the back of your head, and then gently pull the flat iron down the shaft of your hair, keeping the plates closed the whole time.It may seem counter-intuitive to use a flat iron to create a curl, but it works similarly to when you use the blade of a scissor to curl a piece of ribbon.
When you reach the end of that strip, take a moment to see if you’ve achieved a basic curl. If not, repeat this with the same strip until you achieve a curl.
When you're satisfied with the curl, let it cool and move on to the next strip. Repeat the same process.

, If you're working with a curling wand instead of a flat iron, hold the wand vertically with the tip pointing toward the ground./images/thumb/d/d8/Get-Waves-in-Short-Hair-Step-3-Version-3.jpg/v4-550px-Get-Waves-in-Short-Hair-Step-3-Version-3.jpg
/images/thumb/d/d8/Get-Waves-in-Short-Hair-Step-3-Version-3.jpg/v4-300px-Get-Waves-in-Short-Hair-Step-3-Version-3.jpg









Starting about an inch from the scalp, wrap your hair around the wand as many times as you can. With short hair, you may only be able to wrap it around once or twice.
Hold the tip of the hair as you hold the hair on the wand for two to five seconds.Release the tip of your hair and pull the wand out. Let the curl cool and move on to the next strip of hair.

, Once you’ve curled the entire bottom section of your hair, let the section down and repeat the curling process. Allow the curls to cool completely as you curl the second and third sections.
/images/thumb/7/77/Get-Waves-in-Short-Hair-Step-4-Version-4.jpg/v4-550px-Get-Waves-in-Short-Hair-Step-4-Version-4.jpg

When you get to the top section, part your hair as you normally would before curling your hair.

, After you curl all the strips in every section and allowed them to cool and set, it’s time to finger comb through them all to loosen and separate the curls. This process will turn the tight curls into looser waves./images/thumb/d/d6/Get-Waves-in-Short-Hair-Step-5-Version-5.jpg/v4-550px-Get-Waves-in-Short-Hair-Step-5-Version-5.jpg
/images/thumb/d/d6/Get-Waves-in-Short-Hair-Step-5-Version-5.jpg/v4-300px-Get-Waves-in-Short-Hair-Step-5-Version-5.jpg









As you comb through the curls with your fingers, apply a styling product that will help keep the waves in place, such as wax or pomade. Use these products sparingly, especially when your hair is short. Too much product will just weigh down your hair.
You can also apply a texturizing product or hairspray near the root of the hair underneath the curls. This will give your short hair even more volume., If your hair is already clean, you don’t have to shampoo it. Instead, use a shower head or spray bottle of water to get your entire head damp. You don’t want it dripping wet, but you need it slightly damp so that it will hold some waves. With a soft, absorbent towel, dry your hair to remove any excess moisture, then let your hair air dry until it’s just a bit damp.

, There are three methods you can use to create waves in your hair without using heat: buns, braids, or twist braids. With all three methods, you will style your hair, wrap it with a scarf, and let it dry overnight so that the waves set. You can still do this with short hair, but your hair will have to be long enough to twist or braid a couple times.


Braids can give you the tightest waves, twist braids will give you looser curls, and buns will give you the loosest, most relaxed waves.

, Once you’ve selected your heatless wave style, you can go ahead and braid or twist your hair, or wrap it into a bun. Make sure your hair is still somewhat damp when you do this.


Braid your hair: For tight waves, braid your entire head with small or medium braids. For looser and more relaxed waves, divide your hair into four or six sections and braid each section into a large braid.
Make two twist braids: part your hair down the middle. On the left side, grab two medium sections of hair from the top front of your head. Twist them, and as you twist them again, incorporate a bit of extra hair into the front section. Twist again, and again incorporate more hair into the front section. Repeat until you have fully twisted all the hair on the left side and tie the twist at the end with an elastic. Repeat on the right side.Depending on how short your hair is, you may not be able to make more than a few twists.
Make two buns: part your hair in the middle. Gather all the hair on the left side of your head into a ponytail at the bottom left side of your head. Twist all the hair together and then wrap it around the ponytail to form a bun. Tie it off or secure it with bobby pins. Repeat on the right side. If your hair is too short for a bun in the back, make the bun on the side of your head.

, With a soft head wrap scarf, wrap all the hair up so that it doesn’t rub against the pillow and sheets while you sleep. The scarf will keep your hair from coming out of its style and prevent it from becoming frizzy.

When you’ve wrapped your hair, you can either tie the scarf to secure it or tie it with an elastic.

, As your hair dries in one of these styles, the waves created by the twists or weaves will set in your hair, giving your hair heatless waves.


You don’t have to do this overnight, but you will have to wait several hours for your hair to dry if you're doing this during the day.

, In the morning when your hair is fully dry, remove the scarf, untie any elastics, and let your hair down. Gently comb through it with your fingers to remove the weaves and twists. Continue combing with your fingers as you style your hair the way you like it.

, For softer waves, use hair cream or serum. Only apply it two-thirds of the way up your hair; leave the top of your head alone. Use enough to cover the ends, but not so much that your hair is greasy. Using gel or mousse will result in stiffer waves.

, If you want very structured, neat curls, use a comb to part your hair into sections. If you want a messy and more natural look, skip the comb parting and just grab differently-sized tresses. You'll pin between separating each section.

, Twirl your hair around your finger until it starts to twist into coils. Hold a finger down at the root to steady it, and twist hair into a small bun around that point. Secure with non-rubber elastics or curved bobby pins.

, Start with the hair over your forehead, moving to the sides, and then going back. For a more comfortable night's sleep, don't pin up the hair at the back and bottom of your head; if you're planning on wearing your hair loose, the upper parts will cover this lower section anyway.

, Let your hair stay pinned up overnight.

",How to Get Big Wavy Hair," In order to achieve maximum volume, you’ll want your hair to be as clean and un-oily as possible, so be sure to shampoo it well.In addition to shampooing your hair really well, only use conditioner on your ends. Putting it anywhere else will weigh down your hair, making it more difficult to add volume to it later.
If you have colored or otherwise damaged hair, avoid volumizing shampoos and conditioners as these can cause dryness and further damage. Instead, use a color-safe or moisturizing shampoo and conditioner, and then use a volumizing root spray afterward.
If you want to moisturize and volumize your hair, seek out more lightweight conditioners like royal jelly and linseed oil.;
, The wetter your hair is, the longer it will take to blow-dry, and the more damaged it could become from the dryer’s heat. It’s healthier for your hair if you can let it dry out a bit on its own before blow-drying it.Some experts recommend leaving your hair in a towel for 15 minutes before blow-drying it.While waiting for your hair to dry off a bit you can get dressed, do your makeup, eat a meal, etc.

, Apply a few spritzes of volumizing spray to your hair, focusing mainly on the roots. Be sure not to apply too much spray, otherwise it could cause you hair to look flat and oily instead of voluminous.


You can help protect your hair by purchasing a spray that also protects from heat. Many manufacturers make sprays that are both volumizing and heat-protecting, so just read the labels and choose one that does both.
If you have dry/damaged hair, choose a volumizing spray that also moisturizes the hair. Look for the words “moisturizing” or “protective” on the packaging.

, It’s okay (and common) to flip your head upside down and give your roots a little blast with the blow-dryer before sectioning off your hair. This can help give a bit of extra volume.


Just be sure that you don’t blow-dry your hair for too long in this way, otherwise it can become frizzy. You want most of your blow-drying to be done on small sections of hair, moving from your roots to your ends.

, How many sections you have will depend on how long and thick your hair is. The goal is to make it manageable, so just divide your hair into sections until you feel able to work with it.


Separate your hair into 3 or 4 main sections: a strip near the nape of your neck, a strip across the centre-back of your head, and a strip at the top of your head.
Next, separate those sections into at least 2 halves — one on each side of your part.

, Starting at the back of your head near the nape of your neck, unclip one section of hair and select a 2- to 4-inch-wide chunk of hair from that section. Wrap that smaller chunk of hair around the brush.


Once the hair is wrapped around it, pull the brush up slightly so that it gently pulls your hair against the direction in which it grows (i.e. up instead of down).
Round brushes come in different sizes. If your hair is quite long, you can use a medium to large brush. If your hair is somewhere around your shoulders, you’ll want to use a smaller-sized brush.Choose your brush size wisely. If the brush is too large, you won’t be able to wrap your hair around it multiple times, meaning you won’t be able to create wavy curls.

, Once your hair is in the round brush, lift the brush slightly upwards, in the opposite direction of hair growth.


Holding it this way as you blow-dry your hair will improve your hair’s volume by locking it in a position that is up and away from your scalp.

, Holding the dryer at least 6 inches away from your hair, move it down the section of hair from your roots to your ends, in one smooth motion. You will move the blow-dryer and the brush at the same time as you pull down through your hair with the brush.


Most blow-dryers come with diffuser attachments. Use this while blow-drying your hair to ensure a more even distribution of air.Experts recommend keeping the blow-dryer at least 6 inches, but up to 8 inches from your hair.Use a medium setting rather than the hottest setting on your blow-dryer. The hotter it is, the more damage it can cause to your hair., Move the blow-dryer down along the section of hair in one smooth motion, from roots to ends. When you reach the end of the strand, start again at the top of the section, repeating until it is almost (but not quite) dry.


Do not move the blow-dryer upwards along the section, towards your roots. Blow-drying your hair in any other direction than down along the hair strands (from the roots to the ends) will cause your hair to look frizzy.Blow-drying your hair along the strand, from roots to ends, keeps the cuticles closed and your hair looking soft, shiny, and silky.

, Once it feels almost dry, give your hair a final blast with the blow-dryer at medium heat while it’s still wrapped around the brush. Then let it sit for a few seconds until it cools down.


Allowing your hair to cool down in the brush will help it hold the round shape of the brush, meaning it’ll be curly, or at least wavy, when you take it out, and it will hold that shape longer.If your dryer has a cool air setting you can give your hair a blast with cool air to help it cool down more quickly.

, Use one hand to unroll the brush and the other one to hold the hair as you go. This will ensure that you don’t accidentally pull out the curl you’ve made with the brush and the blow-dryer.Image:Get Big Wavy Hair Step 11.jpg
, Once the section of hair is out of the brush, give it a gentle twirl with your fingers and let it drop to your shoulders. It should have a gentle, wavy curl in it. If you’re happy with how the curl looks, give it a spritz of hairspray to help it hold its shape.


Don’t go overboard with the hairspray, otherwise you’ll risk weighing down your hair with product and/or making your hair feel crunchy.

, Do the same thing with the round brush and blow-dryer for each section of your hair, working in 2- to 4-inch-wide sections. Start at the nape of your neck (back) and work your way section by section, upwards to the front of your head.

, Once you’re done, lightly spritz your hair all over with a texturizing spray or a hairspray. For extra volume you can bend at the hips and flip your head upside down, then spritz your hair a few times with a volumizing hairspray.


As you spray your hair, you can gently shake your head from side to side and/or move your hands in a gentle scrunching motion to help encourage even coverage and extra body.

, If you’d like your hair to have more wave, use a curling iron or flat iron where you see fit to spruce it up a bit. Curling irons are pretty straightforward, but creating loose curls with flat irons is a bit more tricky:Starting roughly an inch down from your roots, close the flat iron on a 2- to 3-inch section of hair. Holding the end of your hair, turn the iron in you hand so that it does one full forward rotation while still clasping your hair.
Next, pull the iron gently down the rest of your hair shaft while still holding on to the end of the section of hair that you’re working on. The slower you go, the more heat will touch your hair, and the more intense the wavy curl will be. Move faster for a looser-looking wave.
Let go of that section of hair, and you should find that it is wavy now. Note that this only works with thinner flat irons.
For both curling irons and flat irons, you can start midway down the section of hair for a more natural wavy look. Too avoid making a line at the starting point in your hair, move the iron as soon as you close it down on your strands.

, Make sure your hair isn’t completely dry, as having it a bit damp will help it hold its shape better. You might consider using a leave-in conditioner to help protect your hair and boost its ability to hold waves.


Note that wet hair is more fragile than dry hair, so you’ll need to be careful., There are countless options for adding waves or wavy curls to your hair without heat-styling tools. Here are some popular ones:


Braids: You can braid your hair in a multitude of ways to achieve different types of wavy looks. Tight french braids on each side of your head will give you voluminous, kinky waves all over your head. A long, classic braid will give you softer waves that start around the nape of your neck.

Headband curls: Start by placing a plain stretchy headband on top of your head like a crown, so that it sits low and cuts across your forehead. Starting at the front of your head, twist your hair into 1- to 2-inch sections, and wrap them around the headband moving towards the back of your head. Moving from the front of your head to the back, continue doing this with each section of hair until all of your hair is tucked into the headband. Leave your hair in the headband overnight for the best results.

Sock buns: Cut the end (the toes) off a sock (preferably one that matches your hair color) and then roll it up so that it looks like a donut. Put your hair into a high ponytail on top of your head, then pull the ends through the centre of the sock. Move your hair around the sock as you tuck in the ends, so that most or all of the sock is covered by your hair, then begin rolling the sock towards your roots using your hands to keep your hair moving along with the sock. Once it’s at the top of your head, fasten the bun with bobby pins. Leave the bun in for at least one day. When you take it out, your hair will be big, bouncy, and wavy.

, Using leave-in conditioner will help boost the hold of your heatless alternatives. You can also spray a texturized into your hair before whatever volumizing/wave-making method you choose.


You might prefer to limit your product use until you’ve seen how the process turns out on your natural hair. Leave-in conditioner alone might be enough, and then you can just put in a little hair oil to de-frizz or calm your curls into waves.

, If you don’t like surprises, the downside of heatless alternatives is that they sometimes produce unexpected results.


If you’re leaving something in overnight, give yourself extra time in the morning just in case you need to tame your curls or flatten your hair a bit.

If your hair is naturally very curly, before continuing. If you want loose waves, you'll need to start with either straight or slightly wavy hair.;
, The larger the barrel, the looser your waves will look. Heat it to the lowest setting required to hold curl in your hair - it's different for everyone. If your hair is on the coarse side, you should be able to use low to medium heat. For fine, straight hair, use medium or high heat.








, This will protect your hair from heat damage and also help your waves stay in place. Choose a spray or serum designed to protect your hair from heat. Avoid gel or mousse-combined with the direct heat, as they'll make your waves look too crunchy and less natural.








, Don't open the clamp of the curling iron, just wrap your hair around the whole thing. This will give you loose waves instead of tighter curls. Hold a section of hair and wrap it near the roots at the base of the barrel, working your way down to the tips. Hold it for about 5 seconds, then release. You should have a wavy, twisty section of hair. Repeat with every section.









Be careful to keep your fingertips away from the curling iron.
If you want more wave around the end of the section, grab it with the curling iron clamp and hold it for a few seconds.
If you have a lot of hair, clip up the top section and start with the back, then work your way forward.

, Don't use a comb or brush, since this will undo your waves. Use your fingers to carefully relax the curls into waves and tousles. Toss your hair and spray it lightly with a flexible hold finishing hair spray if needed.

These chemicals can damage hair and cause frizz.;
, “Rough-drying” means to blow dry your hair using your fingers to move your hair around, rather than a hair brush. Start by lifting your hair at the roots with your fingers. Hold your blow dryer several inches away from your scalp and aim it at the roots. Turn it on and work your fingers throughout your hair, lifting and drying the roots.Drying the roots first will help to add volume and body to fine hair.

, Use your hands and fingers to tousle your hair as you move the blow dryer around your head. Don’t worry about doing this evenly or perfectly – you want to achieve a rumpled, “undone” look. As it dries, you’ll notice that your hair is fuller than usual and has a lot of texture.


Volume and texture are the key components of this look.

, Once your hair is completely dry, wrap small sections of it around a ceramic curling wand or iron. Start at the middle of your hair, not at the roots, and stop about an inch from the ends. Hold the hair around the tool for several seconds, then release. After you finish each section, drop the curl and tug at the ends gently to loosen the wave.You can achieve an extra tousled look by twisting each section of hair before curling it.
If you have short hair, use a wand or iron that has a one-inch barrel.
For longer hair, use a wider barrel.

, Once you’ve completely finished adding waves with the wand, spray a volumizing texture product all over your head. This will help to set the waves, add necessary texture and give your fine locks a little more body.Do not spray the product on your hair and continue using the heating tool – this can damage your hair.

Use a headband.",How to Get Beach Hair1," Braids are one of the easiest and cheapest ways to make your hair look like you just left the beach. When you take the braids out, you should have natural waves.


First, wash your hair and towel or air dry it, but not completely. Use a thickening shampoo that is designed to help define curls and waves, not to straighten your hair. You want your hair to be a little damp as you style it. Separate your hair into 8 sections (smaller braids will create tighter waves). Then, braid each section. You could use French braiding instead as it is closer to your scalp, but either approach works. French braiding is preferable, though, because it will curl your roots and upper hair as well.
Leave your hair in braids for about 5-6 hours. It’s even better if you leave it in overnight. Remove the braids. Finger comb your hair because a brush or even a comb will mess up the waves and could make your hair look frizzy. Add a little hairspray if you want but not too much.
For best results, your hair should be completely dry when you take out the braids. If you take them out while your hair is still wet, the waves will fall out.This method works even if your hair hasn't been shampooed. If you just washed it yesterday, dampen it thoroughly with a spray bottle full of water. It should be damp, but not dripping wet.;
, If you don’t want the kinks of braids, or you don’t know how to do them, or don't have the time, try a bun instead. It will give you a beachy look.


To use the bun approach, simply twist your hair on top of your head or low – either works – and then secure it with a scrunchie. As with braids, you want to put the bun into your hair while it’s still damp. Sleep overnight with your hair in the bun. Then remove it, and run your fingers through it, and use hairspray to set the style. You could also divide your hair into four sections and tie each section up into a loose bun. Make sure you don't brush it when you remove the buns. Use your fingers or a wide tooth comb.

, You can also create beach-style waves by twisting your hair around a headband. This approach is a bit harder to pull off, but it can also work.


Take an elastic headband, and put it over your head. It must touch your forehead. Then, grab a piece of hair, and twist it. Wrap the hair around the inside of the headband.
Repeat the process until you have most of your hair twisted. Apply hair spray, and then sleep on it. As with the other approaches, this method works better with slightly damp hair that you then sleep on overnight.

Apply a nail hardener.,
Wear gloves to protect against cold weather and chemicals.,
Protect your nails from prolonged water exposure.Letting your nails soak in water for too long — whether you’re doing the dishes or spending a lot of time in the swimming pool — can result in weak nails that have a tendency to split when they grow a little bit of length.,
Eat a balanced diet.,
Try taking Biotin supplements.",How to Grow Your Nails in 5 Days1," You may want to apply a nail hardener to help strengthen and protect your nails while they grow.Nail hardeners will help to prevent chips and breaks that force you to trim your nails back before they reach the desired length.









Remember, your nails will only be harder while the nail hardener is on them. Once it wears off your nails will return to their normal strength. Reapply the nail hardener daily to keep your nails strong.
Nail hardener should be used only as a temporary supplement to a more long-term nail health plan in which you improve the nail’s natural strength.;
, In addition to applying lotion, remember to always wear gloves or mittens when you're outside in the cold. If working with any type of chemicals — from household cleaning products to art supply products — protect your nails with latex or heavy duty work gloves, depending on what the situation calls for. This will help to prevent your nails from breaking.

, That, in turn, results in having to trim them back more frequently.


For longer nails, make sure to protect your nails from water by cutting down on exposure — wearing gloves while washing the dishes, for example.

, You already probably eat more than enough protein for your body, so unless you're protein-deficient (which, per the average U.S. diet, is highly unlikely), you don't need to add more protein to your diet to grow your nails. In fact, too much protein can cause obesity, accelerate kidney damage, and possibly cause diabetes.


For strong nails, try to eat a wide variety of healthy foods, including fruits, vegetables, lean protein, whole grains, and low-fat dairy products.

, Biotin can help to strengthen brittle nails so that they will not break as easily.Taking a biotin supplement may help you to grow your nails longer and faster. Eating foods that contain biotin can also help with growth.You can purchase biotin supplements in drug stores, grocery stores, or health food stores. A common dosage of biotin for adults is 30 micrograms per day."

Although a regular nervous habit for many, it can cause bacterial skin infections on your hands and in your mouth. If you have dry or loose skin around your nail beds, make sure to clip them away rather than biting them off.Try keeping your nails neatly polished or add nail art, so you’ll be less apt to biting.
Chew gum when you’re bored.
Don't bite the skin around your nails. You may convince yourself that by only biting the skin around your nails, you're not actually harming the nail. This is false and will only cause your nails to weaken through the added moisture from saliva and make your nails prone to breaking.
Choose one nail a week that you won’t bite. Gradually add more “no-bite” nails to wean yourself off of the habit.
Consider talking to a therapist about anxiety and boredom issues if your nail biting is severe.;
, Rushed removal of acrylic or gel nails leaves your nails dry, brittle, and unlikely to grow. Even proper removal can damage your nails because it occurs with soaked nail-beds. When your nail beds are wet, they are most sensitive.If you wish to get gel or acrylic manicures, try alternating. Get a traditional manicure between your gel or acrylic manicure.

, Picking at your polish often removes the top layer of your nail bed. This forms a weak base for your nails., It is easy to skip base coats or top coats when you’re in a hurry and want your polish to dry fast. However, when you skip these, you’re damaging your nail. They protect your nails from staining; plus, they help the polish adhere to your nails, so that it chips less. If it chips less, you’re less likely to pick at it and further damage your nails. Carry pre-moistened nail polish remover packets in your purse for quick removal when your nails start to chip. This way, you won’t have to worry about picking at your nails.

, Peeling labels, scrapping glue, or unfastening a key ring are all things that can easily damage or break your nails. You might not even realize you’re doing it, but if you want to grow strong nails, you need to start to notice.


The best way to stop this is to slow down. Have scissors available, or another tool, to help you open, scrape, or peel anything you need during the day.Avoid doing activities that will cause your nail to bend. Keep clear nail polish on nails to avoid biting your nails.

, Biotin promotes the growth and strength of nails, hair, and skin. Aim to consume between 30 and 40 micrograms per day either through food or supplements. Whole grains, mushrooms, bananas, salmon, and avocado are all great sources of biotin., Folic acid, or Vitamin B9, helps prevent damage to your nerve cells and keeps red blood cells healthy. It is the best vitamin for nail growth, and it is impossible to intake to much because your body naturally excretes the excess. Fish, red meat, cheese, and fortified soy products are high in folic acid.

, The daily recommended dose is between 700 and 900 micrograms a day. Sweet potatoes, carrots, squash, and leafy greens are rich in Vitamin A. , This means that it helps recovery inside the body. This recovery helps promote nail growth and gives them strength. Oranges, kale, strawberries, and bell peppers are high in Vitamin C.

, In order to grow you nails long and strong, you need to start with a proper base. This means you need clean and healthy nails to begin with. File them into shape and keep your cuticles trimmed.


File them properly. Start from the outside edge and file toward the center. Going back and forth in a repetitive motion will weakens your nails.Choose the right nail shape to promote growth. A basic round shape is easier to grow out. If you shape a square nail, you’re more likely to use it as a tool.

, Soak your nails in warm water for 5 minutes to loosen your cuticles. Put a cuticle remover on your nails and use a cuticle stick to push the dead skin back. Rinse off the remover and debris. Do this up to 4 times a week.


For added cuticle health, put hyaluronic acid on and around your cuticles after pushing them back.
Keep them moisturized. Applying moisturizer around your cuticles will prevent hangnails and broken nails.

, Several strengthening treatments exist. Once you’ve shaped a proper base and correctly cared for your cuticles, apply the one that fits your budget and schedule.Serums are expensive but often produce the fastest and best results in strengthening nails.
Creams are perfect for everyday use. You can buy intensive protein treatments in the form of a cream that you put on your nails in the morning and before falling asleep at night.
Strengthening polish will help keep your nails from chipping. It is very affordable and easy to use.

Wash or mist your hair.,
Combat frizz and snarls.,
Divide your hair into sections.,
Braid your hair.,
Allow your hair to dry.,
Undo the braids and style your waves.",How to Get Natural Looking Waves1," When braiding your hair to create waves, it is best to begin with damp hair. You may achieve this in one of two ways:


Wash your tresses prior to braiding your hair.
Mist your hair with lukewarm water.;
, Frizz and snarls will ruin your efforts to achieve natural looking waves. Combat frizz by applying a leave-in-conditioner or setting mousse to your tresses. Thoroughly brush through your hair to remove any tangles or knots., The number of sections you will divide your hair into depends on the thickness of your locks. Thin hair requires fewer sections and braids than thicker hair. Use a comb to divide your hair into one to five sections.


For uniform waves, divide your hair into even sections. For random-looking natural waves, divide your hair into uneven sections.Experiment with dividing your hair into one, two, three, four, or five sections until you achieve your desired results.

, When braiding your hair for the purpose of creating waves, you can choose to produce waves that fall from your roots to your ends or waves that start near the top of your ears.French braids will produce waves in your tresses from root to tip. French braid one section at a time and secure the braid with a rubberband two inches from the ends.Traditional three-strand braids will create uniform waves from the top of your ears to the ends of your hair. Divide each section of your hair into three equal sub-sections. Plait your hair in a traditional three-strand braid., The longer you are able to leave your braids in, the more defined your waves will appear. When possible, sleep with the braid(s) in overnight. If you are in a rush, you may blow dry your braids—set your blow dryer to the lowest heat and speed setting and individually dry each braid., In the morning or after blow drying your plaits, remove the rubberbands and undo the braids. Comb your fingers through your hair to separate the waves.Secure the waves with a few spritzes of an anti-frizz strong hold hairspray."

Mist your hair with sea salt spray.,
Make a homemade sea salt spray.,
Air dry your hair to keep it looking healthy.",How to Get Beach Hair2," This is one of the most common ways that people get beach hair, and you can find affordable sea salt sprays at stores that sell beauty products. They will probably only cost a few dollars. Sea salt spray will add texture to your hair that will mimic the look of the beach. Real beachy waves, the kind you get after taking a dip in the ocean, are caused by the salt in ocean water. The sea's salty spray causes hair to curl up a bit into natural-looking waves.
To replicate this look with the spray, separate your hair into three sections. Spray your hair with it, starting at the bottom section. Then ball your hair up in your hands, and twist it around.
Let your hair set for a few minutes, and then do the same thing to the other sections. Twist the front pieces of your hair around your finger before setting them so they frame your face.

, Maybe you can’t find a product in the store. It’s pretty easy to make a spray on your own, and there are several different ways to do it. Although regular salt can work, sea salt works better.


You could make a homemade salt spray that is one part salt, one part coconut oil, and 5 parts water. Coconut oil is great for your skin and your hair; it adds shine.
Or you could make a homemade spray out of sea salt and warm water, and then scrunch that through your hair along with a gel or mousse.
Another approach is to take a small amount of hair gel or hair curl enhancing cream, and add that to warm water along with 2 teaspoons of sea salt. Put it in an empty spray bottle, and then spray your hair.

, Putting unnatural heat on your hair – such as using a blow dryer or hair straightener – can cause a lot of damage to your hair. To truly have good beachy looking hair, you need your hair to look shiny and healthy.


If you use a blow dryer, make sure you attach a diffuser to the end of it to give yourself more curls. Scrunch it again every few minutes to make sure it retains its waves.
Curl strands of hair around your fingers, then let them slip off if you want your waves to look more curly.
Add hairspray. You can get some beachy waves if you spritz your hair with a light hold hair spray. Make sure to give your hair a good shake before you leave the house. This will make the curls look less perfectly formed, which is essential for the beachy look.

Lighten your hair with lemons so it looks like it was kissed by the sun.,
Spend time at the actual beach.,
Don’t wash your hair every day or it will end up too silky for beach hair.,
Try a curling iron to create waves.",How to Get Beach Hair3," Using lemons is a natural way to add highlights to your hair, and natural products are a better choice than bleach or dye because the key to beachy hair is looking like you were really out in the sun.


Just wash your hair, cut a lemon in half, and then rub the inner part of the lemon up and down your hair. Make sure you cover all your hair. Then, sit in the sun.Be careful that you don’t dry out your hair. Make sure you use a good conditioner. It could take up to a week to see any difference. You could add a little bit of lemon juice to a sea salt spray bottle too and apply it that way. Again, put a little coconut oil in there too for shine.

, If you are at the beach or ocean a lot, you’re going to naturally get beach hair. The sun will naturally lighten your hair color, too, giving you beautiful summer highlights.


Lay on the sand for awhile. Go near the ocean. You want the breeze and salty mist to settle into your hair.
You need to stay at the beach for awhile to get this look. Don't go underwater and submerge your hair. It won't look like beach hair when it dries that way; it will look messy probably.

, Another way to get beachy hair is to not wash your hair for at least a day. It will help your hair have more of a texturized look. Freshly washed and conditioned hair looks silky, which is not the look you are going for.


When you do wash your hair, don’t use conditioner. Alternatively, you could put a dry shampoo on your hair. This will give it a voluminous, almost dirty look.
A good rule of thumb is to only wash your hair three times a week. You damage your hair each time you wash it because it produces natural oils that are essential to hair growth.

, If you want loose, natural looking waves, choose a curling iron with a large barrel. Using a curling iron to create beach hair isn't the best approach though because the curls often look too uniform. The key to beachy hair is a tousled, natural look. Start with dry hair for this method, since applying a curling iron to wet hair can damage it. Separate your hair into pieces. Wrap a piece at a time around the curling iron at a 45-degree angle. Hold it in place for a minute, then gently loosen your hair and let it slip off the curling iron. Repeat with the rest of your hair.
For more control over your waves, curl each piece a section at a time. Start near your roots, wrapping the top of your hair around the curling iron and holding it in place for a minute. Wrap the middle part of the same piece of hair and hold that in place for a minute. Wrap the end of the same piece of hair and hold that in place for a minute. Repeat with the rest of your hair.
For a quicker curling session and looser waves, wrap large sections of your hair around the curling iron and hold them in place for two minutes before releasing. Tousle your hair. When you're finished curling your hair, use your fingers to tousle it so that the curls loosen a bit and become waves. Don't overdo it, or the waves may fall out.

Moisturize your hands and nails.,
Clip away rough edges.,
Take care of the cuticle.,
Go for a round look when shaping your nails.",How to Grow Your Nails in 5 Days2," Applying moisturizer to your hands and nails should be part of your nail hygiene routine.Doing this can help to protect your nails from dryness, which may help them to grow stronger and longer. Try to apply a moisturizer to your hands and nails a couple of times per day or anytime your hands feel dry.









Use a thick, creamy lotion, such as a hand lotion.
When applying the lotion to your hands, take special care to massage it over the nails and into the cuticles.
Be especially careful to apply lotion after you wash your hands, as soap removes natural protective oils from your nails and makes them more vulnerable to breakage.

, If you notice a tear in a nail or frayed edge, then it is a good idea to clip it away with a pair of nail clippers before it becomes worse. A jagged edge might catch on something and cause you to lose part of the nail. Clip these edges as soon as you notice them to prevent them from becoming a problem.


You can also file away less severe jagged edges on your nails.

, The cuticle is the most important part of your nail, because it protects against infection. Cuticle damage (like cutting it or pushing it back without softening first) can damage your nail, which in turn will make the nail grow less quickly.Softening the cuticle will make it easier to push the cuticle back without damaging it. Try soaking your fingertips in warm water with a little bit of soap to help soften them. Then use an orange tipped cuticle pusher to push them back.
Massage your cuticles to maintain healthy blood flow in that area. While this won’t make your nails grow more quickly, it will strengthen the nail, keeping it healthier and stronger for a longer period of time.
Avoid cutting your cuticles. This can lead to bleeding and it may also introduce an infection into your nails.

, Avoid filing your nails in the ""square"" look. Instead, go for a ""round"" or ""pointed"" look. ""Square"" nails tend to catch more on surfaces like clothing, which rips them and causes the nail to break more quickly.








If you prefer the square look, then at least try to soften the edges so that your nails will be less likely to catch on things.

Repeat this process.,
Let your hair dry, remove the clips, and style.",How to Get Natural Looking Waves2," Before curling irons and straighteners, curls and waves were achieved by wetting setting hair. Pin curls are a traditional wet-setting method. To begin the process, dampen your tresses with a spray bottle and apply a generous amount of mousse to your damp hair., Create a one to two inch vertical section in front of and above your right ear. Produce a loop in the section by wrapping the hair away from your face and around your fingers. Wind the curl towards your head until it reaches your scalp. Slide a duck bill clip up through the bottom of the curl—the bottom prong should sit against your scalp and the top prong should be positioned in the center of the curl.


The sections do not need to be perfectly even or straight., Continue to work from the right crown to the nape of your neck—always wrap the curl away from your face. Once you reach the center back, move to the front left. Work from above the left ear to the nape of your neck—wrap each curl away from your face., Once your locks are secured in pin curls, allow your hair to dry.

After washing and blow drying your hair, apply a light misting of heat protectant spray. To prepare your hair to hold the curl, spray your locks with hair spray., When creating natural looking waves with a curling iron, opt for a curling wand—a curling iron without a clip. Your heated tool should have a barrel between a half an inch to one inch.Set your curling iron to a temperature appropriate for your hair type.


If you have fine or damaged hair, set your curling iron below 200℉.
If you have curly or thick hair, set your curling iron between 200℉ and 300℉., Separating your hair into sections will make it easier to manage. Use a comb to divide your hair into layers.

Make sure your hair is healthy so it will grow nice and long.


If you have scalp problems, or are struggling with dandruff, remedy those problems before attempting waves with specialized scalp shampoo.;
, There are several possible cuts to get the style started:


Get your hair cut with a 1⁄3 inch (0.8 cm) guard, with the grain.
Have a razor style cut. This is a horizontal line at the bangs.
Have a traditional ""Caesar"" cut., From this point, you'll be tending your hair daily and the grooming requires tools. Things you might find handy to purchase include:


A man's hand brush. This means a brush without a handle, that is designed to brush through long hair.This type of brush gives you the control needed.
Wave shampoo and conditioner. This will provide softness to make training your hair easier. If you don't have wave conditioner, regular conditioner will work.
Hair lotion. Lots of men use Luster's Pink lotion to add moisture to their hair. Other hair lotion can work as well.
Pomade. Pomade will help fix your wave in place, down to your scalp.
Nylon or Spandex du-rag or stocking cap. You want your du-rag to fit tightly over your head. This is needed to pin the hair down and for hair protection during sleep.

, You will be ""training"" your hair, so this requires time and effort on your behalf to rearrange the hair daily. If you're good at watching TV or listening to the radio at the same time, you can find this a pleasant way to pass the time.


All you are doing is lengthening out the natural curls in your hair, which then form waves. Think of your hair like a spring or a slinky that's wound up; when you unwind the slinky, it has a curve to it. That's all that you're going to be doing with your hair.

, There are commercial shampoos available that are specifically made for men aiming to create wave styles. If you don't want to use wave shampoo, you can use regular shampoo, or even soap. Getting waves is possible without special shampoo.

, After you step out of the shower, having washed and conditioned your hair, apply lotion and pomade, just enough to cover your hair, and brush your hair down, starting from the crown of the head.









You also want to brush your hair on top forward, toward your eyes, and brush the hair on your sides forward but downward, toward your chin.
Starting from the crown, brush the hair on the back of your head down, toward your neck. Imagine there's a small circle on the crown of your head. Going all the way around the circle, brush outward until you get all the way around.

, Lots of guys say they only get the waves in front and not in back. What that means is that you haven't brushed your hair enough in the back.








, This will help hold the wave in place. Make sure it's tight, but not too tight. Leave the du-rag on your head for at least 30 minutes.


Remember to put the du-rag on before you go to sleep.

, Remember to get your hair cut at least every 2 to 4 weeks, but keep your hair long enough so that curls can develop. Talk to your barber about what you've been doing and make sure your hair isn't cut ""against the grain,"" as in against the direction you've been combing it.








, Keeping your hair hydrated is the secret to great-looking waves. The do-rag will help with this, so moisten it with water before you put it on. Keep yourself hydrated by drinking plenty of fluids.

, This protects your hair from rubbing against the pillow and pillowcase during the night, which could undo all your hard efforts.


Brush your hair at least five times on each side at least three times a day. Brushing is what will tease your hair into place
Don't wash but rinse your hair while you're developing your 360 waves. Wash your hair weekly with wave shampoo and wave conditioner.

, Your 360 wave should be complete after several months of brushing several times a day. It may be longer than you're accustomed to having it at this point, but that means your waves will be deeper.


If you're having trouble getting the wave, you might need to brush more.

Scrub underneath your nails daily.,
Avoid biting your nails, picking at cuticles and pulling off hangnails.,
Sterilize nail care tools before using them.",How to Groom Long Nails1," Long nails can harbor dangerous infections, making meticulous hand-washing a must.Centers of Disease Control and Protection recommend a particular way to wash your hands that is the most effective at killing germs and microbes.Use clean, running water. Apply soap and lather for 20 seconds, making sure to scrub the backsides of your hands, between your fingers and under your nails. Rinse your hands well and dry them on a clean towel.Keeping nails dry is as important as keeping them clean, since moisture can encourage bacteria to grow. Carefully dry your hands on a clean towel every time you get them wet.Carry antibacterial hand sanitizer with you for times when soap and water aren’t available. Make sure the sanitizer is a gel and contains at least 60% alcohol – most commercially available sanitizers meet this criteria.Using a hand sanitizer is not as effective as washing your hands with soap and water, but it will do in a pinch. Don't replace regular hand washing with sanitizer.;
, Nail brushes are available for use during nail care, but you can also try using an old toothbrush to clean underneath your nails with soap and water.After washing, use an orange stick to clean beneath the nail. For stubborn debris, soak a Q-tip or small piece of cotton with nail polish remover (preferably an acetone-free version) and wrap it around the end of the orange stick before swabbing beneath the nail., Not only does it damage the nail bed, but even a minor cut or abrasion can harbor bacteria and fungi.Carefully clip off any hangnails with nail clippers.


Also avoid trimming your cuticles. Instead, use an orange stick to push them back.There are also cuticle-removing products available on the market, which are safe to use for this purpose.

, Use a cotton ball soaked with alcohol to thoroughly wipe off all of your nail tools before and after every use to avoid spreading infection. Make sure all of your tools are sharp and functioning along with being clean.

Cutting Waves In: After your hair is chopped 16mm to 20mm, who ever is cutting your hair is going to need a hair trimmer.,
Laying Hair Down: You want to keep your hair laid down at all times, because if not, the waves will still appear... but will look funny, and nothing even close to what the original 360 waves look liked.,
Shape Up: This is more off an optional step, but getting a shape-up is going to suit the hairstyle more than an uneven hairline, and edges.

,
Maintaining - Trims: Well, obviously you're going to need to get your waves re-patterned every so know and then... but when?,
Maintaining - Showering: You can easily continue with your current showering schedule.,
Maintaining - Cutting The Hair: Y'all probably know what wolfing is if you've been doing your research on how to get 360 waves... so how long can you ""wolf"" with straight hair and this method?",How to Get 360 Waves for Straight Textured Hair,";
, They should cut the waves in the pattern that looks natural. There is a video down low that shows the visuals of someone doing it. But if you want waves all around the head, then start from the crown, do a little circle, and make your way towards the front. This will ensure that the wave spacing will be proportional to all sections of the head. To actually cut in the waves though, the barber is going to cut into your hair with the trimmer in a line much like how he would if he was shaving designs into your head. He is going to cut a circle around your crown, then leave a cm or two, and cut another circle around your head, and so forth until the head is spinning with waves. The barber should not but right down to the scalp though, he should keep a steady hand and leave a bit of hair, but take most of the length off as it will add texture.

, The hair will be prickly as it is standing up, and this also makes your hair look thinner. Laying the hair down will make it appear thicker. To lay your hair down, you're going to want a soft-bristle brush, and brush in each direction. There are several videos on YouTube which elaborate how to brush down 360 waves, no different here. But, you also want to wear something that will lay your hair down, like a du-rag, wave cap, Tsu-Rag, or get creative if you don't have the money to buy those... use a scarf, or a t-shirt.

,, This is for you to decide, you got see when the waves start fading it, that also depends on how deep they were put in. I would suggest getting the waves re-patterned every week or two, and get a shape up while you're at it. But hey, if you're waves look nice without a cut in a month... then they look nice! But, that probably won't be the reality. You'll need weekly or every other-weekly touch ups.

, But the less you shower and the less you get your hair wet, the better the waves will feel and look. Because the more coarse your hair is, the more ""natural"" the waves will appear.

, Again, it all depends on how deep you want your waves. You could get a cut every month, every 2 months... 3 months... You just need to figure that out out yourself, what works for you. But because straight hair, grows straight, the waves will grow out much faster, so a monthly cut seems realistic, maybe every other month. And when you cut your hair, just restart from the same length you started at (unless there is another length your prefer more)

Know that eating more protein does not strengthen your nails.,
Know that garlic does not make your nails grow faster.,
Know that moving your nails doesn’t make them stronger or longer.",How to Grow Long Nails," The obvious first step in growing longer nails is to stop biting and peeling them. Biting your nails may be a compulsive habit, but they will prevent your nails from gaining any length at all. If you’re having trouble stopping, consider painting your nails regularly, or mixing habanero pepper extract into a clear nail polish; the flavor of either regular nail polish or the spice in the clear polish will likely deter you from nibbling.;
, The reason most nails don’t grow long, is because they become split and brittle by the time they get to the tips of your fingers. One of the primary causes of this is improper nail filing. The most popular and easiest way to file your nails, is unfortunately, very damaging; filing your nails in a back-and-forth motion splits the ends of the nail, meaning that down the road layers of the nail peel off and leave the nail brittle and prone to breakage. To prevent this, simply file your nails in a single direction only. This might take a bit longer and a little more concentration, but filing in a single direction will prevent the ends from splitting.

, Although you may not want bright red nails, there are many clear topcoats and strengthening polishes on the market. Applying nail polish regularly helps prevent damage to your nails, should you bump them into something. Rather than your nail being damaged, the polish will chip, effectively protecting your nails. Nail polish also prevents the ends of your nails from splitting or peeling, a major cause of breakage and short-nail syndrome. Try to have nail polish on your nails at all times, be it clear or colored.

, Dry nails are prone to splitting and breaking, and dry cuticles are likely to form unsightly hangnails. An easy remedy to this then, is to keep your nails and cuticles moisturized. While there are many fancy cuticle oils and nail treatments on the market, any lotion or oil will do the trick. Simply dab some lotion or oil onto your nail bed, and massage it onto the nail and surrounding cuticle. You can leave it to soak in over the course of the day, or rinse it off after 5-10 minutes.Olive oil and coconut oil are effective nail/cuticle moisturizers

, We all get them: a jagged broken edge on the end of a nail, or a corner that split off. While these are not only unattractive, they are also likely to cause the rest of the nail to break, because they form a stress point. Whenever you experience a broken nail, file it down as soon as you’re able. Removing the jagged edge and leveling out the shape of your nail will help keep it from breaking further, even if it does mean you lose a bit of length in the meantime.


Keep a nail file or clippers in your purse or at your desk for accidents like this.

, As attractive as the squared-off nail edge may appear, the sharp corners of this shape are prone to getting caught on things (particularly clothing), resulting in a broken nail. Therefore, you should file your nails into a more rounded shape. Even gently rounding the corners of a square-shaped nail will be effective; do all you can to limit harsh edges and corners on your nails though. On the flip side, don’t file your nail into a sharp point (such as the stiletto or almond shape), as this will create a weak tip that will snap easily.

, Gel polish is a special type of polish that is adhered to the nail using a UV light, and that lasts for 3-4 weeks without chipping. However, gel polish has a bit of a love/hate relationship with long nails. The polish is incredibly sturdy and strong, meaning that while you wear it, your nails are very unlikely to chip or break. However, for the same reason, the only way to get the polish off is to scrape it off with a metal orange stick, or to peel it off (therefore taking a layer of nail with it). In the long run, gel polish does more damage to nails than good, making it a no-go if you’re trying to grow yours out. Stick to regular nail polish, or gel polish copycats that aren’t so difficult to remove., As aforementioned, dry nails increase the likelihood of damage. Nail polish remover, although helpful, can be very drying. The same goes for other chemicals, be they cleaning products or perfumes. When possible avoid coming into contact with these chemicals via your nails. At those times when you must use them (like polish remover or acetone), be sure to swipe on a layer of oil or lotion afterwards to moisturize your nails and cuticles again.

, You’re running out the door for a meeting, look down and see chipped polish, leaving only a splotch of color in the center of each nail. While your immediate solution might be to peel this polish off before your hands must be seen in public, don’t! Peeling off polish - regular or gel - peels off the layer of nail underneath it. This thins the nail and makes it more prone to breakage, increasing the likelihood of having short nails. Instead, stick to nail polish remover and a bit of lotion afterwards.

, Biotin in a b-complex vitamin that has been linked in studies to stronger nail growth. While taking biotin does not speed up the growth of your nails, it does harden them and prevent breakage. Purchase a biotin supplement from your local health foods store, and take it on a daily basis to improve the quality and strength of your nails.

, Similar to biotin, fish oil is an omega-3 fatty acid that has shown to improve the strength of nails and hair, among other things. Fish oil can be taken one to two times daily, with results showing up within a few weeks. Visit your local health foods store to purchase a fish oil supplement.

, Rubber gloves might not be the most comfortable gloves in the world, but they do protect your nails from water and chemical exposure. Prolonged exposure to water will soften the nails, making them more likely to tear, while chemicals make nails flaky and brittle. Therefore, when you’re washing dishes or cleaning with chemicals, wear rubber gloves.

, Opening a tough package or tearing into a bag with your nails might be handy and time-saving, but doing this can cause splitting and tearing of the nail ends. This, of course, leads to breakage and prevents your nails from growing long. Therefore, whenever you’re able, use a real tool to open up things and avoid relying on your nails., Cold temperatures and dry air in the winter months suck moisture from your nails, making them brittle and prone to chipping. To prevent this, wear gloves whenever you head outdoors. For a double bonus, put on a thick layer of lotion before slipping your hands into your gloves; the gloves will trap the moisture and cause it to absorb into your nails and skin faster than usual.

, Although it sounds like it should be effective, seeing as your nails are made of keratin (a protein), consuming more protein doesn’t affect the strength or length of your nails. Studies have shown that eating foods high in protein, although good for your body overall, does not correlate to the quality of your nails. Eat protein regularly, but know that it won’t make your nails grow stronger or longer.

, An age-old myth, it has been said that rubbing garlic on your nails will speed their growth. The idea behind this is that garlic contains selenium, which weak nails lack. However, studies have found no link whatsoever to garlic consumption or rubbing garlic on your nails to stronger/faster growing nails. Rubbing garlic on your nails won’t have any detrimental side-effects, but it won’t improve your nails either.

, Some people claim that moving your fingers more increases the speed of nail growth, because it stimulates the nail. While the theory sounds good, it doesn’t actually pan out in practice. Moving your fingers more doesn’t speed up your nail growth or make your nails grow stronger."

This will soften your nail bed and make clipping and filing easier for you., The most common nail shapes are square, oval and squoval (a combination of a square and oval – essentially a square shape with rounded edges), but choose the shape that works best for you. If you aren’t sure which shape to choose, check out the shape of your cuticles and then shape your nails similarly.Square nail shapes are the most durable because they span the entire width of the nail bed.Aesthetically they look best on long fingers with wide nail beds, but this shape is popular in general.
The next best option is squoval, as far as sturdiness is concerned. This shape looks great on any hand., There are many types of nail files, including glass files, emery boards and metals files. For shaping the nails, opt for a glass file.The coarser grit allows for more control when shaping.


If you need to remove a significant amount of length before you shape your nails, use nail clippers to carefully clip your nails to be slightly longer than your desired length and use a file to eliminate the rest while shaping., Filing back and forth can weaken your nails. Instead use smooth strokes in one direction when filing, starting with one side and then moving on to the other.


Be sure to use your file to smooth away any rough edges after shaping your nails. Rough edges can cause snags and leaving behind any sharp points can be dangerous.

, This will smooth away any dents, ridges and leftover nail polish from your nail. Buff the entire nail but also the tips of your nails, which will smooth away any residual ridges after filing."

Everyone’s nails having a breaking point after reaching a certain length, no matter how strong your nails are. The longer the nail, the more easily it can break. Experiment a little to find out what length works best for you.

, Apply the nail hardener first and then add a fresh layer of topcoat every 1 to 2 days to keep your nails looking great and to help prevent chipping and breakage. If you polish your nails with color, do that first and then apply the additional products.


There is a wide variety of nail polish, nail strengtheners, topcoat and nail hardeners on the market, which you can find in the same section as nail polish when shopping. Experiment with different kinds and discover which products work best for you.
Avoid changing your polish frequently, because nail polish itself and removing the polish can both be hard on your nails.Decals are popular nail adornments and there are tons of designs available. The best ones to use are the kind you peel off paper and apply to your nail like stickers. Do this after you apply nail color, and then do your topcoat on top of the decals to seal them in.

, The worst culprit is nail polisher remover, which is particularly harsh because many removers contain acetone, which is a very aggressive solvent.


Limit your use of nail polish remover and choose a brand that is acetone-free.
Many nail polish brands use harsh and even toxic chemicals in their formulas. These chemicals can make your nails brittle.If this concerns you, there are nontoxic brands out there that you can use instead.

, Not only are these things harsh on your nails and cuticles, they can also cause nails to become brittle and discolored. Wearing gloves also prevents additional grime from getting underneath your nails, which will reduce bacteria growth and the spread of infection.

, Use clean and sharp cuticle nippers to cut off the hangnail. Try cutting as close to the base of the hangnail as possible.The closer you cut to the base of the hangnail, the less likely your hangnail will get caught on things like clothing.









Do not pull and pluck at your hangnail. This will cause an uneven break from your skin, further irritating the area of the hangnail. Pulling at your hangnail could also cause bleeding.
Do not cut off more skin or nail than what is necessary. This can create a deep cut that can easily get infected.

, The antibacterial ointment will help kill, and keep away bacteria from the hangnail area, while supporting healing. You only need a small amount to cover the entire affected area.









If your hangnail was deep, you can put a bandage on the hangnail to help prevent it from getting infected., For small hangnails that aren’t that deep, lather vitamin E oil onto the hangnail area. Vitamin E is easily absorbed into skin and is extremely moisturizing. Besides vitamin E oil, applying any kind of moisturizer to your hands will prevent your cuticles from getting dry and brittle – conditions that promote the likelihood of hangnails.

Eat a healthy diet.",How to Get Strong Nails1," Dry nails are brittle nails. To reduce splitting and breaking, rub a moisturizing cream or olive oil into the cuticles daily.Petroleum jelly or a thick, greasy hand lotion that seals in moisture should do the trick as well.





;
, Biotin may not have much of an effect unless you have severely brittle nails, but it may be worth a tryA daily dose of 30 mcg is enough to avoid deficiency.Some people take a much larger daily dose of 2.5 mg to strengthen nails, but talk to your doctor first to avoid overdosing or side effects.Talk to a doctor first if you are taking any other medications, or if you have diabetes., Shape nails with a fine-grit file (at least 180 grit), avoiding metal files and rough emery boards.File in one direction only, never back and forth.Smoothing away nicks and rough edges can help prevent breakage, but stick to this careful approach.









Make sure your nails are dry before filing.
Try shaping long nails to an oval, rather than a point or square, to reduce pressure.Never file down the sides of nails, as it can lead to infection and seriously weaken your nails.

, Many beauty websites and magazines tout specific foods or supplements. There is little to no evidence that most of these work. In general, a balanced diet with plenty of vitamins and minerals from food should be enough to avoid nail problems. Some people may benefit from calcium, iron, zinc, or vitamin B supplements, but only if their diet is low in these substances.Talk to your doctor for more information.


Don't believe myths about gelatin or garlic strengthening nails. These have no noticeable effect when eaten or used to soak the nails.

Stop biting your nails.,
Try not to use your nails as tools.,
Avoid scraping nail polish off the surface of your nails.,
Don't use abrasive products on your nails.,
Apply lotion or oil to your hands and nails.,
Eat nutritious foods.",How to Get Nice Nails1," Biting your nails keeps them from growing strong. When you bite them off you're actually tearing the nail, which weakens it all the way to the nail bed. The saliva from your mouth also softens your nails, making them more prone to getting torn or broken. Biting your nails is a habit that's hard to break, but it's the first major step to having nice-looking nails!


You can buy products that will keep you from biting your nails by making them taste funny.
Reward yourself for a job well done by giving yourself an amazing manicure when you've let your nails grow for a couple of weeks without biting them.;
, Do you tend to use your nails to scrape stickers off of bottles, pop open cans, and perform other tasks? This puts stress on your nails that leads to them cracking and getting weaker. While it's impossible to completely stop using your nails as tools - after all, that's why you have them in the first place! - being more mindful of how you use your nails can help save them from getting banged up., If you tend to pick off your nail polish, please stop. This tears up the surface of your nails, making them fragile and easy to break. When you're done with your manicure, remove the polish in a gentle way. You'll notice a big difference.

, If your nails are naturally prone to breaking, using harsh products on them is going to make the situation a lot worse. For example, acetone, the ingredient that strips nail polish from nails, is extremely drying and can make nails start to chip if you use it too often. Even nail polish usually has ingredients that can be harsh on your nails. Give them a break for a few weeks to recover from products - they'll grow back in strong and shiny. An alternative to harsh, drying polishes are water based nail polishes which use water as a base instead of drying chemicals.


Dish soap and other detergents can be tough on nails. Wear gloves when you're cleaning your house or dishes.
Use a moisturizing hand soap when you wash your hands.

, In order to combat dryness, regularly apply some lotion or oil to your hands. Almond oil and jojoba oil are particularly good for nails. This will protect your nails from drying chemicals and extreme temperatures that typically lead to damage. You can also use nail strengtheners with vitamins in them. Avoid using mineral or baby oil, which will only coat your nails rather than moisturize.









If you work outside in the elements, it's especially important to use lotion. Protecting your hands and nails with gloves or mittens will also be a big help.

, If your diet is lacking certain nutrients, that'll show up in your nails. It can cause them to look dry, ridged, or even discolored, and it leads to more breakage than usual. The solution? Eat plenty of foods that contain the vitamins and minerals your body needs to produce healthy nails. As a bonus, the same foods will do wonders for your hair, too!


Eat plenty of protein, since this is what nails are made of. Fish, poultry, pork, spinach, and beans are all good sources of protein.
Eat foods rich in biotin, the B vitamin, which is found in nuts, fish, eggs and liver.
Eat zinc and vitamin C.
Also eat foods rich in calcium.

, Apply a thin layer of toothpaste containing hydrogen peroxide to all of your yellowed nails. Use your fingertips or a old, soft bristled toothbrush to rub the toothpaste all over the surface your nails. Allow the toothpaste to sit on your nails for approximately 10 minutes, and then rinse off the toothpaste with clean water.After rinsing off the toothpaste, apply lotion to your hands and nails to keep them hydrated.

, Drop 2-4 dissolving denture cleaning tables into a bowl of water, and soak your nails in the water for approximately 15 minutes.After 15 minutes, use a paper towel to dry your hands, and then rub on some lotion.


You can soak your nails in this solution a couple times a month, but be sure you soak then when your nails are bare, and free from nail polish.

, If your nails are yellowed because of a nail fungus rather than constant use of nail polish, tea tree oil can help with the discoloration. Apply a couple drops of natural tea tree oil to each nail twice daily, and use your fingertips to massage the oil to all parts of your nails.Tea tree oil is a disinfectant and naturally fights fungus, which could help combat the yellowing of your nails.

, If you nails are severely yellowed, or the yellow coloring doesn’t improve with any of these methods, you might have some sort of nail infection or yellow nail syndrome. A medical professional will be able to properly assess your situation, and may prescribe a medicated cream or supplements to treat your yellowed nails.Zinc supplements are commonly used to help treat yellowed nails.

, Apply a clear base coat of nail polish to all of your nails before you apply your colored polish. The thin layer of base coat acts as a barrier to the dyes in the colored polish that can stain your nails and turn them yellow. Allow the base coat to dry for about 5 minutes before proceeding to paint them with your colored polish.


A base coat also serves as an anchor for the colored polish to hold onto.

, Dark nail polishes (black, purple, blue, red) have pigments that can discolor your nails if the polish has direct contact with your nails. Applying base coat can help prevent this color staining, but in general, try opting for lighter polish colors every once in a while.


Using lighter or sheer nail polish colors can give your nails a break from the harsh dyes found in darker polishes.

, Try giving your nails a break from nail polish altogether. Allow your nails to be naked and breathe about 3-4 days every few weeks. Going without nail polish for a few days will allow your nails to naturally be exposed to air for a bit before being painted over again.

Use your own manicure tools only.,
Leave your cuticles alone.,
Avoid nail hardeners.,
Switch nail polish brands.,
Take care when removing polish.,
Minimize wear and tear.",How to Get Strong Nails2," Anything that touches your nails should be used on your nails only. Sharing files, brushes, and other tools can spread infection, leading to puffy red cuticles and weak nails.Even a professional nail salon may not clean its instruments properly. Bring your own tools or ask the salon staff to sterilize their instruments.

, The cuticles at the base of your nails protect against fungi and bacteria. Cutting them or pushing them back can lead to an infection that permanently damages the nail bed.








Fake fingernails that extend over the cuticles also cause harm. Use fake nail tips instead.

, These products make untested claims and are rarely worth the risks. Even if they succeed in hardening your nails, the end result may be brittle and easily broken., Some nail polishes, especially ones that contain formaldehyde, make the nail brittle and dry.Try switching to a different brand for a few weeks and see what happens.









Some dermatologists recommend leaving nail polish on for no longer than five days.Try using hand lotion instead of a base coat, to further protect your nails., Never chip or peel off the polish. Always soak it with a nail polish remover until you can easily scrub it away. These polish removers do dry out your nail, so moisturize afterward with nail cream, thick hand cream, petroleum jelly, or olive oil.









There's some controversy over which nail polish remover is best for nail strength. Acetone has a stronger drying effect, but since it acts fast, there's less time for this to take place. Try both acetone and non-acetone removers to see which works best for you.

, Manual labor, housework frequent hand washing, and exposure to cleaning chemicals can all tear your nails. Wear gloves during these activities when possible.


If nail stress is unavoidable, possibly due to work-required hand washing, or playing classical guitar, you may need to moisturize several times daily.

Soak your foot in a warm water that's been treated with a povidone-iodine solution.,
Wrap the toe with a slice of lemon and bandage the toe overnight.,
Use oils to soften the skin around the toenail.,
Try a soak of potassium permanganate.,
Decrease pressure and increase drainage with a band-aid.",How to Get Rid of Ingrown Toenails2," Put one or two capfuls of povidone-iodine into warm soaking water instead of Epsom salts. Povidone-iodine is an antimicrobial that fights infection and fungus, forming a layer of protection until the solution is washed away., Tie a thin slice of lemon on the toe with gauze and leave overnight. The acidity of the lemon helps fight infection overnight.

, Oils applied to the toenails can help moisturize and soften the skin, reducing the pressure put on the toenail when you have to wear shoes. Try the following oils for fast relief:


Tea tree oil: this essential oil is both an antibacterial and an anti-fungal agent that smells great.
Baby oil: another great-smelling mineral oil, this doesn't have the antimicrobial properties of tea tree oil, but works great for softening the skin.

, Potassium permanganate soaks are common home treatments for athlete's foot. For 2 to 3 weeks, place 0.04% potassium permanganate in water and let your feet soak for 15 to 20 minutes, once a day. Your feet will turn slightly brown, but the permanganate is a natural disinfectant and will help keep your toes and nails exceptionally clean.

, Secure a band-aid to the bottom of your toe and pull the skin away from the location where the nail is cutting into the nailbed. The trick is to move the skin away from the offending nail with the help of a band-aid. This can decrease pressure in the area, and if done properly, promote drainage and drying.

Keep toenails at a moderate length and trim them straight across.,
Avoid getting pedicures while your ingrown toenail is still bothering you.,
Make sure your shoes are the right size.,
Be on the lookout if you regularly get ingrown toenails.,
Apply antibiotic cream to your feet twice a day.,
Soak your feet in warm, soapy water for 45 minutes.",How to Get Rid of Ingrown Toenails3," Nails that are rounded have a higher chance of growing into the skin around the toes, creating problems.


Use toenail clippers or nail scissors to trim toes. Ordinary nail clippers are small enough that they tend to leave sharp edges near the corner of the toenail.
Optimally, try to cut your toenails once every 2-3 weeks. Unless your toenails grow extremely fast, cutting your toenails often won't give them a good chance to become ingrown.

, Pedicures can aggravate the skin underneath the nail; pedicure instruments can be less than sanitary, worsening or causing an infection.

, Shoes that are too small and press on your toenails can easily cause them to become ingrown. Opt for roomier, bigger shoes instead of smaller, cozier ones.


Try to wear open-toed shoes to prevent pressure on your toe. Since your toe should also be covered, use bandages or wear socks with sandals. Although this is unfashionable, it is better than having to get surgery.

, If you get an ingrown toenail once, you are likely to get it again, so take steps to prevent that from happening.

, After you get out of the shower in the morning, and once before going to bed, apply antibiotic cream to your entire foot, not just your toe. Antibiotic cream will help reduce the risk of infection, which can lead to complications and increased pain., Put Neosporin in the corner of your toe, by the ingrown toenail. Wrap a band-aid around the toe. Leave in place until the nail improves, then cut free.

Take an oral medication.,
Apply an antifungal lacquer.,
Try a topical cream or gel.,
Opt for surgical removal.,
Undergo a laser treatment.",How to Get Rid of Nail Fungus2," See your doctor about getting a prescription for an oral antifungal medication if none of the above home remedies are helping your condition. Two commonly prescribed medications that are thought to be particularly effective are terbinafine (Lamisil) and itraconazole (Sporanox). Ask your doctor which medication is best for your particular condition.


You can expect to be prescribed an oral medication if you are at risk for developing cellulitis or are in pain from your nail fungus.
Oral medications allow the nail to grow anew without any fungus, but it takes a long time to replace the nail completely. It will usually take between six and 12 weeks for the medication to kick in, though it can take several months to completely get rid of an infection.
Be aware that oral medications can cause certain side effects including rashes and liver problems.

, If your infection is not so strong that it requires oral medication, you may be prescribed a topical antifungal lacquer. Lacquer basically looks like clear nail polish and is used only on the surface of the fungus outbreak. The most commonly prescribed lacquer is called ciclopirox (Penlac).


Apply it to the infected area once a day for a week. Then clean the area with rubbing alcohol and start the layering process over.
The drawback to lacquer treatment is that it takes an incredibly long time to get rid of an infection. It can take as long as one year to clear up nail fungus.

, Alternately, your doctor may prescribe creams or gels with antifungal properties or those that contain urea, which helps to absorb excess moisture. Some of these treatments require a prescription, while others are available over-the-counter.

, For severe infections, it may be necessary to surgically remove part or all of the infected nail. Don't worry, your nail will eventually grow back, it just takes awhile and can be a bit painful in the meantime.

, Doctors are now able to treat nail fungus using a laser or photodynamic therapy to remove the fungus. The laser treatment method is only a few years old and may not be available in some areas. Additionally, the process can cost several hundred to over one thousand dollars."

Practice good hygiene.,
Keep your nails short, dry, and clean.,
Wear ventilating socks.,
Wear rubber gloves when washing dishes or using cleaning products.,
Always wear shoes in public places.,
Avoid sketchy nail salons.",How to Get Rid of Nail Fungus3," Allow as much air as possible to reach your nails. You can achieve dry nails by avoiding tight shoes, hosiery, and tights that create a sweaty environment for your nails and opting instead for open-toed shoes.

, Use a manicure/pedicure kit to groom your nails often. Keeping your nails short prevents bacteria from getting trapped under them.

, Avoid cotton and wool socks if you plan to sweat while wearing them. Synthetic socks are better at not allowing moisture to build up and get trapped inside your socks.

, This not only prevents you from coming into contact with bacteria while performing chores around the house, it also keeps your hands dry. Bacteria likes to live in warm, moist places, so avoid creating this environment around your nails whenever possible.

, This is especially important if you shower in a shared gym. Make sure to wear sandals while showering if multiple people are using the same shower. These perpetually wet, warm places full of sweaty people are bacteria breeding grounds.

, Make sure that the nail salon you visit properly sterilizes their tools and tubs after every client.


If you don't want to ask the owners or you are unsure whether they are being truthful or not, simply bring your own nail kit and ask them to use your tools and polish to complete your manicure or pedicure.
You can also stop painting your nails or getting fake nails altogether. Nail polish traps moisture in your nails and can leave you with small cuts that attract bacteria."

Trim your nails regularly.,
File your nails.,
Soak your nails.,
Buff your nails.,
Push back your cuticles.,
Keep them maintained.",How to Get Nice Nails2," Every few weeks, you should trim your nails using nail clippers or a nail scissors. If you're growing long nails, be sure to file the edges once a week to keep cracks from forming.









Don't trim your nails too short. Leave at least a sliver of white crescents on your nails. This will let them grow stronger and result in a much prettier manicure.

, Use a nail file to smooth away any rough areas at the tips of the nail. Only file in one direction using a light motion. Try not to make them too round, because that puts you at risk for getting ingrown nails! Using a crystal file can cause less damage than rougher grained sandpaper files.









Don't file using a back and forth motion. This weakens your nails and rips up the fibers. Instead, file in only one direction, being careful not to apply too much pressure.

, This will soften them up so you can push back your cuticles and file them. Soak them in warm water. You can add a little oil if you'd like, to help soften your nails and cuticles. Be careful not to do this too often, wet nails expand and shrink when dry, this can cause cracks to form over time.








, Use a nail buffer to buff the surface of your nails. Start with the coarsest side of the buffer, then move to the finest. Your nails should be shiny when you're finished.








, Use a cuticle pusher to gently push the cuticles toward the nail beds. Don't push them back too much, and take care not to rip or tear them. Never trim your cuticles with a cuticle trimmer; this leaves an open wound at the base of your nails, making you prone to getting an infection.








, When your nails are the desired length, just file or clip the nail every now and then to maintain its shape and stop the nails from growing too long.

Start with a base coat.,
Paint your nails with polish.,
Do a second coat.,
Add a top coat.,
Remove the polish when it's time.",How to Get Nice Nails3," Get a bottle of clear or natural nail varnish and give every nail a coat of polish. Alternatively, if you have fragile, brittle, or weak nails you can use a nail hardener instead of clear varnish. Let it dry completely before moving on.








, Choose the polish color you like and apply it carefully to each nail. Using the right painting technique will help your nails look like they were done by a professional. Here's how to do it:









Dip your brush in the bottle and brush it against the opening so that you have one small drop of polish on the end of the brush. Too much polish will result in a mess.
Paint a vertical stroke in the middle of your nail first nail - usually your thumb. Start at the base and paint all the way to the tip.
Paint another stroke on the left side, and one on the right side. Re-dip the brush if necessary. Blend with more vertical strokes.
Continue with the rest of your nails until they're all painted.

, Depending on what color nail polish you used, you might want to do a second coat to make it look completely opaque. Make sure the first coat is completely dry first.








, After the polish is completely dry, add one more clear topcoat. This will seal your manicure so it doesn't chip for a week or two.








, When the nail varnish starts to chip beyond repair, use a gentle nail polish remover to get rid of the nail polish. Make sure the remover does not contain acetone and be very gentle. Instead of acetone, look for a remover that contains ethyl acetate. If you are using a water based nail polish keep in mind that removers for conventional polishes won't work; you will need to buy a remover specifically made for water based polishes. Be careful when removing polish, harsh scrubbing will damage the nails.









Giving your nails a break after you remove the polish is a good idea. Wait a week or two before painting them again.

File your nails.",How to Fix the Skin Around Your Nails," Take a medium sized bowl and fill it approximately 4 inches deep with warm water.Dip your hands in the water, making sure to submerge your nails and cuticles. Soak your hands for about 5 minutes.


Warm water helps to soften the skin around the nail for easy and pain-free grooming.;
, Pat dry your hands with a towel. Your cuticles should be free of water drops, but still moist. You want your skin to stay moist and soft while you manicure your cuticles, so it’s easier and less painful to remove dead skin.








, Using a wooden cuticle pusher, or an orange stick (a manicuring stick with a pointed end and a flat end) can help keep your cuticles from growing out onto your nail. Use the flat end of the orange stick to push the cuticle back, and the pointy end to run along the underside of your fingernail and remove any built up dirt.









Metal orange sticks should be sterilized before and after every use, and wooden orange sticks should be thrown away after every use, otherwise they can harbor bacteria., Using manicure nippers and manicure scissors, cut away extra, dead skin around your nails. This could include skin near your cuticle that you pushed back with the manicuring sticks, but be very careful to only cut away skin that is loose and soft, not your actual cuticles (the skin immediately surrounding and protecting your nail, especially near the nail's beginning edge).









Loose, extra skin will be white in color compared to the actual attached skin on your fingers. You only want to nip away skin that can snag on things and cause skin tears., Use lotions, moisturizing oils, or store bought moisturizers specifically made for cuticles to moisturize the dry areas around your nails. Rub a generous amount of moisturizer on the nail, and pay special attention to your cuticles. The entire area surrounding your nail should be coated with the moisturizer.









You can also try applying moisturizer underneath your nails as well.
Alcohol and fragrance free moisturizers usually hydrate skin better., Put on cotton gloves and wear them overnight. The gloves seal in the moisturizer and help heal your nails and cuticles. Remove the gloves in the morning.For better, longer lasting results, repeat this procedure every night.

, For smoother, hydrated skin around your nails, moisturize everyday, multiple times a day. You always want your cuticles and nails to be hydrated, because hangnails, rips, and breaks happen when your nails and cuticles are dry.


Keeping your hands moisturized is especially important in the dry, winter months.

, Dry hands are prone to cracking and peeling, so protect your hands from unnecessary exposure to activities that can dry out your skin. Avoid things like:



Washing dishes in hot water without gloves. The hot water and soap pull out moisture from your hands.

Stay away from acetone-based nail polish remover. Acetone removes important natural oils from your skin and nails.

Not wearing gloves in the winter months. The cold, dry air during the winter dries out your skin, so protect your hands by wearing gloves.

, Rather than picking at loose skin around your nails, soak and moisturize your hands. Picking can lead to open cuts, which can breed infections.


Some people pick the skin around their nails as a nervous habit. Looking into better ways to curb nervous habits, and practicing self-control can break this habit.

, Try to refrain from biting your nails or nibbling on the pieces of loose skin around the nail. Bacteria in the mouth can lead to an infection if you rip your skin around your nail, or bite your nail too low.


Try using a special foul-tasting ointment to keep you from putting your fingers near your mouth.

, Keep your nails at a length that prevents them from getting caught and snagged on things. Pay special attention to the corners of your nails and keep them smooth, so the edges don’t injure the skin around your nail.








When you do file your nails, pull the file across your nail in one, steady direction. This helps prevent splits and tears in nails that ""sawing"" (pulling the nail file back and forth) creates.

When handling anything dirty, like when you're working in the garden, make sure to wear gloves to minimize contact with dirt., While many people have no problem remembering to add lotion to their arms, legs, and hands, they neglect their nails. Each time you use hand lotion, rub the lotion over your nails and into the cuticles. This will help keep your nails strong and healthy.However, not all nails take to every moisturizer. If your nails appear cracked or otherwise damaged after using a moisturizer, try another brand.

, Harsh chemicals from cleaners can harm fingernails.You also want to keep your nails dry to promote growth, so you should avoid contact with water. Each time you need to clean, put on a pair of rubber gloves to protect your nails., It's important to file and shape your nails regularly, even when growing them out, but how you file affects nail growth. Do not file your nails back and forth. Instead, file them on either side, working towards the center. Try to file into a square shape, as this tends to cause less breakage.If you're growing your nails out to get a particular shape, stick with a basic square shape. Once your nails are at your desired length, you can file them into the shape you want.

, Go for a strengthener made of keratin protein. You can buy nail strengthener online or at a drug store. Apply your strengthener once every three days to promote nail growth."

Leave your cuticles alone.,
Use tools instead of your nails.,
Let your nails breathe.,
Go for rounded edges instead of square tips.",How to Get Long Nails1," Filing your nails in a back and forth motion can create tiny tears in the nail and this may lead to breakage. To prevent this from happening, make sure that you file your nails in one direction only.Apply gentle pressure to your nail with the file. Then, move the file in one direction. After you reach the end of the file, take the file away from your nail and return it to the starting point.;
, Cutting your cuticles can introduce bacteria into your nail beds. These bacteria can cause an infection in your nails.This may irritate your nails and even lead to nail loss.


Instead of cutting your cuticles, try pushing them back with an orange tipped cuticle stick. Apply some cuticle oil to soften them first and then use the tip of the orange tipped cuticle stick to gently push back your cuticles.
Soaking your cuticles in a little warm water will also help to soften them and keep them healthy.

, Part of the reason why mails break is because people use them to do things that they are not suited for, such as opening cans of soda. To prevent breakage, avoid using your nails as tools. Use the right tool for the job instead.For example, if you are trying to open a package, don’t use your nails to peel off the tape. Get a pair of scissors and use them to cut open the package instead.
It is also a good idea to wear vinyl or latex gloves whenever you wash dishes, clean, or do other things that might expose your nails to water and chemicals., In some cases, the best way to rehab your nails is to let them breathe for a while. Try going without any nail polish or other products on your nails for a few weeks (or months, depending on how damaged your nails are).This will give your nails a chance to repair themselves.


While you are letting your nails breathe, you can buff and file your nails to keep them looking neat and clean.
Try rubbing a drop of olive oil into each of your nails for a natural shine.

, Rounded edges are less likely to break than square edges, so try to maintain a rounded edge while you are growing out your nails.To create rounded edges, file your nails with a curving motion, as if you are tracing a half-circle around the tip of your nail. Keep filing in this manner until you have rounded out the tips of your nails.

Look for an ionic or tourmaline dryer for thick, frizzy hair.,
Consider a ceramic or porcelain dryer if you have fine or dry hair.,
Opt for a titanium dryer if you have a lot of hair.,
Choose a blow dryer in the proper wattage range.,
Pay attention to the dryer’s weight.,
Find a dryer with multiple heat settings.,
Opt for a dryer with a cool setting.,
Consider purchasing a dryer with a diffuser.,
Decide whether you need a dryer with a concentrator nozzle.",How to Choose a Blow Dryer," Ionic or tourmaline hair dryers give off negative ions that help break up the water droplets on your hair for faster drying. As a result, your hair is less likely to be frizzy after you dry it. If you have thick, frizz-prone hair, shop for a dryer that has an ionic or tourmaline interior for the best results.Tourmaline is a semi-precious metal that provides the most intense ionic action. A tourmaline dryer is likely to be more expensive than a regular ionic dryer. However, if you have extremely thick or frizzy hair, it may be a good investment.
An ionic or tourmaline dryer is also good for any type of hair that’s difficult to dry.
If you have fine or thin hair, avoid ionic dryers. They aren’t as effective in building volume as other types of blow dryers.;
, Blow dryers that feature plastic or metal housing that’s coated in ceramic or porcelain provide heat that’s less harsh and more consistent, so they’re a good choice for fine or dry hair that dehydrates easily. If you’re not sure what type of dryer to purchase, a ceramic or porcelain model is actually good for all hair types.Ceramic or porcelain dryers also use negative ions to prevent frizz and allow you to dry your hair more quickly.
Some ceramic or porcelain dryers feature infrared technology. That means they use longer energy waves that penetrate the hair so it’s dried from the inside out.

, A titanium blow dryer provides heat at a steady, even temperature. It tends to get very hot, though, so it’s not a good choice for fine or damaged hair. However, if you have extremely thick hair or lots of hair, a titanium blow dryer can drastically help reduce your drying time.Titanium weighs less than ceramic or porcelain, so the dryer is usually lightweight. That makes it more comfortable to hold when you have a lot of hair to dry.

, A blow dryer’s wattage measures how hard and fast its motor works. The higher its wattage, the faster you’ll be able to dry your hair. Dryers with a low wattage are usually cheaper, but you’ll need to replace them more often than those with a higher wattage. For at-home use, look for a dryer whose wattage is at least 1350.If you have extremely thick, difficult to dry hair, opt for a dryer with a wattage between 1800 to 2000. That will help you dry your hair more quickly.

, It may seem like a minor detail, but it’s important to consider the weight of a blow dryer. You want a lightweight model that will be more comfortable to hold while you’re drying your hair. That makes your blowout easier.For the most comfortable drying experience, look for a blow dryer that’s approximately 1 pound (454 g) in weight.

, While it helps to have a dryer that’s made with the right material and proper wattage, you also want a model that allows you to adjust the heat level. Search for a dryer that provides low, medium, and high heat settings so you can use the precise amount of heat that your hair requires.For fine, thin, or dry hair, the low heat setting is usually enough to effectively dry your hair.
For normal hair, the medium setting is usually enough to effectively dry your hair.
For coarse, thick hair, the high heat setting is usually enough to effectively dry your hair.

, If you want shiny, sleek hair, choose a blow dryer that features a cool shot setting. That allows you to blast your hair with cool air when you’re nearly finished drying your hair to seal the cuticle for smooth, shiny hair.Switch from the heat setting to the cool setting when your hair is approximately 80% dry. It will finish drying your hair with overheating it.

, A diffuser is an attachment that distributes the hot air in a larger area without blowing your hair all over the place. It’s particularly helpful if you have curly or wavy hair because it helps keep the texture intact while still adding volume.A diffuser typically snaps onto the end of the blow dryer. It is removable so you can only use it when you want to.

, Like a diffuser, a concentrator nozzle snaps onto the end of a blow dryer. However, it emits the air in a concentrated stream so it’s a handy tool if you regularly straighten your hair your hair with your dryer. It can also help cut down on frizz.When you use the concentrator nozzle, always keep it pointed downward and never allow it to come into contact with your hair.Run a brush through your hair as you’re drying it, and follow the path of the brush with the concentrator nozzle for super straight, sleek hair.

Set your hairstyle with hairspray.",How to Set Dry Hair3," Work a small amount of styling mousse through your hair before styling your hair to keep body and volume throughout the day. Mousse works similarly to gel except helps set your hair while also allowing the hair to move freely.

, Hair lotion should be applied to your hair while it is still damp. Add hair lotion after a shower to ensure that your dry hair sets. Many hair lotions require you to sprinkle it directly on your hair rather than working it through your hair with your fingers., Once you have styled your hair, applying hairspray can help the hairstyle last all day. Hold the can of hairspray at least 12 inches from your head to prevent the individual hairs from sticking together. Spray the hairspray under the strands and near your roots to give your hair extra volume."

Avoid rubbing with the towel, which can cause frizz and breakage.;
, To make your hair shiny and smooth, rub hair serum into your hair ends.You only need to use a coin-sized amount for your full head of hair.









Rub this between your hands first to ensure you apply it evenly.Some people apply one or two drops of oil to their hair instead. This may cause damage during a hot blow dry session, so use this with low-temperature blow-drying only. Try a light oil such as jojoba oil or coconut oil., Spray heat protectant lightly onto your hair from at least 20cm (8 inches) away. Gently comb your hair with a wide-toothed comb to distribute the protection throughout your hair.








Do not use a narrow-toothed comb, and don't try to comb out tangles. These approaches may tear out wet hair.

, If your blow dryer comes with multiple nozzle attachments, compare the width of each one. If the nozzle is too wide (side to side), you may waste air flow directing it at short hair. However, the more narrow the nozzle opening is, the more likely it is to cause damage. Consider sticking to a wide nozzle if your hair is fragile or thin.








Reduce the air flow setting to low or medium as well.

, If your hair is easily damaged, reduce the temperature setting on your blow dryer to medium or low, until the flow of air feels comfortable on the back of your hand.If your hair is strong, or short enough to dry in a few minutes, blow dry on high heat.









See the guides below for specific styles.

, For a quick and easy dry, point the blow dryer downward. This reduces frizz and fly away strands. As you blow dry, drag a comb or your fingers through your hair to ensure even drying.








To keep straight hair smooth and well-shaped, pull the ends of your hair as you blow dry. You can do this with your fingers, but for best results, use a brush adapted to the length of hair. Pull very short sections with a small brush, and use a brush with longer, thicker bristles to wrap around the ends of medium-length sections.

Part your hair.,
Wrap the section around a brush.,
Select your temperature.,
Blow dry from all sides.,
Twist the hair and let cool.,
Blow dry again while pulling forward.,
Blow dry the remaining sections away from your face.",How to Blow Dry Short Hair2," Divide your hair into four sections: the left, right, front, and back. Clip three of the sections, leaving the last one free. It's generally easiest to start with the back section free and move forward.









Part thick hair into more than four sections.

, Wrap one section of hair around a round brush. Bring the hair forward so you can reach it easily with the blow dryer.








, High heat blow-drying has a more significant effect, but can easily cause damage. Set your dryer to a medium temperature instead unless you have resilient hair.








, Pull the hair gently with the brush to expose a straight length of hair. Hold the blow dryer about ½–1 in (1.25–2.5 cm) away from the hair, gliding along this length without touching your scalp or the brush. Repeat several times from below, above, and both sides. Gradually roll the brush to reveal more hair as you blow dry.









Direct the air away from your head, not toward it.
For everyday blow drying, it's best to keep the nozzle 8 inches (20 cm) away from your hair.This will reduce damage to your hair, but will make it much more difficult to style.

, Rotate the brush to form a half or full twist, to encourage more volume. Leave your hair in this position until it cools.









To prevent your hair flipping up, twist this toward your head, not away.

, Bring the brush as far forward on your head as you can to maximize volume. Pull the brush forward so your hair is tense; this will make your hair more shiny. Blow dry from all sides until dry, adjusting the section to expose wet areas.








, Move on to the front section, blow drying it while pulling it to one side of your face. Pull the sections on the left or right away from your head, to increase bounce and volume.









If the ends of your hair tend to flip up and disarrange your hairdo, blow dry them from above, with the dryer pointed straight downward. You'll still add volume as long as you keep your hair pulled tightly away from your head.

Place your hair in the diffuser.,
Blow dry with gentle movement.,
Move your hair back (optional).",How to Blow Dry Short Hair3," A diffuser attaches over the nozzle of your blow dryer. These lower the air flow, keeping your curls intact instead of creating a mountain of frizz.









If your blow dryer didn't come with a diffuser, buy a ""universal"" model, or a diffuser specifically meant for your blow dryer.

, Just as described in the basic method, you should blow dry while your hair is damp but not soaked. Apply heat protectant before you begin, plus hair serum or oil if you want added shine.

, Curly hair is especially vulnerable to heat damage. Reduce heat to low, or over time you might end up with limp, straight sections in the middle of your curls.








If your hair starts to break easily or looks damaged, take a break from heat treatments. Use the cool setting on a blow dryer, or air dry instead.

, Flip all your hair to one side of your head. Let it hang into the ""teeth"" of the diffuser, with the blow dryer on.







, As you blow dry from beneath, lift the diffuser up onto your hair strands. Avoid quick movement that could disrupt curl formation. Make sure no strands of hair are caught in the teeth when you move to the next area.








, Some people find that blow drying with their hair all on one side leads to flat hair on the crown. If you encounter this problem, just flip your hair back to a more typical arrangement after a few minutes. Tilt your head as you finish blow drying, to allow your curls to fall into the diffuser teeth.

Use a curl enhancing product.,
Embrace the diffuser.,
Defy gravity.",How to Blow Dry Hair With Natural Waves1," Prepare your hair for styling by applying a product that is designed to accentuate waves to wet hair.

Blow drying with a diffuser will allow your hair to dry faster than it would naturally, which prevents frizz, but it will not weigh down your hair with too much pressure like blow drying without a diffuser will.


To get the most benefit out of your diffuser, hold it right up to the ends of your hair and use it to push the ends of your hair up towards the roots as you blow dry.
A good diffuser should reduce the amount of air your hair is exposed to. If you don't see a significant difference in airflow when you put the diffuser on your hair dryer, you may need a better diffuser.Use the low or medium heat and speed settings on your blow dryer to avoid drying your hair and creating frizz., To help give your waves some extra bounce, it helps to hold your head upside down or to the side as you blow dry.

This will give you added volume when your hair dries., With your hair partially dry, separate it into small sections and create braids all over your head. The smaller your braids, the tighter your waves will be.


This will work the best if you part your hair where you want it for your final style before you start braiding.
You can also try twisting your hair into small buns and pinning it up if you don't want to do braids.

, With your braids secured, continue blow drying your hair until it feels completely dry. Then remove your braids.

Your results will not be as good if your hair is not fully dry, so be thorough. Depending on the thickness of your hair, it will probably take between five and 10 minutes to dry completely.

Try experimenting with different sized brushes. A smaller brush will give you a tighter wave.
The length of time you will have to hold the blow dryer to your wave to make it hold will depend on the thickness and texture of your hair.
Applying hair spray while your hair is twisted around the brush may help it hold the wave.

Wash your hair.,
Towel off your hair slightly, just enough to stop the dripping.,

Work your way down the hair sections.,
Leave your hair a little bit damp.,
Finish with a blast of cold air.",How to Blow Dry Hair," Use your regular shampoo, but for better blow drying effects and |protection, try washing with a moisturizing shampoo (dry hair formula, as it's often called).

;
, Don't rub your hair with the towel, as the friction can cause split ends and frizzy dryness. Instead, gently wrap the towel around your hair and squeeze, like blotting the water out of your hair. If you have hair that's too short a length for that technique, wrap the towel around your head and rub very very gently using strong, circular motions. Don't rub too fast or hard, and if you can feel pain or hair breaking, then use your common sense and stop. Your hair doesn't have to be very dry at all after toweling; it just shouldn't be excessively soaked and dripping everywhere.








, The bigger the section, the longer it will take to dry. It's best to go for four to six sections, but make sure that nothing is tangled. If you have thick or longer hair, try using clips to help. If your hair's a bit too short, you may want to just part it into two sections.








, Maintain this distance throughout, so nothing burns. Never blow dry in an upwards motion, as this causes more damage. Plus, by drying the hair on your scalp, it prevents the moisture from soaking the rest of your hair.








, Remember to move the blow dryer around, again, to avoid focusing too much heat on one area. If you simply focus the dryer on one spot for too long it will dry out and may even burn the hair, rather than drying it gently.








, Don't dry the hair until your whole head of hair is completely dry; leave in some moisture, so that your hair won't dry out, and become frizzy or damaged. Leave it tolerably damp, not so it soaks your clothes, but so it will dry naturally in about 5 to 10 minutes.








, This will help to to lock in shine. Brush through your hair gently, or de-tangle it with your fingers. If needed, apply a moisturizing or anti-frizz serum and brush it through evenly.

, Pull the arms towards the back of your head. They should cross right over the shirt hem. Tie them in a tight knot. If the sleeves are long enough, you can wrap them back around your head, and tie them in a knot right above your forehead.


The sleeves of the shirt will hold your shirt-turban in place.
If the sleeves are too short, try securing them with a bobby pin or a safety pin.

, Do this only when your hair is almost all dry. Place the brush under a section of hair, close to the roots. Point the nozzle of the hairdryer over the hair section. Slowly bring the brush and hairdryer down towards the tips of your hair at the same time. Keep the hair sandwiched between the brush and the nozzle. You may have to repeat this a few times before the section is smooth.


If you don't have a round hairbrush, you can try substituting a regular paddle hairbrush.

, Turn your hair dryer to a cool setting. Aim the nozzle downwards, and blow dry your hair using smooth strokes. Start from the roots and move the dryer down to the tips. This will help smooth and seal the hair cuticle, making your hair appear shinier and smoother.

Use a tiny bit of argan oil, jojoba oil, or shine serum on your hair before you blow dry it.,
Always use a heat protection spray before your blow dry your hair.,
Consider using a leave-in conditioner on the ends of your hair.,
Try getting a nozzle attachment for your hairdryer if you have straight hair.,
Try getting a diffuser attachment for your hairdryer if you have curly hair.",How to Blow Dry Hair Without Frizz2," Start with a pea-sized amount, and apply it to your hair, focusing on the ends. If you have longer hair, or very thick hair, you might need to use more.


You can also these oils and serums on your hair after it dries to give it some additional shine.

, This is essential if you have curly hair, which is more prone to heat damage than straight hair.


Some heat protection sprays also have built in frizz control.

, This will help your hair retain moisture while you blow dry it. One of the reasons hair might appear frizzy is because it is dry and damaged.

, It is also great for those who would like to blow dry their hair straight. The nozzle will help direct the airflow better while you are blow drying your hair. It will help the hair cuticles lay flatter, and in turn, make your hair appear smoother.

",How to Blow Dry Hair Without Frizz3," There are many things that can make hair appear frizzy, including genetics. One of the leading causes of frizz is damage. Learn to prevent damage to help keep your hair frizz-free., Both the sun and the wind can wreck havoc on your hair. If it is going to be a hot, sunny day, try to wear a hat or use a hair product with built-in SPF. If it is going to be cold and windy, try to wear a hood, scarf, or hat to protect your hair.

, Once you finish rinsing your hair after washing and conditioning, give it a final rinse using cool water. This will help seal the hair cuticles and help them lay flat. Your hair will appear smoother afterwards., Most cotton pillowcases will soak up the moisture from your hair, making it look dry and brittle. Also, coarse fabrics, such as cotton and linen, can snag your hair and cause minuscule rips and tears. A satin pillowcase is smooth, and will help reduce hair-damaging friction.

, This is important, even if you are planning on growing your hair out. As your hair grows, the ends become split. There is no real way to permanently fix split ends, and if you leave them untended, the damage will only creep further and further up the hair shaft. As such, you will want to trim the damaged ends off.


There are serums and creams that can temporarily seal split ends together. Look for products that say they will mend or seal split ends.

, Aim for washing your hair two to three times a week instead. Excessive shampooing can really dry your hair out, which can lead to frizz.

, While playing with your hair won't necessarily damage it, it will cause it to appear frizzy. The more you touch your hair, the more you mess up the cuticles. This is especially important for those with curly hair.

, Too much heat styling, such as straightening and curling, can cause hair to become brittle and dry. A heat protection spray will help prevent this from happening. It is better, however, to leave your hair natural, and give it a few days break between straightening and curling sessions.


When blow drying, straightening, or curling your hair, try to use a lower heat setting. Avoid using a high heat setting. It will take longer, but it will be gentler on your hair.

, While silicones are great for making hair appear smoother, they can cause build-up if not properly washed out. This build-up can make your hair appear limp and dull. Unfortunately, silicones can only be washed out with sulfates, which are harsh cleaning agents. Sulfates can make hair dry and brittle. This can lead to frizz.

, All of these can lead to frizz. Alcohol, caffeine, and smoking are all diuretics. This means that they absorb moisture from the body. No moisture means dry, frizzy hair. Processed foods offer little nutrition, which hair needs to be healthy. They can make frizz worse.

, Coloring, bleaching, and perms can all damage and weaken hair, causing it to become brittle and dry. All this can make your hair appear frizzy.

Get the right tools.,
Wash your hair.,
Blot it dry.,
Comb it out.,
Apply heat protectant product.,
Move to the bedroom.",How to Blow Dry Hair Straight1," The most basic tool you need to blow out your hair is a good hair dryer with a nozzle that will direct the heat in a concentrated stream. This will result in a smoother blowout than one done without a nozzle. Most hair dryers come with a nozzle attachment, but if yours didn't, you can purchase one separately from a beauty supply store. In addition to a hair dryer, you'll need the following:








Wide-toothed comb
Large round brush
Heat protectant product
Hair oil or anti-frizz serum;
, Shampoo and condition your hair in the shower as normal. Since you're planning to blow it out straight, consider using a straightening shampoo and conditioner to reduce the volume before you even start your blowout.








, As soon as you step out of the shower, use a towel to gently blot the excess water from your hair. Don't squeeze it, rub it, or twist it up, since this could make it frizzy. Just use the towel to absorb the water that's dripping from your hair.








, Use a wide-toothed comb to comb your hair smooth and remove any tangles before you start your blowout. It's much better to start your blowout with tangle-free hair, since the brush you'll be using could damage your hair if it catches on tangles.








, This is an important step to take to protect your hair from heat damage. Heat protectant products contain polymers that bind to your hair and keep it from getting fried by the hair dryer. Squirt a nickel-sized amount into your palm, rub your hands together, and smooth the product into your hair from roots to tips.









If you don't have a heat protectant product, apply leave-in conditioner or anti-frizz serum. It's better than drying your hair with no product at all.
Avoid using too much product, since it could leave your hair looking limp and even greasy instead of shiny and sleek.

, Humidity causes curly hair to frizz up, so blow drying your hair in the bathroom just after you've taken a hot shower is not ideal. To get the best out of your blowout, blow dry your hair in the bedroom or a different room with a good mirror and no humidity.

Rough dry your hair.,
Pin up the top layers.,
Drape a small section of hair around your brush.,
Turn on the hair dryer and position it two to three inches from the brush.,
Angle the dryer down as you pull the brush from roots to tips.,
Repeat several times until the section is dry.,
Continue section by section.",How to Blow Dry Hair Straight2," Instead of jumping straight to drying it out straight, start by using the dryer without a brush to get your hair about eighty percent dry. Hold the hair dryer several inches from your head and dry your hair all over, using your other hand to comb through your hair and tousle it to help all the layers dry evenly. Stop when your hair is still damp, but no longer wet.


Rough drying protects your hair from getting too damaged by your hairbrush and dryer. If you go straight to using the brush, it will take twice as many passes to get each section of hair straight. It's better to get most of the way there without a brush.

, Gather the top layers of your hair and pin or ponytail them at the top of your head. You'll start by drying the bottom layers, and unpin more layers as you to until your hair is fully dry. This way you'll be able to ensure that all of your hair is evenly dried and straightened.








, Choose a section to start with and drape it over your brush close to the roots. The brush should be touching your head, with the hair draped over it and hanging toward the ground. This will enable you to pull the section of hair taut as it dries, which is the key to getting it straight.








, In most cases you want to use a medium heat setting to reduce damage to your hair. However, if your hair is extremely curly, use the hottest setting to ensure it dries straight.








, Pull your hair taut with the brush and run it through your hair from roots to tips. At the same time, angle your hair dryer down and move it down the length of your hair. The brush and hair dryer should move in sync.









If your hair lacks volume, you should brush your hair up. If you want it to lie flat, brush it toward the ground.
Either way, keep the hair dryer angled down, so that the stream of air moves from the roots toward the tips. This helps the hair shaft lie flat and prevents frizzing.

, One pass isn't usually enough to dry a section of hair. Keep drying the same section until it's completely dry and straight. Remember to brush from roots to tips, holding the hair taut. Angle the dryer downward.







, Keep going until the entire bottom layer is dry, then unpin the next layer of hair and repeat. Continue until your hair is completely dry from top to bottom.








"
"
Blast your hair with cold air.,
Apply serum to keep your hair sleek.,
Use a straightening iron if necessary.",How to Blow Dry Hair Straight3," Turn your dryer to the cool setting and finish off the top layer by blasting your hair with cold air from the roots down toward the tips. This helps the hair shaft lie flat and prevents frizzing throughout the day.








, Use an anti-frizz serum or argan oil to keep your hair shiny and straight. Rub a little through your fingers and comb it through your hair, focusing on the tips, which tend to dry out sooner than the rest of the hair.








, Curly or wavy hair can be difficult to completely straighten with a hair dryer alone. You hair should be sleek, but it might not be bone-straight. If you want it to be perfectly straight, use a straightening iron on each section of hair.

Brush out your hair.,
Apply heat protectant.,

Brush your hair as you go.",How to Blow Dry Layered Hair1," Get rid of all tangles before you begin.;
, Blow drying always risks damaging your hair. Apply a heat protectant evenly throughout your hair.

, Flip your hair forward and tilt your head toward your chest. This is good for volume and definition.


Skip this step if you have thick, frizzy hair.

, You may hold the brush on the opposite side of your hair, moving it along to follow the blowdryer. If you'd rather not blow dry every layer separately, just blow dry without a brush, and stop every few minutes to brush your hair out.

"
"
Start with wet hair.,
Section your hair.,
Apply heat protectant to the lowest layers.,
Blow dry the lowest layers with a round brush.,
Flick the brush off the hair at the end.,
Repeat with each layer.",How to Blow Dry Layered Hair2," Layered hair usually takes a long time to blow dry. If you towel dry or allow it to air dry partially, your hair may dry before you finish heat styling. Blow drying dry hair can cause major damage.


Brushing out tangles is recommended, unless you tend to lose hair when you brush it wet.

, Use your best judgement depending on how thick your hair is. Typically, you would divide your hair into left and right sections. Divide each of these sections further by layer, and clip most of the layers onto the top of your head. Leave the lowest layer or two hanging free.

, This will protect them from heat damage. Natural options such as argan oil are also available.

, Place a round brush against the underside of the hair near your neck. Wrap your hair around the brush and blow dry from the other side. Move the brush and blow dryer down along your hair at the same rate, steadily drying your hair.


The round brush helps define the ends of your hair, making your layers stand out.
If you want to add volume, brush and blow dry backward instead. (Note that this can damage your hair.)
Some people get better results brushing hair from the back and pulling it forward (toward the face) as it dries.

, When you reach the end of your hair, lift your brush a little and pull the brush out sideways. This little ""flick"" will give a natural swing to the layer, instead of having it hang straight down.

, Once your hair is dry, pin it to the sides and let down the next layer. Repeat the same process for each layer until your hair is dry.


To prevent frizz in curly hair, make sure your hair is completely dry.
Don't forget to apply more heat protectant to each layer.

If your hair is several inches above your shoulders (your shortest pieces less than an inch long), section off the hair right above your ears and clip it away.

Some even have extra items embedded inside, such as flower petals and glitter. Other bath bombs contain additional oils and butters that are good for your skin, such as almond oil and cocoa butter. Find a bath bomb whose color and smell appear to you the most; if you have dry skin, then look for one with additional oils and butters for extra moisture. Here are some things you can expect to find in a bath bomb:Essential oils such as lavender, chamomile, and rose. These not only make the bath bomb smell nice, but they can also help you feel relaxed or more awake.
Skin softening and nourishing oils and butters, such as almond oil, coconut oil, shea butter, and cocoa butter. These are great for dry skin!
Fun additives such as glitter and flower petals will float on top of the bath water. They are for aesthetic purposes and can help enhance the mood.
Salts and powdered clays and herbs are also often found in a bath bomb. They help soften, moisturize, and nourish your skin.;
, Some bath bombs include flower petals, which can get stuck in the tub after you drain the water out. You can prevent this from happening by putting the bath bomb inside a small cloth bag or a nylon stocking. The detergents, fragrances, and oils will pass through the fabric and enhance the bath water, but the petals will remain inside the bag or nylon stocking. Once the bath is over, all you have to do is empty out the bag or recycle it.

, Bath bombs are expensive, but you can make yours last longer by cutting it in half using a serrated knife. You will use one of the halves for your bath, and save the other half for another bath.If you choose to only use half of your bath bomb, be sure to store the other half properly by wrapping it in plastic wrap and keeping it in a dry location. You can also store you bath bomb in an air-tight container, such as a mason jar. Make sure that the bath bomb is dry; and moisture will cause it to start to fizz., You are making this bath for yourself, so make sure that it is comfortable for you. Make the water as deep or as shallow as you like, and use a temperature that is not too hot and not too cold for you. Once you have filled the tub to your liking, turn the water off.

, As soon as the bath bomb enters the water, it will start to bubble and fizz. Over time, the bath bomb will start to break apart and dissolve, thus allowing all the beneficial oils, salts, and butters to be released into the bath water.

, You can enter the tub while the bath bomb is still fizzing, or you can wait until it has finished.

, Get into a comfortable position. You can close your eyes and relax, meditate, or even read a book. The bath bomb will dissolve, and fill the water with fragrant essential oils, nourishing and moisturizing butters and oils, and additional items, such as flower petals, glitter, and color.

, After a while, the water will start to naturally cool down. At this point, you can leave the bathtub and drain the water. Do not stay in the water too long, or your skin will turn pruney and wrinkly!

, You do not have to rinse off after using a bath bomb, but if you used a colored bath bomb or one with glitter in it, you may consider doing so. Simply drain the bathtub, then take a shower and rinse the oils and butters off your skin. You may use a loofah and shower gel as well, if you wish.

, Some bath bombs use dyes that may stain your tub. The dyes will be easier to clean off while they are still damp. Use a bathtub cleaning sponge or brush and scrub the dye residue away. If there are any flower petals or glitter in your tub, you can either pick them out or run fresh water over them and let them flow down the drain.

, Bath bombs will keep their solid form as long as they are kept in a dry environment; however, the fresher a bath bomb is, the more it will fizz when you drop it into the bathtub.If you wait too long to use it, it will not fizz as much.

, If you purchase a bath bomb that contains eucalyptus oil, you can use it to help clear out your sinuses when you have a cold. Simply fill a tub with warm water, drop the bath bomb in, and hop in.

, Many bath bombs contain essential oils, which can help enhance your mood and make you feel relaxed, less stressed, or more awake. When choosing a bath bomb, look at the ingredient list to see what types of essential oils it contains. The essential oil is also responsible for the scent, so be sure to choose one that you like. Here are some common types of essential oils that can be found in bath bombs and their uses:Lavender essential oil has a classic scent with fresh, floral notes. It may help reduce anxiety, depression, and stress.
Rose essential oil is another classic scent with sweet, floral notes. Like lavender, it helps ease depression.
Lemon essential oil has a fresh, clean scent. It is very uplifting and may leave you feeling fresh and energized.
Peppermint and other minty essential oils have a cool, refreshing scent. They are great for easing headaches and nausea. They may also leave you feeling refreshed and energized.

, You can do this by dimming the lights in your bathroom and lighting a few candles. You can further enhance the mood by playing some soft music. Because you will be soaking in the tub for a while, you should consider bringing something with you. Here are some more ideas:Relax with a book.
Bring something to drink, such as champagne or hot tea.
Bring something to eat, such as fruit or chocolate.
Fold a soft towel and place it behind your head, neck, and shoulders before you lean back in the bathtub. This will make things more comfortable.
Wear a face mask to the bathtub. By the time you have finished taking your bath, the face mask will have finished doing its work.

, Sometimes, bath bombs can be almost too pretty to use! If you find it difficult to drop your pretty bath bomb into the tub, consider displaying it in a pretty dish in your bathroom. The fragrance released by the bath bomb will be subtle and not overpowering., If you like to pamper yourself but dislike sitting in baths, you can use a shower fizzy instead. Shower fizzies are similar to bath bombs, except that they contain fewer oils so that they don't make the floor of your shower slippery. Simply place a shower fizzy on the floor of your shower where the water will hit it, turn on the water, and step inside. The water will cause the shower fizzy to break apart and dissolve, thus releasing the fragrant oils."

Blow hair up and back from your face.",How to Blow Dry and Add Volume to Your Hair," Choose a shampoo and conditioner that are right for your hair type. If your hair is too dry, buy a moisturizing shampoo. If your hair is too oily, buy a shampoo designed for oily hair. Use a volumizing conditioner, unless your hair already has too much volume.Use about a dime to a quarter-sized amount of both shampoo and conditioner. Rinse thoroughly.;
, Do not rub your hair! Instead, blot it gently and repeatedly with a towel. Try to get all the excess moisture out.







, Put a tennis-ball sized amount of mousse into your hands. Apply the mousse from the roots of your hair to the ends. If you have longer hair, put it up near your scalp, too.








The same products do not work for everyone, especially in terms of mousses and volumizing products. If you try a mousse and it does not work well for your hair, ask your hairstylist what kinds of products are be best for blow drying your hair.

, Before you begin blow drying, your hair should be at least 60% dry. Keep blotting with a towel if you do not have the time for your hair to just air dry. This might seem like a long time to wait, but, to protect your hair and prevent frizziness after blow drying, the 60% dry rule is really important!, Use a thermal heat protectant that prevents damage from the heat of the blow dryer.Heat protectants come in many different forms. Sometimes they are sprays, but they can often be oils. Apply it lightly and evenly to all of your hair.








, These sections should depend on the width, texture, and length of your hair. You should let down these sections gradually as you blow dry the rest of your hair. Secure them with hair clips on top of your head. Leave the bottom layer of your hair down. You should blow dry this section first.









If you have really thin hair, you should opt for four to six sections for your whole head. If you have thick hair, you can divide it into 10 or more sections. Take your time, and make the sections as small as you can without sacrificing too much time.

, While many people think that a hotter blow dryer is be more effective, it could give you dry, frizzy hair. Put your blow dryer on the lowest possible setting.If the lowest possible setting seems really ineffective, try the next highest setting. However, your hair should be mostly dry by the time you even begin blow drying, so the blow dryer should be used more as a styling tool than a drying method.

, Do not wrap it all the way around the brush. Pull the brush (with the hair wrapped around it) to create tension on your hair, and begin to blow dry from the tips of the hair, moving the round brush up from the tips, to the middle of the hair strand, and finally to the roots.When you move the brush, release the hair slightly, then wrap the next part of hair around the round brush.









Make sure that you have a high quality blow dryer with a nozzle or diffuser.Always brush in an upwards motion so that you add more volume to your hair.Holding the blow dryer in one hand and the brush in the other, extend your hairbrush-wielding arm up and out rather than down. This may volumize your hair more.The type of brush you need will vary with your hair type. While people with thicker, more textured hair may want to opt for a paddle brush, people with thinner, fine hair may want a ceramic round brush. If you have questions about what is best for your hair, consult your hairstylist.

, Release the sections one at a time from the next layer of your hair. Repeat the same drying process for all the layers of your hair.








, Many people, especially if they start with wet hair, do not blow dry their hair until it is thoroughly dry and also warm. Run your hands through all of your hair, making sure that it is warmer than the room temperature. Especially check the bottom and back of your head for cold spots. If you blow dry your hair but leave it cold, it could get dry and frizzy.







, When all of your hair is dry, blow it all backwards, away from your face. Part your hair.If you want extra volume, part your hair on the opposite side than you typically do.Add any finishing products that you like (such as Moroccan oil) and style further.

Crack open an egg and let the yolk settle into one of the shell halves. Hold both halves of the shell over a bowl, and pass the yolk back and forth between each one. Each time the yolk lands in a shell, a little bit of the egg white dribbles into the bowl. Do this until all of the egg white is in the bowl. You can discard the egg yolk or you can save it and use it for something else, such as cooking or a hair mask.

, If you want the added benefits of aromatherapy during bath time, add 5 drops of your favorite essential oil. Your bubble bath will smell divine and help you de-stress after a long day. Here are a few great bath oils:


Chamomile
Lavender
Rose geranium
Sandalwood
Vanilla

, Once you have put all of your ingredients into the mixing bowl, stir them together gently. Do not over-mix your ingredients, or else the soap and egg white will start to stiffen and foam.

, You can store your bubble bath in any container you want, so long as you can close it tightly. You can use mason jars, glass bottles with screw on caps, or glass bottles with corks.


Consider making a label for your container.
Embellish your container by tying some string around it or decorating it with stick-on gems.

, Your bubble bath contains egg white, which means that it is perishable. When you are not using your bubble bath, store it in your refrigerator and try to use it within a few days.

, Egg whites help keep the bubbles firm and honey helps moisturize the skin, but they are not absolutely necessary to make bubble bath; it is still possible to make bubble bath without them. This section will show you how to do it.

, You can use a pot, a bowl, or even a jar to mix all of your ingredients. You will be pouring the ingredients into another container later.

, You will need 1 ½ cup (337.50 milliliters) liquid Castile soap. You can use scented or unscented soap. If you choose to use unscented soap, you can add your own scent later with essential oils. If you do not have any liquid Castile soap, you can use other liquid soaps and shampoos instead, but they may not be olive-based or vegan. Here are some options:


Mild, unscented dish soap
Baby shampoo or other mild shampoo
Liquid hand soap, scented or unscented
Liquid body soap, scented or unscented

, Measure out 2 tablespoons of vegetable glycerin and ½ tablespoon of sugar. Add both to the bowl. The sugar and glycerin help create larger bubbles and make them last longer.


Note that your homemade bubble bath will not create bubbles as large and frothy as a store-bought one.

, Essential oils are not necessary, but they can help make your bath more aromatic, pleasant, and relaxing through aromatherapy. Here are some ideas:


Chamomile
Lavender
Rose geranium
Sandalwood
Vanilla

, Using a fork or spoon, gently stir your ingredients together. Do not over-stir your ingredients, or the soap will begin to bubble and foam.

, Pour your bubble bath mixture into a seal-able container—use a funnel if you can to. You can use anything for your container that can be closed tightly, such as: mason jars, glass bottles with screw on caps, or glass bottles with corks.


Personalize your bubble bath bottle by making a label for it.
Embellish your bottle by decorating it with stick-on gems or tying string around it.
The glycerin may settle to the bottom of the container. This is normal, because it is heavier than both the soap and water. Simply give your bottle or jar a little shake and swirl before you use your bubble bath., You will need to wait 24 hours before using your bubble bath. This allows the mixture to cure., Vanilla-honey bubble bath is popular, and it is not difficult to see why. It combines the sweetness of both honey and vanilla extract. It also uses almond oil, making it rich and nourishing. Here is what you will need:½ cup (112.50 milliliters) light almond oil
½ cup (112.50 milliliters) mild liquid hand soap or body soap
¼ cup (56.25 milliliters) honey
1 egg white
1 tablespoon vanilla extract

, You can add some dried lavender inside your bubble bath bottle. It will help add a relaxing aroma and color the bubbles. Here's what you will need to make some lavender bubble bath:1 cup (225 milliliters) clear, unscented dish soap
2/3 cup (150 milliliters) liquid glycerin
4 tablespoons water
2 teaspoons salt
5 to 15 drops of your favorite essential oil (consider using a scent that compliments lavender)
Several stems of dried lavender

, You can create a bubble bath that is reminiscent of orange creamsicles using a combination of orange-scented soaps and extracts. After you have mixed all of the ingredients together, you will need to let the mixture rest for 24 hours before using it. Here is what you will need:½ cup (112.50 milliliters) Castile soap (consider using an orange-scented one)
¼ cup (56.25 milliliters) distilled water
¼ cup (56.25 milliliters) glycerin
1 tablespoon granulated sugar
1 tablespoon orange extract
1 tablespoon vanilla extract

, You can create your own, personalized scent by combining essential oils and adding them to your bubble bath bottle. Be sure to stir the bubble bath mixture before using it to combine all of the essential oils. Here are some blends:Lavender-Lemon: 5 drops lavender, 4 drops lemon, and 1 drop chamomile
Citrus-Floral: 5 drops bergamot, 4 drops orange, and 1 drop rose geranium, ylang ylang, or jasmine.
Lavender and Spice: 5 drops lavender, 4 drops patchouli or sandalwood, 1 drop clove (not recommended for sensitive skin)
Rose Dream: 3 drops rose absolute, 2 drops palmarosa, 1 drop rose geranium
Cool and Refreshing: 5 drops eucalyptus, 5 drops peppermint
Relaxing Lavender: 5 drops lavender, 5 drops bergamot
Calming Rose: 6 drops lavender, 3 drops geranium, 3 drops rose

, Put the plug into the drain and start running the water. Use a temperature that you are comfortable with. Let the water run for a few minutes. Do not fill the entire tub just yet.

, Measure out about ¼ cup (56.25 milliliters) of your bubble bath mixture and pour it into the tub. Be sure that you are pouring it under the running water; this will help the bubble bath to foam up. You should see rich, frothy bubbles taking shape in your tub.

, Let the water run until it is as deep as you like it. Remember, the deeper the water is, the longer it will retain its heat.

, To help fluff the bubbles up even more, stick your hand into the water and move it back and forth quickly. It is okay if you splash the water about. After a while you should see the bubbles begin to foam up even more.


Keep in mind, however, that your homemade bubble bath may not produce as many bubbles as a store-bought one.

, Lean back against the wall of the tub and sit in the water. You can choose to read a book or simply close your eyes and relax. Do this for approximately 20 to 30 minutes.

Fill it enough so that you submerge most of your body in the water., Two cups (473 g) of Epsom salt is a standard amount to use in a bath. This amount will work for just about anyone, but you can tailor the amount of Epsom salt you use to your body weight. The quantity of Epsom salt you should use based on your weight is:


1/2 cup (170 g) for children that are 60lbs and under
1 cup (340 g) for people between 60 and 100lbs
1 ½ cup (354.9 g) for people between 100-150lbs
2 cups (473 g) for people between 150-200lbs
An additional ½ cup for each every 50lbs

, Using a dry brush helps increase the detoxification that Epsom salt provides. The dry brush opens the pores, allowing the skin to absorb the salt. Scrub all over your body, including your face, but focus on any problem areas you may have. Scrub for about 5 minutes during your bath.You may want to use a separate loofah on your face if you have a rash on your body.
Problem areas could mean sore muscles, rashes, etc.

, Stay in the bath between 15 and 40 minutes. If you soak for 40 minutes, the first 20 is for your body to detoxify, and the second 20 is when your skin absorbs the Epsom salt. Soaking for less than 40 minutes will be beneficial, though."

If you are using essential oils instead of soap making fragrance oils, make sure that they are skin safe.
Do not use candle-making fragrance oils. They are not the same thing, nor are they skin-safe.

, A great choice would be ground oatmeal because of how beneficial it is for skin, especially acne-prone skin.You can also use other exfoliants as well, such as ground apricot seeds, which you can get in the soap making section of an arts and crafts store. Plan on using about 1 tablespoon of your desired exfoliant., Keep stirring until the color and texture are consistent. Scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl often. If you added in an exfoliant, be aware that it may settle. This is normal., Use the rubber spatula to help scrape the bowl clean so that you don't waste any of your soap base. You can find soap making molds in the soap making aisle of an arts and crafts shop. You can also find them in online stores that specialize in soap making supplies.

Make sure that the soap is less than 145°F (63°C) before pouring it into plastic molds, or the molds may warp., This will bring any air bubbles to the surface.

Give your hair time to cool down before stepping outside, especially if it is very hot or humid out.",How to Straighten Hair Without Frizz," Use shampoos and conditioners that contain the word ""smoothing"" or that are designed to fight/prevent frizz. They will give your hair extra moisture, and prevent it from becoming too dry. Dryness can often appear as frizz. Comb the conditioner through your hair, then rinse it out well., If you can't get one, try to find one that's at least a boar bristle and nylon mix. Plastic brushes tend to cause static, which leads to frizz. Boar bristle brushes help polish and smooth your hair better., You can also apply a little bit of moisturizing oil into your hair while it is still wet. This will help nourish your hair and keep it smooth while you straighten it. After you are done straightening, you can apply a little bit of oil to smooth down any remaining frizz., Steel plates can damage your hair by tugging and pulling on the strands. If you have curly hair, however, you may need something tougher; in this case, choose a gold or titanium flatiron.Don't get anything that is wider than 1½ inches (3.81 centimeters). If the flatiron is too wide, you won't be able to reach the roots of your hair.

, You should also give your hair time to cool down before you apply it. Avoid products that contain too many silicones and oils. Instead, give your brush a spray with some light hold hair spray, then pass it through your hair.If you must apply some oil or serum, go for a natural product, and focus it on the ends of your hair.

, If you can, use a specialized shampoo and conditioner that's meant for smoothing hair and taming frizz. Make sure that you do this well ahead of time, as your hair will need to be perfectly dry before you straighten it.

, When you towel dry your hair, don't rub the towel vigorously across your hair; this will only bring out your hair's natural curl and give you more work.Instead, gently pat and squeeze your hair dry with an absorbent towel, preferably microfiber. Microfiber towels are much gentler on the hair because they don't rip or tear your hair, like regular towels can.Ripped, torn hair can look frizzy.

, A heat protectant of sorts would also be a great idea. Apply the cream throughout your hair, focusing on the ends, which tend to get dry/damaged the most. If you have thin hair or short hair, you will probably only need a dime-sized amount. If you have thick hair or long hair, start with a quarter-sized amount.


Don't apply too much! Doing so will weigh down your hair and cause it to become limp once dry.

, Always point the nozzle downwards towards your hair; this will help the cuticles on your hair to lie flat. Pull a round, bristle brush through your hair as you blow dry it. This will help straighten it and give you less work later on.Consider switching between the hairdryer's hot and cold settings to give your hair a break from all that heat.
You can shake the hairdryer to help your hair dry faster, but always keep the nozzle pointed down.Never straighten your hair while it is wet. Doing so can damage your hair. Always blow dry it first (or let it air dry).

, It will be much easier to work with smaller sections than huge chunks of hair. You will also get a sleeker, smoother result. Simply pull the top half of your hair into a bun at the top of your hair, and secure it with a claw clip. If you have very thick hair, you might want to pull up two-thirds to three-fourths of your hair up into a bun.

, Even with a heat protectant, high temperatures can damage your hair—and damaged hair often looks frizzy. Don't use the highest setting; instead, set the temperature somewhere between 300 and 350°F (150 and 177°C). If you have thicker hair, you can use a higher temperature, but using a gold or titanium plated flatiron would be better.Avoid going past 420°F (215°C), as this is when the keratin in your hair breaks down, which can lead to split ends and damage; remember, damaged hair often looks frizzy.Some research has shown that the ideal temperature for straightening hair is 365°F (185°C)., Use a brush to pull a 1 to 2-inch (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) wide section of hair as taut as you can. Use your free hand to clamp the flatiron down onto the section, close to your roots. Pull the flatiron down the length of your hair in a single, fluid motion. Repeat 1 to 2 more times, if necessary.


Avoid using a comb; use a good, bristle brush instead. Combs tend to cause too much static and split-ends on dry hair.If you pull your hair taut, you won't have to pass the flatiron over it more than once or twice. If you find that you have to pass over your hair repeatedly, you might not be pulling it taut enough., Once the entire bottom layer of your hair is down, undo the clip, and let down the rest of your hair. Continue straightening your hair using the same technique.


If you have very thick hair, let down another one-fourth or one-third of your hair instead.

, Ideally, you should use only a spray, but thicker hair might need a little bit of oil or serum to smooth down any frizz.To avoid using too much product, apply some spray to your hairbrush, them gently comb your hair. Use your fingers to apply some serum or oil to the ends of your hair, where frizz tends to happen the most.

, As your hair cools, the style will begin to set. If you rush out too soon, your hair will be more likely to frizz up again."

A cool rinse ensures that your hair follicle is closed tightly and minimizes hair loss., Use a wide tooth comb to detangle your hair before drying. Begin at the ends of your strands and work your way up to your scalp. Do not tug too hard on any tangles in your hair., Before blow drying your hair you should apply a heat protecting spray. Hold the spray bottle about a foot from your head and spritz your wet hair. Make sure to cover the entire surface area.Heat protection spray can be found in the haircare aisle of most general and beauty stores.
Select a heat protection spray that can be used on wet and dry hair.

, Avoid using a round brush to dry your hair if you intend to straighten your hair. Trade your round brush for a paddle brush. This will guide the hair into a straighter position., Set the straight hair with the cool setting on your hair drying. Heat is helpful when you are styling hair. The cool setting on the hair dryer helps to keep that style for hours., Before you apply more heat to your hair with the hair straightener, spritz the strands with the heat protection spray.

Regularly massaging your scalp, let it sit for 20 minutes.,
Rinse out the milk, and shampoo and condition as usual.,
Let your hair dry.",How to Straighten Hair with Milk," Any (fresh) milk will do, but the thicker the milk is, the better. Though it's questionable, some believe that coconut milk has extra straightening power.









If you do use coconut milk, combine it with lemon juice from half a lemon. Let it sit in the fridge for an hour until a cream forms on top. That's the stuff you want to use on your hair! Follow the rest of the directions as normal.
You could also add a bit of honey, strawberry, or banana to your mixture. Just stir it up well and take in the extra moisturizing powers of the honey or fruit (and the better smell).
Powdered milk is a cheaper alternative -- and it won't go bad as quickly!;
, Dry or damp hair is ideal. Here's what to keep in mind:









Thoroughly saturate your entire head. You don't have half-straight, half-curly hair!
Spray from root to tip, being sure the tips are just as milky as the roots.
Spray on the top, flip your head over, and spray from the bottom. Then spray from the middle and sides, especially if you have layers.

, This keeps any of your hair from resting in a curled position and prevents any milky snarls -- that definitely won't smell good tomorrow.








, The milk needs time to soak into each shaft of hair and weigh it down, straightening it. This is a great time to exfoliate, paint your toes, or shave your legs!








, Rinse your hair out a little more diligently than you normally would so you don't end up smelling like sour milk afterwards. Then continue your usual routine.








, If you have somewhat wavy hair this will make your hair straighter, but if you have kinky, curly hair it may not work as well. However, it is still nourishing and will define your waves and curls if it doesn't straighten it."

, Do not rub the hair too hard as this can cause breakage and frizz. Simply squeeze sections of the hair with a towel to remove excess water.








, These combs typically have wider teeth so they will detangle your hair without snagging. Follow with a finer-toothed comb to smooth the hair further.








, The pigtails should start near the nape of your neck; higher pigtails will cause more kinking in the hair as it dries. Secure with elastic hair bands.








, Every 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm), wrap an elastic hair band around each pigtail. Don’t wrap too tightly or you will create bumps in the hair as it dries. You should end up with what look like “striped” pigtails.







, Secure with a few bobby pins. The silk will help keep your hair from tangling as it dries and will also help reduce frizz.









You can sleep comfortably in this style, or do it first thing in the morning if you don’t have anywhere to be for a few hours.

, Comb through with a wide-toothed comb. Avoid using a bristle brush, at it might encourage frizzing.

Use a wide tooth comb to comb through your hair, removing any small tangles.",How to Straighten Hair Naturally2," The heavier, or more moisturizing, the conditioner you use, the more it will weigh down your curls and help your hair hang longer and straighter.


Do not towel-dry your hair. The friction from rubbing your hair against the towel will create frizz and encourage curling. Keep your hair soaking wet for the following steps.

, This will add extra weight to bear down on the curls and prevent frizz. If you prefer to avoid commercial conditioners, consider applying a natural oil.









Thicker hair would benefit from a thicker oil, such as argan or olive oil. Thinner or finer hair would do better with a lighter oil, such as grape seed oil, or coconut oil.
Remember to start with a small amount of oil: in the math of hair, it's always easier to add than to subtract.

, If your hair is particularly thick, you may need to divide your hair into six parts.








, Brush this section so it is free of any tangles, making sure that the leave-in oils are evenly distributed.








, Keeping one hand on your brush, use the other to gently insert bobby pins every 2 inches (5.1 cm) to secure the section of hair to your scalp.








, Depending on the length of your hair, the section may wrap all the way across the side, bottom, and opposite side of your scalp. Use as many bobby pins as necessary to keep the section secure.








, Secure the hair to the scalp with bobby pins placed every two inches.








, If your hair begins to dry, apply more water with a spray bottle, or by splashing water on your hair with your hands.

, If you find it uncomfortable to sleep with the bobby pins, try wrapping a towel lightly around your head to pad your scalp.


If you develop a headache, you may have placed the bobby pins in too tightly against the scalp. You may want to experiment with different brands to find ones which are the most comfortable against your head.

, Unless your hair is extremely thick, it will be mostly dried. Don’t pull too vigorously or you may damage your hair.








, Avoid using a brush, as it will increase volume and frizz.









If your hair is particularly dry or thick, you may wish to apply a second layer of a leave-in conditioner or oil to your hair, rubbing the product between your palms and smoothing evenly over your hair, from the roots to the tips.

, Apply a leave-in conditioner or natural oil to wet hair, distributing evenly from root to tip. Comb through your hair with a wide-toothed comb.








, Use a tail comb to separate sections of hair. Place a large roller on the section of hair near the ends and wrap the ends up and over the roller. Roll the hair toward the scalp.









Use the largest rollers you can find. Velcro and mesh rollers often come in very large sizes. although if you plan to sleep in the rollers overnight, you may prefer to use soft foam rollers.

, Use bobby pins or plastic clips to secure the roller. The weight of the roller hanging slightly from your head will help to straighten the hair at the base of your scalp, which will prevent too much body at your crown.








, You can blow dry your hair if you’re in a hurry, but use the low setting to help prevent damage. Air drying the hair will allow the tension of rolling to gradually pull the hair straighter.


If you plan to sleep in the rollers overnight, wrap your head in a smooth scarf, ideally silk. This will help prevent friction between your hair and the pillow, which will lead to frizz and may dislodge the curlers.
Do not go to bed with your hair covered by a shower cap. Shower caps are made of plastic and are designed to prevent moisture going in or out. This will prevent your hair from drying overnight.

, Do not pull the rollers out of your hair, as this may cause damage; gently unroll them and allow them to drop from your hair.








, Avoid using a bristled brush, as it may cause your hair to frizz or fluff up. A detangling comb is a great option for this step.








, Smooth the coconut oil across your hair. This will help seal the hair cuticle and keep it smooth and shiny.

Distribute mask throughout hair.,
Cover your hair with a shower cap.,
Apply heat.,
Wash with gentle shampoo and warm water.,
Comb straight.",How to Straighten Hair Naturally4," Coconut milk is high in fat, fiber, and nutrients like vitamin E that make it excellent for moisturizing hair. Combined with the super-moisturizing power of extra virgin olive oil and the acid of lemon juice, this mask will help relax hair.People with artificially colored hair should avoid using lemon juice on their hair, as it will cause color to fade more quickly.

, In a separate bowl, mix 3 tablespoons (44.4 ml) cornstarch with 4 tablespoons of lemon juice until a smooth slurry forms.








, Over medium heat, whisk the mixture constantly until it thickens. Once it reaches the consistency of a bottled conditioner, remove from heat and allow to cool slightly.








, You can use a pastry brush or a paintbrush to make application easier, or just use your fingers to work the mask evenly throughout your hair. Make sure your hair is coated thoroughly with the mask for best results.








, If you don’t have a shower cap handy, you can also wrap your hair with plastic wrap. Wrapping your hair will help it retain heat, which will assist in relaxing curls.

, If you have a hairdryer, use it on the low setting until hair is warm. Alternately, you can warm a damp towel in the microwave and wrap the warm towel around your hair.








, Avoid shampoos that have heavy surfactants or sulfates, as they will roughen your hair’s cuticles and undo the moisturizing and smoothing action of the mask. Follow with a deep conditioner.

, Use progressively finer combs to completely detangle and gently stretch your hair.









Coconut milk is different from coconut water (which is thinner) and cream of coconut (which is sweetened and thickened). Make sure to purchase the right stuff!
This mask will relax and loosen curls, but if you have very curly hair it may not entirely straighten your hair. However, the extra moisture provided by the mask will also help protect your hair if you use heat appliances.

This color-safe mask will deep-condition and help relax your hair., You can use a fork or potato masher to mash the bananas. For a smoother mix, use a blender or food processor. Mash until there are no remaining chunks of banana.








, Mix thoroughly. The mask should be about the same consistency as bottled conditioner.








, This mask is a little runny, so it is probably best to work over the sink or even in the shower to avoid mess. Make sure to smooth the mask all the way down to the tips of your hair.








, You can also wrap your hair in plastic wrap or even a grocery bag. Allow mask to sit for one hour.

, Thoroughly rinse your hair! This mask is quite sticky, so make sure your hair is entirely rinsed out. Follow with conditioner.

",How to Straighten and Maintain Damaged Hair,"









High quality flat irons are crucial. Unfortunately, this is the one thing where pricier tends to be better. That doesn't necessarily mean that you need to spend $700 on a designer flat iron. Whatever you do decide to buy, make sure that it has thin ceramic plates. One inch gives you much better control and straightens better than larger 1-1/2 or 2 inch plated ones.
You'll also need a wide-tooth plastic comb - you can get one anywhere for about $2 - a round brush with both natural and nylon bristles, and a thin plastic comb with a long pointed handle for parting your hair. Buy large metal hair clips - the kind for styling. Look to a beauty supply store for these if the drugstore doesn't have any good ones. Thin hair ties are also very helpful. Try to get the kind without any metal in them, as those snag easily.
Use a good moisturizing shampoo and conditioner. Infusium 23 is great. Matrix and Biolage are also excellent, but a little more expensive. Even if you are loyal to your favorite brand, Infusium 23's leave-in conditioner is an absolute essential for anyone who straightens their hair. It has a texture like water and leaves no residue if used properly.;
, Never scrub, but gently massage your scalp. Pay special attention to your hairline - particularly around and behind your ears - because this is where your hair gets especially dirty. When you're satisfied, comb the shampoo through with your fingers to distribute it to the ends, but keep in mind that there's no need to vigorously wash the bottom half of the hair, especially if it's damaged. Be sure to rinse it all out, and be thorough but always gentle. Any trace of shampoo left in your hair will only contribute to dryness. Rinse for a full four minutes.








, Don't use too much, just enough to coat it evenly. Please, please, please do not condition the roots of your hair. The bottom half is all you need to do unless you're into major greasiness. The first time, condition normally, comb it through with your fingers and rinse it out. The second time use a (store-bought) deep conditioner mixed with your regular conditioner and leave it in for a while - tie your hair up to keep it out of your face and get your shaving/body scrubbing/whatever out of the way, and rinse it out. The last time you condition rinse it out with cool water (or as cold as you can tolerate). This will really help seal in the moisture and add shine. Rinse as thoroughly as you can! Accumulated conditioner makes your hair feel dull, heavy and greasy, guaranteed.








, Use only on the bottom half of your hair. Less is definitely more here. Use too much, and your hair will feel like there's a light spray in it. For the best results, put some in a spray bottle. A couple spritzes on each section is all you need. If not, pour a very little bit onto your hand and smooth it through your ends. Comb it through with a wide tooth comb.








, Make sure that it's oil free and not too heavy, and again, keep it well away from your roots. Squeeze it through between the palms of your hands.








, The part will stay in place best if you make it while the hair is wet.








, You can experiment with the time to see what works best for you.








, Tie most of your hair up into a ponytail right on top of your head, leaving just the bottom layer hanging down. Use the clips to get stray chunks of hair out of the way. Blow out the bottom layer of hair, really pulling it taut and away from the head. It doesn't need to be pin straight just yet, so don't stress out too much here. The idea is to make the flat ironing easy.








, Go section-by-section as thoroughly as you can. Don't do huge pieces at a time. Pull it taut, and go firmly but gently. Going through your hair super fast will snag it and lead to split ends, but going through it too slowly will burn it. The great thing about small flat irons is that they're very versatile - you can go pin straight, flip the ends, or just give your hair some body where you need it. Even if you want to make your hair as straight as possible, using strokes with a slight inward curve looks the most natural. With enough practice, you'll find your own technique.








, Keep in mind that the smaller the layer the more thoroughly you can straighten it and the better the results will be. Pay special attention to your bangs and the back of the head.








, Comb all your hair forward and clip it up section-by-section with bobby pins. Make sure not to bend it in any way that goes against the style that you've so toiled for. You want to clip it to the side of your head in a circular pattern so that it looks kind of like a beehive. Pile it up, not to the side. When it's all up, secure it with a silk scarf to keep everything in, and you can sleep on it with no worries.

Pick out a good cream.,
Get your hair wet.,
Smooth in the cream or hairdressing.,
Let your hair dry.",How to Straighten African American Hair1," Silicone creams and other hairdressing products are made with oils like petroleum and lanolin or silicons like dimethicone or cyclomethicone. This may be the simplest method for straightening your hair, but it's important to pick out the right product. Some creams and hair-dressings make your hair look weighed down or greasy. Read some reviews before you decide which product to pick up at the store.


Oil-based products are easier on your hair than products with silicones, but all creams and hair dressings will wash out with shampoo, and they won't cause long-term damage like other straightening techniques.;
, Creams and hair dressings should be applied to damp hair for best effect. Shampoo your hair, rinse it out, and pat it dry with a towel to get it ready for the cream application.

, Depending on the length of your hair, pour a liberal amount of cream or hairdressing into the palm of your hand. Rub your hands together and then apply it to your hair, working from the roots to the tips to ensure every strand gets covered.

Condition your hair.,
Get your hair wet.,
Brush out the first section.,
Apply a heat protectant.,
Dry the first section.,
Continue brushing and drying sections of hair.",How to Straighten African American Hair2," For any hair-straightening method you use that requires using heat to straighten your hair, it's important to condition it a few days beforehand. Heating dry hair will cause it to get brittle and may even make it break. Use a good deep conditioner on your hair about 2-3 days before you want to straighten it.


Olive oil or coconut oil-based deep conditioners are great for your hair. Consider using these chemical-free options.
You can also use a high-quality silicone-based conditioner a few days before you straighten your hair.

, Don't shampoo it, just wet your hair when you're ready to straighten it, and blot it with a towel until it's damp but not dripping wet.

, You're going to blow your hair dry piece by piece. Start with one section and use a round brush to brush it straight, starting at the roots and brushing all the way to the tips. Make sure it's tangle-free.

, Smooth it all over your hair, from roots to tips, to protect each strand from the damaging heat of the hair dryer. This will also help your hair stay straight for a longer period of time.

, Take your brush and position it at the roots of the section of hair you're blowing out. Turn on your hair dryer and position it right next to the brush, at the roots of the hair section. Move the brush and the blow dryer down the hair section to the tips, slowly drying and straightening the hair at the same time.Don't move down the shaft of hair too quickly; you want to do it slowly, so the hair has time to dry.
Use either the warm or hot setting on your hair dryer for best effect.

Start conditioning early.,
Get your hair wet.,
Apply heat protectant.,
Comb out a section of hair.,
Straighten the hair.,
Continue straightening your hair in small sections.",How to Straighten African American Hair3," Hair straightening irons are particularly damaging to hair, because they apply direct heat. That means you've got to start conditioning your hair a few days or even weeks in advance to get it ready for the hot iron. Use a good conditioner in the week or two beforehand when you wash your hair, and do a deep conditioning treatment a few days before straightening day to make your hair soft and ready for heat.


If you want, you can deep condition on the day you want to straighten your hair. Just make sure to rinse it all out before you start the straightening process.
You can also blow dry your hair before straightening if your hair is extra kinky. Follow the steps in the previous method and skip straight to the flat ironing technique., Go ahead and wet it so you can dry and straighten it at the same time with your flat iron. If you used the blow dry method first, don't wet it again.

, Work it in from the roots all the way to the tips, since using direct heat on your hair can cause damage. Products made with Moroccan oil and argan oil are great for your hair and result in a sleek, shiny finish.

, Choose a small section that you want to straighten first. Use a comb to comb it out straight, then smooth it out with your fingers.

, Close your flat iron around the section of hair at the roots. Pull it down the shaft of the hair until you've straightened and dried it all the way to the tips. If the hair is still curly, go over it once more with the straightening iron.


You can apply more heat protectant serum as you go if your hair looks like it's getting dried out.
Don't go over the same shaft of hair too many times. This can make your hair start to get brittle.

, Doing a little at a time gives you control over how much heat you're applying to your hair, reducing the risk of damage. Take your time and go over each strand of hair until your entire mane is straight, sleek and glossy.

Get a hair relaxing treatment.,
Try a keratin treatment.,
Consider Japanese hair straightening.",How to Straighten African American Hair4," Hair relaxers work by treating your hair with an alkaline agent that breaks down the hair follicle to straighten it. This treatment is effective and permanent. The downside is that it can also be pricey, and the chemicals can cause long-term damage to your hair and even your skin.


Do research to make sure you go to a good salon to get your hair relaxed. Strong chemicals in the wrong hands can wreak havoc on your hair.
Don't get a straightening treatment done on freshly washed hair. Go several days without washing first so your hair has some natural protection from the chemicals.
You can also get a texturizing treatment, which is similar to a relaxing treatment but with less severe chemicals and a softer, wavier effect.

, Keratin treatments last about 6 weeks, after which they wash out. They leave the hair looking straight and sleek, but some treatments contain formaldehyde. If you're worried about using chemicals on your hair and skin, skip this one.

, In recent years this technique has become more popular. It's a sulfer-based treatment that is said to be less harsh on the hair, with permanent effects. If you're interested in this treatment, be sure to go to an experienced beautician.

Get the largest curlers you can find. If possible, find some curlers that are about the same size as soda cans.If you are not opposed to using heat on your hair, then using large hot curlers can speed up this process. Otherwise, go for some foam rollers and be aware that you will need to leave them in for quite a while.;
, You will need to start with damp hair, so you may just want to shampoo and condition your hair before you begin. If you do not have time to wash your hair, then spritzing it with a bit of water will also make your hair damp.









Make sure that your hair is damp throughout, not just in a couple of places.
Remember that your hair should be damp, not dripping wet. If you decide to wash your hair, dry it with a towel when you are done and let it air dry a bit as well before you put it into the rollers.

, Using some hair clips, comb out your hair and divide it into two equal sections. One section should contain hair from the top of your head and one should contain hair from the back and lower sides of your head. Use a clip to secure the top section to the top of your head.









Sectioning off your hair will allow you to put the bottom section of your hair into rollers first and then work on the top section of your hair.
If you have extra thick hair, then you may need to divide your hair into three or four equal sections.

, Focusing on the bottom section of your hair first, put your hair into rollers. Start with the ends of your hair and slowly roll the roller towards your head and then secure it. After you finish with one section, move on to the next and keep going until all of your hair is in rollers.







, The rollers will need to stay in your hair until your hair dries, which can take several hours if you have long, thick hair. If you put the rollers in your hair at night, then you can just sleep in them. Otherwise, expect to have them in for at least a few hours.

, Use a brush or comb to get all of the tangles out of your hair. Then, divide your hair into two low ponytails on the sides of your head. Secure each one loosely with a rubber band a little below your ears.


Remember that the ponytails should not be high, but low and loose.

, Keep securing loose rubber bands around the hair in your ponytails so that there is a rubber band about every inch or so.If your hair is extra curly, then you may want to place one every half inch.


Do not make the rubber bands so tight that they will leave an indentation. Just make them tight enough to secure the hair.

, It will take a while for your hair to dry and become straight from the rubber bands. You can sleep with your hair secured with the rubber bands or just leave them in for a few hours. When you are certain that your hair is dry, then you can take them out.

As you comb your hair, start at the roots and move downwards. When you reach the end of your hair, hold each section taut for several seconds.You can speed up this process by sitting in front of a fan, but you will have to comb your hair non-stop until it is dry if you use a fan.Keep combing until your hair is completely dry and straight.

",How to Straighten Hair Quickly," Clean hair straightens better and doesn't get a burning smell so easily. Unless you have really oily hair, you don't need to wash it again if you have already done so the previous day. If it's been longer than one day, wash it again. If you don't have time you may use a dry shampoo.;
, It may take a moment, but it is so much better for your hair. Spritz some hair straightening serum and brush it through your hair to protect it from the hair heat of the straightener.








, Do not exceed the temperature you are comfortable with. As a guide, try a low heat setting for fair, thin hair, a high heat setting for thick, curly hair, and a medium heat setting for something in between. If your hair damages easily, don't risk ruining it, and wait the extra minute or so for it to heat up. One good hairstyle is not worth months of repairing damaged, broken hair.

, In most people's hair, you can normally find natural layers that want to stay together. Put up all but the bottom layer in a clip or a hair tie.








, Do this layer, and possibly the next, quickly, and only go over them once. No one will see these unless you are putting up your hair, or it will cause a puff to the top layers because of a pony mark or something. Once you are done with the bottom, let down another layer, and straighten it. Repeat until all of your hair is straight. This actually does save time because you will be straightening smaller sections at a higher heat, thus requiring less time on each section.









Alternatively, straighten your bangs and tie the rest up in a ponytail. Straighten your ponytail until it's completely straight. Then, untie the ponytail and straighten the flaws (ponytail mark/bump).

You can also add texturizer to your hair. This can help straight hair from falling flat.Depending on the length and texture of your hair, you may want to use a different hair product. For example, volumizing mousse is better for stick-straight or fine hair. Styling cream may help control frizz and flyaway hair for thicker hair., Once you have mousse throughout your hair, use both hands to scrunch up your hair. Do this all over your head. Your hair won’t really hold the waves at this point, but it will help your hair from going stick-straight.








, Take some time to let your hair air dry. If you have really long hair, this might take a while. You can speed it up somewhat by turning up the heat in your house or going into the sunshine for a bit.

, Spritz texturizer throughout your hair. This hair product will help your hair hold waves in it.

, Separate your hair into 4 or 5 chunks. Braid each one loosely. You can use a rubber band to hold each end. You can also just scrunch or twist the end of the braid and it might hold on its own (especially if you’ve used enough texturizer).

If you have short hair, use less hair product in your hair. Otherwise, your hair can get weighted down too much.Find a strong hold mousse to get maximum hold throughout the day., This size of curling iron will allow you to make a slightly tighter curl in your hair. The heat from the curling iron will be able to reach every strand of hair more easily this way. If you use a large-barreled curling iron, your hair will not hold the waves as well., Take the hair around the crown of your head and pin it up.

, A diffuser is an attachment to a hair dryer. It is round with prongs that come out of one end. The diffuser will reduce the velocity of the air coming from your hair dryer, which leaves your hair less frizzy. It will also help with wave and curl formation., Use a medium to cool setting on your hair dryer. It’s best to use the cool setting, as this temperature will “set” your hair better.
Tilt your head upside down or sideways. Place sections of your hair into the diffuser and move the diffuser up towards your scalp. Let your hair get about 80 to 90% dry.

, Each chunk of hair will be about 1-2 inches wide. It might help to pin up some of the hair around the crown of your head so you can work with the hair underneath.The bigger the sections, the wavier your hair will be. If you have very small sections of hair, your hair will end up more as curls.

, Roll the end of the section around your index finger and thumb. This will make a loop. Then keep rolling the hair around the loop up to the scalp.








, When you’ve curled the entire section of hair up to your scalp, use a bobby pin to keep the curl against your head.








, Pin up the rest of your hair in the same manner. You’ll have lots of bobby pins in your hair. Be sure to pin them against your head so that they don’t stick out and poke into your head.

A larger barrel will allow you to run the curling iron through sections of your hair more easily and much more quickly than a curling iron with a smaller barrel.If you only have access to a curling iron with a smaller barrel, .75 to 1 inch in diameter, you can still use it to straighten your hair. But it may take more time due to the smaller barrel size.;
, Look for a curling iron that is made of ceramic and/or tourmaline. Ceramic irons are ideal because they help to disperse heat through your hair more evenly. Tourmaline irons are also good for controlling frizz and for locking moisture in your hair when you style it with heat.Many professional grade curling irons are made with ceramic or tourmaline. You may be able to get a more affordable curling iron that is only partly ceramic or tourmaline if you are on a budget.

, You should also check that the curling iron comes with several heat settings so you can control how much heat you are applying to your hair. This will ensure you do not burn or damage your hair when you use the curling iron.If you have fine hair or hair that is color treated, you should use a low heat setting of below 200 degrees. If you have curly, thick hair, you can use a higher heat setting of 200-300 degrees.
Make sure you pay attention to how your hair responds to the heat of the curling iron. If you notice a burning smell coming from your hair, the temperature is likely too high. Never go above 400 degrees as this can damage your hair, no matter what hair type you have.

, You should prep your hair for the curling iron by washing and conditioning it in the shower. You should use a shampoo that will give your hair moisture and does not leave residue in your hair.








You should also use a small amount of conditioner on the ends of your hair so you do not put too much conditioner in your hair. Too much conditioner can make it more difficult for your hair to stay straight or hold any styles.

, Apply a heat protectant gel or spray while your hair is still wet. Run the heat protectant from the root to the ends of your hair, scrunching your hair with your fingers. This will protect your hair from heat damage and prevent frizz.








You may also want to apply a hair mousse to your wet hair, especially if your hair is lacking in volume and body. Run the mousse from the roots to the ends.

, You should avoid trying to straighten wet hair, as it can damage your hair and create split ends. Your hair can also become frizzy and rough looking due to heat being applied to wet hair. Make sure you dry your hair well with a blow dryer so you are straightening hair that is prepared and ready for the curling iron.








You should blow dry your hair by flipping your hair over and running the blow dryer down to the ends of your hair. Move the blow dryer around your hair, dispersing the heat throughout, until your hair is completely dry., Turn the curling iron to the right heat setting for your hair. It may take a few minutes for the curling iron to warm up.









You should also position yourself in front of a mirror so you can see what your hands are doing and how your hair looks as you straighten it. You may also place a hair clip on a table in front of you so it is easy to access.

, You should straighten your hair in stages, starting with the bottom layers first. This will ensure you do not miss any strands of hair and that your hair appears uniform when you are done straightening it. Clip back the top layers of your hair so you can access the bottom layers.








Even if you have short hair, you should still clip back the top layers so you can access the bottom layers. This will allow you access each layer of your hair more easily.

, Hold a section of hair at the nape of your neck with your hand. Then, open the clamp of the curling iron and place the upper part of the hair between the barrel and the clamp. Keep a firm grip. Slowly pull the curling iron downward, through your hair. Hold the clamp shut with your hand as you do this.








Pull the curling iron all the way to the ends of your hair. Then, release the clamp. You should have a straightened section of hair.
Repeat these steps for the bottom layer of your hair. Make sure you keep a firm grip on the clamp as you run the curling iron down to the ends of your hair.

, Once you have finished straightening the bottom layer, you should take the top layer of your hair out of the clip. Then, repeat the same steps on the top layer of hair using the curling iron.








You may need to straighten the shorter hairs around your face in smaller sections to ensure you catch all of the shorter hairs. Use the curling iron to straighten out the sections around your face for a full straight look.
Try to avoid going over the same section of hair multiple times, as this can damage your hair. Instead, pull the curling iron through and down your hair slowly and firmly to ensure you straighten the hair the first time through.

, Once you have straightened your hair completely, you should set your look in place with hairspray. Use a hairspray that will give your hair shine and prevent frizzing.








You may also run your hands through your hair lightly to give your hair volume and body. However, try not to touch your hair too often once you have straightened it, as this can make it appear messy and undo your perfect straight hair look.

",How to Straighten Curly Hair," To make the straightening process easier, wash and conditioner your hair before you attempt to run a flat iron through it. This will give you freshly washed hair that you can wear down for several days, as well as creating smoother hair to straighten. Try to choose an anti-frizz or smoothing shampoo and conditioner.When you apply conditioner to your hair, start at the ends of your hair and apply up to the middle of your hair -- you want to avoid applying conditioner to your roots. Then, take a wide tooth comb and run it through your hair to detangle it. This will make the combing process easier when you get out of the shower because curly hair can tangle easily. Then, allow the conditioner to sit in your hair for a few minutes before you rinse it out.
When your are in the shower, use luke warm water to wash your hair. Hot water can damage the cuticles in your hair and will result in dry or frizzy hair. When you have washed all of the soap and conditioner out of your hair, give it a quick rinse with cold water. This will add shine to your hair and help flatten it out.;
, Leave in conditioner can help moisturize your hair as well as provide strength and shine to your hair. After you have stepped out of the shower, apply a dollop of leave in conditioner to your hair, avoiding your roots. This will also help protect your hair from drying out since you will be using heat styling tools on it., In order to make the blow drying task easier, use a microfiber cloth or old t-shirt to remove excess water from your hair. Gently squeeze the water through your hair with the cloth until your hair is not sopping wet. Avoid rubbing your hair with the cloth as this can create frizziness, and try not to scrunch it either as this will shape your curls., Use a wide tooth comb and start at the ends of your hair, working your way up to the roots. Avoid using a brush as this can often snag hair, making it more prone to breakage.


If you combed your hair while in the shower, this process should be a lot easier. If your hair is still very tangled, consider spraying a detangler through your hair before you comb through it.

, You are about to use several heat styling tools, so you need to protect your hair to keep it from becoming damaged. You can use a serum, spray, or gel. Choosing one that is anti frizz and specifically designed for flat ironing hair will give you the best protection. Apply evenly all throughout your hair for the best protection.If you are looking for a natural product you can use argon oil -- this is especially good for thick or course hair. Try to avoid using products with silicone as these can weigh your hair down, making it look flat (if that is the look you are going for that is fine, but if you want some volume then avoid these products)., This step is probably going to take a while, because you want to make sure you hair is completely dry before you straighten it. Using a round bristle brush, pull it through your hair as you dry it. Point the blow dryer towards the brush, but keep it about six inches away from your brush so you don't apply too much heat. Do this until your hair is completely dry.To best protect your hair, don't use the highest heat setting on your blow dryer. In fact, consider alternating between the cool and warm settings on your blow dryer to prevent over heating your hair. Cool air on your hair can help add shine to it, so it's worth the time it takes.
Make sure you point the nozzle down when you are blow drying your hair. Avoid sticking it underneath your hair and pointing it upwards as this can create frizziness in your hair., Depending on the thickness and length of your hair, you'll need to section your hair off into three or four sections. Start by separating the bottom layer of your hair from the top layer. Once you have your bottom layer, twist up your top layer and clip it to the top of your head with a clip.The thickness of the sections is up to you, but you'll only want to put one inch sections of hair through your straightener, so keep that in mind as you are separating your hair.
As you finish a section of your hair, let another layer of your hair down and twist the rest back up. Continue to separate sections like this until you have let down all of your hair.

, Some people have difficulty straightening their hair simply because they are using the wrong type of flat iron. Ceramic straighteners are great for fine to normal hair types as they will help soften the hair. For curly hair, gold or titanium plates on the straightener are really your best option. Titanium helps produce both flat and sheen for curly hair.Titanium straighteners are also great for someone who straightens their hair often. This type of straightener withstands ultra high heat and corrosion, so it will last a long time.Use a straightener that is at most an inch and a half. Bigger straighteners are good for styling, but they will make the straightening process difficult.
When it comes to flat irons, don't be afraid to spend a little more to invest in a great iron. A good iron can last you for years, so try to avoid spending $15 on a flat iron. Also, never use a flat iron with plastic plates or plain metal. These don't distribute heat well and will take you extra time to straighten your hair.

, Now that you've sectioned off your hair, you can begin to straighten one inch pieces. Start at the front of your hair and move your way along your hair until you reach the other side of your head. To straighten your hair, take a one inch piece and hold it taut. Then, run the flat iron through your hair, starting from your roots and moving towards the end of your hair. Do this until you have straightened all of your hair.When straightening your hair, try to only run the straightener through a strand of hair once. This is why tension is key, because the tighter you pull your hair, the faster it will straighten.
If your hair is sizzling while you are straightening it, this could mean that you haven't completely dried it. Take the blow dryer and completely dry your hair before you straighten it again.
If you are able, use a lower heat setting on your flat iron. The highest settings are really designed for salon professionals, and can damage your hair if you don't properly protect it. Aim to stay between 300 and 350 degrees.Sometimes it is helpful to chase your flat iron after a comb. Take a comb and start at the roots of your hair. Gently run the comb down your hair and as you do so, follow the comb with your straightener. This can just help keep your hair flat and tangle free as you straighten it., Once you have straightened all of your hair, you can make any styling finishes your hair needs. If you want your ends to curl under, take your straightener and run it through the ends of your hair, gently curving it under so that your ends curl under. You can also straighten your bangs, or flip your ends outwards --- whatever you want to do to create the style you want.

, To hold your hair in place and create a shine, spritz or apply serum throughout your hair. This will help tame the frizziness and fly aways as well as give your hair an extra silkiness. You can also spray your hair with a light hairspray at the roots to keep it from frizzing up throughout the day., After you have gone through all of that trouble to straighten your hair, you probably want to maintain it as long as possible. To keep from damaging your hair, try to avoid completely re-straightening it every day. Go about three days and then repeat the process over again for straight hair. To maintain straight hair you can follow these steps:Use dry shampoo when it starts getting oily. If you want to wear your hair straight for a few days without having to wash it and repeat the process, apply dry shampoo to your roots when they start to look oily. You can also use baby powder to remove any oil or shine.
Avoid getting your hair wet. Because curly hair will easily kink back up if exposed to water, try to avoid humidity or water. When taking a shower, pin your hair up with clips and then wrap it in a towel or shower cap to keep excess humidity out.
Touch it up every so often. If you are wearing your hair straight for a few days, it's likely going to frizz up a little bit and it may begin to shape back into curls. To prevent this from happening, run a straightener through your hair every day or so, focusing on the problem areas. You don't need to completely straighten all of your hair or pin it up in sections -- just straighten the top layer or any pieces that are starting to curl.
Continue to apply serum to your hair. Serum can help smooth hair and will prevent extra frizziness. Every day after you straighten your hair, or when you wake up, apply serum to your hair. Then, spritz your roots with a light hairspray to prevent fly aways.
Pin your hair back on the last day. If your hair is looking really oily, you can use the last day as an opportunity to wear it in a cute undo. You can also just wear a headband or pin back your front pieces as those are probably the ones that have acquired the most moisture and oils throughout the day.

Grow your hair long.,
Invest in a good blow dryer.,
Nail down your blow-drying technique.",How to Keep Your Hair Straightened1," It's science -- the heavier your hair is, the more it will straighten out under its own weight. So if you want naturally straighter hair (not straight, straighter), grow it out. Shorter hair has more of a tendency to curl up.









That being said, don't avoid the salon and ignore your regular haircuts. Still go in every 2 or 3 months, but only get the ends trimmed. This will actually stimulate growth (cutting off the dead ends) and help your hair grow faster.;
, The only reason those salons that only do blow-drying (seriously?) exist is because very few of us own a good blow dryer. It may seem silly, but ""ionic"" may not just be a marketing ploy. If you see it on the box, buy it. It may prevent further hair damage.









""Ionic"" supposedly means that instead of the water molecule evaporating (like it normally does under the heat), the ionic blow dryers simply break it down, leaving the moisture in your hair. They also do the drying quicker, saving you time. If you blow dry often, they're worth the extra cost., You may think there's one way to blow dry your hair: point the blow dryer at your mop and go. But there's actually more to it to that and it's important that you do it correctly. There are two things you should get down pat:









Use the nozzle on the end -- it's there to protect your hair from the direct heat. And section your hair to keep it straighter, getting faster results.
A large round brush will help smooth out your hair from cuticle to end. It also magically will make it seem shinier as it smooths out your strands.

",How to Keep Your Hair Straightened2," Use your shampoo, conditioner, and straightening serum and follow your normal routine of lathering up. Bust out that nice hair dryer you just bought, the round brush, and get to work, starting from the nape of your neck.









You can now choose to either blow dry your hair or to straighten it with a flat iron, or both. If blow drying, take a wide brush and straighten your hair as your hair stylist would do. Watch out not to turn the blow dryer on maximum heat and not to keep it too close to your hair., This step may not be necessary if your hair responds well to blow-dryers and brushing. But if you have rather curly hair and tangles are common, give it an extra comb-through.









Always be gentle on your scalp. When you're brushing or combing, take extra care in not pulling or tugging on your follicles.

, You may think you're saving time in the long run, but when you take large sections, you just wind up going over them again. Keep your sections to about 1"" (2.5 cm) wide to get a more uniform, straightened-for-longer look. And you won't be exposing the strands to heat over and over -- just the one time.









If you have fine hair, keep the hair straightener on low; but thick and coarse hair can tolerate the medium and high settings. If you're curious, grab a tissue and test the flat iron on it. If it scorches, it's obviously too hot for you. And though it should go without saying, always, always, always use a heat protectant on your hair to defend your strands against the heat., You've invested in a good hair dryer and a good flat iron, so it's high time to invest in some good products. Get a hair spray you know you like and some anti-frizz spray or gel that contains silicone.









That's right, silicone. It's found in many haircare products. It minimizes frizz because it's water-resistant, and so it prevents humidity from entering the hair shaft and swelling it. Using a shampoo, conditioner, and styling serum all containing silicone will not only control frizz but also help with detangling and shine.,"

In terms of quality, authentic extensions are the better choice. They last longer and look more natural. However, authentic extensions are pricey and may not be within your budget.If you want longterm extensions, ones that you want woven or glued into your hair, you may want to spend the extra money on real extensions. For best results, get extensions directly from your stylist and have them designed for you. You want extensions to look natural, so you should have them colored and shaped for you hair type.If you're looking for extensions you can take in and out, which you will not wear all the time, you may be able to get by with synthetic extensions. There are two types of synthetic extensions: Toyokalon and Kanekalon. Kanekalon extensions have more fiber, meaning they're more resistant to heat. If you plan on styling or curling your extensions, go with Kanekalon. Toyokalon are not as easy to style, but may last longer.;
, Before making a purchase, you want to make sure you know how long your extensions should be. Hair extensions are attached to the center of your hair. You should measure the length of your hair from the center the the tips. Then, add the number of inches you want to this number. This should give you a rough idea of the length you should buy.For example, say you want to add 5 inches of hair. The length from the center of your hair to your tips is 10 inches. You would want extensions 15 inches in length.
Keep in mind where the center of your hair falls depends on your hair type, as well as torso and neck length. Therefore, it's a good idea to ask your stylist for a length recommendation before making a purchase.

, You want to get a sense of how much extensions cost before making a purchase. You do not want to overpay for extensions. However, you should be suspicious of extensions are priced too low, as they may not be high quality.Real hair extensions tend to be very pricey. A partial head of extensions will cost between $400 and $800. A full head of hair extensions designed to just fill out your hair will cost between $1,300 and $1,600. If you want to fill out your hair and add length, the cost will be $1,600 to $4,000.
Synthetic extensions will cost much less. Things like clip-ons or hair flips are particularly cheap. While synthetic hair is not recommended, it's a decent option if you're on a budget.

, It's a good idea to buy extensions in a store, so you can make sure they're a good match for your hair color and texture. Visit a variety of local salons, beauty stores, and department stores and see what types of extensions they sell and for what prices. You may want to talk to stylist at your local salons and ask for suggestions based on your hair type.


As stated, real hair is going to cost you more. However, you may be able to find cheaper, synthetic extensions. Price ranges may vary slightly from salon to salon and store to store, so look out for minor differences in prices.
Do research on a salon before settling on it. If prices are lower, make sure the salon still has a good reputation. Low prices may indicate poor quality.
Also, call a variety of salons and ask about added costs. The cost of attaching the extensions will vary. In addition to paying a lot for the extensions themselves, there's a cost of labor you should consider.

, You may be able to find cheaper extensions online. If there's a brand you like at a local store, see if you can find it at a discount price online. You may also find stores online that sell extensions that are closer to your price range.


You should be sure to do some research before making an online purchase. Read user reviews to make sure that type of extension has a good reputation.

, The duration you want to keep your extensions in place makes a big difference in terms of the types you choose. Certain extensions last much longer, and are placed in the hair via things like hot glue.Strand by strand extensions and tubing extensions are inserted into your hair for the longterm. Usually, you will have to go to a salon to have these types of extensions woven into your hair. This can be time consuming and costly, but will give you extensions that will stay in for the longterm.Other types of longterm hair extensions are glued or fused to the heat using heat, cold, or glue. These also usually require a salon visit.Micro tube extensions are also longterm, but easier to apply and less damaging. You clamp these extensions onto existing hair without any adhesives, which may cause less damage to hair than other permanent options. If you have some experience working with hair, you may be able to use a tube extension kit on your own. However, most people will need a salon., Not all extensions are made to last. If you're on a budget, or simply don't want to commit to a look longterm, look into things like hair clips and hair flips.Hair clips and hair flips are shorter term extensions, which you clip or attach yourself in the morning when getting ready. They are generally cheaper and easier to apply than more permanent measures.
However, the process of attaching hair clips or flips each morning can take awhile. Hair flips tend to be slightly more expensive than clips, but are generally easier to attach.

, Salon visits can get costly. Hair extension options that require tubing, weaving, or fusing almost always must be done at a salon. Research a variety of salons in your area to get a sense of the average cost of these kinds of procedures. See if that cost is within your budget. If you cannot afford a salon, you may want to go with synthetic hair clips or flips that you can attach yourself.

, If a salon is out of your budget, look into DIY extensions. Many stores sell cheap hair clips you can easily attach yourself. They may sell color strip or extensions made from feathers. If you're looking for a wilder style, this may work for you. You should also look into ponytail extensions, which you attach to a headband or existing ponytail. These types of extensions are not as authentic in appearance as pricier clips or extensions that require salon care, but tend to be affordable for most people., It's very important that you get the right color match when selecting your extensions. A mismatched color can look jarring and call attention to the fact you're wearing extensions.Look at a variety of color options. It's a good idea to see extensions in real life before making a purchase to make sure they match your hair tone.
If you can't find extensions that match your own hair color, you may want to consider coloring your hair at home or professionally. You can then purchase extensions to match. Usually, you want extensions colored ahead of time. Extensions are not as strong as regular hair, so dyeing them to match yours can cause damage. Dyed hair extensions tend to not last as long.
Certain hair tones, like reds and highlights, may be lighter on extensions. If your extensions are old, and you've already gotten a lot of use out of them, it may make sense to simply dye them if their color fades.

, Make sure you get a length you're comfortable with. As extensions are often attached to the middle of the head and not the top, the total length of your hair is usually longer than the advertised length of the extensions. If you're getting 15 inch extensions, for example, keep in mind your hair will end up longer than 15 inches. Hair extensions can be cut, but longer extensions cost more. To keep things in a reasonable budget, it's a good idea to get extensions in your desired length., In addition to making sure you get a color match, you want to make sure your extensions are the correct texture. Extensions come in straight, wavy, and curly varieties. When selecting your extensions, make sure to buy a type that's fitting with your current hair. You should also keep in mind how you style your hair. If you frequently curl of flat iron your hair, make sure you get a heat resistant extension., Unless you have professional experience, you should never attempt to attach longterm extensions on your own. Extensions that require fusing, weaving, or heat/cold treatments can cause damage to your hair attached incorrectly. Always hire a stylist if you're going with these types of extensions., You should not sleep on your extensions. They tend to be more delicate than regular hair. Wrap your hair in a shower cap or a silk bonnet at night to avoid damaging your extensions., Like regular hair, extensions require washing and care. However, you want to be careful when washing extensions, especially if you have synthetic extensions. Consider using a dry shampoo. You should also be sure to avoid placing conditioner near the glue or bonds holding your extensions in place."

Just make sure it's completely secured. You do not want any hair falling down and getting in the way while you're securing your extensions., The idea is to sandwich a thin strand of hair below your part line between top and bottom extensions. However, the strand of hair you're sandwiching needs to be very thin. This is so the adhesive tape on both extensions can stick together through the hair. Grab a very thin strand of hair from the hair below your part line about the length of one extension. Make sure the hair is thin enough your fingers can feel one another through the hair., Take your strand of hair and lift it up a little. Remove the strip covering the adhesive on the bottom extension. Press on the bottom extension underneath the thin strand of hair you're lifting., Take the top extension. After removing the adhesive tape covering that extension, press on top of your strand of hair. The top and bottom extension should stick together. Hold the two together for about 20 seconds to secure.If the extensions are not sticking, you used too much hair in your strand. Gently brush some hair off the bottom extension.

Continue braiding.,
Secure the ends.",How to Braid Extensions1," Extensions braided into small braids are usually in place for a long period, so you want to starting with clean hair and scalp. Make sure your hair is dry before braiding.


You may also want to cut the extensions to the length you prefer before braiding. If you are going to use the full length of the extensions, you can leave them as they are.;
, For box braids, you are going to be braiding numerous strands into tiny, long braids. Start the process by separating a small portion of hair that will be the basis for your first braid. You can do this with your fingers or a comb. Make sure the section of hair is untangled.The size of this section of hair will be the size of all sections over your hair, so make sure this is the braid size you want.

, Hold the piece of natural hair in one hand. Take the hair extension and loop it around the natural hair; essentially, you are wrapping the extension around the natural hair in half. You will have two strands of hair extension in one hand, and one natural strand in the other hand.









Make sure the extension is looped evenly around the strand so the ends meet; this will ensure that way your braid is even.

, Hold your natural hair taut as you twist the two strands of the extension around the natural hair strand. If you can't quite get it by twisting, just cross the extension strands under the natural hair. You will now have three distinct strands of equal size.

, Take the natural strand, which is one of the outside strands, and cross it over the middle strand. Pull the extension strand to the side, making it an outside strand while the natural hair strand becomes the middle strand. This makes your three strands.









Spray the hair extension and natural hair with water to keep stray hairs in place while you are working with it.

, Using these three initial strands, braid a few strands to get the braid going. Then, slide the extension upwards towards the scalp to secure it.


Make sure not to braid the hair too tightly. This can cause severe scalp and hair damage.

, Split the natural hair into two strands. Do the same to one of the extension strands. Combine one of each of the strands together into two new strands. Now, two of your strands should be a combined natural hair and extension strand.You should still have 3 separate sections of hair at this point.

, Now that you have the braid started and blended, continue braiding until you get to the end of your hair.









When you get to the ends of your natural hair, use some hair spray or water to smooth them down as they combine with your extensions.

, When you reach the end of the extensions, secure the ends with a small hair tie or whatever other method you choose.

Add hair to the braid.,
Continue the braid to the end of your hair.",How to Braid Extensions2," Start your cornrow by sectioning off a long, narrow section of hair. This section should be in a straight line from your scalp to your nape. Make sure to separate the edges as crisply as possible.Use rubber bands, clips, bobby pins, or another styling tool to secure the hair not in the cornrow section. You want to make sure hair from the rest of your head doesn't get integrated into the cornrow.
Make sure to comb the hair in the tract straight back before you begin.

, To start your cornrow, you need to make the base for the braid. Begin by taking a thin, even section from the very front of the section - right next to the scalp.

, Position the hair extension around the natural hair so the natural hair rests in the direct middle of the extension. This will produce three strands to braid - the extension on the right, the natural hair in the middle, and the extension to the left.








Prepare these strands to braid by placing the three strands between your fingers on one hand. One strand should be between your thumb and index finger, the middle between your index and middle finger, the last between your middle and ring finger.

, Get your fingers as close to the scalp as possible. Start with the strand of hair resting between ring finger and middle finger. Take that strand between your thumb and index finger on your free hand. Wrap the strand around the base of the hair in the direction of the hand you are wrapping with. Keep the hair tightly close to the scalp. Keeping that strand secure between your thumb and index finger, place the middle strand between the index and middle finger, while the outside strand is between your middle and ring finger.









The strands have now shifted position. The hair that started in the back is now in front, the original middle strand (your natural hair) is in the back, and the original front strand is in the middle.

, Now with the other hand, repeat the same steps, wrapping around the other side of the strand. Take the strand currently between your ring and middle finger and wrap it around the hair using the thumb and index finger on your free hand. Make sure you wrap it around a different side than in the previous step; you are wrapping it around towards your free hand. Now place the middle and outside strands between the index and middle and middle and ring finger, respectively.









If you are wrapping with your left hand, the hair will be wrapped on the left side of the strand. If you are wrapping with your right hand, the hair will be wrapped on the right side of the strand.

, Continue braiding the hair this way for 3-4 more turns. You want to establish a tight, secure base braid for the rest of your cornrow.








, Now that the base braid is ready, start adding hair to the braid. Pick up a small amount of hair from the tract and add it to the strand between your thumb and index finger. Braid a complete turn, which means you wrap hair around both sides of the hair.









Continue adding small sections of hair from directly below where the braid is, braiding complete turns each time.

, When you have incorporated all the hair from your scalp into your braid, keep braiding in the same way until you get to the end of your hair. Secure your hair with a small rubber band.

The amount of cornrows you braid into your hair might depend on the kind of extensions you are braiding into your hair. If you are braiding bulky extensions, you can braid less cornrows into your hair.Crochet braids are braids where you first cornrow your hair, then attach the extensions into the cornrows by a latch hook method., If your hair is long enough to extend beyond the nape of your neck, fold them up so they are directly alongside the cornrow. Push a threaded needle through the cornrow and the braided tail, then out and through a loop on the end of the thread. Pull tight to secure the thread around the hair. Repeat a few times along the cornrow.







, Fold the extension in half so the ends meet evenly. The center of the extension should make a little loop. Carefully slide the latch hook under the cornrow. Hook the loop of the extension into the latch hook, then close it.









Buy a latch hook tool. This tool closes the hook so that it doesn't tear, break, or snag on your hair. If you use a regular crochet needle, you might damage your hair.Alternately, you can use a bobby pin. Slide the bobby pin under your cornrow until just the looped end is sticking out on the other side. Slide your extension through the looped end of the bobby pin. Make sure to pull the hair through until both strands are even. Slide the bobby pin and extension under the cornrow.

, Carefully pull the extension underneath the cornrow until the loop of the extension is below the cornrow. Take the strands of the extension and pull them through the loop. Tighten the loop until it is snug against the cornrow, and therefore, attached to your hair.







, Once you have secured one extension, repeat the same process all the way down the cornrow. Place them as closely together as you please, depending on the look you are going for.

Remove the hair extensions before they look ratty.",How to Take Care of Synthetic Hair Extensions," The shampoo should be a shampoo specifically formulated for synthetic hair. A shampoo for synthetic wigs works fine on synthetic extensions as well. However, if you cannot find a shampoo for synthetic hair, then a mild shampoo works fine too.


Not all shampoos are labeled mild or strong, so look for a shampoo without “sulfates,” which is a strong cleansing agent. Shampoos without sulfates are much gentler on the hair, and they’re usually labeled as “sulfate-free” on the front of the bottle.You should be able to buy shampoos for synthetic wigs and extensions at a beauty supply store or wig store. (Try only to use conditioner if you can.) That said, you should only wash synthetic hair if it is smelly or visibly dirty. Washing will not add shine or strengthen the hair, and you should not wash it too often.;
, A wide tooth comb won’t snag the hair like a comb with smaller teeth does. Work from the ends of the hair to the roots as you gently comb the tangles out. In other words, work from the bottom up.









To make the combing process easier, wet the hair by spritzing it with a spray bottle filled with water or detangling spray. Then, comb the hair.
If the hair has a really tight curl pattern, use your fingers to comb the hair. Your fingers are much gentler, won’t snag the hair and won’t disrupt the curl pattern like a comb does.
If you are wearing a wig or clip-in extensions, you might find it easier to take them off and then comb them. Purchase a wig block at a beauty supply store, and set the wig on the block with T-pins. This will help you comb the hair.

, The water should be cool to lukewarm -- not hot. Make sure that the water is not too hot or it might affect the smoothness or texture of the hair. Fill up the sink to a level high enough to immerse all of the hair in the water.


If you're extensions are not clip-in, or if you don't want to remove them to wash them skip to step 4, which states to wet your hair and apply shampoo as you normally would.

, If you are washing a lot of hair, then mix two capfuls of shampoo into the water. Use your best judgment to decide if you need one or two capfuls. You don’t want to use too much shampoo because you don’t want the cleanser to strip the hair of any coatings that give it a sheen or change the look and feel of the hair.








Using too much shampoo or a harsh shampoo can make the hair look dull.
Once again, if you want to wear your extensions while you wash your hair, wet your hair as you normally would. Then, apply about a capful of shampoo directly to the hair and distribute it through the hair., The hair should be fully submerged. Make sure it absorbs the water. Push it down under the water if necessary. If the hair is not wet enough, then the shampoo won’t be able to cleanse the hair.









If you're wearing your extensions, skip to step 6 and massage the shampoo in.

, This is a method of agitating the hair without rubbing or scrubbing. Then, dunk the hair up and down. Go back and forth between swishing and dunking the hair until you think it is clean.








If you are wearing your extensions, gently massage the shampoo in, but do not rub. You don’t want to tangle the hair. Massage the shampoo in all around the hair for a few minutes until you feel it is clean.

, Cool water closes the hair cuticles on human hair. On synthetic hair, cool water won’t disrupt any of the coatings on the hair or alter the curl pattern like hot water can. So, rinse out the hair thoroughly with cool water until all of the lather has rinsed out and the water runs clear.








, You want to prevent the hair from detangling at all costs. If the hair gets tangled, then you will have to painstakingly detangle it without messing up the texture, curl or wave pattern of the hair. Since the hair is not natural, moisturizing conditioner won’t be as effective as it is on human hair because the synthetic hair can’t absorb it.


Conditioners are usually labeled by type. So, they will say moisturizing, volumizing, or detangling on the front of the bottle.
If you are still having trouble finding a detangling shampoo, check the children’s section. Several companies make shampoos and detangling conditioners for children.
If you want to add some sheen back to the hair, purchase a conditioner with some natural oils such as avocado or jojoba oil.

, Use cool water. Cool water is the best temperature to use for synthetic hair. Fill it up to a level high enough to cover all of your hair once you put it in the sink.


If you're wearing your extensions, your hair should still be wet after rinsing out the shampoo.

, Again, if you are washing and conditioning a lot of hair, use your best judgement. Add two capfuls of conditioner. You don’t want to add too much though. Too much conditioner can weigh the hair down.








If you are wearing your extensions as you condition them, add one or two capfuls directly to your hair and distribute evenly.

, Agitate the hair by gently moving it back and forth in the water, just as you did before. You want just a bit of the conditioner to grab hold of the hair and condition it. Too much will weigh the hair down and make it look greasy since synthetic hair can’t absorb the conditioner the way human hair can. Keep swishing the hair around for a few minutes until you think the hair is conditioned.









If you're wearing the extensions, continue to distribute the product the product through the hair by raking it gently through with your fingers.

, Do not rinse it out.The conditioner should remain in the hair even if it is not a leave-in.If you prefer, use a leave-in conditioner on the hair instead. Use a water-based leave-in that typically comes in a spritz-style spray bottle.








You also can let the hair sit in the conditioner water for 10 to 15 minutes if you're washing the extensions in the sink.
If you are conditioning with the synthetic extensions while you're wearing them, simply spray in a leave-in. Leave the conditioner in the hair.
You can make your own leave-in conditioner by pouring a cap of detangling conditioner into a spray bottle and filling the bottle with water. Shake to combine the two ingredients, and spray on hair as needed.
If you think that you have added a bit too much conditioner to the hair, spritz the hair with water from a spray bottle to gently rinse out some of it.

, Simply place the hair in the palm of your hand. Then, close your hand as if you’re making a fist to squeeze out the excess water. Work from the ends of the hair to the top while gently squeezing. Don’t rub the hair against a towel, and don’t ring the hair the way you would ring out a towel.









This applies whether you are wearing the extensions as you wash them or not.

, Place each extension on a towel with space between each track so that the pieces don’t overlap. They will take longer to dry if you pile them on top of each other. Don’t disturb the hair by brushing or combing it while it is wet









If you’re drying a wig, place it on a wig stand to dry.
If you are wearing the extensions, blot the hair with a towel. Use a microfiber towel for the best results. It dries the hair without ruffling the strands of hair.

, Don’t use a blowdryer. Blow drying the hair can permanently change the curl or wave pattern of the hair. In other words, it can damage the hair. Some synthetic hair has been specially formulated to work with hot tools, but most have not. It should say if you can use hot tools on your synthetic hair on the package . Even then, check the label to see if you can blow dry the hair.









For best results, allow the hair to air dry even if you can use hot tools on the hair.
This applies to clip-in and non-clip-in extensions.

, Using a wide-toothed comb ensures that you’ll have far fewer snags when you’re combing the hair since the teeth are wider. If the curl pattern is especially tightly curled, use your fingers to finger comb the hair. In this case, your fingers are your best tool.









Don’t brush curly or wavy synthetic hair with bristled brushes such as boar bristle brushes. These kinds of brushes can mess up the pattern and texture of the hair.

, If the hair is curly, wavy or textured, this will be especially helpful. Water helps add slip so that you can move the comb through the hair easily. If you need more slip, add a little bit of leave-in conditioner to the water in the spray bottle. You also can purchase wig spray to comb the hair.









Lots of synthetic hair is tightly curled textured hair because synthetic hair can recreate the texture and curls of specific types of hair that is difficult to recreate with straight human hair -- the original state of most extensions. Synthetic hair creates texture and holds the curl and waves better than human hair does. So, if you’re using curly and wavy synthetic hair and you want it to last longer, spritz the hair with water and comb through with your fingers.

, If you have synthetic hair that you can use hot tools on, make sure you use a cool setting on the flat iron or curling iron. Otherwise, you might melt the hair. Also, styling changes that you make with hot tools can set the hair permanently. So, be careful when you’re using flat irons and curling irons..









You also can curl straight synthetic hair with hot water. Set the hair on rollers, or whatever you’re using as a curling rod. Then, dip the hair in very hot water, or spray hot water on the hair if you're wearing them. Place the hair on a towel to dry or let it air dry, and then remove the curling rods once it’s dry. Only do this if you really want to change the style of the hair. It’s not recommended to curl it and then try to straighten it. Synthetic hair can’t undergo frequent style changes so easily without damaging the hair.
If your synthetic hair does not say that you can use hot tools on it, then don’t. You might ruin or melt the hair.

, Uneven, tangled and knotted ends can make your extensions look damaged and unkempt. Trim off the ends when they start to look bad. It will instantly revive the look of the hair and make it look better.

, When your extensions start to look dry or without sheen, rub a light weight oil such as jojoba oil through the hair. Leave it for an hour, and then wipe off excess oil by blotting with a towel.. If necessary, wash out the excess with a dollop of mild shampoo and rinse.


Most synthetic extensions are naturally shinier than human hair, so only do this if they appear dull.

, Hair extensions tend to move up the hair shaft at around the six week point, making them become loose or uneven. After a while, even if you take good care of them, eventually they will have to be removed. They don't last forever. So, plan a return trip to the hairdresser to get some replacements reinstalled.

Decide on the kind of hair you want.,
Think about clip-in hair extensions.,
Consider fusion hair extensions.",How to Apply Hair Extensions1," Hair extensions come in two different makes: synthetic or human. Synthetic extensions are a man-made keratin/plastic mix that mimics the appearance of human hair. Human hair is donated by real people and repurposed into extensions. Human hair extensions also come in many grades, such as Brazilian, Indian, Malaysian, three of the most popular. All of the best grade and textures of human hair come in its most natural state, this allowing for straighten, curling and even coloring to a desired color level. natural Brazilian, Indian and Malaysian hair installs will have different grades of textures, such as wave (a natural c formation throughout the weft), natural curl, (somewhat straight with natural body and fullness towards the ends and tight curl (the weft has a natural very tight ringlets ). When choosing human hair installs it is always best to use hair that is closest to your own natural texture, this will allow for smooth blending when installing your extensions.


Synthetic extensions do a very good job of mimicking the appearance of human hair, but lack some of the texture that natural hair maintains. At the same time, synthetic extensions tend to be shinier than natural human hair.
Human hair is much more expensive than synthetic hair, but it is also more versatile and natural looking. Unlike synthetic extensions, it can be styled with heat tools, chemically treated, colored, and washed and styled.;
, These are either synthetic or human hair that are attached to a hair clip at the base which allow for temporary extensions to your hair. These are a great option if you only want extensions for a particular event or day.


These are the cheapest available hair extensions, and are also the easiest to install. They take only minutes to put in.
Clip-in extensions must be reapplied on a daily basis as they begin to fall out over the course of a day. They are not very comfortable to sleep in.

, Fusion extensions are synthetic or human hair that is treated at one end with either a special glue or keratin wax that is melted into your natural hair.


Fusion extensions are the longest lasting extensions, but are also significantly more expensive than clip-ins.
Although fusion extensions use heat, they are not too damaging to your natural hair. If you are afraid of damage, look into cold fusion extensions.
Because of the difficulty in applying fusion extensions yourself, for the best results have a friend or stylist apply them for you."

Begin with clean extensions free of hair product buildup.,
Buy a bleach kit.,
Mix the powder and the liquid and follow the directions in your kit.

,
Put on your gloves and massage the mixture into the extensions starting from the top.,
Fold the foil over the extensions so that no bleach spills out.

,
Check on them every ten minutes until they are a lemon yellow color or an hour has passed.

,
Wash them with a PH balancing shampoo to neutralize the chemicals.,
If they are not blonde enough, another bleaching may be necessary.,
Lastly, eliminate any brassy tones with a toner.

",How to Bleach Clip in Extensions," Place them on individual sheets of tinfoil.;
, These can be purchased from many places.

,, Use circular motions and move towards the ends. Fully saturate the extensions.

,,, Make sure to use a deep conditioning treatment such as olive or coconut oil and leave it on overnight.

, Be sure to check every 5 minutes to make sure they are not being over processed.

,"
"
To install the extensions, your hair should be 5 inches (12.7 cm) minimum so that the attachment points are visible.,
Make the Preparation rows.,
When the keratin is not transparent, it is rolled between your fingers so the extension and natural hair is uniform.

,
Repeat the same steps to put the locks one by one across the head.

,In the end, the hair is brushed lightly to blend so harmoniously with the natural hair extensions

",How to Apply Hot Fusion Hair Extensions," The extensions are applied 5 mm from the scalp.;
,

Select a thin strand of hair using the tail of the comb.






Insert the lock of hair in the template circle to protect the scalp.






Use hot extension iron to heat the pre-tipped extensions to natural hair, your hair is fixed to the original lock expansion on heating point of keratin.

Purchase wefts of hair.,
Divide your hair into sections.,
Tease your hair.,
Take one weft and clip to to your hair at the roots.,
Remove another section of hair from your ponytail.,
Finish your hair style.",How to Apply Hair Extensions2," A weft of hair is a single row of hair to be clipped between your own layers of hair to add length. You can buy either synthetic or human hair in wefts, with the latter being the pricier of the two options.


Match your color as best as possible. Hair extensions are intended to look natural, which they are unable to do if there is a simple discrepancy in hair color.
Find the right length of hair. Although you obviously want your extensions to be longer than your current length, avoid adding a dramatic amount of difference between your natural length and the extensions. Not only will it obviously look fake, but it will cost a significantly higher amount of money. Stick to 4 inches (10.2 cm) of extra length at the most.

, You can do this by pulling all of the hair on the top of your head into a ponytail. Leave a thin section of hair down against your neck/back. As you add extensions, you will continue to let down more sections of hair of about an inch each.

, Take a back-comb and rat your hair at the roots. You want your hair to gain ½ to a full inch in volume at the base of the strands.


Teasing your hair gives the extensions something to stick to. Natural hair is too slippery for the clips to hold long without sliding down your strands.
Ratting the roots of your hair also provides coverage for the clips. This makes it more difficult to tell you are wearing extensions.

, You should be able to dig into the teased section of hair to allow for the best stick.


Be sure to evenly space the extensions, so that you have a level length of hair all the way around your head.
You can give your hair the look of layers. Apply the extensions in evenly spaced vertical sections. You may need to cut the extensions to blend them in with your natural hair.
Feel free to cut or trim your extensions to match the rest of your hair. You are not required to leave them as-is from the packaging.

, Repeat the same steps as above, by teasing your hair at the roots and adding in one weft at a time.

, Tease your hair at the roots and brush out the top layer so that it is smooth. Your clip-in extensions should be completely blended so that you cannot see them at the roots of your locks.


If you can see the clip from your extensions, rearrange them so that they are not visible.
Be sure that your extension clips cannot be seen even if you put your hair in a ponytail. They should be close enough to the roots and blended with enough layers that they are invisible to the naked eye."

Clarify your hair.,
Dry your hair completely.,
Make a divider for you hair.,
Section your hair beginning at the base.,
Put a strand of hair into your cardstock divider.,
Attach one strand of the extension to your divided hair.,
Use a flat iron to fuse the extension.,
Roll the fused strands into your natural hair.,
Remove the hair divider.,
Repeat the steps of dividing and fusing hair.,
Style your hair.,
Care for the hair extensions.,
Finished.

",How to Apply Hair Extensions3," There are many clarifying shampoos available for purchase that help to cleanse your locks of any buildup or residue that might prevent the extensions from sticking to your hair.


Do not use conditioner or other hair products after clarifying your hair, as you will be adding in the things you just removed with your clarifying shampoo.
If you are afraid of your clarifying shampoo stripping too much, look for ones that advertise sensitive skin and are made from organic materials instead of more chemicals.

, If you hair is at all damp, the glue from the extensions will not be able to stick.

, A divider will section out small pieces of your hair to fuse the extensions to, as well as protect your scalp from getting burned. To do this, you will need a piece of cardstock about three inches in diameter.


Cut the cardstock into a circle, around three inches wide. It doesn’t have to be perfectly shaped, but using the curved figure will work best.
Cut a slit on one side of the circle to the center, like drawing the radius. At the center of the circle, make an enlarged hole one to two millimeters wide.
Now, you will be able to slide small pieces of hair to the center of the cardstock circle, where the fusion extension can be safely attached at the root without burning your head.

, Part your hair around two inches from the nape of your neck, pinning everything above that mark to the top of your head.

, Pick up small sections and pull them through the divider. A crochet hook can be very useful for this. This will be the first piece you fuse, and should be around the same size of the hair extension strand. If you need to, clip the divider into your hair with a bobby pin or hair clip.

, Line up the end of the extension with the roots of your hair so that it begins as near to your scalp as is possible.

, Hold the end of the extension and your hair by the roots in the flat iron for a few seconds. Remove the flat iron for a few seconds and repeat. Be careful not to burn your own hair in the process.

, Using your fingertips on the still-warm hair, make a rolling motion to blend the extension with your natural hair. This will help to set the glue or melted keratin.

, Take another section from the same row of hair and replace your cardstock divider on a new strand of hair. Just remember to be careful of the newly fused section.

, Layer extensions evenly over your head so that they appear the most natural. Continue this process until you have used all of your extensions.

, Use a brush that has no nibs or bulging ends on the tips of the bristles so that you do not pull out your newly fused extensions. There should be no problem following your basic style routine post-extensions as long as you are careful not to damage the base of the fusion.Don't brush or comb your hair near the scalp.
Too much tension can result in the extensions sliding or falling out.

, Brush your hair regularly, making sure that you avoid brushing too close to the scalp. When washing your extensions, use sulfate-free products, and do not condition the scalp. Leave-in conditioners can help you keep out tangles.Use a very gentle touch. Do not rub, scrub, or tug at your hair.
You will need to have the extensions redone every six to eight weeks, as they will start to slide out around this time.

Make sure it is 100% human hair.,
Look for Remy hair.,
Identify genuine Virgin hair.",How to Grade Hair Extensions1," All graded hair extensions (1A and up) should be composed of 100% human hair. Unfortunately, many companies may include strands of animal or synthetic fibers. The best way to determine if hair is 100% human is to look for cuticle scales under a microscope. You can also test for synthetic fibers by seeing if the hair is easily damaged (melts) by heat styling., ""Remy hair"" refers to 100% human hair extensions in which the strands are arranged in a unilateral cuticle direction. Remy hair is collected in such a way that strands of hair stay aligned in the direction they grew. For instance, this can mean holding the hair in a ponytail and cutting it off.Keeping the cuticles in the same direction reduces tangles and helps hair to last longer.
If the hair becomes matted in 2-3 weeks, you will know that it's not real Remy.

, Virgin hair is 100% human Remy hair that has never been chemically treated or processed. This is the highest quality hair you can buy. There are essentially six ways to verify that what you have purchased is authentic virgin hair.These are:


The presence of split ends. If there are zero split ends, this means the hair has been acid washed.
You can feel the cuticle. If you hold a strand between your fingers and slide your hand down, it should be smooth. If you try to move the other direction, you should feel tiny ridges.
The hair will often be lighter at the tips than at the roots (though not always).
The hair that is stitched to the track and reversed (often called the mustache or beard) is very soft.
The hair has not been coated with silicone. It should not have a shiny residue.
It smells like hair. The chemicals used to disguise non-Virgin hair smell a bit like corn chips.

"
Wash your hair with shampoo and conditioner to rinse away the dirt.,
Co-wash if your hair is particularly dry.,
Gently pat your hair dry with a towel to reduce friction.,
Apply a leave-in conditioner or hydrating formula to prevent damage to your hair.",How to Straighten Curly and Thick Hair1," Use a gentle shampoo and conditioner as flat-ironing hair may cause damage to your hair.Shampooing and conditioning will remove unwanted oil and product build-up from your hair.


Look for shampoo and conditioner products that are sulfate-free and jam packed with glycerin. Glycerin helps reduce frizz as it penetrates hair follicles, hydrating hair from the inside out. The closer glycerin is to the front of the ingredients list, the more it contains.Use a gentle shampoo and a smoothing conditioner. Straightening can be damaging to hair, even if your hair is thick and curly, so gentle products are important.When leaving in the conditioner in the shower, use a paddle brush to comb through your hair. This will help with the smoothening process while in the shower.;
, Co-washing means washing your hair with only conditioner. Hair that's thick or curly is prone to more dryness than average hair. If your hair is very dry and frizzy, you should try co-washing your hair before straightening it. Your hair may benefit from being co-washed a few times a week.Shampoo can remove a lot of the natural moisture from hair. Using conditioner may reduce your hair's dryness. As straightening your hair can cause it to dry out, co-washing may be very helpful for someone with thick or curly hair.
To co-wash your hair, saturate your hair with water. Then, massage in your chosen conditioner. Give your hair three to five minutes to absorb the conditioner and then wash it out.

, Do not rub! Wet hair is very weak and prone to damage. Blot the hair gently, and lightly wring the ends to soak-up moisture. Dry until it is slightly damp.Pat the hair downwards to promote straightening. Towel-drying in different directions enhances curls.Allow your hair to dry 90% of the way before you blow-dry. Concentrated hot air can frizz your hair., If you don't have either, use a small amount of the conditioner or a dime-sized amount of olive oil.These coat your hair to prevent the intense heat from causing split ends.


Don’t overdo it. Too much leave-in conditioner can make your hair limp instead of straight.Wash your hair with only conditioner twice a week to keep from washing away natural hair oils.
Use argan oil for thick hair."

Do a pony tail.,
Try a high bun.,
Do a simple braid.",How to Style Curly Hair in 20 Minutes or Less1," A pony tail is a simple, classic hairstyle that works on nearly all hair types, curly hair included. There are a few unique considerations when it comes to pulling curly hair up into a class ponytail.Consider going for a hair bungee over a conventional elastic bands. Curly hair can be thick, and may be too thick for the usual rubber bands. You can pick up hair bungees at most beauty stores and salons. They're elastic bands with two clips on the end. You would pull the band around your hair until it forms a ponytail, and then clip the bands together.
To do a classic ponytail, gather your hair in back. You can gather all your hair, or just clip back part of it. A pony tail can fall high or low, depending on your preference. Once your hair is gathered, place the bungee in place or wrap an elastic band around your hair.
If your hair feels too tight, try gently loosening the bungee or band. If you can't loosen it adequately, take your hair out of the ponytail and try again. A pony tail should take less than 5 minutes.;
, A high bun is a quick, classic style that can be particularly flattering for curly hair. As with the classic ponytail, there are some special considerations to take when putting your hair in a high bun.To start, use your fingers to gather your hair in a high ponytail. Aim to have your bun resting towards the top of the back of your head. Then, use an elastic band or hair bungee to secure your hair.
From here, you can pad your hair gently with your hands or a soft-bristled brush, creating a bun shape. You can use a large scrunchie or a hair donut, which is a large and thick elastic band, to secure the bun shape you've created. Simply tuck the ends of your hair under the scrunchie or donut.
If your hair still feels a bit loose, you can place some bobby pins around the base of your bun to secure it. You can also spritz your hair with a light bit of hairspray to keep the style in place.

, If you have curly hair, you can try a simple braid. If your hair is thin enough, simply separate it into three sections and braid it to the side or running down your back. If your hair is particularly thick, however, braiding the whole thing may be difficult. In this case, there are other options.You can try braiding one or two small strands of hair. Then, you can wrap these strands around your existing hair and secure with bobby pins, creating a ponytail with your braid.
Some women like to separate their hair into three section. Then, they braid each of these sections. When complete, they braid the braided parts together. This creates a fun, somewhat eccentric style. The only downside is, if you're not used to braiding, it may take slightly longer than 20 minutes.

Get the right haircut.,
Build volume and moisture in your hair.,
Buy the right products.",How to Make Naturally Straight Hair Curly1," A mid-length cut will make it far easier to curl your hair then a very short or very long cut. Your hair will be long enough to add some layers of curls but no so long as to make the whole process unbearable. Having your hair at about your shoulder is the perfect length.;
, Your hair needs to be moisturized if you want it to maintain the style. If you have let your hair get very dry then the curls will fall away much more quickly. Try to prepare for curling your hair a week or so ahead of time by using moisturizing shampoo products.

, Dove Daily Moisturizer Shampoo and Nexus Pro-Blend Bodifying Mousse are two highly recommended products. Use the moisturizing shampoo every other day for about a week before you try to curl your hair and save the mousse for the hair-curling day.

Measure the length of the strands.,
Distinguish between single-drawn and double-drawn.,
Compare the thickness of different bundles.",How to Grade Hair Extensions2," According to some sources, the grade of hair extensions does not indicate the quality of the hair at all, but rather the length of the strands. For example, in a bundle of 18 inches (45.72 cm) hair extensions, not every strand will measure the full 18 inches (45.72 cm). The higher the number of strands per bundle that measure the full length, the greater the grade of the hair. Look carefully through your bundle to evaluate the proportion of full-length hairs to shorter-hairs.Grade A (1A) hair will have 50% or less full-length strands.
Grade AAA (3A) will have around 70% full-length strands.
Grade AAAAA (5A) and up should have at least 90% full-length strands.

, Single-drawn hair bundles, and bundles that are essentially gathered together once, and then trimmed to the desired length (such as 18 inches/45.72 cm). This process results in around 50% of strands that are the full-length of the bundle. Double-drawn hair bundles are processed twice, achieving closer to 90% of strands that are full-length. Fold a bundle of hair extensions in half and look for shorter hairs popping out. If you see this, most likely the hair has been single-drawn.If the non-uniform length of hair does not bother you, single-drawn hair is a more cost-effective option.
Both Remy and non-Remy hair can be either single or double-drawn.

, The higher the proportion of full-length hairs in a given bundle are the thicker the bundle will be. Furthermore, higher grade double-drawn hair should have a completely uniform thickness from top to bottom. If the bundle of hair seems to grow thinner towards the bottom, it is of a lower grade."
"
Rate how much it tangles.,
See how long it lasts.,
Gauge how the hair responds to coloring.",How to Grade Hair Extensions3," Unfortunately, evaluating the quality of hair extensions is difficult to do just by looking. In most cases, getting a sense of bundle's quality will require some wearing time. One of the factors when determining the grade of hair extensions involves tangle. Hair bundles with the majority of strands moving in a unilateral direction (such as Remy hair) will tangle much less easily. In other words, the more easily your hair becomes knotted or tangles, the lower the grade., With proper care, hair extensions should last for a while. The length of time that the hair stays shiny, healthy, and natural-looking is reflected by the hair's grade.Here is a basic guide:


Grade A (1A) hair should last around one month.
Grade AAA (3A) hair should last 3-4 months.
Grade AAAAA (5A) can last anywhere from 8-12 months.

, The highest quality hair extensions (5A and/or Virgin hair) have had the least amount of chemical treatment. This means the hair can be successfully dyed.

Finish with brushing your hair and using a straightening or shine serum.,
Do not overuse your hair straightener.",How to Straighten Curly and Thick Hair2," After you have done this your hair will probably be very big and frizzy. Don't worry - this will go away after you finish straightening it.


Alternate the dryer between hot and low settings as you blow dry. This will help you prevent your hair from drying out, creating frizz and other issues.
Make sure you point the blow dryer downwards from the roots as this will create an airflow that’ll naturally straighten your hair. Otherwise, your hair will frizz.It can take a very long time for curly or thick hair to dry out, so be patient. You should never apply a flat iron to damp hair, as this can cause damage.

, Ceramic plates work well for fine and thin hair, but go with gold or titanium if your hair is thick and curly. Make sure the flat iron you choose will work on your hair type and not cause any unnecessary damage.Buy a straightener that is an inch and a half or less. This size will help you reach your roots. Larger flat irons are better for styling but not ideal for straightening.Make sure your flat iron can go up to the right temperature for your hair. For thick or curly hair, your flat iron should go up to a heat setting between 380 to 410 degrees.Automatic shut-off features are perfect for any on-the-go lifestyle., Remember, hotter for thick hair, and cooler for thin hair. Wait for it to warm up to the temperature.


Don’t go beyond 350 degrees. The 450 degree setting was created for salon-professional keratin-straightening, not for home use.Never straighten damp or wet hair. Using a hot flat iron on wet hair can cause the moisture to boil, causing your hair to break and literally fry.

Once you’re done, unravel the top portion, and straighten in sections. Keep doing this until all of your hair is completely straight. Turn off the flat iron after use.

If the straightener is not fully doing it’s job on the first run, turn up the heat 10 to 30 degrees.Consider straightening your hair before bed then touching up the next morning. The night’s sleep naturally reduces frizz from the prior day’s blow drying and heat treatments.

, Wait for your hair to cool down prior to spraying with a light hold hairspray.Ensure that this spray or serum also lacks silicones and sulfates.Carry this serum around on rainy days for touch ups and flyaways., You should not straighten your hair every day if you don't know how your hair will respond. Straightening always damages hair to a degree. After straightening your hair for the first time, wait 48 hours to straighten again. After a week of straightening your hair every other day, assess the level of damage.Your hair will show damage by becoming increasingly frizzy and losing some shine. This is a warning sign that you're overdoing the straightening. However, if you hair does not appear damaged, straightening it every day may be safe for you.
If your hair responds poorly to being straightened every other day, cut back to straightening your hair every 2 to 3 days.

In fact, split ends continue to split up the hair shaft, so the longer you leave them untrimmed, the more damaged your hair will become.Have a stylist trim off the ends of your hair. If you absolutely cannot go to a stylist, use the sharpest scissors you have to snip off the ends. It's best to ask for help if you must do it at home.
Ask your stylist for a professional recommendation about how much of a trim you really need. If you’re concerned about losing length, let the stylist know that you’d like to keep as much hair as you can. Listen to their professional opinion. Stylists know hair and want you looking your best.;
, Chemicals cause damage, so give your hair time to recover by avoiding dyes and straighteners. While it may feel like a sacrifice now, even a short break from chemicals can do wonders for speeding up your hair’s repair progress.If you’re used to having color-treated hair, there are options for coloring your hair without chemicals. These natural treatments are less harsh on your hair. You can try hennas for reds, indigos for dark hair, and citrus for lighter hair. If you choose to try these options, be sure to follow the product directions.
Try wearing your natural curls for awhile.
If you hate the look of your hair and miss having a straightener, try styling your hair into braids or twists. You can also incorporate hats or hair wraps into your outfits.
If you are miserable with your natural texture, mix it up with some fun wigs from your local beauty supply store.

, Restore and retain much needed moisture so that your brittle hair will feel soft again. After your hair becomes damaged, moisture is a necessity. You can find many deep conditioners on the market, but you may also have just what you need in your kitchen cupboard.Create your own deep conditioning treatments. Aloe vera, honey, coconut oil, olive oil, and shea butter are all great conditioners that you may already have on hand. If you don’t, they are cheap to pick up from your local grocery store.Mayonnaise, avocados, and bananas also nourish your hair, so incorporate them into your moisturizing regimen.
Try mixing two or three of the kitchen-moisturizers for an easy treatment. For example, you could mix coconut oil, honey, and banana.
Apply the deep conditioning treatment to damp hair and place a shower cap over your hair. Using a shower cap traps in the moisture so that your hair is better able to soak it in.You can leave it on overnight, or you can set aside 30 minutes to an hour to let it sit.
Too many overnight treatments can make your hair limp. Once a week is the recommended frequency for best results., While you can purchase hot oil treatments from your local beauty supply or drug store, you can also use oils such as coconut oil to do a hot oil treatment. In fact, coconut oil is a great oil for repairing your damaged curls.Put your oil into a container. You may want to invest in an inexpensive squeeze container from your local beauty supply store, but a small cup, jar, or bowl will work.Immerse the container in hot water to warm your oil.Once your oil has become a warm liquid, apply it to your hair.Cover your head in a shower cap. To keep in the heat, tie a scarf or towel around your head.Do not get your oil too hot. Avoid microwaves and stoves.

, Protein treatments improve the health of your hair by putting a barrier around your hair follicle and protecting the hair shaft, which will prevent additional damage. Proteins also temporarily repair damaged hair by filling in the frayed areas of your hair shaft.Use a reconstructor if your hair is really damaged, but as the texture of your hair improves, a deep-penetrating treatment will be a better choice.Be careful not to use protein treatments too often; while they are great for repairing and protecting hair, they can also damage your hair if you use them too often., If you are using products that contain damaging chemicals or aren’t formulated for curls, then they may be adding to your hair’s damage. Consider switching to natural formulas that are specially formulated for curly hair.


Stay away from sulfates, which strip your hair’s natural oils.Look for products that offer moisturizing.

, Hair only needs to be washed every other day at most. You may want to limit shampooing to once or twice a week, especially if you have very dry hair. It’s okay to condition your hair more often, so you may find that you like to apply conditioner most days of the week.


Protect your hair from moisture by using a shower cap.
On no-shampoo wash days, wet your hair and apply conditioner. Continue your shower as you normally would.
Alternatively, use no shampoo at all with the Curly Hair Method.

, People with curly hair should never skip conditioner. Allow your conditioner to soak into your hair for at least three minutes. It’s easy to accomplish this if you put the conditioner on your hair at the beginning of the shower so that it sits on your hair as you cleanse and shave.

, Try one that’s formulated for curly hair for best results, but any leave-in will help the condition of your hair. Use your leave-in conditioner before using other products, such as curl creams or heat protectants.

, It is best to finger detangle first, and then start combing the ends of your hair, working your way closer to the scalp. While it’s best to do this in the shower while the conditioner is on your hair, you can also use a leave-in conditioner once you’re out of the shower., Using oil as part of your regular hair routine is different from a hot oil treatment. To add oil to your routine, pour a dime size of room temperature oil into your palm and smooth it onto your hair like you would a mousse.


You can use oil on either damp or dry hair, depending on your hair texture and how frequently you wash it.
Oils help nourish and protect your hair, so applying oil to your hair will both repair the strands and help you avoid further damage.
Many popular brands offer their own blend of oils. While these provide an excellent solution that helps you avoid measuring oils or investing in several oils to create a blend, these products often contain other additives.
You don’t have to buy a hair product; using plain oils is fine.
Coconut oil is a great option because it balances your hair.Many people cook with coconut oil, so you may find that it’s an economical option for you due to its multiple uses.
Argan oil is also a popular oil for hair.

, Curl creams minimize frizz and smooth out your curls. Not all curl creams are created equally, however. Make sure that you are avoiding sulfates and alcohols when you choose a curl cream.


Many people with curly hair find that mixing two or more creams or gels creates the best curl hold for their hair.
You can also mix oil with cream or gel to create your own curl-hold options.

, Air drying has two benefits. First, it protects your hair from heat damage. Second, it allows your hair to dry into tighter curls with fewer flyaways, which means a better hair day. As a bonus, you’ll also save time on styling your hair, making air-drying a win-win-win.

, Sometimes you may want to blow out or straighten your hair. Minimal heat styling should not damage your hair if you’re otherwise caring for it; however, avoid using heat too often., If you must dye or straighten your hair, choose one. Multiple chemical processes fry curly hair, so if you want to have nourished locks, you must choose one process., When you style your hair, avoid accessories like ponytail holders or bobby pins that can snarl hair, causing more damage. Instead, try soft headbands or cloth ties.

, When you need to use heat to get your desired style, limit the amount of time you apply the heat and use heat protectants.


Let your hair partially air-dry when using heat styling. For example, you could allow your hair to dry halfway while you get ready, and then use the hair dryer to finish drying it.
Make sure that your hair is completely dry before using a hair straightener. If you use a straightener on wet or damp hair, it can singe your hair as the water evaporates.
When you do use heat to style your hair, apply a heat protectant. This product comes in sprays or creams, depending on what you choose. While silicones are usually bad for your hair, heat protectants with silicones are actually better because they are so heat resistant, allowing them to better protect your hair., When you’re spending time outside, use a cute hat or hair wrap to shade your hair. If you can’t wear a hat, try a product that contains a sunscreen.

, Sleep in a satin hair wrap or on a satin pillowcase to minimize damaging friction.As a bonus, you’ll look cute and avoid bedhead in the morning.

Go medium or long.,
Beware of bangs.,
Don't use a brush.,
Choose layers.,
Avoid razor cuts.,
Ask for a dry cut.,
Study your face shape.,
Practice different styles.",How to Manage Curly Hair1," If you have curly hair, and go too short, you could end up with hair that has too much poof or looks misshapen. The key to managing curly hair can simply be the right cut. That doesn't mean you shouldn't ever try a short cut. It means you should do it with caution. Get a trim every 6 to 8 weeks. This keeps your cut's shape and will make your curls look their best.
Here's why short cuts are risky. The problem is that short hair will increase frizz. So find a great stylist if you try it. Television actress Keri Russell learned this fact the hard way. When she lopped off her curls, controversy followed and ratings dropped. ;
, You should be equally cautious with bangs as length. Bangs will also make frizz worse. They're usually not recommended for people with very curly hair.As with any rule though, an extremely experienced stylist could help you break the rules. , Brushing curly hair can be a disaster for it. If you introduce a brush to curly hair, especially when it's wet, get prepared for damage and frizz. It's best to choose a wide-toothed comb.


Comb your hair while it's still wet with conditioner in it to reduce damage. Don't comb dry hair (although brushing dry hair is the worst yet). Run your fingers through wet hair with your head upside down so the curls fall into a natural shape. Sometimes your fingers make a better comb. , Ask your stylist to give you a few layers with your cut. This can make curly hair look less boxy. In fact, some stylists believe that getting proper layers is the most important factor as to whether curly hair will look good.


Layers should start at your chin, and then your stylist should layer them downward. Uneven layering works best with curls. You should have more layers with longer hair. Avoid layering that makes your hair look like a triangle with the curls too weighted at the bottom. One-length cuts without layers can look heavy and be harder to manage with curls. , They don't work well with curly hair because they harm the hair cuticle. There are a few sites that say they can be done, but they are dangerous without a very experienced stylist.Razor cuts actually increase curl in the hair. So they would work better for people who don't already have tight curls. If your curls are more wavy than they are tight, you are a better candidate for this kind of cut., If your stylist cuts your curly hair when it's wet, it can be hard to predict what it will really look like. Ask the stylist to cut your hair while dry so you can really tell how the curls will fall. This matters for straight hair too, but it's even more important with curls. Dry cuts will enable the stylist to cut your hair with more precision. They will be seeing the curls as you will be wearing them. , What looks good on a celebrity with curly hair might not look good on you. It all depends on which style works best with your face shape. So figure out what's uniquely good for you.


A short bob doesn't work well with heart or round-shaped faces, especially with curls. To figure out your face shape best, stand facing a mirror, and pull your hair back. Then, outline your face on the mirror with an eyeliner pencil. Now you can better assess your face shape. , Play around with braids, high buns, and hair that is half up and half down. It's not true that curly hair must only be worn loose and flowing, although that can look good too.


Wearing your hair up can look particularly romantic and attractive with curls. Make sure to pull a few strands down to frame your face. "

Dry and fluff out your hair.",How to Make Black Hair Curly2," Of course, the most important part of a flexi rod curl is the flexi rods. These can be found at most beauty supply and drug stores. You will also need a bristle brush, a spray bottle filled with water, hair clips, and a setting product if necessary.


Flexi rods come in a variety of sizes. Keep in mind that the wider the rod, the larger your curls will be. If you want to go for tight ringlets, use smaller rods.

, Flexi rods work best on stretched hair, like what you'd have from a braid out. Part your hair where you want your curls to fall.


If your hair is long, separating it into four sections with hairclips will make it easier to work with., Spritz your hair with the spray bottle so that the whole strand is a little moist. Do not make it soaking wet. Smooth your hair down with your bristle brush., Take the bottom end of your hair strand and place a flex roller on top of it. Use your finger to initially hold the end in place. Roll the rod up towards your scalp.

, Work around your head, section by section. If you plan on finishing with large, chunky curls, try to keep each strand a consistent size. To do that, try to grab strands that are as equally thick as possible.This is not as important if you plan on separating the curls out into smaller ones.

Shingle your hair if necessary.",How to Make Black Hair Curly3," The most prevalent hair typing system separates hair into four different general groups by texture: Type 1 (straight), Type 2 (wavy), Type 3 (curly), and Type 4 (coily). Each of these types can be further broken down into three subtypes A-C. In general, the system moves from hair that is the most straight and moisture-retentive (1A) to hair that is the most textured and prone to drying (4C).If you are of African descent, your hair is most likely to be Type 3 or Type 4. Types 3C through 4C will benefit the most from curl enhancers.


Not everyone's hair fits perfectly in this system. You may find individual hairs that share the qualities of two different subtypes or you may have hair of more than one subtype.

, Some hair types work better with this method than other. Some special considerations for certain hair types include:


Types 3A and 3B: While these hair types are easier to straighten, they are also more prone to losing curl definition. Curl enhancers are much less likely to work.
Type 3C: This hair type is more prone to drying compared to other Type 3s and benefits from added moisturizing.Type 4A: This hair type is the one most prone to damage. High heat and harsh chemicals should be avoided.
Type 4B: This hair type is tightly coiled and holds styles better than Types 3 and 4A hair, making it ideal for wash and goes.
Type 4C: This hair type usually does not form individual clumps or curls on its own but may do so with curl enhancer. If the enhancer cannot form curls by itself, the product may be used to enhance other curling techniques., Each person's hair has its own unique set of properties. As such, finding the curl enhancer that's right for you will take some trial and error. However, knowing your hair type will help narrow down your choices. In general, Type 3 hair responds well to sprays, while Type 4 hair needs thicker products like gels and creams.


Until you know what works best for you, buy the smallest size available. While the cost per ounce will likely be higher than a larger size, you won't be saving any money if you need to toss most of it because it doesn't play well with your hair.
Ask around for sample-sized products. Many salons and beauty supply shops offer trial samples that are either very inexpensive or completely free. These samples typically have enough product to figure out if it's right for you.

, Be sure to moisturize your hair afterwards if necessary. Some curl-defining products are oil-based and hydrate your hair, making them enough of a moisturizer on their own. Other products are water-based and non-moisturizing, while still others contain harsh chemicals that can dry your hair out further. For these, you will definitely need an extra leave-in conditioner or hair oil to moisturize your hair.


In general, products called creams or custards will moisturize.Some curl creams can work as a leave-in conditioner for 3C and 4A hair., Start with a quarter-sized dab of definer and lather it between your palms. If your product is extra thick or sticky, try mixing in a few drops of water. Coat your hair with the product using your hands., Smooth down the length of your hair with your hands together in a ""praying"" position. Do this a few times until there is no visible residue. Be sure to distribute the product evenly from your roots on out. Detangle with your fingers if you find any knots.


If you're happy with your curl definition from the product alone, simply allow your hair to air dry. You don't have to do anything else to lock your curls in place.
If you're in a hurry, you can blow dry instead. Use a low heat setting to prevent damage. , If your hair is very thick, you will likely need to ""shingle"" each individual curl. This may sound like a daunting task, but it's very simple and with practice won't take too much time.


After applying your product while your hair is still wet, separate out a small strand of hair with your hand.
Add a little more product to the strand. Rake your fingers through your hair until it's slick and frizz-free. Detangle with your fingers as you go.
Pull the first strand to the side and move on to the next. Repeat until you have a head full of individual defined curls.Dry your hair as normal, locking in your curls.

Style your hair.",How to Get Curly Hair Without a Perm2," You may recognize these as the little pink curlers that you've seen in movies or your grandmother's house. They are super affordable and available at any beauty supply store. They come in many sizes, so get whatever size you want your curls to be.Not all foam curlers are pink, that is simply the most popular color. Any foam curlers will work just fine.

, Your hair should be freshly washed and still damp when you roll your hair in foam curlers. Your hair is more likely to hold the curl if it dries in place. If your hair has difficulty holding curl, add some gel or curl enhancing product to your hair before rolling it in curlers.

, As with rag curlers, it's easiest to divide your hair into sections before putting it in curlers. There should be three sections of hair: the right side, and the left side, and the middle. Hold each section in place with a hair tie.You will start with the middle section of hair, and then move on to the sides once you've finished.

, Start by opening the hinge on the roller so that the plastic clip is sticking out to the side. Starting at your hairline, roll a 1 inch piece of hair around the roller, all the way to the root. Once you reach the root, close the hinge over the rolled hair, and click it into place.Roll 1 inch pieces of hair into curlers all the way to the nape of your neck. This should take 4-8 curlers, depending on the size of the curlers and how much hair you have. At this point, you're curlers should be in a mohawk type shape.
After you've finished the middle section of your hair, roll the side sections of your hair into curlers, starting at your temple and working your way back. Each section should use 3-8 curlers.
The bigger the curlers, the fewer you'll need. The smaller the curlers, the more you'll need. If you have thin or short hair, you'll use fewer curlers. If you have long or thick hair, you'll use more curlers.
Tie a scarf around your head to keep your curlers in place overnight.

, To undo your foam curlers, un-snap the hinge of each curler and gently unroll one at a time. Start with the curlers by the nape of your neck and work upwards until all of the curlers are out. Your curls will be bouncy and close to your head., If you want messy, tight curls, do not brush out your hair. Instead, toss your curls gently with your fingers until you get your desired look. If you want luxurious waves and volume, brush your curls out. They'll look big and bouncy. Finish your hairstyle with hairspray."

Choose your curling iron.,
Prepare your hair.,
Divide your hair into sections.,
Curl your hair.,
Style your curls.",How to Get Curly Hair Without a Perm3," The type of curls you want will determine what size curling iron you should use. Do you want tight bouncy curls, or do you want luxurious waves? Be sure to use the proper curling iron to get the results you want.


For tight and bouncy curls, use either a 3/8"" or 5/8"" curling iron. These sized curling irons will give you tight spiral curls that will beautifully mimic the look of a perm.
For springy, bouncy curls that are larger near your scalp and tighter near the ends, use a curling wand. A curling wand will give your hair a pretty spiral curl.
For full curls or defined waves, use a 1"" curling iron. This size is recommended for shorter hair, and is great for creating beach-inspired hair styles.
For large, voluminous waves, use either a 1.25"" or 1.5"" curling iron. This is a must have curling iron for every day, body-filled waves., Wash your hair to remove all excess dirt and oil that could potentially weigh your hair down. Use a volumizing shampoo and conditioner to give your hair more body. While your hair is still damp, add a curl enhancing product or a mousse. This will help your hair hold the curls.How you dry your hair will depend on how you'd like your curls to look. If you want natural looking curls, let your hair air-dry before curling it. If you want full and voluminous curls, blow-dry your hair before curling it.

, Dividing your hair into sections will make curling your hair much easier. Pull the top half of your hair up and secure it with a clip or hair tie so that you're able to curl the bottom half of your hair first.Before you divide your hair into sections, plug in your curling iron so that it has time to heat up.

, Once your hair is completely dry, it is time to curl it. Starting with the bottom portion of your hair, grab pieces of your hair one small section at a time. Do not curl your hair by clamping it in your curling iron and rolling upward. Instead, hold the curling iron in place and wrap your hair around it. Starting close to your roots, wind your hair around the curling iron away from your face. Hold the bottom 1/4 inch of your hair in place for 10 seconds. Then, let go of your hair and gently pull the iron away from your hair. Do this to each piece of hair until the bottom half of your hair is curled.Unclip the top portion of your hair, and grab the first piece you'd like to curl. Curl the top of your hair the same way you curled the bottom. Starting near the roots, wind small pieces around your curling iron. Continue until you have curled all of your hair.

, If you want to keep your curls defined, lightly toss your hair with your fingers to give it a more natural look. If you want smooth yet big volume, comb your curls out with a wide-tooth comb.


Let your hair set until it is cool to the touch before you touch or comb your curls. Touching it too soon after curling can cause the curls to fall out.Finish your look by spraying your curls with hairspray.

Scrunch your hair.,
Apply hair product to enhance texture.,
Put your hair up overnight.,
Take your hair down.",How to Get Curly Hair Without a Perm4," The scrunching method will create curls, bends, and volume in your hair, and doesn't take a lot of technique to master. Scrunching your hair is similar to crumpling up a piece of paper, and is done with damp hair.


After you wash your hair, scrunch your hair while it is still damp. Squeeze small sections of your hair between your fingers, and crumple the ends up toward your roots. Look here for a more detailed guide about how to Scrunch Your Hair Overnight., Hair scrunching relies heavily on products like volumizing mousses, strong hold gels, and curl enhancing creams. Apply these products to your damp hair before scrunching into place to help your hair hold these bends and curls in place.To apply these texturizing products, rub a dime sized amount into your palms, and scrunch the product into your hair. You can use a few products as long as you use small amounts of all of them.

, This can be done by putting your hair in a scrunched bun (or buns if you have a lot of hair), or by plopping your scrunched hair into a head scarf or tied up t-shirt. Do not leave any pieces of hair out of your bun(s) or plop., If you have the time, allow your hair to scrunch overnight. This will allow it to dry in place and hold more shape. If you don't have all night, blow dry your hair while it's being held in place by your buns. Once you take your hair down, it should have a wavy, curly textured look."

Understand that curly hair really is beautiful.,
Look at famous icons with curly hair, even if it's not necessarily natural: Beyonce, Emmy ""Rossum"", Rose from ""Titanic,"" Sarah Jessica Parker, Kate Hudson, Debra Messing, etc.,
Treat your hair to deep treatments, since it is naturally drier than other hair types.,
Avoid the triangle look; this happens when your curls weigh the roots of your hair down and it creates flatness at the top and bulk at the bottom, resulting in your hair looking like a Christmas tree.,
Take care of your hair.,
Add moisture to your hair with a good daily conditioner and leave in conditioner every time you style your hair.,
Detangle and comb your hair in the shower with conditioner.,
Concentrate on making your natural hair look great instead of straightening your hair.,
Try out different hairdos if you're having a bad curly hair day.,

Get a good curly hair cut to show off your curls at their best.,
Be grateful for your voluptuous twisted locks.,
Love your hair.",How to Learn to Love Your Curly Hair," It's exotic, classy, striking, and most of all, unique. Think of it this way: do you really want to look like every other blonde, blue-eyed, straight-haired girl out there? How boring is that? Curly hair has had plenty of bullying in the media. You may find it hard to go natural at first, but one reason it's hard is that the media caters for wavy and straight hair. In most cases they don't pay attention to us ""curly heads"", so we may end up not knowing what to do with our hair. The first step is to accept our hair, know that it is beautiful, and treat it kindly.;
, Their hair is gorgeous and has so much more character than straight hair.

, Hot oil treatments are amazing with curly hair.

, Make sure you have a good hairdresser that knows curly hair, and knows proper techniques such as slicing and angling the layers down to reduce bulk. Cut curls at the end of each ""S."" Try styling and washing upside down, as well as clipping up the roots with clips to get more root lift.

, It's your hair, don't treat it like a wig or a mannequin; use heat protectors (a spray), and deep conditioners. Curly hair needs extra care-- there is no denying it.

, Curls lose moisture easily and tangle and knot very easily. Our hair is not going to be as naturally soft as straight hair; it's not in the genetic make-up. Use a satin pillow to stop your hair from tangling too much at night.

, It makes life so much easier.

, Curly hair can look amazing if styled well.

, Loose high buns, messy updos with face framing ringlets look gorgeous. Buns look best on curly hair on ear level or higher. The higher the better, but not too high. Make sure the bun is loose, and that the hair near the crown is lifted so there is volume. French braids and fishtail braids look good on curly hair.

, Cute vintage hair accessories look amazing on curly hair. Black and white lace bows, pretty jewel encrusted pins, and pastel coloured ribbons in white, pink, green and blue are a great way to finish off your bun or ponytail. Make sure the accessories are not trashy or cheap- looking.

, Fringes look good on curly hair if cut right. Always have your hairdresser cut face-framing pieces around your face. Stick with long layers. Do not go with short layers, or you will add way too much volume to your hair.

, You probably won't have the worry of greasy hair. Curly hair is special because it's different every day.

, It is, in the end, your natural hair, so why attack it and manipulate it? You were born with your curls, so just go with the flow, and embrace them. Be happy with your hair, love it, and wear it with confidence!

You can also use a bobby pin to help hold the hair in place if you are having trouble keeping it secured.

, Keep wrapping your hair around the rags until you have no hair left to wrap. Try to keep the sections as even as possible, but don’t worry about making them perfect.

, This could take a few hours for your hair to dry or you may have to leave your hair in the rags overnight. Don't take the rags out too early, or your curls may go limp.

a set of foam rollers in the size of your choice (small, medium, large, or extra large)
a wide-toothed comb
Some gel or mousse (optional)

, It is important to start with clean, tangle-free hair, so wash and condition your hair if you have not done so today. Try running a comb through your hair while it is still wet to help remove the tangles.

, If your hair is pin straight or doesn't hold a curl well, you might want to apply some styling gel or mousse. This will help your hair hold the curl better and longer.


Use a generous amount of mousse to ensure the best hold.
You can also look for a product specifically for making your hair curly.

, Take a small section of hair and wrap it around the hair roller, starting from the end of the strand and moving towards your scalp. Take a section of hair that is a bit narrower than the hair roller itself. Place the ends under the hair roller. Hold the hair against the roller, and start rolling everything towards your head. Secure the hair roller, if necessary.


Make sure that the hair rollers are positioned horizontally against your head.
You can part your hair down the middle and put the hair rollers on the left and right side of your hair.
You can also gather a section of hair from the very top of your head, and insert the hair rollers horizontally into it.

, It is important to make sure that your hair is totally dry before taking the hair rollers out. If you are in a hurry, you can use a blow dryer on a low or medium setting. If you take the hair rollers out too soon, your hair will fall limp and it may not curl at all.

, You can leave the curls in tight ringlets by not touching them at all or by just separating them into a few separate curls. If you want to keep your curls tight, then you may want to spray a bit of hairspray on them as well.


You can also soften your curls and spread them out by running your fingers through your hair.

Try using a special curling hair product, such as curling mousse. This may result in better curls.

, The more braids you make, the tighter curl you will get. Plan on having at least two braids, one on each side of your head.


For a tighter curl, try doing four braids. Note that this will only leave the bottom portion of your hair curly; the hair at the top of your head will still be mostly straight.

, Again, the more braids you put in, the tighter curl you will get. One or two braids will cause thicker waves, and five or six braids will cause smaller curls.

, Part your hair down the middle, then divide each side into two sections. Secure each section with a hair tie, so that you end up with four mini ponytails. Take the hair from the bottom left section and twist it into a rope. Keep twisting it until it curls in on itself and forms a bun. Secure the bun with another hair tie or some bobby pins. Repeat this for the bottom right, and the two top sections.


You can also use a sock bun or two to create more wave-like curls.

, This could take several hours. If you are in a hurry, you can use a blow dryer on a low or medium heat setting. You will get the best curls, however, if you let your hair dry overnight.

, When you take out the braids or buns, your curls may be very tight. You can fluff them up by running your fingers through them. Avoid brushing them, or you will cause them to frizz.

When using shampoo, try to use more on your scalp, and less on the ends of your hair.
When using conditioner, try to use more on the ends of your hair, and less on your scalp.

, Sulfates are harsh cleaning agents, and they can make your hair dry, brittle, and frizzy. That is why it is best to avoid shampoos and other hair products that contain sulfates.Look for hair products that are labeled as “sulfate-free.”
You might also consider only washing your hair every other day, or every third or fourth day.

, Never use a hairbrush on your hair when it is dry. This will break up the curl pattern and cause your hair to frizz. Instead, use a wide-toothed comb to tame your curls.Always start from the ends first, and never comb your hair from the roots straight down. This will cause your hair to snap and break.
You can, however, use a hairbrush on your curls while they are still wet. Make sure that you are brushing in small sections, starting from the ends first.

, If you must blow dry your hair, spray your hair down with a heat protecting spray first. Then, use a low or medium heat setting and a diffuser attachment. This will help maintain the natural pattern of your curls.


While your hair is still damp, try forming curls with your fingers. Wrap a curl around your finger tightly, then gently slip your finger out of the spiral. Repeat this for the other curls. This will help shape your curls, and make them flow in the same direction.

, Regular towels tend to be too rough on curls. The fibers can snag the delicate hair strands and cause them to rip or tear. Instead, try blotting your hair dry with a towel or t-shirt.

, There are many different products available at beauty stores and salons that will bring out your natural curls. Most of these need to be applied to your hair while it is still wet, while others can be used while your hair is dry.Here are some ideas to get you started:


Use mousse and gels on damp hair to enhance curls. Start with a grape-sized amount, and apply it with your fingers.
Use oils on dry hair to tame frizz. Start with a pea-sized amount, and focus on the ends. Try using natural Argan oil, coconut oil, or jojoba oil.
Use a sea salt spray to create beach waves. Keep in mind, however, that this can make your hair sticky. You can also make sea salt spray at home by just mixing sea salt with water.
Use an anti-frizz cream on dry or damp hair. Start with a grape-sized amount, and focus on the ends of your hair, as well as the outermost layer.

, Getting your hair trimmed regularly will help to eliminate split ends. You can also use this opportunity to even out any layers, or add layers to your hair. Layers are great for bringing out curls; straight, non-layered hair will weigh down your curls and make them appear straighter."

",How to Get Curly Hair to Turn Into Wavy Hair2," Shampoo contains harsh cleansers that strip the hair of natural oils and leave it dry, frizzy and poofy. Many curly-haired people have found that ditching shampoo entirely and choosing a moisturizing conditioner keeps curls shiny and bouncy, more like waves. Washing your hair with conditioner, known as ""co-washing"" is easy to do, and you'll save money if you don't have to use shampoo. Here's how to co-wash:Wet your hair in the shower, and massage conditioner into your scalp. Rub your scalp in a circular motion, and make sure you cover every spot.
Use your fingers to comb the conditioner through to the tips of your hair.
Wash it out using warm or cool water to seal up the cuticle so your hair won't frizz up.

, Curly-haired people don't need to wash their hair as frequently as those with straight hair. The natural oil your scalp produces takes a long time to travel down the coils of your hair to the tips. Washing it away too often will result in dry, brittle hair that looks frizzy instead of wavy. Cut back washing your hair to twice or even once a week and notice the results.

, Work through the tangles gently with a wide-toothed comb, and never a fine comb or brush. A wide-toothed comb will keep your strands of hair together instead of pulling them apart, which can end up making your hair poof up.

, Instead of roughly toweling your hair dry, use a soft, fluffy towel to dab away the extra water. Only use a hairdryer when you want to create a style for a special occasion; using one too often will result in damage to curly hair.

, Before your hair is completely dry, apply a little hair oil, anti-frizz serum or straightening serum. Use your fingers to comb it through your hair, focusing on the tips. As your hair finishes drying, the serum will soak in, and your hair will end up sleek and shiny with lots of movement.


Argan oil is a great natural solution that many curly-haired people swear by. It makes your hair look glossy and healthy.
Or try a tiny bit of coconut oil (a little goes a long way). It will protect your hair from getting frizzy throughout the day.

, This fun trick is great for both your hair and skin. Cotton pillowcases absorb moisture and oils, leaving your hair and skin dry in the morning. A silk pillowcase will keep your curls looking loose and pretty, rather than crushed and frizzy., If you really want your hair to look wavy instead of curly, having it chemically relaxed by a professional will give you the look you want. However, this is not a long-term solution, since over time this practice is damaging to curly hair.


When you get your hair relaxed, chemicals are applied to your hair that cause it to become permanently straight. Then your hair is permanently waved according to your specifications; you can choose tighter waves or looser waves.
Make sure you see a stylist who has experience working with very curly hair.

In order to ensure the curls last a long time, do not use as much shampoo or conditioner during your regular washes.",How to Make Curls Last Longer1," Conditioner straightens and smooths the hair, making it very difficult to curl.

",How to Get Natural Curls5," You can get a lot of natural curl in your hair by using bobby pins, which have been around for decades. Using bobby pins doesn't require any chemicals or costly products, either. Pin curling is the process of wrapping small strands of hair up in a loop, and pinning them to your scalp for several hours.Here's a list of what you will need:


Bobby pins
Mousse (optional)
Comb

, Your hair should not be dripping wet, or else it will take too long to dry. If necessary, blot your hair with a soft towel to remove excess moisture.


If your hair is very straight or doesn't hold a curl well, you might want to put some styling mousse into it., This will make it easier to tell which direction you should be curling your hair. When working on the left side of your head, you will be wrapping your hair clockwise. When working on the right side of your head, you will be wrapping your hair counter-clockwise. This will create a uniform curl.

, Make sure that the section is small enough to pin it flat against your head. If you make the hair section too thick, then it will take too long to dry. Also, the bobby pin won't hold the hair as well if the hair section is too thick.


Try using a comb to section your hair.
You may also want to clip up some of your hair so that you can focus on a smaller portion of your hair at one time.

, Try to make the section of hair as straight as possible. Start at the roots of your hair, and move the comb down towards the end of the section.

, Place the ends against your finger, and start wrapping it around your finger, all the way to the top of the section.

, As you pull your finger out of the center of the curl, be sure to hold the curl together with your other hand. Press it close to your head.

, As you are slipping the bobby pins through the curl, try to make an X shape with them. This will help to hold the curl securely in place.

, Remember to always curl your hair towards your face. This means that when you are working on the left side of your head, you are curling clockwise; when you are working on the right side of your head, you are working counter-clockwise.

, Your hair must be completely dry before you remove the bobby pins. If you are in a hurry, you can use a hair dryer on a low or medium heat-setting to speed up the drying process.


Your curls may be very tight once you remove the bobby pins. You can tease them a little by running your fingers through them. This will break them up a little and make them fluffy.

From natural oils like coconut oil to specialty products like hair mayonnaise and a protein pack, use the right combinations that work to keep your hair healthy.Consult a stylist or haircare specialist to find what works best for you.
There are natural essential oils and mixtures that can keep your hair moisturized like, lavender and rosemary if you are concerned with using a chemical formula.;
, Whether you use a professional or are create them on your own, braid about six big rows. Make sure to leave the front edges of your hair out. Specifically, leave the hair along your temples and front of your face out of your corn rows., You may twist your hair out or use a clip to keep them from your face. Treat your hair with a product like Jamaican castor oil to moisturize and strengthen the hair. Allow the product to work while you move onto your synthetic wig., Depending on your budget and timeframe, there are a variety of options when it comes to finding a weave best suited to create your wig. Whether you’re looking for curls, kinks, or straight hair, consult a hair care specialist or beauty supply store to familiarize yourself with your best options. Synthetic weaves are more cost-effective than ones made from real hair.


Most synthetic hair looks unrealistic. They may be made out of shiny plastic so choose one that looks as natural as possible. A curly weave looks more natural than a straight weave., Some people have hair that is curlier or kinkier than others. If you have extremely shiny kinky hair, do not choose a wig that has large curls without any shine.

, Weaves can come in a variety of colours so don’t settle on something that is significantly a different shade from your own hair. Weaves that have a mixture of dark and light strands may look more natural than ones that are a single shade., One pack of 3 bundles is enough for a full hair wig. You can use 2 textures: natural texture and the remy closure texture on top. However, if you want larger curls or generally more volume, choose the appropriate bundles of weave to complete your look., If you have sensitive skin or your scalp gets easily irritated, choose a breathable weaving cap with a mesh lining. Mesh is less itchy than plastic or synthetic linings. Mesh is also easier to manipulate and conceal.A breathable weaving cap allows you to wash your wigs and cut down on drying time. Find a soft elastic velvet that the skin on your head and neck do not get itchy and irritated.

, Whether you borrow your supplies from your friends or buy your own from a beauty supply store, you will need a styrofoam wig head, wig stand, weaving cap, hair-sewing thread and needle, scissors, tweezers, foundation, and hair care products. Create a budget to ensure that you choose the best products for your price. Look online for used beauty supplies to keep your costs low.

, You will need to know the circumference of your head and compare it to the circumference of the wig head. The second measurement you need to take is from your hairline to the nape of your neck. If your head is larger than the wig head, use wrapping tape and continually wrap it around the circumference of the wig head as many times as you need until it fills out the difference. Do the same from the hairline to the nape of the wig head’s neck., Use pins to secure your weaving cap onto the styrofoam head. Pin the elastic dome band along the front of the head, above the ears, and along the nape of the neck. Also, pin the unhooked elastic bands down so that they are out of the way. Make sure to place the styrofoam wig head onto the wig stand.Make sure to completely stretch your weaving cap down onto the wig head.

, Place wefts of hair -- essentially, small curtains or bunches -- onto the weaving cap. Thread your needle and thread through the cap and around the track or the weft of the hair. Pull the needle through the loop of the thread as it comes up to securely form a thread track. This method helps to lay the tracks flush against the wig cap.Don’t sew through the weave tracks because it slows you down and may cause shedding after too much wear.

, The fold is going to be at the edge of the cap. Pin down the new row to hold it in place as you secure the new row of weave. Go right back through the edge of the cap and both of the wefts with the needle and hair thread. Use the same blanket stitch method twice on the small fold at the end of the track to make sure that the fold is very flat and flush to the edge of the cap.There shouldn’t be anything sticking out or funny around the wig if you double blanket stitch the fold.

, Use 2 fingers as spacing in between each track of hair that you lay down. As you get closer to the top of the wig head, start to space out each track closer together using just one finger for spacing.Use the fold over method to keep the layers of weave together as a wig. Start off by sewing through the thickest part of the cap and go through the actual weft of the hair so that you’re sure that it’s down nice and tight.

, Pin down a bundle from the forehead to the nape of the neck and sew all the way around to make sure that it’s down. You will be sewing along the centre of the styrofoam head, from the forehead to the nape of the neck. Make sure that you are covering the lace and that the tracks are secure. Use a regular stitch to make sure you’re securing the lace closure nice and tight to the weaving cap all the way around with a vertical stitch., Whether it’s uneven hair, odd patches, or excess mesh lining, use scissors to personalize your look. Cut off excess mesh at its hairline to ensure that it never shows when you wear it., Pluck out random strands of hair to clean up your part and create a smooth transition to your natural hair. Don’t remove too much hair or you may look like you have thinning hair or a bald spot.Create a natural part. Don’t try to create a completely straight line because it will look unnatural.

, This may take trial and error depending on the material of the wig. Your wig won’t take the same shades as your real skin so you may have to use colours that are a couple shades darker or lighter than what you normally use.Don’t be afraid to use a variety of colours until the wig matches your scalp and looks natural. Be liberal with the makeup as you apply it onto the meshing of the wig. Keep in mind that the meshing may take a while to get your desired look.

, Add some talc powder to a hair brush and brush through your wig. The combination of brushing and talc powder removes some of the shine from synthetic hair. This will give you a more natural and muted look., Using your fingers, separate the curls in your wig to increase the volume. For a natural look you don’t want your wig to just lay there. Add shape and depth by increasing the volume.Detangle your wig every day using your hands in order to prevent knotting. If you use a comb you may pull out the hair or damage the wig., Breath some life back into your hair before applying your weave especially if it looks dry matted. Avoid using any oil as this will make the ends stick together., Use a needle and hair thread for maximum security. If you do not have the time, you can also use bobby pins. Hair thread is a lot more secure than bobby pins, which tend to fall out if you play with your hair or are planning to be active., Placing the wig just behind your natural hairline, sew it to the cornrowed hair at the middle of your head, the back of your head, the nape of your neck, and at both sides of your head. If you have chosen to create a part in your hair, also sew your wig at the part.Depending on your time and budget, you may seek a hair care specialist to attach your wig. Don’t be discouraged if this is your first time. With time and practice you will become more proficient at applying both a secure and natural look.

, As you have placed your weave behind your natural hairline and kept the natural hair at the edges of your face in twists or clipped, unravel your natural hair once you’re satisfied with the positioning of your wig.Adjust your natural hair together with the wig you have just made out of weave to create a natural looking blend. Ensure that the texture is maintained throughout your head. Make sure your natural hair still has the same type of kink or curl as your wig.

Lift an approximate 2""(5cm) width of hair starting directly from the root of the parting with the forefinger and middle finger of your less dominant hand.

,
You should only be holding a thin top layer of the hair.,
Picture this: Pretend your fingers are scissors and you have to cut the hair.,
Place the inked sponge edge at the roots, above where you are holding and slowly slide both the sponge and your fingers TOWARDS yourself.

,
As you reach the end of the hair length, gently curl your wrist AWAY from you with your thumb gradually facing the floor while maintaining the position of your fingers.

,
The back of your hand is now facing you, and that works like a support for the sponge to color all the way to the tips.

,
Repeat throughout the entire wig.

,
Clip up the completed portions, so that they do not obstruct wherever you are working with at the moment.

,
It is best to revolve the wig stand, so that the portions you are working on face you, rather than you climbing all over the place to reach an uncolored spot.

,
Squeeze more ink as you need along the way.,
Take the other clean sponge and a new dish.

, You will quite naturally position your 2 fingers parallel to your lips.

,,,,,,, Do not leave the ink lying on the dish as it dries out very quickly.

,, Go over the Blue with the Darker Blue in some underlying layers of the hair or streak the fringe and sides.

,,,, Brush out any clumps or tangles in the wig gently after it is dry.

, This removes the smell of the marker ink.

You may also wish to apply a heat-protective spray to your hair before using the iron since it can be dangerous the first few times. These sprays can be found at any beauty store.

, Since heat is what makes the hair curl, it is important that the curling iron is very hot before you start to curl. It should be 200 degrees or above.


Do not use a cheap iron. Invest in a more expensive, reliable iron which will provide consistent heat.

, Go at a consistent pace so that the iron does not have time to burn your hair.


Be sure to avoid letting the iron sit in one place too long.
Do not let the iron touch your skin since it is very hot.

, Leave the pin in for around 10-15 minutes.


This will help hold the curl in and should increase the time the curls stay in your hair.

The length of your lace front piece is up to you.Next, measure from side to side. Hold the tape measure just in front of one ear, where the hairline ends. Wrap the tape measure over the head, to the same spot in front of the opposite ear.To get the most accurate measurement of the head, you'll need to flatten the hair. You can wet the hair to flatten it, or put your hair in a flat style, such as corn rows.;
, Take a piece of plastic wrap large enough to fit over the head. Wrap it tightly over the top part of the head. Keep it as tight as possible, and fasten it at the back. Apply clear adhesive tape to the plastic wrap to begin forming the pattern.


Start by taping from side to side. Secure a piece of tape over one ear, and run the tape over the top of the head to the other ear. Make sure the plastic wrap is secure, but not too tight.
Tape from front to back. Cover the entire head with tape until the pattern feels rigid.
Trace the hairline using a soft pencil. Start in the front and go just over the ears. Tape over the pencil to keep it from erasing or smudging.

, Carefully remove the pattern from the head and prepare to pin it to your wig block.


Take some stuffing and place it in the pattern. Place the pattern on a wig block and secure it using balled straight pins. Once the pattern is secure on the block, go back through and add straight pins along the hairline., Use the pattern to measure a piece of lace. You'll need some extra lace to work with, so don't cut the piece to the exact size of the pattern.You may need to dye the lace to get it to match your skin tone. If you need to dye the lace, do it now, before you secure it to your pattern.
You can find wig lace online or you can by similar fabrics at a craft store.

, Drape the lace over the pattern on the wig block. Secure the lace along the hairline using balled straight pins. Once you have the lace secured to the wig block, trace the entire hairline using small straight pins.Take care not to let the lace get ruffled as you work. Keep it smooth and tight.
Once the front hairline is completely pinned, smooth the lace down to the back of the pattern. Secure the back with a straight pin and continue the pinning process in the back. Continue to keep the lace tight as you work.You may end up having to fold some of the lace in the back to keep it flat on the pattern. Pin the tip of the fold to secure it, and then sew the open end of the fold shut., Remove all the pins from the lace and take the cap off the pattern. Test the fit of the cap and make any necessary adjustments., To sew the hair into the lace, a process known as ventilating, you will need a ventilating needle. Ventilating needles have hooks on the tip to loop the hair into the lace. Hooks come in a variety of sizes. The size number represents the number of strands you can thread at a time.Find a source for the hair you'll be using. You can buy synthetic or human hair online. The size of your lace front will determine the amount of hair you need.

, Secure the lace cap to the wig block. Hold some hair in one hand, and your ventilating needle in the other. Make a loop with the hair so that you can easily hook your needle through the strands.Hook the needle through the lace and use the hook to grab a few strands of hair. Don't overload the needle with hair. Refer to the number on the hook to see how much hair it can hold.Hold the hair tight while you're threading.Start the process at the hairline and work your way back. Use tight clusters of hair on the hairline. As you move towards the back of the piece, you can add more space between your knots., Pull the hair through the lace. As you pull, hook the needle around the hair to create a loop. Thread the hair through the loop and pull tight to make a knot.Repeat this process for the entire lace front piece. Ventilating is a time consuming task. One square inch may take several hours.

, Once you've added hair to the entire cap, take a look at the hairline. Make any final adjustments to the hairline as necessary. Use this opportunity to get the lace front exactly how you want it.Remove the cap from the wig block and do a test fitting. Make sure the lace front piece fits correctly. Check the sides and the hairline.

, Once you have finished the ventilation process, trim away any extra lace. Leave a small border in front of the hairline to make applying the wig easier., Use a non-oily soap to wash your face and neck. Pay special attention to the hairline. Apply a scalp protector to the skin just below your hairline.The scalp protector protects your skin from the adhesive used to apply the wig, and keeps skin oils from weakening the bond of the adhesive. Let the scalp protector dry completely before attaching the wig., Before applying your wig, pull your hair back into a bun or a ponytail. You may need to wear a wig cap depending on the length of your hair.

, You can use a liquid adhesive or a special double-sided wig tape. If you are using the liquid adhesive, spread a thin layer around the perimeter of your head, just below the hairline. The glue needs to be tacky before you can apply the wig. Depending on the brand of adhesive, this could take several minutes. Use a blow dryer set to cool to speed the process.Once the glue is tacky, place the wig on your head, and press the hairline of the front piece onto the glue line. Hold the wig onto the glued area. Apply constant pressure until the wig is secure and can stay on by itself. Let the glue dry completely before you style the wig.To use wig tape, cut a piece of tape to fit the perimeter of your head, just below your hairline. Apply the tape to your forehead. Line the wig up so that the hairline is just on the edge of the tape. Peel the back of the tape off, revealing the other sticky side. Press the lace onto the adhesive, starting with the front hairline. Hold each section for about 30 seconds to make sure the wig is securely attached."

The tape measure should wrap just above the ears on either side of your head.
Do not pull the tape measure. It should lie flat against flattened hair, but it should not be taut.;
, Place the end of a cloth tape measure at the center of your forehead, matching the end of the tape measure to the beginning of your natural hairline. Drape the tape measure over the crown of your head and down to the middle of the nape, where you natural hairline ends.


As before, do not pull the tape measure. It should lie flat against flattened hair without being taut.

, Bring the end of the cloth tape measure to the uppermost point at which your ear connects to the rest of your head. Drape the tape measure over the crown of your head and back down to the same position of the opposite ear.


The tape measure should rest on both ears along the point at which eyeglasses or sunglasses would sit.
Once again, the tape measure should lie flat against flattened hair but should not be pulled tight.

, Draw a rough sketch of the perimeter of your head based on the measurements you took. Use your cloth tape measure to measure out the same distances for the perimeter of your head, the crown of your head, and the distance between your ears.


Alternatively, you could find a cotton lace cap or other fine net cap that will fit your head and place that over the wig block. It will not be a custom fit, but doing this can be easier than trying to form and apply strips of cotton lace.

, Line cotton ribbon along the perimeter of your wig outline, as drawn previously. Gently hammer this ribbon onto the wig block using small nails.


If you decide to use a Styrofoam head instead of a wooden wig block, you can use sewing pins instead of nails to attach the ribbons.
Make sure that the ribbons are as flat as possible on the wig block.

, Moisten strips of cotton lace by quickly spritzing them with water from a spray bottle. Drape the strips of cotton lace over the wig block and stitch them to the ribbon.


Note that the strips of cotton lace must be at least as long as the measurement you took for the crown of your head. They can, however, be a little longer at this point. Use as few strips as possible, opting for larger pieces rather than many smaller ones.
Pin the lace in place before sewing it onto the ribbon.
You can find cotton lace in a variety of colors, but avoid lace with patterns already embroidered into it.
Wetting the lace beforehand makes it easier to form and shape.

, Remove the nails from the ribbon and take the wig foundation off the wig block. Try it on to determine if it fits correctly.


If the wig foundation does not fit correctly, determine why not. Return the foundation to the wig block and make any adjustments you need to make in order to fix the fit.
When everything fits the right way, trim off any excess cotton lace that hangs past the ribbon border of the wig foundation

, Generally, for a wig that will be worn every day, you would want to use real hair. For a wig only worn on occasion, you might be able to use synthetic hair.


Natural hair look more realistic, tends to be more durable, and can tolerate heat and other styling products better. On the other hand, wigs made from real hair must be restyled after washes, the color can fade with light exposure, and the wigs can become damaged more easily.
Synthetic hair does not look as realistic and can be damaged by heat and hair dye. On the other hand, wigs made from synthetic hair tend to be lighter, do not need to be restyled after washes, and do not fade as quickly.

, Run handfuls of hair through a hair heckle to detangle, straighten, and sort the hair. Pull and tie it into sections using hair elastics.


A hair heckle consists of a sturdy base with five rows of pointed needles. It can straighten hair and blend multiple shades together.
Bolt the heckle down before using it.

, Lay one end of each hair section onto one drawing mat. Place the other drawing mat on top of the hair so that the pointed sides of both mats meet.


Drawing mats are leather rectangles with short wires or needles along one side. They are used to keep hair straight and organized.

, The right size depends on the number of strands you want in a single knot. For more strands, choose a larger needle. For fewer strands, choose a smaller one.


If you have lace with very fine gaps, you might need to use fewer strands per gap, so you would choose a smaller needle.
For lace with larger gaps, the number of strands will influence the fullness of the wig. More strands will create a fuller, fluffier wig, while fewer strands will create a flatter style.

,









Fold the end of a thin section of hair to form a loop.
Hook this loop with your ventilating needle and push it through one of the gaps in the lace foundation.
Maneuver the needle so that you can grab the hair at the base of the loop with the hook, pulling it back through the gap of the lace. This should give you a new loop of hair that wraps around the edge of the gap.
Knot the strands of hair once or twice onto the cotton edge of the gap. Make sure that the knot is fully tightened and closed so that the hair stays in place. You will need to pull the entire length of the section through the knot as you tighten it.
Note also that you should be using your free hand to hold the other side of the hair taut as you work throughout this entire process.

, You should always start knotting the wig onto the lace from the bottom of the neckline. Work your way up along the back before moving to the sides. After reaching the sides, work your way over the crown of the head.









The hair on the sides should be tied with double knots.
The hair on the top of the wig, or on the crown, should be tied on using single knots. This prevents the hair from looking too thick.

, Once you reach the crown of the wig, you should mentally separate the top into six separate directions and tie the strands off evenly in each of those directions.









Do not merely tie the strands so that they fall in one single direction, since this will not look natural.
You should have two sections that extend straight down from either side of the wig, and the other four sections should be evenly spaced between these initial two.

, Turn the wig inside out and stitch hair along the inside edge of the ribbons to prevent them from showing from the front.

, Use a needle and thread to sew a few short steel springs around the temples, neck, and forehead of the wig. This will help the hair lift in a natural, pleasant manner.









The springs should only by a few loops wide and should not be visible from under the hair.

, With all the hair sewn in place, part the wig as you would do with a normal head of hair and cut the hair into your desired style.









If you are anxious about cutting the hair into a good or flattering style, you might want to ask a hair stylist for some tips or ask if he or she will cut the wig for you.

, Try the wig on. It should now be complete, but if anything looks off, you should still be able to adjust it.

, You can make a quick, inexpensive wig for a costume using a balloon, hair net, wefts of hair, and glue.


Inflate the balloon and use it as a dummy head.
Place the hair net over the balloon and glue the hair onto it.
Trim away unwanted portions when done.

, You can create a wig to mimic the appearance of a jellicle cat from the Cats musical using sheets of faux fur.


Measure your head for the correct shape and size.
Create a pattern using your measurements and cut the faux fur out according to this pattern.
Create and attach fake cat ears.

, Doll wigs can be made out of yarn. You can create one with or without a sewing machine.

, You can make a large wig in the ragdoll style for a costume. Use yarn, and either sew or glue the wig into shape.

, Another way to make a costume wig is with a clean mop. Color the mop as desired and glue the individual mop strands to a hat."

Decide if you prefer a synthetic wig or a human hair wig.,
Consider your lifestyle.,
Look for a wig that flatters the shape of your face.,
Select a wig that compliments your skin tone.,
Go to a wig store.,
Measure the circumference of your head.,
Try the wig on to ensure it is comfortable.,
Use the adjustable band so the wig stays in place.,
Protect the wig from heat.,
Wash a human hair wig with mild shampoo and conditioner.,
Use synthetic wig shampoo and wig conditioner to wash a synthetic wig.,
Brush the wig out before you put it on.",How to Buy a Wig," Most wigs are either made of out synthetic fibers, real human hair, or a combination of the two.Synthetic wigs are especially great for holding volume with short hair styles. They are often referred to as ""shake-n-go"" wigs because you can simply shake them out as you pick them up and then put them on.If you are experiencing hair loss due to chemotherapy treatment, most hair grows back within six months of your last treatment. Many cancer patients prefer a synthetic wig because they are a more affordable and temporary option. They generally cost between $50-$500.
Wigs made of human hair tend to be more versatile in that you can style them in multiple ways (in a ponytail, bun, with curls or beachy waves). And while they generally remain in good condition longer than synthetic wigs, they also require more maintenance.
Human hair wigs are often more expensive and can range between $600-$4,000 (very long wigs are the priciest).You can also look for a wig with a lace front cap. This will help position the hair around your face in a natural shape (not as a harsh seam of hair on your head).;
, What kind of needs do you have for your haircare routine? Will you want a wig that you can put on with minimal styling and care or do you want something that can be elaborately styled?You should also think about if you need a wig that you can wear comfortable when you exercise.

, Your wig can be most flattering if you pick one that enhances the shape of your face. Here are some general guidelines:


Round faces. These generally look best with short, spiky pixie wigs, hair that graces the collarbone, or with longer layers that hit at the jawline (but not above it).Heart-shaped faces. Consider a short pixie cut that can be tousled and has some texture (like Halle Berry), a shoulder length wig with side-swept bangs, or long layers with a fringe of bangs.Oval face shapes. For shorter hair, look for a shaggy bob (or lob -- long bob). For long hair, look for a wig that holds layered curls or waves.Pick a wig that can hold lots of volume as this will make your face appear fuller.Square faces. For square faces, picks wigs that will soften your jawline, such as a longer, angled bob, a shoulder length style with soft layers, or a wig with an off-center part., You should have a general idea of which color you want before you go to buy your wig. You might be tempted to try something very different once you are in the store, but it's best to stick with colors that you know will work for you. Skin tone types generally fall into three categories: warm, cool and neutral.Determine what skin tone you have if you don't know already. Warm skin tones tend to have brown, hazel, or green eyes. If you tan easily, then you most likely have warm skin tones.
By contrast, if you burn easily and have a ruddy color to your skin, then you are cool-toned. Neutral skin tones will often not have an obvious undertone to their skin (neither yellow or pink) and will, therefore, be compatible with most hair colors.Warm skin tones can generally wear colors like honey blondes, chestnut browns, ebony brown-black shades or copper colored reds.
Cool skin tones can generally wear platinum blondes, ash browns, auburn reds or inky, raven blacks.Talk to your hairstylist before you go to buy your wig about the ideal cut or color you should look for in a wig.

, Once you have selected the wig you would like to buy, you can go into your nearest wig store and buy one in person. Look for synthetic wigs or human hair wigs, based on your preference. Wigs can range in cost from $50 to hundreds of dollars. Make sure you find a wig that fits your needs and your budget.


You can also buy wigs online at online wig boutiques. However, when buying a wig online, you should have a good sense of the cut, color, and style of wig you are looking for to ensure it fits your needs. You can also use your measurements to buy a wig that will fit your head properly.
If you are a cancer patient who is buying a wig as part of the chemotherapy process, your insurance company may cover part or all of the cost of the wig. There are also certain organizations, like the Breast Cancer Society, who give wigs out for free. Talk to your doctor about your insurance options and reach out to cancer support programs in your area to see if you qualify for a free wig or a discount on a wig., Whether you buy your wig in person or online, you will need to know the size of your head.


Take a cloth measuring tape and wrap it around your head. It should start in the middle of your forehead, go down to the base of the skull where the wig will end, and then wrap back up to meet the start of the tape on the forehead.Make sure as you wrap the tape around your head, that you keep the tape above your ears.
The average size of a head's circumference is 22 inches., Testing the fit of the wig is the most important element of the buying process. You want to make sure the cap of the wig fits snugly on your head without irritating your scalp.Many caps in wigs come with tabs that can be adjusted to fit the size of your scalp. But you should aim to find a wig that is the closest fit to the circumference measurement of your head.
Some wigs also contain double-sided tape used to secure the wig in place.If you are bald, you may want to wear a skull cap pieces inside the cap to prevent the wig from irritating your skin.If you are wearing a wig over your natural hair, some wigs can be securely attached to hairpins or comb pieces.
Make sure your wig comes with a good return policy. If your wig irritates the skin on your scalp, then make sure you will be able to return it or exchange it for a more comfortable wig.
If you buy your wig online, it should also have an excellent return policy.

, You may be worried about keeping your wig in place when you wear it, but may wigs come with an adjustable band that you can fit to your head so the wig stays secure.You can also buy a cushion band, which is a gel filled headband that you put on under the wig. The cushion band will make the wig more comfortable to wear and relieve any pressure points caused by wearing the wig.
You can also use a wig gripper, which is an adjustable headband made of fabric that creates friction around your hairline. This friction will help the wig stay in place.
Some people also use toupee clips, which clip into your own hair and into the wig to keep the wig in place.

, Most wigs can become damaged by heat if you open an oven door or cook over a stove stop. If you want to wear your wig while cooking or baking, then wear a turban or tuck it under a hat to protect it.You should never use a hair dryer, a curling iron or other drying aids on the wig, as this can damage the wig fibers., Synthetic and human hair wigs should be washed every six to eight wears, especially if you keep the wig on for a prolonged period of time every time you wear it. You should always brush the wig gently with a wig brush before you wash it to remove any tangles, regardless of if you have a synthetic hair wig or a human hair wig. If the wig is curly, run your fingers lightly through the wig to remove any tangles before washing.To wash a synthetic hair wig, turn the wig inside out and immerse it in a bowl of cold water and a small amount of mild shampoo. Swirl the wig gently in the water and let it soak for about five minutes.
Rinse the wig one to two times until all the shampoo is removed. Then, apply conditioner to the wig and let it sit for two minutes so it penetrates the hair. Use cold water to rinse the wig until all the conditioner comes off the wig.
Once the conditioner is removed, wrap the wig in a dry towel and pat the wig gently. You can spray a very light coat of conditioning spray, 10-12 inches away from the wig, as an optional final step. Let the wig dry on a wig stand and then brush or comb it with a wig brush. Avoid placing the wig in direct sunlight and do not try to brush the wig while it is still wet.

, Do this every six to eight wears and always brush the wig with a wig brush before washing. You can find synthetic wig shampoo and wig conditioner at your local hair supply store.Pour two capfuls of synthetic wig shampoo into a sink or basin of cold water. Then, turn the wig inside out and immerse it in the water. Swirl the wig gently in the water and soak it for about five minutes. Use cold water to rinse the wig until all the shampoo is gone.
Pour one to two capfuls of wig conditioner on the wig. Let the fibers absorb the conditioner, sitting for about two minutes. Use cold water to gently remove all the conditioner from the wig.
Take a dry towel and wrap the wig with it, patting out any excess water. Never rub the wig when it is wet.
Spray a revitalizing conditioner over the wig to condition the wig fibers. Let the wig dry completely on a wig stand. Only brush the wig when it is dry.

, Only brush the wig when it is dry and use a wig brush, as this will ensure the wig fibers are not pulled or damaged. A regular hairbrush or comb can stretch and stress the fibers."

Measure your head using a tape measure.,

The pattern on the right will be your base pattern.,
Trace the pattern on your fur (on the non-furry side) with your sewing marking pen.,

Sew two pieces together by folding the insides together.,
Sew one side of the piece to the other piece, again, insides folded together.,



 Now it's time to attach some ears.,

Sew them onto the base: I'll admit that this is the small flaw with my method of wig making.,
How to make a multi-colored wig, such as Munkustrap or Alonzo: This is essentially the same method, except you cut the base pattern into quarters.,
Extras: Grizabella: Buy a curly wig either online or (if you live in the U.S.) go to Party City and buy a ""Yo Mama"" wig and stretch out the curls.,
Extras: Old Deuteronomy: Make a brown wig and buy a costume beard of the same color.,
Extras: Cassandra/Coricopat/Tantomile: If you wish to make a wig for these characters in keeping with the style of your faux fur wigs, go to the fabric store and buy some short faux fur (similar to the fabric on the right).",How to Make an Easy Jellicle Wig," What I did was make a homemade manikin head that was the size of my head.
, Draw the pattern to scale on a piece of paper (8"" x 6 1/2""). Do a neat job- you want it as accurate as possible (make sure your measurements are precise!). Cut out the pattern.*Note: you can adjust the measurements to fit your head size. My head is 22"" around and my first finished wig was a little on the loose side. Just to give you a general idea., You will need four pieces. Cut out all four pieces., Notice that they round at the end. This is half of the base! Put that half to the side, and sew together the remaining two pieces. Now you have two halves., Then sew the last side. You now have a complete fur wig base.,

Now it's time to make some ears: You can either replicate the pattern I made (on the right) or simply cut out two triangles. I recommend cutting out the pattern on cardboard because you'll have it for future projects. If you decided to cut out two triangles, sew the sides together just like you did for the wig. Finally, sew the other sides together. Fold the piece inside out and you have an ear! If you want to ensure that the ears are stiff, you can either stuff them with cotton or slip a triangular cardboard piece into them. This will keep them erect.  Important note: Do not sew the sides all the way down. Sew down until there's about an inch long slit. This is how you'll sew it on to the wig., It's very tricky sewing the ears on to the base, because the only way to do so is to sew them on top! I have no tricks to attaching them on, unfortunately. This is why I advise leaving a slit in the ears, because it will be easier to stitch. Poke the needle through the slit and base, do your best to feel around for the needle, and poke it back up and through. It won't be the prettiest stitching in the world, but as long as the ears are secure, you're fine. It can also be tricky getting them in the right spots. Put the wig on your manikin and use your tape ruler to do a neat job. Look in the mirror and hold the ears up to your head to figure out where you would like them. I had to undo the stitch a few times because they were crooked. It can be tedious, but stick with it. Once you've done it a couple of times, it will become easier., Cut the pattern in half, and then cut the two pieces in half. You will have mini strips. Sew the strips together. For a solid multi-colored wig such as Bombalurina, simply cut the pattern in half and use different colored faux fur. , Pinch the hair together and tie them together to make the ears, or make your own. Easy-peasy!, Sew to wig. Or simply buy a pre-made wig and beard combo and attach ears., Or buy whatever fabric you think will work best. Make your wig base. For the ears, cut out a long rectangular piece and sew the sides together to create a long tube. Sew the piece on the side of the wig."

Prepare the wig.,
Place the wig on your head.,
Secure the wig.,
Style and accessorize.",How to Apply a Wig," There are three major kinds of wigs: the full lace, the partial or front lace, and the non-lace. There are also three main materials they can be made out of, which are human hair, animal hair, and synthetic hair. Each wig type has its pros and cons, so make sure you buy the wig that is best for you.


The full lace wig is made with a lace mesh cap and the hair sewn into it throughout. It gives you a natural looking hairline, is more frequently made with human or animal hair, and is easier to style because they can be parted anywhere. It also allows more comfort when you are wearing it because it breathes more. The downside is that these wigs can often much more expensive than other types of wigs.These can also get damaged easier because they are not made of more durable fabric.
The front or partial lace wig is made with lace mesh at the front instead of all the way around. It gives you a natural looking hairline on your forehead, but it is made of more durable materials around the main part of your head. These wigs can be made of any of the materials and are cheaper than full lace wigs. The downside is that these wigs are not as natural looking as full lace and can be harder to style because of the way the wig is made.
Non-lace wigs are made on materials such as nylon mesh. These wigs can be made with any type of hair material, are more durable, and are much less expensive than other wigs. The downside is that these wigs don't look as realistic as other wigs and don't blend into the hairline as easily as lace wigs.;
, You need to fix your hair so it will not make bumps or uneven places once you have your wig on. Whether you have long or short hair, you need to ensure that all of your natural hair is pulled back from your hairline so it won't be visible under the wig.


If your hair is long, you can separate the hair into two pieces and twist them, crossing the two pieces behind your head. Attach them across the top and bottom with bobby pins.
If you have long and thick hair, you can do small 1 inch twists curls and pin them all around your hair. Grab a 1 inch wide portion of your hair and twist it, wrapping the end around your forefinger. Curl the strand down toward your head, making a 1 inch wide circle with your hair. Once all the hair is in the curl, pin it with two bobby pins, making an X over the curl. Do this for the entirety of your hair. This will give you a smooth surface on which to apply your wig.
Shorter hair can simply be combed and pinned away from the hairline. You can also use a stretchy cloth headband or similar item to push your hair away from your hairline., Wipe the skin around your hairline with a cotton pad dipped in alcohol solution. This removes any access oils and impurities from your skin, which will help the glue or adhesive tape stick better to your skin. Next, apply a scalp protector, which can be a spray, gel, and cream, to the areas around your scalp. This will protect this sensitive skin from irritation and damage from the glue or adhesive tape.









Even if you don't have hair and have skipped the previous step, make sure you prepare your skin.

, You can use either a net wig cap or skin toned nylon wig cap. The net cap breathes a little more while the skin toned cap mimics the color of your scalp under your wig. To apply, gently stretch the cap over your head and line it up perfectly with your hairline, making sure all of your hair is underneath it. Secure it in place with a few bobby pins around the outer edges.


Whether you have long or short hair, you need to use a wig cap under your wig. If you don't have any hair, this step is optional. It may prevent some wig slippage but isn't necessary to help smooth out the hair area., For the wig glue, dip a small makeup brush into the glue and apply a thin layer of it around your hairline. Let it dry. This may take a few minutes. You will know it is done when the glue is no longer thin and wet and is instead sticky and tacky. For the adhesive tape, gentle place double-sided strips along your hairline, securing it to you skin. Leave a small space between each strip of tape. This will ensure that moisture can get out when you sweat and it won't compromise an entire section of tape.You don't have to let the tape dry.









To ensure that the wig and wig cap don't slip, apply the glue or tape slightly on the edge of the cap. This will adhere the wig, the cap, and your skin together, making it more stable.
You can use a combination of these two methods. It is up to you.
You don't have to apply glue or tape to your entire scalp line, but make sure you place some at the front of the forehead and on your temples. These are necessary areas for a natural looking wig. You can then choose any other areas which you think need it and place the adhesives there., Before you can apply the wig, you need to make sure the wig hairs won't get caught in the glue or adhesive tape. Make sure you pull all of the wig hair into a ponytail. Or, if the wig hair is short, clip back the hair closest to the edge.


If you are working with a full or half lace wig, cut the lace to match your hairline. Make sure you don't cut too much off and disrupt the natural hairline of the wig. Leave a little bit on the edge so it can be glued to your head in a natural looking way.
Don't worry about styling your wig now. It will get messed up during the application process. You will be able to style it after application., Hold your finger at the area of the wig that will be at the center of your forehead. Put it over your head and gently lay it down on your scalp, centering your finger on your forehead. After this, gently pull the rest of the wig over your head. Make sure you keep the sides away from the adhesive as much as possible so it doesn't stick before you're ready.








Don't bend over and put your wig on upside down. This will give your wig an uncentered look and might stick parts of the hair to the adhesive material before you're ready.
If you are putting a wig on for the first time, allow enough time to adjust the wig before you need to leave the house. It may take practice to get it perfect.

, Regardless of the type of adhesive you used, you need to secure the wig to your head. Once you have your wig where you want it, use a fine toothed comb to gently press down the front edges of the wig. If you're using a lace wig, make sure the lace areas are smooth against your head, making a natural hairline. Once the front half of your wig is secure, wait 15 minutes for it to set. Then follow the same steps as the front on the back portion. Wait 15 more minutes before you style to ensure the wig is secure.








You can also use bobby pins to make your wig feel more secure. Place bobby pins through the top of your wig, hooking them into your wig cap and hair underneath. Do this more towards the middle to ensure they aren't visible.Once it's in place, check to see if there is any glue residue visible under the wig. If there is, remove it by gently rubbing the areas with a cotton pad dipped in alcohol solution.
If you don't get the placement of your wig right on the first try, gently run a Q-tip dipped in alcohol solution around the area to detach it from your skin. Re-position your wig and reapply., Once your wig is completely secure, you are free to style your hair as you wish. You can be as fun and adventurous as you want. Wigs can be braided, curled, or accessorized to your heart's content. If you have a synthetic wig, avoid heating the strands because they may melt or get damaged.You can have your wig cut into a style that fits your face before you apply it. This will make the wig feel more like you and appear more natural on your head.
Remember that less is always better. Whether your wig is made of human hair, animal hair, or synthetic materials, don't use too much product because it leaves residue on your wig.

First, dab a small amount of liquid adhesive or double-sided wig tape onto the back of your hand. Next, observe the adhesive for at least twenty four hours.If the skin becomes red or irritated, purchase a hypoallergenic wig tape or adhesive to use instead.
If the skin is unaffected, you can safely wear the wig.;
, The flatter your hair is against your head, the better the wig will look. You can braid short hair into corn rows or mold it against your head using gel and bobby pins. For long hair, first tie your hair in a low ponytail. Next, wrap the ponytail into a flat bun and secure it with bobby pins.Allow any gel or hairspray to dry before continuing.

, Stocking caps, or wig caps, are soft caps that flatten your hair and help the wig stay in place. Gently pull on the stocking cap, being careful not to disturb your flattened hair. Adjust the cap so that it barely covers your hairline.If you have little to no hair, skip this step. Otherwise, the cap will slide around your head and bunch up under your wig.
Make sure all of your hairs are tucked into this cap, even the hairs on the nape of your neck.

, Wash your skin with a gentle cleanser and blot it dry with a towel. Next, dab some rubbing alcohol on cotton ball and wipe it along your hairline. This will remove the excess oils on your skin. If you have sensitive skin, you can apply a scalp-protecting serum after using the rubbing alcohol.Allow the serum to dry completely before continuing.
Scalp-protecting serums can be bought at wig supply shops and online.

, Before you apply any adhesives, you need to make sure the wig fits properly. To do so, place the wig on your head and line it up with your natural hairline. If the wig has tightening straps on the inside, you may need to adjust these for a proper fit. If the wig doesn’t fit and it doesn’t have any tightening straps, contact the manufacturer for help.


If you can feel a strong ring of pressure around your scalp, the wig is too tight. Loosen the straps slightly.
If the wig slides around when you move your head, the wig is too loose. Tighten the straps.

, Once your wig fits properly, you need to trim the lace. Use a few clips to pull the hair away from your face. Next, using sharp pinking shears, trim the lace along your natural hairline. You should leave about 1/8 inch (3 mm) of lace.This will only have to be done the first time you wear the wig.Some wigs don’t need to be trimmed before wearing. These wigs have little to no excess lace at the front of the wig.
You can buy pinking shears at sewing supply stores.

, Carefully pull the wig off, leaving all the clips in, and set the wig on a clean flat surface. Arrange the wig so that it’s easy to see what part goes on the hairline and what part goes on the nape of the neck.


If you have to loosen any straps to get the wig off, your wig is too tight.

, Cut six to ten small pieces of wig tape. Next, line your hairline with the small pieces of tape by pressing the sticky side against your skin. Use a mirror while you do this to create an even hairline.Once the tape is applied, remove the thick foam padding to reveal the other side of the tape.


Make sure all of the pieces are touching. Otherwise, you may have loose gaps in your hairline.
Wig tape can be bought at wig supply stores or online.

, If you don’t want to use wig tape, you can use a liquid lace adhesive instead. Use a clean makeup brush to apply the adhesive in thin line along your entire hairline.Depending on the type of adhesive, you may need to wait a few minutes before wearing your wig.


If you use a soft bond adhesive, allow the glue to dry long enough to become tacky before applying the wig.
If you use a hard bond adhesive, you can apply the wig immediately.

, Carefully pull the wig on. First, adjust the edge of the wig so that the hairlines match. Next, adjust the back of the wig so that it hangs naturally over your hair. Lastly, press the lace of the wig into your adhesive or wig tape.


Once you press the lace into the adhesive or wig tape, it’s very hard to remove. Be sure that the wig is perfectly aligned before doing so.

, If your wig is made of human hair, you can use regular brushes, hot styling tools, and hair products. If your wig is synthetic, avoid using regular brushes and hot styling tools. Instead, use a wide-toothed comb or wig brush to adjust your hair., First, remove any adhesives or tape with a commercial wig adhesive remover or regular baby oil. To do so, rub the remover along your hairline where the lace meets the adhesive. Continue rubbing gently until the lace lifts away from your scalp.


Do not pull the lace to remove it you will damage the wig., Depending on the manufacturer recommendations, your wig will need to be washed after 8-12 wears. First, brush any tangles from the wig. Next, shampoo and condition the wig in a sink filled with warm water. Place it on wig stand and let it dry completely before brushing or combing it. This will help wig last for months instead of weeks.


Human hair can be washed with regular shampoo and conditioner. However, synthetic wigs require their own specialized shampoo and conditioner.
Specialized shampoos and conditioners can be purchased at beauty supply stores or directly from the wig manufacturer.

, Proper storage will prolong the life of the wig. Keep the wig on a wig stand when it’s not in use. If you’re in between washings, make sure the wig is free of any adhesives or tape before storing it.


You can buy a wig stand at wig supply stores or online.

Shampoo your beard several times a week. The frequency depends on how dirty and oily your beard is. If you work outdoors, sweat a lot, and come into contact with dirt, you may need to shampoo every other day.
Rinse your beard until all the shampoo is out.
Purchase a shampoo formulated for beards.
Don’t use regular hair shampoo, as this may dry the skin under your beard.;
, After shampooing your beard, you should use a special beard conditioner. Beard conditioners are formulated specifically for coarse beard hair. Conditioning your beard will soften your hair and moisturize the skin underneath. When conditioning, remember to:


Shampoo first.
Rub in the conditioner.
Let it sit.

Over washing could dry your skin and hair out.
Everyone’s hair and skin is different. What might be too much washing for one person, might not be enough washing for someone else. Make sure to experiment and try to find the perfect balance for you., Smokers or foodies might at some point develop nasty beard stains. Thankfully, you'll be able to remove those stains with a baking soda paste.


Mix a 2 tablespoons of baking soda with 4 tablespoons of warm water.
Apply the mixture -- now a paste -- to your beard.
Allow the paste to sit for 15 to 30 minutes.
Rinse the mixture.
Repeat as needed."

Clean the merkin using more spirit gum remover.",How to Attach a Merkin," The more realistic, natural-looking merkins are made from human hair hand-tied to skin-colored lace or netting. These can get quite expensive. If you are wearing a merkin as a gag, prank, or novelty, you might be interested in a fake-fur one instead.Some cosmetic salons may be able to apply a merkin for you. These merkins are made from fox fur, and are glued onto your skin.;
, Some merkins come ""oversized"" so that you can cut them down to the right size and shape for your body. Most of the lace-backed merkins are already made to fit, but the novelty fur ones can be cut into all sorts of weird shapes.

, You can still wax your pubic hair, even if you plan on wearing the merkin for just one day. Waxing is recommended for those who wish to wear their merkins longer, because it lasts longer than a shave. Choose a full Brazilian wax, as opposed to a bikini wax or a “landing strip.”

, Use a shaving gel or cream suitable for sensitive skin and a clean, sharp razor to get the closest shave possible. Because shaving does not last very long, it is not recommended for those who wish to wear their merkins for longer than 2 days.

, Whether you shave or wax your pubic area, you will need to wait a few hours before you can apply the merkin. Both of these procedures place a fair amount of stress on your skin, leaving it sensitive and tender. You will need to give the area time to recover. Once the inflammation is gone, you can start applying the merkin., If you cannot find any spirit gum, try another type of cosmetic adhesive meant for gluing on lace-front wigs, mustaches, and beards. For example, the Telesis 5 silicone matte lace adhesive is designed for use with skin and lace-backed cosmetic items.


Try to get something high quality. It may be more expensive, but a cheaper product may irritate your skin.
If you have not used spirit gum before, or have sensitive skin, consider doing a patch test on your inner elbow or wrist to see whether or nor you are allergic to the spirit gum. If you are allergic, consider using wig tape instead.

, Place the merkin in your genital area to approximate its proper placement. Draw a guideline with an eyeliner if you do not feel you will be able to apply the glue in the right area. Once you apply the spirit gum, it will be tricky to remove it.

, Twist the cap off the spirit gum, and use the brush to trace the perimeter of the merkin.


Most bottles of spirit gum will have a brush attached to the cap, like nail polish. If yours did not come with a brush, use popsicle stick or a clean brush with short, stiff bristles instead.

, Position it just above the pubic mound, where the majority of your pubic hair would be. If you need to make any adjustments, do so now.

, Start smoothing the merkin from the center and move to the edges. Don't worry if the merkin starts to slip; it's simply because the spirit gum has not finished setting. Simply hold the merkin in place until it stays still. It should only take a few seconds for it to finish setting.

, Avoid scrubbing the merkin itself. Spirit gum is typically waterproof and can last a few showers. Remember, this is not a permanent accessory, so you will need to remove it after day or two. Do not wear it for more than 3 to 4 days.


Merkins are reusable. If you'd like to wear your merkin more often, take it off, clean it, and reapply it using the same method listed above. You can also secure it using some wig tape instead.

, If you cannot find any, try baby oil or olive oil. Some sources will recommend rubbing alcohol, but this is not a product you'd want close to such a sensitive area. If you must, use some facial toner for sensitive skin instead.

, You do not want to rip the merkin right off. Spirit gum is very strong, and you could damage your skin this way. You might also end up ripping the merkin itself if it is lace-backed.


Be sure to have several q-tips handy.

, The spirit gum remover will get under the merkin and start dissolving the spirit gum.

, Keep doing this until you can peel the merkin away completely. Do not try to forcibly pull or rip the merkin from your skin. Allow the remover to dissolve the spirit gum.

, If you feel any resistance, get out a q-tip, soak it with some spirit gum remover, and run it around the area where you feel resistance.

, Wipe the area down first using some cotton balls soaked with spirit gum remover. Next, wash the area using some soap and water. Pat yourself dry. Some people recommend applying moisturizer or baby oil to the area to keep the skin soft., Dampen an soft-bristled brush (such as an old tooth brush_ with spirit gum remover. Gently scrub the back of the merkin where the spirit gum is. If the spirit gum is not coming off, try using some 90% rubbing alcohol instead.Keep doing this until the spirit gum residue is gone. Once it is gone, gently pat the merkin dry.


Spirit gum remover can leave behind an oily residue. If this happens, simply wipe it off using a soft cloth soaked with rubbing alcohol.

Keep it clean.,
Use shampoo and conditioner on your beard.",How to Care for a Beard2," It is helpful to trim in multiple different directions to make sure you've gotten all of those stray hairs. Even if you want your beard to be very long, it's still a good idea to trim it every few months and get rid of split ends. , Completely unshaven, untrimmed, and unwashed is one look. Being nicely shaved, trimmed, and washed is another completely different look. If you fall somewhere in between, you might end up looking a little sloppy, so try to decide on a style.

You don't need anything too strong, but just something to cut through the oils that have built up. Make sure you also dry your face thoroughly. Have a clean towel and get as much of the water rung out of that mane as possible.

, Just like the hair on top of your head, beards need to be maintained and kept healthy. You can use the same shampoo that you use for your hair. If your beard is pretty short, you probably can just stick to washing your face with soap and water. If your beard is a few inches long you should shampoo it, but only use conditioner if it's very long.

Your hygiene routine needs to include cleaning your face and beard. Some people can get away with washing their beard only twice per week, but you might need to do it daily, depending on how dirty it gets. Either way, wash your face daily and always rinse your beard every day.

, Harsh sulfates are one of the most common irritants, especially for sensitive facial skin.

, This will help you to avoid having long-term problems, such as breakage due to a lack of nutrients. There are many ingredients that indicate the presence of potentially damaging silicones, including Trimethylsilylamodimetheicone, Amodimethicone, Cyclopentasiloxane, Stearoxy Dimethicone and Phenyl Trimethicone.


It is safe to use a beard wash that is made with water-soluble silicone instead.

For example, Lumberjack's Beard Oil carries an oil called Unscented Blend that has ingredients like sweet almond oil and Vitamin E, but no harsh chemicals.

, Your skin needs to stay hydrated during the winter. If you add just a touch of mustache wax to your normal beard oil routine, you will help your beard stay more moisturized and protected from the elements.

,, Due to this possibility, you should always protect your beard as much as possible with a scarf.


If your beard does become wet, it is important to wipe off the water right away. Make sure that you never allow ice or snow to remain in your facial hair for an extended period of time.

A goatee is a versatile beard that can look good on many faces, though you may find another beard type that will look better on you., The starker the contrast, the more dramatic your goatee will appear. If the colors are close together, you may want to consider another kind of facial hair style if distinctive and noticeable is what you are going for., Traditionally, a goatee refers only to the hair that grows off your chin, which hangs down like that of a goat. There are other forms of beards that use hair on the chin, and are sometimes referred to as “goatees.” You’ll want to choose the one that best enhances your face, and that you are best prepared to take care of.Look through magazines and websites for pictures of goatee variations that you might want to experiment with.

This is a more labor intensive beard, but definitely a distinctive one. With a Musketeer, you’ll want to keep your goatee trim, but let it grow a little longer down your chin. Because of the thickness, you’ll want to use some wax or conditioner to help the hair keep its shape., Once you know what you want to try, stop shaving and let the facial hair below your chin, around your mouth, and below your nose grow out. It should be nice and bushy before you start shaving and shaping. After about one week, you should have some good growth.Itchy skin for a few days is a normal part of growing a beard. Don’t let yourself feel self-conscious about scratching your face often. If you find it’s particularly irritating, you can use moisturizing lotion to sooth the skin a bit.You can grow out the rest of your facial hair as well, though you don’t have to. Having the extra hair can give you a little more flexibility when determining the size of your goatee., Start from your neck by making small cuts with a trimmer blade. Work your way around your chin and up your cheeks until you have the basic outline of what you want your goatee to look like.You’ll probably want the outline to start about an inch above your Adam’s apple on your throat. This may feel a bit long, but you will always be able to shorten it slightly if you don’t like the way it looks. If you shave too close too soon, you will have to wait to grow that back.

, Now that you have an outline, you can shape the edges of your goatee to get it to the size and shape you want. Make sure you have a clean, sharp razor to get the shaping accurate. If you use a manual razor, a new razor will give a cleaner shave. If you use an electric shaver, you will find the trimming tool handier to use.


Before trimming, run a comb through your beard to straighten out curled hair. This will make your hair easier to trim, and will give you a better sense of how long your goatee will be.Make sharp, clean corners at the jawline.Get the right width. A typical goatee will be about the same width as your mouth. You can help to define this width by smiling. Use the creases from your dimples to better judge where the edges of your goatee should be.No matter what kind of goatee you're shaping, make sure that both sides match symmetrically. Every few minutes, stop what you are doing and check in the mirror to make sure things are even on every side.

, Even if you want your goatee to grow out, it should still look clean around the edges. Shave every day, and don’t let the edges of your goatee grow out in every direction.Using an electric trimmer ensures that your goatee is symmetrical and neat. Also, the built-in length selector enables you to select the length of the hair rather than guessing with a pair of scissors. Most trimmers give you several different length choices.
A nose hair trimmer can be a useful tool for giving the edges a finer shape.
Trimming the part of the goatee where your chin meets your neck can be quite awkward, so position your mirror below head height, and pull your chin into your neck to get a better idea of how it looks.
If you are including a moustache with your goatee, trim the top to make sure those hairs don’t connect with your nose hairs. That is not a look you want to have.

, A goatee generally looks best when the rest of your face is clean-shaven, so make sure you get the rest of your face clear. Clear shaving gel is better because it allows you to see the edge of your goatee more clearly when shaving.When you are shaving near your goatee, make sure to move your razor away from the goatee. You don’t want to accidentally move too close to the goatee and shave part of it off.

, Wash your goatee on a regular basis with shampoo and conditioner. You want to help prevent your beard from becoming oily or unruly. This allows oils to get trapped in it, causing acne and other skin problems. Use shampoo instead of bar soap, as it will help keep your skin and beard moisturized.Remember to dry off after washing. Gently pat and wipe your beard dry with a clean towel.Consider using beard oil as well. These oils can be better than moisturizer because they are specially designed for cleaning beards and protect the skin underneath. Rubbing in a few drops of oil daily while your beard is still a bit damp should be enough to keep your beard clean and prevent acne forming under the hair.Be mindful of the fact that when you eat, food can and will get lodged in your beard. Make sure you brush and wash any food out of your goatee. To help prevent this, take smaller bites when you eat, and wipe off your face after each bite., A goatee, like any other beard, will grow nice and thick by taking care of your body. Eating well, sleeping regularly, and exercise are all good ways to help your beard hair grow in nicely.Eat well. A balanced, healthy diet is good for skin and hair, though you can supplement that. Foods high in protein, iron, zinc, and vitamins A, C, and E are all good for growing and protecting hair. You can also include a B vitamin called biotin, which is found in whole grains, liver, egg yolk, soy flour, and yeast.Regular exercise is another good way to boost testosterone, which helps in hair growth. Weight lifting and high intensity interval training are both good exercise programs for increasing your body’s testosterone levels.Get regular sleep. A good 7-8 hours, depending on your needs, will keep you fresh and healthy, and help aid in regular hair growth.

If you already have a beard, use trimmers to make the beard an even length on all sides., On a cleanly-shaven face, a beard will take about six weeks to grow back. Aim for a beard half an inch (1.3 cm) long. Feel free to continue to grow your beard beyond this point. Your hipster beard can be as long as you want it to be.


You may trim loose hairs during this time, but any mistake will make the beard uneven. It’s better to allow your beard to grow out naturally first.

, The best beard for you is the one that compliments your face. Look in a mirror and note your face structure. You want the beard to make your face look oval-shaped. Trim the parts of the beard that stick out by using scissors or a beard trimmer.If your face looks square or circular, cut the sides of the beard short. If your face looks long (oblong or rectangular), keep the bottom of the beard short and grow out the sides.

, Your beard will continue to grow. Use your scissors or beard trimmer to keep your beard at the length you desire. Start by one ear and work around to the other ear. Take care of any loose or overgrown hairs. You’ll have to do this once or twice a month., Your beard will creep down your neck, giving you the dreaded neckbeard look. To figure out where to end your beard, hold your head up and keep it level. Put a finger under each ear. Drag your fingers downwards in a U-shape to your Adam’s Apple. Shave off everything below that U-shape., Specialty beard products work, but you can also use the same product you use on your hair. Treat your beard while you’re in the shower.

You can keep the ends of your mustache pointed outward or shaped downward into a design such as a Fu Manchu. Treat parts of your beard the same way to create points or curls.Wax products are made of different substances, such as petroleum or beeswax, and come in different hardnesses. Softer waxes work best on shorter hair and firmer waxes hold up better in heat.

, Shorter, tidier hairstyles match better with hipster beards. Your hair shouldn’t appear shaggy. An undercut is one option, where the sides are cut short and you can use pomade to slick back the top. Use wax and your fingers to tousle hair for a windswept look.

You can also use a curling iron with a larger barrel or a smaller barrel, though it may be more difficult to achieve the wavy look.You can buy curling irons from a beauty supply shop or online.;
, A protective hair serum made from natural products, like argan oil, or a serum made to protect hair from heat will ensure your hair does not dry out when you curl it. Applying a protective serum to your hair before you use the curling iron on it will also help to protect your hair from any damage or breakage due to the heat.You can find a protective hair serum or spray in the beauty aisle or online.

, To set the wavy look, you should apply a protective finishing spray once your hair has been curled. The spray can contain a setting agent or a finishing agent that will keep your hair in place but it should also have a protective element so your hair stays healthy and shiny throughout the day., The most effective way to get the wavy hair look is to curl your hair in sections. You can use a comb to divide your hair into two even sections on either side of your head.








You can then clip one section of hair with a large clip. Make sure the section is out of the way so you can focus on the loose section first.

, This will ensure your hair does not dry out when you curl it. You can apply a few spritzes of spray on your hair or rub the ends of your hair with the serum.







, Before you start curling the section, you should run the curling iron over the ends of your hair in quick, fluid motions. This will ensure your hair is smooth and ready to be curled.








This step is especially useful for individuals with wavy hair who want to give their hair more of a controlled wave. You should try to start with smooth, straight hair so the waves stick to your hair more effectively.
You can also use a hair straightener on your wavy or curly hair to make it straight or try a straightening balm. Once your hair is not as curly through straightening, you can curl your hair in sections and give it a more controlled, wavy look.

, Grab a small chunk of hair from the loose section, about one to two inches of hair. Starting at the base of your hair, close to your roots, wrap the section around the curling iron away from your face. This will ensure the wave flows away from your face, rather than into it.








Hold the hair in the curling iron in your hair for about 10 seconds. Then, loosen your grip on the curling iron handle and pull the curling iron down to the end of your hair.
Curl the same section of hair again to the top of your head, close to your roots. Hold the hair for 5 seconds and then gently release the handle on the curling iron, releasing the hair. You should now have curls moving away from your face.

, Once you have curled one section of hair, move to the other section. Work carefully and curl each small chunk of hair so the curls look uniform when they fall side by side. Always curl away from your face the curls do not crowd or hide your face. Remember to apply protective spray or serum on your hair before you apply any heat to it.








If you have shorter sections of hair around your face, you should take small pieces of the hair and curl them one small section at a time. You can alternate the direction of the curls so they have a more wavy look.If you have bangs, you can brush your bangs to one side of your face. Choose the side where your hair naturally parts and try to brush all of your bang hair to the same side.

, Once you have curled all of your hair, you will need to make the curls appear more loose and wavy. Run the comb over the curls in sections, softly loosening up the curls with the comb. You can also use your fingertips to gently loosen up the curls.








Another option is to flip your head upside down and use your fingers to loosen up the curls. Try to separate all the curls by running your hands through them. Check that the curls appear loose and wavy, rather than stiff and uniform.

, Now that you have the ideal wavy hair look, you should use a finishing spray to ensure it stays put for the rest of the day or night. Apply a few spritzes of the finishing spray to your hair and run your fingers through the curls one last time. This should keep your hair looking wavy and loose.








If you have straight, fine hair you may want to put in a volumizing or texturizing spray on your wavy hair to give it some body. Apply a few spritzes to your hair and then use your fingers to lightly rub the spray into the ends of your hair.

Touch up your beard periodically.",How to Dye Your Beard," In order for the color to stand out, your beard will need to be a little bit longer. Wait a week or two after deciding to dye your facial hair to give it time to come in nice and thick. A little extra length will also help the dye hold.Facial hair shorter than about an inch (2.5cm) may be more difficult to dye.
If you dye your beard before it has a chance to fill out, you’ll just be forced to repeat the process later on to blend in the new growth.;
, You’ll want to select a shade that’s similar to your natural hair color. If you have dark hair, go with a deep brown rather than black, which almost always looks artificial. If you have lighter hair, find a dye that most closely matches your own shade.Use the color squares on the packaging for reference.
Since beard dyes tends to show up dark, it’s usually a good idea to pick a color that’s slightly lighter just to be on the safe side.Just For Men, Redken and RefectoCil are a few of the most highly-rated brands of beard dyes.

, Some beard dyes can cause allergic reactions. To make sure you won’t have an issue with the hair dye you’ve chosen, rub a single drop onto an inconspicuous area of skin, like your wrist or the inside of your elbow. If you don’t experience a reaction, it’s safe to go ahead and color your beard.Leave the dye in place overnight to give it ample time to react and check the results the following morning.If spot where you applied the dye becomes red, itchy or inflamed, switch to a hypoallergenic variety of dye.

, Wet your facial hair and work a small amount of shampoo through it to form a rich lather. Scrub the skin beneath your beard with your fingertips, then rinse out the shampoo and towel off or blow dry thoroughly. It should be completely dry before you begin dying.Make sure you’ve rinsed out every last trace of shampoo so it doesn’t interfere with the dye’s ability to take hold.
Don’t use a conditioner. This will form a protective coating around the hairs, making it harder for them to absorb the dye.

, Use the long-handled applicator included with the dye kit to layer the dye onto your facial hair. Brush with quick up-and-down strokes, making sure you’ve covered all visible patches including the mustache and sideburns. Work the dye down deep, but try not to let it come into contact with the skin itself.Pull on a pair of rubber gloves to protect your hands from staining and irritation.
If you don’t have an applicator, you can also use a toothbrush, makeup brush or flexible fine-toothed comb., Once applied, the dye will begin working within minutes. Keep a close eye on the color of your beard during this time. To test the results, you can remove the dye from a small section using a damp paper towel and take a look at the coloring underneath.Follow the instructions on the packaging to get an idea of how long you should let the dye set up (this will usually be somewhere between 20-40 minutes).For darker beards, a second application may be necessary to achieve the right depth of color.

, When you’re satisfied with the color, turn on the faucet and run some cool water over your beard. This will dull the vibrant dye to a more natural-looking tint. Continue rinsing your beard until the water runs clear.Massage the hairs by hand to help free dye trapped inside.

, If your beard comes out too dark, you can lighten it a little by showering right away while the dye is still fresh. It may also help to scrub your facial hair with a clarifying shampoo, although this may strip away more color than you want.Blow dry your beard on a low heat setting or let it air dry to avoid staining your towels.
After your first shampoo, you can go back to showering, cleaning and trimming your beard as usual.

, Avoid handling your newly-dyed facial hair too much, as the friction may rub off the coloring. Instead, let the water run through your beard and comb it out gently with your fingers. Most of the time, a simple rinse will be enough to keep your beard clean and your color intact.Hot water is more likely to cause fading than cooler temperatures.Wait until your beard is dry before brushing it or applying any other products, like lotions or oils.

, Invest in shampoos and conditioners formulated for use on color-treated hair. These are designed to clear away dirt and oil without affecting the hair’s color. You’ll be able to find these types of products in the beauty aisle of most major supermarkets and pharmacies.Stay away from cleaning products containing harsh chemicals.
If you’re used to shampooing and conditioning your beard every time you shower, consider cutting down to once or twice a week., Most dyes are non-permanent, which means they’ll need to be reapplied when they begin to fade. For follow up colorings, you’ll probably only need to go through a single round of coloring. Treating your beard regularly will keep it looking thick, full and youthful.Aim to dye your beard every 3-6 weeks, or sooner if needed.Because of how fast facial hair grows, your beard’s roots may need to be touched up more frequently than the rest of it.

",How to Grow a Beard Faster3," If you want the hair to come in quickly, leave it alone while it grows. You will have the chance to groom the beard after about four to six weeks when it is full.

, There is no scientific evidence to support this. Shaving your beard will only reduce the amount of hair on your face, not bring it in more rapidly.

, Because your hair will not all grow at the same pace, your face might get itchy and irritated.


If you suffer from itching or a rash, ask a doctor about applying a hydrocortisone cream to your face while you are growing a beard. It will relieve the itching. However, it can also have negative side effects when used on the face, so only apply it according to doctor supervision and advice.,"

If you're not sure which of two guards is best, start with the longer attachment first. You can always go back over the beard with a shorter guard afterward, but if you trim too short, you'll have to wait for the hair to grow back.
Refer to your manufacturer's instructions for details about the various trim guards and speed settings on your trimmer.
If you want to shave your beard completely, leave the guard off.

,









Maintain balance between each side of your face by always starting at the ears and working down.
The guard should keep the trimmer from irritating your skin or cutting too much hair.

, Start under your nose and move toward the corner of the mouth, then proceed down to your chin. Pay special attention to hard-to-reach areas directly under your nose.









Keep your mouth closed to avoid a mouthful of hair!
Depending on the length of your beard, it may be easier to trim the mustache separately with scissors.

, Remove the guard from the trimmer and trim along your neckline to remove the remaining hair on your neck. Use your jaw as a straight edge.


If you like, you can also lather and shave your neck, depending on how you like it styled. Some prefer a clean cutoff line for their beard, while others prefer subtle neck stubble.

Clean your clippers.,
Keep your clippers sharp.,
Be prepared for common problems.",How to Cut a Beard3," Most clippers come with a maintenance kit that includes a small brush. After every shave, brush excess hair off of the blades and guard. This ensures that old hair does not build up and work its way into the clipper's interior, where it can interfere with the operation of its motor.


If your clippers didn't come with a brush, you can use an old toothbrush or a bristly pipe cleaner.

, Most clippers also contain a small bottle of lubricating mineral oil. After every several shaves, clean the blades with the brush, then apply a few drop of mineral oil along the clipper's teeth. Turn the clipper on for about twenty seconds. This allows the oil to spread along the blades, keeping them sharp and smooth.


If your clippers didn't come with oil, contact the manufacturer before substituting your own oil - many household oils aren't suitable for clippers and will affect their performance.

, Well-maintained clippers should give you few problems. However, like any electric appliance, clippers can experience occasional performance issues. Here are a few of the most common complaints, with basic troubleshooting instructions:


""My clippers make a very loud buzzing noise."" Many clippers have a voltage regulator that resembles a screw on the side of the device. This can be easily adjusted with an included tool or an everyday screwdriver. Experiment with adjusting the voltage regulator in either direction until the noise stops. There is no risk of electrocution.
""My clippers can't cut my hair."" Your clippers may not be sharp enough or the internal motor may be losing power. Ensure that you're regularly cleaning and oiling the blades. If you clippers are noticeably slower, there may be an issue with the motor - it may be time to replace the clippers. Consult your manufacturer for warranty information.

Alternatively, your hair may simply be too thick! Clear any hair that is jammed in the blades and try again with shallower cuts.


""My clippers don't hold a charge."" Over time, the battery in portable clippers can deteriorate. Most manufacturers can replace them - contact your manufacturer for more information.
""My clipper's blades are crooked."" It's possible for clipper blades to get bumped out of alignment. Realignment is not generally a difficult process, but it will differ based on the precise make and model of your clippers. Thankfully, most manufacturers will have online guides for blade realignment and amateur DIY instructions are easy to find."

Repeat this process on the other side of your face.,
Trim your mustache and chin.,
Finish with a clean edge.",How to Cut a Beard4," Scissors are a good method for shortening a beard, but require a skilled hand for finer details, such as thinning or shaping.


Make sure the scissors are rust-free and without major imperfections or notches in the blades that may tug on or pull your hair.
Don't use kitchen scissors or garden shears. These can be too big and clumsy to maneuver. You don't want to cut yourself.

, This will prevent you from cutting the hair too short. Try to imitate the way a barber gathers hair in a comb, then lightly clips it.


Comb from your ear to your jaw, exposing a tiny amount of hair.
Trim any hair which is on the outside of the comb's teeth.
Use caution when performing this step. Begin by trimming very short lengths of hair - you can easily decide to trim more, but it is impossible to correct the mistake if you accidentally trim too much.

, Continue cutting the beard evenly until you've reached the desired length.


Comb the beard again to ensure you've got an even trim of the hair.

, Comb the hair straight down. In a straight line, trim any hair that falls below the line of your lip.

, Using extra care, use the scissors to trim the hair as close as possible on your neck.


If possible, use an electric trimmer for this step.
If you're intimidated, you can simply lather and shave your neck with a safety razor to remove all the hair. This can be much easier than making the finishing touches with scissors.

Choose a style with clean lines.,
Get a razor.,
Prep your beard for shaving.,
Make your first stroke a half inch away from the beard line.,
Shave down your desired beard line.,
Repeat for the other side of your face.,
Remove any remaining lather and rinse your face with cold water.",How to Cut a Beard5," Many styles of beard create dramatic contrasts with clean, abrupt lines where the hair ends and the skin begins. Even if you don't aim to dazzle anyone, you still might want to clean your facial hair up every once in a while. This process can be as simple as removing unwanted neck hair from a standard beard or as painstaking as leveling off your sideburns so that they match perfectly! Whatever the case, have a plan of action beforehand - razors shave all the way down to the skin, so big mistakes can change your style completely.


There's no right way to shape a beard. However, the most common beard styles are maintained by shaving the neck below the chin and the upper part of the cheeks to prevent an ""overgrown"" look. Decide what's best for you.

, In the distant past, shaving required a well-maintained straight razor. Today, almost any supermarket will be stocked with plastic safety razors. What you use to maintain your clean lines is up to you - safety razors are cheap, easy, and convenient, but some prefer the elegance and precision of a classic straight razor. For more information, consult our comprehensive guide on How to Shave.

, Your goal is to get your beard (especially the areas around where you want your clean lines to be) warm and wet - it will be softer and easier to cut this way. This step allows for some variation. Here are some common methods:


Splash some hot water on your face. If you have a soft beard (or you're just brave), no other preparation is needed, though you might want to repeat as needed to keep your beard warm and wet.
Use hot water and lather. This is the most common method. Splash hot water on your face as above, then work shaving cream or oil into a lather on the spots you want to shave. If you have time, let it sit for a minute or two - your shave will be even more comfortable.
Use a hot towel. If you've got the time, this method can be very relaxing. Wrap a warm, wet towel around your head so that it covers your beard. Allow the wrap to sit until it is cool. Remove, apply lather, and shave.
Many like to shower before (or while) they shave because showering provides a constant source of warm water. If this sounds attractive to you, consider investing in a small shower mirror for a more precise shave.

, Be conservative - this way, you have some ""wiggle room"" if you make a stroke that's too big.


If you've used lather and you can't see where you're shaving, it's OK to wipe some off with your finger. Even a very thin layer of lather will work well.

, Use a variety of stroke directions as long as none are painful or go directly against the grain of your hair - strokes that are parallel to your beard line can be used for large, approximate cuts, while strokes that are perpendicular to your beard line can be used to precisely cut into the beard line for smaller adjustments.

, A mirror and a good light source are essentials - you need to be able to see all parts of your face clearly if you want a perfectly symmetrical shave.

, Cold water tightens the skin and will help to stop the bleeding from any small nicks or cuts. Our How to Shave Your Face guide contains further instructions on treating shaving cuts.


When your face has been rinsed, you'll be able to see any small imperfections or spots you missed. Usually, minor adjustments can be made without re-applying a lather.

Leave the chinstrap.,
Rock the goatee.,
Try out the muttonchop.,
Trim it extra short for the five-o'clock shadow.,
Cultivate a soul patch.,
Creep your friends out with a pencil 'stache.,
Experiment!",How to Cut a Beard6," Channel your inner Abe Lincoln by trimming off the mustache completely and leaving the rest.

Maintain by shaving your upper lip regularly with a razor. If you can't, at least keep it significantly shorter with the trimmer.

, Trim your sideburns, leaving only a tough-looking patch around your mouth.


Imagine a line that runs from the sides of your nose down the corner of your lips and shave everything between that line and your ear, leaving the hair around the chin and the mustache.
Experiment with leaving different lengths of sideburn, or, for a style called the fu-manchu, removing the hair under the bottom lip and the chin.

, This is essentially the opposite of the goatee, leave the sideburns long and remove the mustache, chin, and neck beard.


Also try leaving the mustache for a variation on the chinstrap.







, Take off the trim guard or very carefully use scissors to cut (almost) everything off. You want to create an all-over, very short beard. This is a rugged, masculine look.


This effect is more noticeable if you have dark hair (especially if you have pale skin).

Paint your nails normally.",How to Fix a Split Nail," Use a cotton ball soaked in nail polish remover to take off any current nail polish. Rub your nails from side to side, making sure to remove the polish on the side edges of your nail.









Be careful to not get cotton particles caught in the split of your nail. If you are worried about catching your nail on the cotton ball, remove the nail polish moving in the direction of the split.;
, Use scissors to cut off the top portion of an unused tea bag. The bag is what you will use to repair your nail, so keep the teabag paper intact, and pour out the tea leaves in the garbage.







, Depending on where the nail split is, cut the tea bag in a rectangle shape to completely fit on your nail, just past the split toward the free edge of your nail.For example, if the free edge of your nail has the split, cut the tea bag to cover the split and about half of your nail. If the split is deeper, cut the tea bag longer to reach just before your cuticle.









Be sure that the sides of the cut teabag reach to the sides of your nail.
Once the teabag is applied onto your nail, you can leave the end of the teabag hanging off the free edge of your nail; you’ll remove it later.

, Paint a thin layer of a clear nail polish as a base coat. Be sure to cover the split section of your nail.This clear polish will act as glue to hold the teabag in place.








, When the clear base coat is still wet, carefully place the rectangle piece of tea bag onto your nail to cover the split section. Gently smooth the tea bag out with your finger or a cuticle stick, to make sure there are no air bubbles underneath the surface of the teabag.Allow the nail polish to dry for about 5 minutes.








, Wait for the clean base coat to dry, then carefully cut away the rest of the teabag hanging off your nail.








It is okay to leave a little bit of leftover teabag hanging off your nail, because you can file it away later when it is less fragile.

, Now that the tea bag is secure on your nail, paint on another layer of clear polish.Be sure to extend the paint stroke past your nail onto the tea bag. Allow this layer of nail polish to dry for about 5-10 minutes.









At this point, the teabag will look see-through.

, Once the clear layer of nail polish has dried, use a nail file to file in one direction and remove the rest of teabag paper.








The nail file will help sand off any paper particles remaining on the edge of your nail.

, To seal everything down, paint on another thin coat of clear nail polish.This time, be sure to swipe along the free edge of your nail where the teabag had been cut off. Allow this coat of polish to dry for at least 10 minutes. You don’t want to mess up your nail after having the rectangle of teabag paper and three coats of nail polish applied.









Swiping along the free edge of your nail helps to prevent and lifting or fraying of the teabag.

, When your nail is completely dry, paint your nails like you would regularly.Try to keep the layer of the polish on the split nail light, as you already have three layers of polish on the nail, and it will take longer to thoroughly dry."

Use a styling paste or pomade after waves dry.",How to Accentuate Wavy Hair1," Wavy hair tends to get frizzy and dry. Using a harsh shampoo can make these problems worse. Stick with a sulfate free shampoo or one with moisturizers. Sulfates are detergents that can strip natural oils from hair., Keep in mind that conditioner should not be overly heavy, because too much oil can weigh wavy hair down. Look for a conditioner that is a medium consistency, not too thin or thick. Some conditioners are designed for wavy hair and will have ingredients that fight frizz and help waves curl up., When towel drying hair, soak up excess water by patting and scrunching your hair. Don’t be tempted to rub hair with the towel, because this will make your hair frizzy. You can also wrap your hair on top of your head with a dry towel for a few minutes to remove excess water. Hair should still be damp, but not soaking wet, after towel drying.

, If you need to get rid of knots, brush your hair thoroughly before you wash it. Do not brush hair after you shampoo and condition, if you want to wear it wavy, because it will pull waves out you’re trying to enhance. If you absolutely need to detangle, after you towel dry and apply product, use a wide tooth comb to lightly remove tangles., Depending on the condition of your hair, you may want to use a leave-in conditioner. This is a good option, if your hair is dry and needs more hydration than what your rinse-out conditioner can give. It’s also good to use in place of rinse-out conditioner, if you have fine hair, because they're generally lighter.

The best leave-in conditioner for wavy hair should be a lightweight formula that creates shine, detangles and smooths cuticles.Leave-in conditioners normally protect hair from heat, as well.

, Rub your hands together to evenly distribute through your hands. Apply to ends first and work the product throughout the rest of your hair shaft. Use a hair serum that is designed to stop frizz and provide hair with extra moisture.


Argan oil works great as a hair serum, because it smooths fly-aways, but isn’t too heavy.
Do not overuse hair serum. A little goes a long way.

, Mousse has come a long way, since the 1980’s. Instead of creating stiff, crunchy hold, they now give soft, touchable control to hair.Look for a mousse that contains flexible polymers to give curl memory and definition to your wavy look., Dry shampoo is not just for days you don't wash your hair. It will give you long lasting volume, whenever you use it. This is great, since one of the biggest problems of wavy hair is its tendency to fall flat. Spray or sprinkle dry shampoo on your roots to fluff up hair. It will also absorb any excess oil off your scalp from hair serums or conditioning products., Salt spray will enhance your natural texture and create amazing volume. It will give you effortless looking beach waves, especially if you air-dried your hair in braids. Use salt spray on slightly damp or dry hair. Scrunch away for a look fresh from the ocean., If you have coarser textured hair, you will need a stronger product to contain frizz and moisturize locks. You can find your solution in a styling paste or pomade designed for curly or wavy hair. These products typically come in a jar, and they are concentrated.


Use no more than a dime-sized amount and warm the product up in your hands before using in your hair.
Another great way to measure is by looking at the size of a finger nail bed for reference.
Apply this concentrated product on your ends and to frizzy areas around the face.

Trim hair regularly.",How to Care for Wavy Hair," Use a shampoo that is made for wavy to curly hair. Choosing a shampoo that is made for another hair type, like straight hair, won’t give your hair the proper care it needs. Look for shampoos that specifically say they are made for a wavy hair texture and will add bounce and/or definition to the waves. Do not use too much shampoo or shampoo too often. While shampooing, focus on your scalp and use a quarter-sized amount. Depending on how oily or dry your hair is, wash once every other day or once every few days.Consider any problems you’ve had with your hair before buying a shampoo. If you have trouble with frizz, look for a brand that helps with frizz.;
, Along with buying a shampoo made for wavy hair, you should use a conditioner based on your hair type as well. If you find a shampoo you like, try to find the conditioner that is paired with it. If there isn’t a conditioner that is meant to be bought with the shampoo, then look for a product that says it is for wavy hair. Make sure to use conditioner every time you wash. Only apply the conditioner to the mid-shaft through the ends of your hair.Conditioners made for curly hair can work for wavy hair as well.
If you are concerned about the ingredients in your conditioner, like alcohol that can dry hair out, look for an organic conditioner.

, Hot showers feel great, but they are not good for your hair. Warm water is good to use to allow the shampoo and conditioner to work into the hair, but finishing your shower with warm or hot water can dry it out. Even if you start with a warm shower, end with a cold one. A cold shower will close the cuticles and help seal in the moisture from the shampoo and conditioner.If you really can’t take or end with a cold shower, use one cup of apple cider vinegar mixed with two cups of water and pour it over your wet hair. This will remove build-up from products and dandruff from your scalp.

, If you do not plan to style your hair after washing it, then put in buns before bed to help maintain waves. Towel dry your hair, apply a styling mousse, and then put your hair in four twisted buns. This will help you maintain soft curls for the morning., Don't use a hairdryer to dry hair if possible. Instead, let it dry naturally. The heat from a hair dryer can cause damage to hair and leave the waves looking poofy. If using a hair dryer is unavoidable, use a diffuser and put it on a low heat setting., A comb can cause breakage to your hair, especially if it is used too soon in the styling product. First, use your fingers to detangle hair. Then, you can use a wide-tooth comb to tackle any knots that you were not able to untangle with your fingers. Start combing at the ends of your hair and work up to your roots, rather than starting at the roots.Do not use a brush. A brush can cause breakage and ruin the shape of your waves.
Comb your hair while you are still in the shower if you can’t avoid combing it altogether.

, Use a mousse or other styling product to control frizz and maintain waves. Divide your hair into at least four sections before applying product. The smaller sections allow you to coat every strand of hair. While applying the product, scrunch your hair, squeeze it for a few seconds, and then let it go., Try to minimize using a hair straightener or curling iron. Your hair will be healthier if you allow it to dry on its own and stay wavy. Excessive use of heat will damage hair and cause your waves to look frizzy. If you do use a heat styling tool, then use a heat protectant product before straightening or curling your hair.Heat protectant products typically come in spray and cream form.

, Complete your styling routine with an oil to seal in moisture and add shine. Look for a lightweight oil that won’t weigh your hair down, like Argan oil. Only use a small amount. The size of dime should be enough, depending on the length of your hair. Apply the product from mid-shaft through the ends of your hair., Use a deep conditioner once a week to give your hair extra moisture and protection. Deep conditioning gives your hair more a more intense conditioning than your usual, everyday conditioner, and it should not be used as often. A deep conditioner can repair damage, add shine, and protect your hair from pollutants and harsh UV Rays. Apply the product from the mid-shaft to the end of your hair, leave in for five to thirty minutes, and rinse thoroughly.The product should say that it’s a deep conditioner or mask that is not meant for daily use.
The amount of time you leave the conditioner on your hair depends on the instructions on the label of the product, and the amount of damage to your hair.

, Using a lot of product can cause build-up in your hair, which can leave hair looking dull and limp. Buy and clarifying shampoo and use it once a week to get rid of dirt and oil in the hair. The instructions for use depends on the product, but typically you should massage and lather into hair and then rinse thoroughly., Avoid chemical processes, like dyeing hair and using chemical relaxers. Chemical processes damage the hair, and it can be hard to recover from that kind of damage. Use an organic hair dye if you do decide to dye your hair. And if chemicals can’t be avoided completely, make sure to deep condition before and after the process.Henna is an example of a natural hair dye.

, Heat usage, combing, and brushing causes split ends. Not getting rid of these split ends can cause the ends to split ends even more, which leads to unhealthy hair that will probably need a dramatic hair cut later on to fix. Trim your hair every six to eight weeks to keep your hair healthy and long."

Insert the pin.,
Squeeze the clippers.,
Thread the handle end onto the pin.,
Turn the handle back around.",How to Fix Nail Clippers1," A pin or rod-like piece holds the handle of your nail clippers in place and allows you to clip your nails. Locate the pin and then locate the hole near the clipper blades. Take the pin and insert it through the hole. Make sure that the notch in the pin is on the upper side of the clippers.








Hold the pin in place with your thumb by pressing on it from underneath the clippers.;
, Next, squeeze the clipper blades together with your thumb and forefinger while still holding onto the pin. This will expose more of the notched area in the pin and allow you to reattach the handle.








If you find it difficult to squeeze hard enough to bring the blades together, then you can may need to ask someone to help you or use a vice to press the blades together.

, Look at your handle and find the opening on the end of it. This opening attaches to the notch in the pin. Take the open end of your handle and thread it over the notch in the pin. 








After you have done this, you can release the pin. The handle should stay in place from the tension created by the two opposing blades.

, After you have replaced the handle, your clippers should be all better. Flip the handle up and over the pin if you want to clip you nails, or spin it around if you want to close and store the clippers.

Diffuse hair from ends and work upwards.,
Massage hair close to the scalp.,
Finish your blow dry with a blast of cool air.,
Touch up unruly waves with a curl rod.",How to Accentuate Wavy Hair2," Some dryers come with two different types of attachments. One is a nozzle concentrator that is good for straight looks; another is the diffuser attachment, which will be your go to for accentuating waves. A good diffuser will gently dry your hair without blowing out the cuticle.This attachment is bell-shaped with many holes that spread and soften the air from your dryer.

Purchase a universal diffuser, if your dryer doesn’t come with a diffuser attachment. These have springs around the part that attaches to the nozzle of a blow dryer; so that it adjusts to many sizes.Measure the diameter of your dryer nozzle to make sure the diffuser you buy fits properly.
Look for a diffuser that has many finger-like plastic pieces around the holes. These help scrunch hair.

, All diffusers are not created equal, and this is important to keep in mind, if your blow dryer came with a diffuser already. If you attach your diffuser and air still blows as strongly, or almost as strongly, as if you didn’t attach it; this is not a good diffuser.The point is that air blows softer to contain your hair cuticle and prevent frizz.

, Drying your waves from the ends up will help cut down on any weight that could pull your hair straight. Tilt your head to the side or upside down and scrunch hair with the diffuser. Hold the nozzle horizontal to your locks or at a 45 degree angle. Do not point the nozzle directly up the hair shaft, because this will open your cuticle and cause frizz., As you work towards the end of your blow dry, you will want to maximize volume. To keep hair lifted off the scalp and as wavy as possible, place the plastic finger-like pieces attached to your diffuser on your scalp and massage with small circles. If your diffuser doesn’t have these plastic pieces, you can claw your hand and use your fingertips to massage in a circle., Most blow dryers come with a cool setting on the temperature controls. The cool air will lay your cuticle down, if the hot air opened it, and smooth frizziness. It will also help lock in curl, giving you longer lasting waves.

, Sometimes your waves may not cooperate, even after properly diffusing them or scrunching them. In this case, take a curl rod, or iron about an inch wide, and wrap unruly pieces around it. Wrapping pieces around a curl rod, instead of clamping and rolling curls in, will mimic your natural, loose wavy texture."

Wrap and twist hair around fingers.,
Braid your hair.,
Twist your hair into buns.,
Tuck hair behind your ears and secure with clips.,
Separate waves with a wide tooth comb.",How to Accentuate Wavy Hair3," A great way to set and enhance waves or curls is by gently making twists all over the head about an inch thick. Remember not to pull the hair too tight as you twist. The twists will naturally spring up, but you can scrunch afterwards too. As your hair dries, the twists will loosen, but not all the way. Use a wide tooth comb to tousle them, after they completely dry.

, Braids work great to accentuate wavy hair. Before you go to bed, braid your hair in one or more braids and take them down in the morning. If you get frizzy hair from sleeping on it, you can run a little bit of conditioning styling cream through the ends or anywhere else you have flyaways.Braid wet hair in one big, loose braid. Twist the braid into a bun, and clip your hair a few inches below the crown for some lift.
Create four braids around your head for tighter texture and extra volume.

, While your hair is wet, place your part where you want it in your final look. After this, divide your hair into four sections and twist each section into a bun. Secure each bun with a large u-shaped pin, so you don’t create an elastic mark from hair ties. Take your buns down in the morning for beautiful, loose waves., This is an easy way to enhance waves around the face and eyes. While your hair is damp, tuck the hair behind your ears and use flat metal clips right above your ears to set the wave. After the hair dries, un-clip and un-tuck for perfect movement around your face., Waves should be tousled and loose. After you’ve completely dried your hair, pick areas out with a wide-tooth comb to break up any waves that may be too defined. You can use your fingers to tousle waves as long as you use a light touch."

Use warm water and soap to wash your hands or feet. Dry well with a clean towel.
Wash and dry carefully to avoid accidentally snagging the torn nail and making matters worse.;
,









If you do not have a nail mending kit, you can cut a piece of material out of a tea bag. This is the most common substitution, and it works quite well.
If you do not have nail mending paper or tea bags in your house, you could also try handkerchief linen or coffee filters.
At minimum, the material must be large enough to cover the entire break. The material should ideally be large enough to cover the entire nail with enough excess., Apply a small dot of super glue or nail glue to your nail and use the applicator tip to swirl the glue around gently until it covers the entire nail. Use tweezers to place the cut material onto the nail over the glue.









If using a nail mending kit, use the nail mender liquid in the kit instead of glue and apply it using the brush applicator inside the kit.
Use tweezers to smooth out any bumps or wrinkles in the material. The material should be as smooth as possible.
If necessary, use small nail scissors or regular scissors to trim away excess material.

, Pinch your tweezers over the material at the top of the nail, folding it down and under so that it sticks to the underside of your nail.








If the material has not gotten any adhesive on it yet, you may need to apply a small dot of glue or mending liquid to make it stick to the underside of the nail.
This measure provides extra balance and protection to the broken nail.

, Put another drop of glue onto the material covering the nail and spread it around using the applicator tip. Create as smooth of a layer as possible.









Nail mending liquid can also be used instead of super glue or nail glue.

, If you have a buffing stone, carefully buff the nail after the glue dries. Use the smoothing side first, then the polishing side.









For the better results, rub the buffing stone in a single direction instead of rubbing it back and forth.

, Apply a layer of top coat or nail strengthener to the damaged nail in order to balance it out and provide an added, final layer of protection.

;
, Make sure your hands and nails are dry before you begin. Liquid can dehydrate nails and make them more prone to breaking while filing.







, While there are several types of nail files you can choose, emery boards are both affordable and effective. Choose one with a high grit to get the smoothest finish, around 300-600 grit.Coarse grits, around 80-100 grit, should only be used with acrylic nails. If you use them with natural nails, they will tear up your nails.
Avoid metal files as they can also tear up your natural nails.Glass, or crystal, files are very effective and can be easily cleaned in the dishwasher., There are many nail shapes to choose from, but the most basic shapes are oval, square, and almond. Deciding what shape you want will depend on what your preference is and what kind of nails you have.


Oval-shaped nails are a great shape for growing out and maintaining your nails. It’s the most functional since your nails will be least likely to break off in this shape. Oval-shaped nails are symmetrically round at the tip.
Square-shaped nails are a great statement and work well with people who have long nails. The square shape comes from filing the nail straight at the tip all the way across the nail.
Almond-shaped nails are great for making your fingers look more slender. The shape mimics the curve at the base of your nail.Have short nails that can’t be shaped? It’s no big deal. Use what you’ve got to work with and apply cuticle oil to them every night to help them grow for future shaping., If your nails are are on the longer side, cut them down taking into consideration the nail shape you want.








If, for example, you want square-shaped nails, you shouldn’t cut your nails much, if at all, since square-shaped nails require longer fingernails.
You can cut your nails a little shorter if you desire an oval-shaped nail. However, be sure to cut your nails in that oval shape.
If you’re aiming for almond-shaped nails, cut down the sides of your nails more than the tip.

, Hold the file parallel to the side of the nail when beginning your filing. This will prevent breakage.

Be sure to not file too far into the side of your nail. If you do, this can make your nails more susceptible to breakage., It’s important to file your nail from the side to the center in one direction using a fluid motion. This will ensure that your nail is smooth, and not jagged.You should never “saw” your nails back and forth with a nail file. This will cause peeling and breakage of the nail.

, When filing your nails from the side to the center, you should always hold the nail file perpendicular to the tip of the nail. This will prevent weakening the nail while filing.Filing at an angle from above can cause the nails to thin.
If your nails are already thin, hold the nail file flat to your nail, tilting it to file from slightly underneath your nail., Move the file from its perpendicular position at the tip of the nail to the opposite side of the nail from which you began. Make sure that you hold the file parallel to the side of the nail., Since you should never “saw” your nails back and forth, lift the file away from your nail and return to the side of the nail for another pass., If you’ve got some nail filings still attached to your nails, remove them by placing the tip of the file underneath your nails and flicking upwards., Give your nails a shine by buffing them after you finish filing. This will help show off your newly shaped nails!








You can purchase a buffer at any beauty supply store.

, Regularly apply cuticle oil to your nails and keep your hands moisturized to ensure healthy nails. Everytime you wash your hands, you should apply cuticle oil and moisturizer.Keep cuticle oil and moisturizer next to the soap at your sink as a reminder to apply regularly.

, Only file your nails once every two to four weeks. Filing your nails too frequently can damage them as they won’t have time to grow properly."

Trim a small piece of clear tape down to size.,
Cover the entire tear with the tape.Stick the center of the tape over the center of the break.,
Trim off any excess tape.,
Fix the nail as soon as possible.,
Proceed with caution during tape removal.",How to Fix a Broken Nail2," Use scissors to carefully cut a small piece of tape that is just barely bigger than the size of the tear.









To make it easier to cut the tape without having to peel the tape off the scissor blades, use small nail scissors or sewing scissors. If you’re using larger scissors, trim the tape using the tip of the blades.
Choose a single-sided tape with a mild adhesive. Consider “magic” tape, gift wrap tape, multitask tape, or other transparent office tapes. Avoid strong tapes like electrical tape.

, Press down firmly to adhere. Then, using the tip of an unbroken nail, glide the lengths of the tape on either side so that they cover the tear from end to end.









Make sure that both broken sides are lined up evenly before applying the tape.
Use firm, even pressure to secure the tape in place.
Rub the tape on in the direction of the tear, never against it. Rubbing in the opposite direction could cause the nail to peel up further.

, If the piece of tape you applied to your nail is slightly too large, use nail or sewing scissors to snip away any excess.









Make sure that the ends of the tape are flat against the nail.
You could also use the tips of standard size scissors to cut the tape if you do not have small scissors., Even though this fix will suffice for emergency nail care, it is by no means a permanent solution. You will need to adhere the nail back into place using a stronger adhesive and a more thorough application.


Take special precaution, in the meantime, to avoid snagging the tape or the nail beneath.

, As you peel the tape off, peel the tape off in the direction of the tear, not against it.

Press the nail into place.,
Wipe off excess glue.,
Smooth the repaired area.,
Apply a protective top coat when dry.",How to Fix a Broken Nail3," Before you can fix the nail, you need to make sure that your hands are clean and free of oils.


Use warm water and soap to wash your hands or feet. Dry well with a clean towel.
Wash and dry carefully to avoid accidentally snagging the torn nail and making matters worse.

, If the tip of your nail broke off completely and you want to reattach it, soak the broken tip in warm water until it feels pliable again.


If your nail is still attached or still pliable, disregard this step.

, Grab this bead with a toothpick and spread it over one side of the broken nail, creating a thin coat of adhesive.









If you do not have nail glue, use super glue. In general, a glue containing cyanoacrylate will form the strongest bond.
Do not touch the glue with your fingers for any reason.

, Use the tip of the toothpick to ease the broken portion of the nail back into place. Press down on the nail with firm, even pressure, using the side of the toothpick.


Again, it is important to avoid getting glue directly on your fingers.
Apply pressure for at least 1 minute to ensure that the nail adheres properly.

, Before the glue finishes drying completely, dip a cotton swab or cotton ball in nail polish remover and run the soaked cotton along the sides of your nail bed. This should get any excess glue off your skin.









You may need to scrub a bit to get the glue off.
Make sure to apply nail polish remover on any part of your skin you got glue on.

, After the glue has finished drying, file the nail to look even. Use the rough side of an emery board or nail file to file down the rough, exposed edge of the tear.









Move the file in one direction, not back and forth. To minimize the risk of further damage, move in the direction of the break, not against it.
Work slowly to prevent yourself from causing additional damage.

, Once the broken nail seems smooth again, protect it by applying a coat of nail strengthener or protective top coat over the entire nail. Let the nail dry completely.

Remove the detached nail.,
Stop the bleeding.,
Trim down any remaining nail.,
Soak your foot or hand in cold water.,
Soak your foot or hand in salt water.,
Apply an antibiotic ointment.,
Cover the nail bed until a new nail grows in.,
Monitor the injury.",How to Fix a Broken Nail4," When a nail or a portion of the nail gets completely ripped from the nail bed, you may need to remove the nail in order to treat the injury. Use nail scissors to carefully snip away any portion that is partially attached and lift the nail out using tweezers.









By removing the nail, you allow yourself better access to the injured nail bed beneath. As a result, you might be able to reduce the risk of infection by treating the area better.
Alternatively, you could leave the detached nail in place and clean around it. Doing so is harder, but possible. The detached nail will fall off on its own once new nail grows in its place.

, Depending on how severe the detachment was, your nail bed may be bleeding a lot. Before you can continue treatment, stop the bleeding by applying pressure to the injury.









When possible, use medical gauze or sterile cotton pads. Place the cloth or pad directly over the injury and press firmly for several minutes. Use even pressure.

, Use nail clippers or sharp nail scissors to cut away any jagged or sharp edges. You should do this regardless of whether you removed the detached nail or left it in place to prevent further catching and tearing.









Contact your doctor and have her trim your nail if it is too painful, or if you are not comfortable doing so yourself.

, Immediately after you trim the nail, soak the damaged nail bed in a bowl of cold water for 20 minutes.


The water should be cold enough to soothe and numb the area.
Soaking your toe or finger in cold water helps regulate blood flow in that area of your body.

, After using the cold water treatment, switch to a treatment of warm water and salt.









Mix 1 tsp of salt into 4 cups of warm water.
Let your damaged finger or toe soak in the salt water for 20 minutes. The salt water helps prevent infection.
Repeat this procedure two or three times daily for the first three days.
Pat dry using a clean, soft cotton cloth.

, To further speed up the healing process and reduce the risk of infection, use your fingers or a clean cotton swab to gently rub a layer of antibiotic ointment over the entire area.








Make sure that your hands are clean as you handle the injury.

, Wrap an adhesive bandage over the damaged nail to prevent further snagging and reduce the risk of infection.









Keep the bandage over your nail bed until enough new nail has grown in to cover the entire nail bed.
Change your bandage each time you soak or clean the wound. Make sure that the wound is dry each time you change the bandage. If the bandage gets wet, change it too.

, Watch for signs of infection each time you change the bandage. This is especially important during the first 72 hours, but you should continue to check until enough nail grows in to cover the exposed nail bed.









Signs of possible infection include: fever, redness, increased heat to the injury, pain, tenderness, swelling, or puss.
If you suspect that an infection has set in, schedule an appointment with your doctor.

Remove any nail polish.,
File and smooth your nail.,
Prepare the patch.,
Glue the break in your nail.,
Adhere the patch to your nail.,
Trim and file the fingernail patch.,
Apply more base coat and finish with nail polish.",How to Fix a Broken Fingernail1," If your fingernail has any nail polish on it, start by removing it. Use a cotton ball, pad or soft cloth, dampen it with nail polish remover (use acetone remover for dark colors and glitter polishes) and gently wipe over the surface of your nail. Make sure to rub in the direction of the break to prevent further tearing.;
, Use the finer-grit side of a regular emery board or the second-finest grit side of a 4-way buffer to gently even out and smooth the edges of your fingernail, again filing in the direction of the break. Because you will be applying a material, or a patch, to the surface of your nail bed that will be there for quite some time, you want to make sure it’s as smooth as possible. Therefore, use the coarser side of the emery board or the second-coarsest grit side of the buffer and run it along the entire surface of the nail to help buff away any ridges.Be careful to not apply too much pressure while you’re buffing, or you’ll damage your nail.

, The material you choose to use as the patch depends upon a variety of factors, such as what you have available, the strength or weakness of your nails and your activity level. You can use silk or fiberglass wraps, fabric or empty tea bags.Initially cut the material into a rectangle about the length and width of your fingernail. If you’re using a tea bag, cut off the top and empty it first. Now a) trim the width down just a bit so it won’t touch the skin on either side of your fingernail and b) trim the length so the material will cover half of your fingernail and extend from the tip of your fingernail about 1








Silk wraps, which you can buy online or at beauty supply stores, are thin, flexible, become practically invisible once you apply the sealant on top and are best for strong nails.
Fiberglass wraps, which you can also buy online and at beauty supply stores, are also very natural looking but are better for thin, weak nails.
Linen wraps, which include fabrics and tea bags, offer a lot of strength and typically last just as long as silk and fiberglass. They are thicker and more opaque, though, so they require more filing to blend and smooth into the nail., Using nail glue, put one drop on top of the break and one underneath the break. Never use super glue or any other glue that is not designed for use on human tissue. Use a toothpick or cuticle file to help spread it the length of the break. Hold it in place with either the toothpick or cuticle stick for 30-40 seconds, long enough for it to start setting but not so long that you’ll have trouble when you let go. Both will be fully dry in about 2 minutes.







, Apply a layer of clear base coat polish to your nail and immediately position the patch on it. Make sure about 1








Alternatively, you can use nail glue instead of a base coat., Take a pair of fingernail clippers or a pair of sewing or nail scissors and cut off the extra material at the tip of your fingernail. Next use the coarser-grit side of the emery board or the second-coarsest side of the buffer to gently even out a) the tip of your fingernail, b) the edges on the sides of your nail bed where the material meets the nail and c) the center ridge where the material is adhered to your nail bed. Then use the finer-grit side of the emery board or the second-finest grit side of the buffer and lightly smooth each area until you feel no bumps or ridges.








Do your best to buff in the direction of the break as much as you can.

, After you’re done filing and smoothing, wash your finger to get rid of any dust and stray bits of material. Dry it thoroughly with a clean cloth before applying another layer of base coat. Wait two minutes and then apply two layers of fingernail polish. You want to wait two minutes between each layer of polish, too. Finish it off with a clear top coat for extra strength.








Using a top coat will make your fingernail polish last longer, which is helpful in making the patch last longer. Using a lot of nail polish remover, whether it’s acetone or non-acetone, at one time or using it frequently will shift or remove the patch.
Nail glue, if that’s what you choose to use, will hold up better to non-acetone nail polish removers, even when used frequently. It won’t fare so well with an acetone remover, though you can minimize damage by using it sparingly.

Pick the right clean bowl.,
Fill a bowl with cold water.,
Add a cup of ice to the water.,
Paint your nails.,
Take out the ice bowl.,
Dip your hands in the bowl.,
Wait 2-3 minutes.,
Pat hand with towel or paper towel.",How to Dry Your Painted Nails Quickly1," You want a deep enough, and large enough, bowl that you can submerge the entire nail into the bowl. Ideally, you want a bowl large enough to dip all of your nails at once.


Pick a bowl that can stand up to freezing or chilling. Metal bowls will hold in the cold and be cold to the touch. Plastic will insulate the water but may be easier to handle.
Consider dedicating a bowl just for beauty regiments. You probably do not want to accidentally get nail polish on your favorite mixing bowl.;
, After you’ve picked the right vessel, fill it with cold water. You want the coldest water possible without freezing everything in the bowl. This will help the ice not to melt so quickly., You want to add a cup of ice (cubes, not crushed) to the bowl. This will create cold enough water to help instantly dry your nails. Once you’ve added the ice, return the bowl to the fridge if you intend to paint your nails right away.If you think you it will take at least an hour for your manicure, consider returning the bowl to the freezer so the ice does not melt. Be warned, wait too long and the entire bowl will freeze.

, Once the bowl is chilling, now it is time to put on your favorite manicure. You can use whatever type polish you would like. Paint your nails as you normally would.

, Remove the bowl from the fridge or freezer, carefully. Be careful not to smudge your wet nails doing this! If you can, have someone assist you with this.


Place the bowl on a flat surface. If you are putting the bowl on wood, place a towel or trivet underneath the bowl. This will prevent water rings on the surface.

, You can place both hands at once, being careful that your fingers do not touch each other. Or, you can place one hand at a time.


You will want to submerge your hands slowly as not to cause the water to ripple and damage your nails.

, This is going to be cold. It might be a little bit painful. But, the longer your nails are submerged, the drier your nails will become.


Once your hands have been successfully submerged, remove them from the water and place them on a towel.
You can test the dryness of the nail polish by lightly touching your nail. It should be hard to the touch. As odd as it sounds, after removing your hands from the water, your nails should appear dry.

, Cold water can damage your hands, so pat down your hands to dry them.


Consider applying your favorite lotion to your skin, after your nails are successfully dry of course, to stop skin damage.

Inspect your work.",How to Cut Your Fingernails and Toenails," Soak your nails for a few minutes before you cut them – this softens the calcified growths and makes them easier to trim. If your nails are less brittle, you may be less likely to split them. Dry your hands and feet after washing. You can cut your nails while they are wet, but you may have more control over the cut if you are working in a dry environment.









This step is especially important for toenails. Toenails tend to be thicker and tougher than fingernails, especially on your big toe.;
, You can use nail clippers or manicure scissors. The choice is largely a matter of preference. Consider the pros and cons of each option:


Nail clippers are cheap, simple, and widely available. They cut your nails along a set concave edge – which can be very convenient if the clippers fit your nails, but frustrating if the crescent is too large or too small.Toenail clippers usually feature a heavier bite and a straighter edge to contend with thicker nails and the risk of ingrown toenails.
Manicure scissors are less common than nail clippers, but some people greatly prefer them. You may need somewhat more finesse to trim your nails with manicure scissors. However, you also have more control over the arc of the cut. As their name suggests, manicure scissors are usually best-suited to hand care. You'll want to use a heavier-duty set of clippers on your feet.
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Health Resources and Services Administration says that it is too dangerous to use other sharp cutting tools—such as knives, razor blades, or regular scissors—to trim your nails. The tool may slip and injure the skin surrounding the nail.

, If possible, buy your own set of nail-cutting tools, and keep separate sets for your fingernails and toenails. Wash the implements regularly with a disinfectant for the sake of sanitation. Dish detergent or antibacterial soap will do: just soak the cutting tools for 10 minutes in a bowl of hot, soapy water., Make sure that you set up a place for the clippings to go; you may offend other people if you leave chunks of your nails strewn all over the floor. Consider clipping your nails into a trashcan or a compost bin. Hold your fingers and toes directly over the receptacle, and try to track down the clippings that fly astray. Try not to clip your nails in public spaces, and avoid clipping near people that are talking.


You can, indeed, compost fingernails and toenails. They won't add much bulk to the pile, but they are organic matter and they will decompose. Don't try to compost fake nails (acrylics) or excessively-polished nails, as these artificial materials will not degrade., Nails grow about 1/10 of an inch (2.5 mm) every month, meaning that it takes 3-6 to grow a full nail.If you cut your nails frequently—say, once each week or two—you won't need to worry about them growing too long or too wild. If your nails begin to hurt at the edges, you might be developing an ingrown nail; try to trim away the painful growth before it goes too deep, but it would be wiser to seek a health care professional.

, The goal here is to remove the ""free edges"" of your nails: the opaque, off-white crescents that grow at the tips of your nails. Cut the nails almost completely straight across, and round them a little at the corners to keep the nails strong. Cutting the nail straight will reduce your chance of developing ingrown nails.If you are a finger-style guitarist, consider leaving the nails long on your picking hand. Keep at least 1/16th inch (1.5 to 2 mm) of nail on each finger of your picking hand.

, Cut your nails using a lot of small cuts; do not try to snip away the entire ""free edge"" with a single cut. Toenails are naturally oval-shaped, and a single cut tends to flatten out the oval.







, Use the same strategy that you used on your fingernails. Toenails are typically thicker than fingernails, so make sure that you don't use too small a set of clippers. Cut them straight across; cutting back inwards at the edges will increase the likelihood of problems and for diabetics can lead to medical intervention. If you can avoid it, do not use the same set of clippers on your toenails that you used on your fingernails – this way, you'll avoid transmitting bacteria between your feet and your hands.








, It can be tempting to keep on trimming your nails (for the sake of convenience, aesthetic, or compulsion) even after you've removed the ""free edge"". If you trim too deeply, however, you will expose the sensitive skin beneath the nail, and you may increase your risk of infection. Try to keep the ends of your nails even with the top of your finger – or remove all but a tiny sliver of the opaque ""free edge""., You don't need to file your nails, but the process may help you shape your nails exactly as you want them. Cutting your nails can leave jagged edges – but it is easy to file them uniform. Use a nail file, a pumice stone, or any other hard, textured surface.


Jagged nails can catch on clothes, socks, and pantyhose. If your nails catch on something, they may tear or break.

, Wait for a while until your nails are dry and are no longer soft. Filing wet nails will leave you with jagged, rough nails when they dry, and may also cause your nails to split and crack.

, Use a nail file to shape your nails, and to make sure the edges of the nail are smooth. Always file gently, in one long stroke, from the side to the center of the nail. Use the coarse, shaping side first if you need to remove more nail. Then, use the finer-grade shaping side to smooth your nails out.









Your nails should be slightly triangular or ovular, but not pointed. This will keep them from breaking. Nails can weaken if you file too deeply into the corners and sides.

, As you cut or file, periodically check your nails to ensure that they're all the same length and shape. Make sure that they're smooth – jagged or pointy nails may prove painful and inconvenient in everyday life. Keep clipping and filing until your nails are even.

, Soak a cotton pad or cotton ball in nail polish remover. Press the cotton onto each nail for 10 seconds, before sliding it off each nail.









Go back over your nails with a new remover-soaked cotton pad or cotton ball to remove any excess nail polish your initial removal missed.
Limit the amount of nail polish remover you use.
A thick hand cream or oil is recommended before polishing since it moisturizes and rehydrates the nail. After moisturizing, remove the surface oil with isopropyl alcohol. Oils can prevent newly applied nail polish from sticking to the skin.Excessive amounts of acetone can dry out and damage the nail. As a general rule, nail polish remover should be used no more often than once a week. If you use it more than once a month, you should also opt for an acetone-free formula.

, Dark nail polishes can stain the nail beneath, thereby distorting the color of the new polish you plan to apply. You can whiten nails with a mixture of hot water, hydrogen peroxide, and baking soda.


Combine 1 Tbsp (15 ml) hydrogen peroxide with 2 Tbsp (30 ml) baking soda in a bowl containing at least 8 oz (250 ml) of warm to hot water. Soak stained nails in this solution for one minute.
Alternatively, you could scrub the stains off using whitening toothpaste and an old toothbrush.
But be aware these methods of removing stains may weaken the nails. Avoid them if you do not plan to ""go bare""; they are not necessary if you are going to polish your nails afterward.

, Use a nail file to round away any square or sharp edges. The shape of the nail should roughly match the shape of the cuticle.









Make sure that the nails are completely dry before you file them. Filing wet nails can result in splitting and breakage.Try to file the nails so that they extend just over the edge of the fingertip.

,, Use an orange stick, rather than a metal pusher, to gently push back the cuticles. In doing so, you can expose more of the nail and prevent nail polish from getting on the skin.









Never cut the cuticles. Cutting a cuticle leaves a gap open in between the nail and the skin, which could result in nail infections or other problems that will affect the appearance and health of the nail., This may keep your finger tips clean but may interfere with the polish if it gets on the nail bed. This is an optional step, but by carefully applying a thin coat of petroleum jelly onto the cuticles surrounding each nail, you can more effectively prevent nail polish from accidentally getting on and sticking to the skin., If you are painting your own nails, paint your dominant hand first, before your non-dominant hand has any polish on it. You will be able to more easily manipulate your dominant hand with wet polish than you can manipulate your non-dominant hand with wet polish.

, Base coat can protect the nail, create a smoother manicure, and help the polish to last longer.









Paint the base coat over the entire nail to fill in any ridges.
Let the base coat dry before applying polish.
A rubberized base coat is one of your best options, even though there are plenty of other options available. Rubberized base coats are thought to help the polish adhere better and last longer, however.

, Professional manicurists use a specific procedure when applying polish. This procedure involves drawing a line of polish down the center of the nail, followed by one to side and a final line down the other side.









Place a drop of nail polish at the center of the nail just above the lower cuticle.
Slowly push the drop down toward the cuticle using the nail polish brush.
Drag the brush up in a straight line to the tip of the nail.
Return to the base of the nail and swipe the polish out along one curved side of the nail. Drag it up and toward the tip to cover that entire side.
Return to the base of the nail once more and repeat with the remaining side.

, Instead of applying a single thick layer of nail polish, apply two or more thin coats of polish to each nail for a smoother, more even look. Wait for the nails to dry in between coats.









Thick coats of nail polish only end up drying on the surface. As a result, the polish lying below the surface remains somewhat moist, causing the color to smudge more easily.
You should also avoid shaking the bottle of nail polish before you apply it. Shaking the polish will cause air bubbles to form inside, and those bubbles can get transferred onto the nail as you paint it. Instead, mix the polish by rolling the bottle in between your hands., Once the main color has been applied and left to dry, you can apply any designs or patterns you want using other polishes.


Several ideas are provided in the “Specific Manicure Ideas” section of this article.

, If the nail polish gets smudged while you work, you might be able to smooth it out using a little saliva.









This must be done while the nail polish is still somewhat moist and sticky.
Lick your fingertip and use it to carefully push the polish back in place. It may not be perfectly smooth afterward, but the smudge will be gone.
Saliva reacts with wet polish, allowing you to soften and blend the surface. It will not have the same effect with dry polish, though. Sometimes, a small amount of acetone applied with a fingertip will soften a smudge and allow the next layer to be smoother.

, A small eyeshadow brush, small paintbrush, or cotton swab dipped in nail polish remover can be used to remove any nail polish that found its way onto the surrounding skin.









The brush tip must be clean, and it should be as small as possible so that you have better control over the areas it touches.

, If you want the color to dry faster, you can speed the drying process up by dipping the nails in ice water or by spraying the nails with cooking spray.









If using ice water to dry nails, let the nails air dry for a few minutes until they no longer feel wet but still feel sticky. At that point, dunk the nails in a bowl of ice water for three minutes. The cold temperature hastens the drying process.
For the cooking spray fix, wait until the nails are no longer wet, but still remain sticky. Spray a light coating of vegetable cooking spray onto the nails to set the polish and prevent smudges.
Do not try drying the nails by blowing on them or by sitting next to a fan. While this will cause the polish to dry faster, it can also create bubbles in the polish.
Note that it will take about twice as long for nail polish to dry during days of high humidity.

, Once the color has been applied and dried, you can apply a top coat that will smooth out the overall appearance and prolong the nail color.









Brush the top coat over the top surface of the nail, where the color has been applied.
Run the top coat brush along the top edge of each nail, as well. Doing so will seal the ""raw edge"" of the polish, thereby preventing it from chipping. Many experts recommend doing this for each layer of polish from base coat to top coat.
Note that if you apply top coat to the nails before the layer of color beneath it finishes drying, that polish can still move around and create bubbles or ripples in the color., Use a sponge to blend together two different colors of nail polish, creating a gradient from the top of the nail to the bottom.








, A French manicure can be easy to do at home. All you need to do is paint the nail one color and paint a strip of another color over the tip.

, A nail art flower is a fairly simply shape to create. The petals and center of the flower are drawn as dots.

, Sponge on blue and white nail polish to create the appearance of bubbles.








, You can blend multiple shades of nail polish into a swirled, marble design by mixing them in water.

, Sponge galaxy-inspired hues onto a black base and add glitter for stars.








, You can use a brush with a thin tip to write letters on the nail. You can even use this technique to create the wikiHow logo on your nails.

, Carefully apply stripes of black nail polish over a white base.

, Start with a light green base and add brown, dark green, and black dots to create a camouflage design.

The type of nail polish remover you use will depend upon the kind of nail polish you are wearing. For example, if you’re wearing really dark polish or glitter, you’ll need an acetone remover. Dampen a cotton ball, pad or cloth with the remover and wipe in the direction of the break so it doesn’t snag and get worse.A note on acetone nail polish remover: In general, acetone removers should not be used on natural nails because it will dry them out, causing them to break more easily. They also shouldn’t be used on acrylics or other types of artificial nails.

, Use small nail or sewing scissors, if you have them, to cut a piece of scotch tape that is just larger than your nail bed. Now cut that piece into the shape of your nail bed. You might find it easier if you hold the tape with a pair of tweezers. Your shaped piece of tape likely won’t be perfect. It’s better, in fact, for it to be a bit smaller and not touch your cuticle and the skin on the sides of your nail than for it to be too large. It’s also better for it to be a little long and hang over the end of your nail at this point., Using either your fingers or a pair of tweezers, place the piece of shaped tape on your nail bed. Use the pad of another finger to press it into place before gently smoothing it out to get rid of any air bubbles or wrinkles., Using your scissors or a pair of nail clippers, trim off some of the excess tape at the top of your nail. Next use a nail file with a fine grit and file the top lightly, in the direction of the break, to even out the tape with the tip of your nail. Run your fingernail under cool water to get rid of any excess dust or material and pat dry with a clean cloth., This step isn’t necessary but recommended, especially if you don’t plan to do a more permanent nail repair. Apply 1-2 layers of nail polish, nail strengthening polish or a base coat to the nail. Make sure you wait 2 minutes between applications. If the rest of your nails are painted, paint this nail, too. Nails are dry when you can put them to your lips, and they are cool and no longer sticky or tacky., When you’re ready to remove your temporary nail ""band-aid,"" soak a cotton ball in acetone fingernail polish remover, stick your finger in it for about a minute so that it soaks into the tape, pull out your finger and gently peel off the tape in the direction of the break. The scotch tape may come off on its own when you take off your nail polish with an acetone remover."
"
Prep your fingernail.,
Apply nail or super glue to the break.,
File the glue and nail.,
Clean your nail.",How to Fix a Broken Fingernail3," Remove any nail polish by wetting a cotton ball, pad or cloth in nail polish remover and wiping it over your nail in the direction of the break to prevent more tearing. If the polish is very dark or has glitter, use an acetone remover. Next use either the finer-grit side of a regular emery board or the second-finest grit of a 4-way nail buffer and gently smooth the edge of the nail. Again, to avoid more damage, don’t saw back and forth when filing the edges., Both are thin glues that spread quickly, so you want to use them sparingly. Holding the break together with another finger, put 1 drop of either super glue or nail glue on top of the break and one beneath it. Use a toothpick or cuticle stick to spread it evenly along the length of the break, on both the top and bottom. Use the toothpick or cuticle stick to hold the nail in place for about 30-40 seconds.You need to hold it long enough to help it stick but not so long that you’ll sever the bond that’s forming when you try to remove the cuticle stick or toothpick.
These glues generally won’t last through numerous acetone nail polish removals, so reapplication will be necessary if you use acetone.

, Allow the glue to dry until it’s cool to the touch and not sticky or tacky. Because the glue won’t be smooth with the surface of your nail, take the coarser-grit side of the emery board or the second-coarsest side of the 4-way nail buffer and gently file the glue until it is nearly flush with the surface of your nail. Then use the finer-grit side of the emery board or the second-finest grit side of the 4-way buffer until there’s no ridge left..Pay close attention to the edges, making sure they’re flush with your skin, too. This will help prevent the break from tearing, and it will make the break less noticeable.

, To remove any super glue around your nail or in other places, take a cotton ball or Q-tip with acetone nail polish remover and dab it directly onto the glue, which will dissolve after it has fully absorbed. Then wipe the area with a clean cloth.If parts are still stuck, don't peel or pick at them. Apply more remover and repeat. To remove nail glue, soften your finger, and other areas if needed, in warm water for 2-3 minutes. Gently remove any glue that is soft but still on your finger. For larger, stubborn clumps, gently file them down. Then use a cotton ball or Q-tip to apply acetone remover to the glue for a few minutes before wiping the area clean.Afterward, wash your hands well with soap and warm water.

Clip off the broken nail.,
Stop any bleeding.,
Trim what’s left of your nail.,
Soak and clean your finger.,
Protect your fingernail and nail bed.,
Soak your finger in salt water.",How to Fix a Broken Fingernail4," When your fingernail has broken almost completely from the nail bed, it is generally necessary to remove the broken part to prevent infection. Use fingernail clippers or a pair of sewing or nail scissors to carefully clip off the nail only to the point at which the break ends. Carefully remove it from the nail bed using either your fingers or tweezers.

, If there is any bleeding, apply direct pressure to the area. Use a clean cloth, medical gauze or cotton balls. Press firmly and evenly for several minutes. Try to ensure the cloth, gauze or cotton doesn’t become caught on any rough or jagged edges around the breaking point. If it does, slowly and carefully disentangle it so the nail doesn’t tear more. If it starts bleeding again when you remove the cloth, gauze or cotton ball, repeat the procedure., To avoid more of your fingernail breaking and to help it grow out evenly, trim off any remaining pieces or edges. If the break was more vertical, for instance, and didn’t go the full length of your nail, use fingernail clippers or your scissors to cut the remaining nail closer to the nail bed. Next use the finer-grit side of an emery board or the second-finest grit of a 4-way nail buffer to smooth the now-short tip.If, however, the tear went the full length but is still jagged in places, such as in the corners, carefully use either the emery board or buffer to gently even out and smooth the nail so it’s more uniform.
Additionally, if the break was deep into your nail bed and bled a great deal, don't remove the nail but instead apply pressure to stop the bleeding and see a doctor.

, Fill a bowl, sink or a large cup with cool, not cold, water. Soak your finger in it for 20 minutes. Afterward, pat it dry using a clean, soft cloth and allow it a few minutes to completely air dry. Apply a pea-sized amount of triple antibiotic ointment to the area, which will help it heal more quickly and reduce the likelihood of infection., After applying the antibiotic ointment, immediately wrap your fingernail and nail bed fairly tightly in a band-aid. Alternatively, you could use gauze pads and medical tape to cover the nail and nail bed. Wear bandages the rest of that day and for the next two days., On day four, you can stop wearing a bandage. Mix 8 ounces of warm water with 1/4 teaspoon of salt. Make sure you stir it briskly so the salt doesn’t settle to the bottom. Soak your finger in the salt water for 20 minutes per day for the next seven days to further prevent the risk of infection. Halfway through each soak, remove your finger for just a minute and again stir the salt water.Make sure you keep your finger as clean as possible during this time, washing frequently with an antibacterial soap like Dial. If it becomes extremely dirty, wash it with soap and warm water as soon as you can and dry it with a clean cloth.
Monitor your fingernail as it heals. If, after the 7th day of soaking it in salt water, there are signs of infection, such as pus, redness, heat around the nail and swelling, see a physician."
"
Use air duster.,
Blow dry your nails.,
Spray your nails with a cooking spray.",How to Dry Your Painted Nails Quickly2," Air dusters are not just for cleaning keyboards!

"
Place your hands under a UV or LED Light.,
Use quick dry polishes.,
Dry with drying drops.",How to Dry Your Painted Nails Quickly3," They are generally what you use when getting your nails professionally done. UV lights use ultra-violent waves to dry your polish quickly and into a solid coat.These lights are often recommended for gel coats.

, Instead of using a product to quickly dry your nails, there are polishes out there that advertise quick drying times. Use these polishes to get a quick manicure., Nail polishes add thickeners to properly stay consistent. You can make your polish thinner, and thus easier to evaporate and dry, by adding a commercial drying drop to the polish after application.Your favorite polish brands may carry dry drops specifically designed for their polishes. Look at your local retailer for more information.

"
"
Use thin coats.,
Clean your nails.,
Use a top coat.",How to Dry Your Painted Nails Quickly4," The thinner coats on your nails will dry faster than a thick one. Thin coats will evaporate faster. Instead of applying one thick coat, try to apply a thin coat and wait for a minute or two for it to dry. Then add another coat and repeat until you reach your desired manicure.

, If you start with clean nail beds and cuticles, your nail polish will adhere better and dry faster. Start your manicure with healthy hands and your manicure will look more stunning.

Do not overwork your hair.,
Avoid excessive blow drying.,
Use only as much gel as necessary.",How to Add Sculpted Waves to Short Hair," To begin your sculpted curls, use a fine toothed comb to form a part down the center of your scalp. For best results, part your hair when it's dry. Strive to get your part as straight as possible, as your sculpted curls will look neater when centered around a straight part., You want to create a series of horizontal lines running down either side of your head. You will sculpt curls within the sections created by these lines. To start, you should create one horizontal line about an inch up from your ear on one side of your head. It does not matter if you start on the left or right side.Use your comb the same way you would use it to create a part. Make a horizontal line running from the edge of your hair to the part at the center of your hairline.
Use a hair clip to clip the hair on the top half of the hairline. This will keep it out of the way.

, Apply a generous amount of sculpting gel to the hair that falls beneath the first horizontal line. You can use your fingers to work the gel into your hair., Move your comb upward an inch away from the first line you made. Make another line and secure the hair above the line with hair clips to keep it out of the way. Then, add gel to the hair below the second line.Continue making horizontal lines and adding gel until you've reached your center part.

, Move to the opposite side of your head. Again, start with a line running about an inch up from your ear. Secure the hair above this line in hair clips and then apply gel using your fingers. Continue to make lines like this an inch apart until you reach your center part.When you're done, the hair on either side of your head should be separated into horizontal lines about an inch wide.

, You can sculpt your curls into whatever shape you like using your fingers and a comb. Start creating curls at the top of your head.Press your finger down near your scalp, just next to the part line.
Use your comb to curl a small segment of hair around your finger, creating a tight ringlet.
Then, remove your finger. The gel should hold this ringlet in place.

, While the gel should keep your ringlets more or less in place, you should further secure them with hair pins. This will allow the gel to set more. Keep creating ringlets in each section using your fingers and a fine toothed comb. When you're done, secure each section in place with pins., Keep moving upward, working your way towards the center part, sculpting curls in each section. Stop at the sections near the top of your ear, which were the first sections you created. You should not curl these sections for this look, as the ends of your hair are sensitive and prone to damage. Instead, tuck your hair inwards at the ends., Once each section is curled and pinned, add hairspray. Apply a generous amount and hold the bottle close to your head while spraying.As you'll be applying hairspray at close range, it may be a good idea to wear goggles or something else to protect your eyes.

, After your hair is curled to your liking, use a blow dryer to dry it. Use the lowest setting, as you should always be gentle when drying hair. Slowly blow dry your hair until the gel has hardened., You can now take the pins out of your hair. If the gel has hardened, the look should be set. It should hold well throughout the day as long as you do not engage in too many vigorous activities. You may want to add hairspray on occasion.

, If you have bangs, do not attempt to flatten them with gel or push them apart with your side part. It's okay to simply let your bangs hang. It can be complicated to curl bangs as they're so short, and parting them may look awkward., It's easy to damage short hair by overworking it. Try to get your curls in place quickly to minimize time spent teasing your hair with your comb. Try to work as quickly as possible sculpting your curls to prevent your hair from becoming frizzy or messy during the process., Short hair is much more susceptible to damage from blow drying than longer hair. Only blow dry your hair as long as necessary to harden the gel. Usually, you should only blow dry short hair about 50% dry., For sculpting curls, you will need to add more gel than usual. However, add only as much as you need for your hair to be shapeable. Too much gel can make short hair look greasy."

Debris may appear under your nail, giving it a dark appearance.;
, An unpleasant odor doesn't always accompany a fungal infection. If you show other signs of infection but no smell, don't assume that means you're in the clear. , Nail fungus spreads easily. You may find that more than one (but usually not all) of your nails are also infected.If you see discoloration on a few of your nails, it is another sign you are dealing with nail fungus.

, These are clear symptoms of an infection, and it is probably pretty advanced. Ignoring the infection may affect your ability to walk and allow it to spread to other nails or the skin around your nails., When used daily, this ointment (usually used to treat coughing) can be effective in reducing the symptoms of an infection. Apply a small amount with cotton swab., Keeping your nails short reduces pressure on your toe or finger, relieving pain. Trimming can become difficult when infected nails become thick and hard, however, so you may need to soften them first. Buy a non-prescription lotion containing urea, which can thin and break down the diseased part of the nail plate.


Before bed, cover the infected nail with the lotion and wrap it in a bandage.In the morning, rinse your feet with soap and water to remove the cream. The nails should soon begin to soften enough for you to file or cut them.Look for a 40% urea lotion.

You won't see results until the nail is completely regrown, which may take over four months.These drugs can sometimes have severe side effects and are not recommended if you have liver disease or congestive heart failure., This remedy requires you to paint the infected nails and the surrounding skin once daily. At the end of the week, you remove the layers of polish with alcohol and begin the process over.This method can take up to a year to keep the infection at bay., Antifungal creams may be prescribed alone or in conjunction with another treatment, like oral drugs. To help the cream penetrate your nail, try thinning your nails first. You can either soak them in water or treat them overnight with a urea cream., Depending on the severity of the infection, your doctor may recommend surgically removing the nail. This allows topical treatments to be applied directly to your skin and to the new nail as it grows back.If the infection is extremely painful or does not respond to treatment, your doctor may decide to permanently remove the nail.It may take as long as a year for your nail to grow back., Fungal infections spread very easily, and they thrive in damp environments. Protect yourself by wearing flip-flops or other shower shoes that will reduce your contact with potentially contaminated surfaces., Wash your hands and feet regularly, making sure you wash between your fingers and toes. Keep your nails short and dry, and file down any thick areas of your nail plate.Your toenails should not extend beyond the length of your toe.Try to dry your hands as often as possible if you have a job where your hands are often wet, like bartending or housekeeping. If you have to wear rubber gloves, make sure you change them so your hands don't get too sweaty and damp.If you suspect you have an infection, do not paint over your nail with regular nail polish and try to hide it. This can trap moisture and make the infection worse., Throw away old shoes and look for shoes that reduce humidity, which will keep your feet from getting damp. Change your socks regularly (more than once a day if you sweat a lot), and look for fabrics that wick moisture away from your skin, such as wool, nylon and polypropylene., Make sure any salon where you get a manicure or pedicure carefully sterilizes all their tools. If you can't tell how rigorous their sterilizing process is, bring your own instruments and disinfect them afterwards.Disinfect your nail or cuticle clippers or any other tools you use to keep your nails trim and healthy.

Clean dirt from under your nails.,
Wash your hands.,
Soak your nails in a bowl of warm, soapy water for about three minutes.,
Use a nail brush to scrub the tops.,
Remove nail polish, if necessary.,
Wash your hands again.",How to Clean Your Fingernails1," Using the tip of the nail pick on a pair of clippers, clean underneath your fingernails to remove dirt and other built-up grime. Do this in the bathroom, under good lighting, so you'll be able to see your nails clearly.


In generally, it's easier to clean the dirt from underneath your nails before you wash your hands instead of after. The drier the better.
Avoid using a pencil to clean them out, as the lead may cause them to look dirtier.;
, Use a mild, natural soap and wash your hands under warm water. You don't need to focus on your nails specifically, just wash your hands.


It's generally better to use mild soap and wash your hands more regularly. Strong, harsh paraben-based soaps will make nails brittle, and alcohol-based hand sanitizers likewise weaken nails. Try a fingernail-specific soap, like OrigiNails Bubble White.

, Submerge the very tips of your fingers, not your whole hands, under the water and let them soften slightly. Make sure the water isn't too lukewarm or scalding hot, but a comfortable temperature somewhere in between.


Soaking nails help to make them softer and more pliable, making it much less likely that you'll chip or break a nail during the cleaning process., After soaking, scrub your nails hard, and all over, including underneath your nails. When you're finished, pat your hands dry.









If you don't have a brush specifically for cleaning your nails, use a clean toothbrush specifically for the purpose.

, Use a strengthening nail polish remover and cotton balls or wipes, and wet them with the polish remover. Scrub your nails firmly to strip the nail polish left on your nails, starting from the cuticle of the nail and working toward the fingertip, not forgetting to do the sides. Survey your nails afterwards for any more nail polish, and remove it if necessary.









The remover should dry thoroughly by itself, but you can keep a tissue or dry cotton ball nearby to help scrub after applying the wet cotton ball, as well.

, Give your hands another quick rinse and then pat them dry, don't rub them. Rub on some rich hand cream, if you want, or go about the rest of your routine.


Make sure the nails are all completely even and file or clip them if necessary. Finish off the look with a neat coat of clear polish to strengthen the nail.

Treat yellow nails with lemon juice or tea tree oil.,
Use denture-cleaning solution on your nails.,
Try apple-cider vinegar.,
Use supplements to strengthen nails.,
Give yourself periodic vacations from polish.",How to Clean Your Fingernails2," If you want healthy-looking, strong nails that will look clean and stay clean, mix a paste of baking soda and hydrogen peroxide, using about 2 1/2 tablespoons of baking soda per tablespoon of hydrogen peroxide to create a paste. Spread the paste on and underneath your nails, then rinse and pat dry.









Applied weekly, this mixture helps to keep your nails white and luminescent, especially after having used a darker nail polish.Alternatively, try using whitening toothpaste in the same way. The active ingredients are essentially the same, if you're not interested in mixing up a batch of the home-made stuff.

, To keep your nails pliable and free of cracks and other problems, it's a good idea to moisturize them regularly with aloe, cocoa butter lotion, or even natural oils like olive or coconut. These natural treatments won't necessarily change the look of your nails, but will help to keep them soft and pliable over the course of the week.








, If you have yellowish nails, it can be the result of either smoking, stain from polish, or a fungal infection, which can be difficult to treat and get rid of. Tea tree oil, however, is a natural fungicide with antimicrobial and antiseptic properties, while lemon juice or lemon essential oil has citric acid which helps to whiten nails back to their original luster.









If you have yellow nails, try using an eye dropper to drop a small amount of tea tree oil onto each of your nails and let sit for 5 minutes, then rinse. Apply lemon juice in the same way, rinse, and clean your hands normally.

, While it might sound strange, tablets used to make denture-cleaning solutions are high in citric acid and sodium bicarbonate (baking soda), which can be used to clean, whiten, and otherwise improve the look of your nails. Instead of soaking false teeth, soak your fingernails.

Retinoids. These are the most commonly recommended medicines for acne. Retinoid creams, lotions, and gels help to prevent your pores from clogging. Your dermatologist may also recommend Dapsone along with the retinoids to increase their effectiveness.

Antibiotic creams or pills. Sometimes acnes can be so severe that it causes infections. When this happens, you may need a prescription antibiotic cream or pills to help the acne heal.

Oral contraceptives. If you are female, then your doctor may recommend oral contraceptives to help control your acne. However, there are some serious potential side effects associated with taking oral contraceptives, so make sure that you ask your doctor about the risks before you decide if this treatment is right for you.

Spironolactone. If oral contraceptives don’t work for you, then your doctor may recommend spironolactone (Aldactone).

Isotretinoin. This is a last resort treatment because of the potentially serious side effects, but it can be an effective treatment if other treatments have not helped. However, due to the risk of birth defects, women of child-bearing age have to take a pregnancy test to receive this medication.

, Rough skin can also result from acne scars, but there are some treatments that may help. Some things you might ask your dermatologist about include:Dermabrasion.

Soft tissue fillers. Your doctor can also inject fat into pitted areas of your skin to smooth out the surface. However, the results are only temporary, so you would need to have this treatment done on a regular basis to maintain the results.

Chemical peels. Peels can remove outer layers of skin and help to reduce the appearance of acne scars.

Laser resurfacing and light therapy. These treatments use lasers to help even out your skin’s surface and improve its appearance.

Skin graft surgery. For severe scars, a piece of skin can be surgically grafted onto your face. The results of this procedure are permanent, but the procedure is more serious than other treatments.

Sort your lip products by color.,
Mix two or more lip products together to create a new color.,
Test the color against your skin.,
Apply to your lips.",How to Make Your Own Lip Color1," When you’re mixing lip products to create a custom color, it helps to separate them according to color. That will make it easier when you’re trying to tweak the color exactly to your specifications.For example, you might make a pile of red lip products, one for pink, one for nude, and so on.
You may also further sort your lip products by type. For example, you might make separate piles of red lipsticks, red glosses, and red lip pencils. it’s usually easier to mix lip color together if they’re the same type of product because the consistency will be similar.
You may also want to consider separating your lip products based on finish. For example, separate matte, glossy, frosty, and glitter finish lip products into different piles. That way, if you want to change the finish of your lip color, you’ll know which pile to grab from.;
, Once your lip products are separated by color, you can choose two or more than will help you create your unique color. Use a lip brush or small metal spatula to take some of each shade and place them on some type of surface such as a plastic plate or dish. Mix them together with your brush or spatula until fully combined.If you’re only making the lip color for one-time use, you only need to take a little of each shade. However, if you want to create a custom color that you can use repeatedly, take a larger amount of each shade and make sure that you have a container, such as a small metal makeup pan or jar, to store the excess in.
You don’t necessarily have to mix the lip products on a separate surface -- try layering them on your lips directly and blotting your lips together to mix the colors. In fact, that’s the best way to mix lip pencils because those products don’t have enough texture to mix on a plate or palette.

, If you’ve mixed your lip colors on a palette or other surface, it’s best to try the custom shade out before applying it to your lips. Use a brush or your finger to swipe the custom shade on the back of your hand to see if you’re happy with the color.If you aren’t happy with the shade of your custom lip color, you can tweak it by adding more of one or more of the lip products. Keep mixing until you’re happy with the color, but be sure to test it again before applying.

, When you’re happy with the final shade of your custom lip color, use a clean finger or lip brush to apply it to your lips. Depending on the finishes of the lip products you’ve used, you may want to finish off your lips with a coat of clear lip gloss or balm to add some shine."

Choose an eyeshadow or blush that’s the color you want.,
Mix some of the powder makeup with a clear lip product.,
Test the shade before applying to your lips.",How to Make Your Own Lip Color2," Look through your powder eye shadows and blushes to find one or more shades that is similar to the lip color that you have in mind. However, it’s important to make sure that the eye shadow and/or blush is safe to use on your lips.It’s usually best to use mineral makeup for mixing up a custom color with eyeshadow and blush because they’re often made with all-natural ingredients.

, After you’ve found the powder product(s) in the right shade, take a clear lip gloss or balm and use a lip brush, small metal spatula, or cotton swab to mix some of the powder(s) into it. Blend until the powder is completely blended into the clear lip product.If you’re making the lip color for one-time use, you can mix the powder and lip product on the back of your hand, a makeup palette, or a plastic plate or dish. If you want to make a lip color to use in the future, mix the two in a small plastic pot or a metal makeup pan.
It’s easiest to use loose powder eye shadows and blushes to mix into the lip gloss or balm because you can just sprinkle them in. If you’re using a pressed shadow or blush, you’ll need to use a butter knife or nail file to scrape some out of the pan.
If you’re mixing the powder product with a clear lip gloss, it’s easiest to use one that comes in a squeeze tube because you can squeeze out the amount you need. If you’re using a gloss that comes in a tube with a doe foot applicator, wipe the excess product off the applicator onto your palette or into your container or on the back of your hand.
If you’re mixing the powder product with a clear lip balm, it’s easiest to use a formula that comes in a pot so you can just scoop out the amount you need. If you’re using a balm that comes in stick form, you’ll need to use a butter knife or nail file to scrape off some of the balm from the stick.

, Once the powder product is fully mixed into your clear lip product, use your finger or a lip brush to test the color on the back of your hand. If you’re happy with the shade, you can apply it to your lips. If the color isn’t exactly what you want, mix in a little more of one or more of the powder products to tweak it.A custom lip color made with a clear gloss or balm will be on the sheer side. You’ll have to layer on the color if you want it be more opaque.

Melt the beeswax pastilles, shea butter, and coconut oil.,
Mix in some natural coloring.,
Pour the mixture into a container and allow it to cool.",How to Make Your Own Lip Color3," Add 1 teaspoon (4.5 g) of beeswax pastille, 1 teaspoon (4.5 g) of shea butter, and 1 teaspoon (4.5 g) of coconut oil to a glass jar. Place the jar in a small saucepan that’s halfway full of simmering water, and allow the contents to melt, which should take approximately 3 to 5 minutes.You can find beeswax pastille at a variety of online retailers.
You can substitute cocoa butter for the shea butter if you prefer.

, The mixture in the glass jar will be clear, so you’ll need to add coloring to it. Add in a pinch or two of your chosen natural colorings to the beeswax mixture, and stir well until the mixture is the color that you want.Natural food coloring that’s made of vegetable colorants work really well to color homemade lip colors. They typically come in the primary shades of red, blue, and yellow, but you can mix those three to create a wide variety of colors. Start with a single drop of the coloring, and add more if necessary.
For red lip colors, you can also use beet root powder. Start with ⅛ of a teaspoon (.25 g), and see if you like the color before adding more.
For a brown lip color, you can mix in ¼ teaspoon (.5 g) of organic cocoa powder or a pinch of cinnamon or turmeric.
You can also mix a drop of an essential oil of your choice to the mixture to give it a pleasant scent if you want.

, Once you’ve mixed the beeswax mixture until it’s reached the desired color, use a medicine dropper to transfer it to a container, such as an empty lipstick container or a small cosmetics pot. Allow the lip color to cool completely until it solidifies, which should take approximately 2 to 3 hours, before applying.The lip color will expand slightly as it cools, so don’t fill your container all the way to the top.
You can purchase empty lipstick containers and other cosmetics containers from beauty supply stores and online retailers.

Remove the wrappers from crayon shades you plan to use.,
Combine some shea butter with oil in a metal ladle, and add the crayon.,
Hold the ladle over a lit candle to melt the crayon.,
Pour the melted mixture into a container and refrigerate.",How to Make Your Own Lip Color4," To make a lipstick, you’ll need one full crayon. You can use a mix of two or more shades, but the total pieces used should add up to only one crayon. Choose the shade(s) that you plan to use and completely remove the wrapper(s).Make sure that you’re using non-toxic crayons that are made for children, such as Crayola.
It’s usually easier to remove the wrapper from a crayon if you wet the paper first.

, Take a large metal ladle and mix together ½ teaspoon (2.25 g) of shea butter and ½ teaspoon (7.5 ml) of an oil of your choice. Next, add in the crayon(s) that you’re using to color the lipstick.Olive, almond, jojoba, coconut, and argan oils all work well for the lipstick.
If you’re using a single crayon color for the lipstick, it helps to break it into pieces before adding it to the ladle.

, Once all of the ingredients are in the ladle, light a small candle. Place the ladle over the candle, holding it approximately 3-inches (8-cm) from the flame. It should take approximately 30 seconds for the crayon to begin to melt, but continue to hold the ladle over the candle until it is completely liquefied.While the crayon is melting, use a spoon to stir it into the other ingredients so they are completely mixed together.

, When the crayon has melted completely and the ingredients are fully combined, remove the ladle from the heat. Use a spoon to pour the mixture into a container, such as a metal makeup pan or plastic jar. Next, place the container in the refrigerator and allow it to cool for at least 15 minutes.You can mix cosmetic grade glitter into the mixture after you remove the ladle from the heat if you want your lipstick to have a glittery finish.
Be extremely careful when you’re pouring the mixture into the container because it will be very hot.
If there is more of the melted crayon mixture than you need to make your lipstick, don’t pour it down the sink. It will harden in the pipes and may cause a clog. Instead, allow the mixture to cool in the ladle,and then pry it out and throw it away once it’s cooled.

You’ll need Candelilla wax to make your lip balm solid. Candelilla wax is a plant-based wax, from the stems of the Candelilla shrub, that is an alternative to beeswax in cosmetic recipes.You can order it online.
In addition to Candelilla, you’ll need a solid butter (shea, mango, or cocoa) and a type of liquid oil (olive, sunflower, avocado, sweet almond, apricot kernel).
For scent, you’ll need peppermint essential oil, which you can find online or at most natural foods stores. Feel free to substitute another essential oil or leave out the essential oil for an unscented balm.
For your balm, you’ll need containers. For this recipe, you can uses lip balm tubes, which you can order inexpensively online, or tins, based on your preference.The base recipe makes about 8 tubes worth of lip balm.;
, Heat up about an inch of water on your stove in the bottom pan of a double boiler. Place 3 tablespoons of your liquid oil, 1/2 a tablespoon of Candelilla wax, and 1 tablespoon of your solid butter in the top part of the double boiler.


Melt your ingredients on low heat, and stir occasionally.
For a shinier lip balm, add in ½ tablespoon of castor oil as a part of your 3 tablespoons of liquid oil.
Make sure the mixture is completely liquified, and then take this pan off the heat. Let it cool for just a few minutes.

, Essential oils should always be added in after the main heating process, as heat can speed up the oxidation process in essential oils and cause them to go rancid more quickly.Add in more or less essential oil to your taste. This will depend on how strongly scented you want your balm to be.

, If you plan to use lip balm tubes, it can be helpful to get a lip balm filling tray that will hold your tubes upright as you pour your balm into them.If you are using tins, simply fill them almost to the top.
Use a funnel to make your lip balm easier to pour.

, You want to leave your balm in place as it cools and hardens, so that it doesn’t harden in a lopsided shape.

Invest in a quality coconut oil.,
Find a tin.,
Melt a few tablespoons of coconut oil.You can melt coconut oil over a double boiler or in the microwave.,
Add scent or tint to your balm.,
Pour the coconut oil into your tin, and allow it to cool.",How to Make Lip Balm Without Beeswax or Vaseline2," Coconut oil is a great product to use on its own as a balm because it is moisturizing, completely non-toxic and natural, and has antibacterial and antifungal properties.


When choosing your coconut oil, you want oil that is unrefined. It should state this on the jar, and should have a slight odor of coconut.
You can find quality coconut oil in the natural foods section of grocery stores, in vitamin shops, and online.

, Because coconut oil is semi-solid oil, you want to pour it into tin or jar, rather than a lip balm tube. At a normal indoor room temperature, coconut oil is solid, but it melts at 78 degrees Fahrenheit.


You can find small cosmetic jars at most natural foods stores.
You can also repurpose a tin for your lip balm. For example, Altoid tins make great containers for lip balm.
If you’re going to take your balm out in the heat, make sure to keep it in a container that seals tightly so the oil doesn’t leak out.

,


If you use the microwave to melt your oil, heat it in increments of 20 seconds, stirring between each heating.
The oil should be a clear liquid with no solid pieces left.

, If you prefer a plain balm, you can leave your oil as is. However, if you want something a little more luxurious, you can make your lip balm scented or give it a slight color.


For scent, use the essential oil of your choice. Use 1 to 2 drops of essential oil for each tablespoon of coconut oil. You can also use vanilla extract to make a vanilla lip balm, using a few drops per tablespoon of oil.
For color, melt a small piece of an old lipstick into your coconut oil, and stir it thoroughly.
For a natural alternative, use a pigmented vegetable like beets. To make a pink tint, simmer a cubed beet with three tablespoons of vegetable glycerin on low heat for thirty minutes.You can find vegetable glycerin at natural foods stores like Whole Foods.
After the mixture simmers, strain out the beet, and add some of the now-colored glycerin to your melted coconut oil.

, If your tin or jar is small, you can use a funnel to make the pouring process less messy.


Put your finished balm in the refrigerator to make it cool more quickly.
You can even permanently store your coconut oil balm in the fridge. This will keep it solid even during hot days, and it will give you something refreshingly cold to put on your lips.

Stir in the honey, avocado oil, and zinc.,
Blend your balm with a hand mixer.",How to Make Lip Balm Without Beeswax or Vaseline3," Made in larger quantities, it can also serve as a sunscreen balm for your whole body.


You’ll need green tea, unrefined coconut oil, Candelilla wax, honey, and avocado oil.
Zinc oxide, which you can order online, powder provides the primary sun protection.
If you don’t want to use honey, you can substitute an equal amount of natural aloe vera gel, either scraped straight from the leaf or store-bought. You can substitute another liquid oil, such as sweet almond or olive oil, in place of the avocado oil.

,
Cover the mixture, and let it simmer on low for 1 hour. After an hour, strain the tea out of the oil with a fine mesh strainer or cheesecloth.

, You’ll need two tablespoons of your green tea-infused oil (you can store the rest in the fridge) and ½ teaspoon of Candelilla wax. Heat these together in a double boiler over medium-low heat.


When the wax is completely melted, take them off of the stove.

, Once you take your oil off the stove, you need to add in the rest of the ingredients in your sun balm.


Add 1 teaspoon of honey, 1 teaspoon of avocado oil, and 2 teaspoons of zinc oxide powder.
Stir until ingredients are completely combined.

, This step will make your sun-protectant lip balm creamy and airy. If you want to pour your balm into lip balm tubes, skip this step, and pour the liquid directly into the tubes.

Baking sheet
Mixing bowl and spoon (or a resealable plastic bag)
Spatula;
, There are many popular salt choices for bath salts, many of which are sea salts. You can mix and match your salt ratios depending on your personal preferences. With a spoon, mix together the desired portions of salt together in a medium bowl. Some of the most common bath salt choices include:Epsom salts, which aren’t actually a salt, but rather magnesium sulfate in crystal form. Epsom salts are soothing for the muscles and help to soften the water.Sea salts, and especially Dead Sea salts, which can reduce the symptoms of arthritis, rheumatism, psoriasis, and eczema.
Hawaiian red bath salts, which may help with wounds, aches, and sprains.

, Once the salts are mixed together, stir in the baking soda. When that has been incorporated, add your desired essential oils. Stir in five drops at a time until they are fully incorporated, and continue adding in increments of five drops until you achieve the desired potency.


Instead of using a bowl and spoon to mix your bath salts, you can instead mix all the ingredients together in a resealable plastic bag. Once the ingredients are in, seal the bag, and use your hands to mash the salts together with the baking soda and essential oils., To add color to your bath salts, add five drops at a time like you did with the essential oils until you achieve the desired shade and vibrancy.You can use food coloring, soap coloring, or another skin-safe color.


Similarly, if you want to add glycerinor oil to your bath salts for an extra moisturizing concoction, add those now and stir to mix.
Other optional ingredients include fruit zest and juice, fresh herbs and seeds, flower petals, and extracts.

, This step is optional, but it will help to dry out the bath salts and remove clumps. It’s important to bake it on low heat, however, to prevent the oils and fragrances from burning off.Preheat your oven to 200 F (93 C).
Spread the bath salt mixture evenly over a baking sheet.
Bake the mixture for 15 minutes, stirring every five minutes.
After 15 minutes, remove the bath salts from the oven and allow to cool.

, To use your bath salts, simply add one-half cup to the running water as you draw your bath.Store the remainder in an airtight jar, such as a mason jar or old jam jar., The basic bath salt mixture can be spruced up for any occasion or for a personalized gift, and there are many options for adding new ingredients, extracts, and oils. To make a relaxing and soothing bath salt mixture, take your basic bath salts and gently stir in:One tablespoon (2.4 g) of fresh rosemary
Two tablespoons (4.8 g) of lavender flowers
Peppermint essential oil, 10 drops
Eucalyptus essential oil, five drops
Rosemary essential oil, five drops
Lavender essential oil, five drops
Cinnamon essential oil, five drops

, For a refreshing and rejuvenating bath, try a citrus bath salt mix. Choose a citrus fruit (or combination), such as orange, lemon, or lime. Zest the fruit and add the zest to your basic bath salt mixture. Then, cut the fruit in half, extract the juice, and add this to your bath salt mixture as well.Complementary essential oils include:


Bergamot
Tangerine
Grapefruit
Orange, lemon, or lime
Mint, Herbal bath salts for relaxing and refreshing baths can be made using a combination of essential oils, extracts, and one to two tablespoons (2.4 to 4.8 g) of dried or fresh ground herbs.Once you’ve added the herbs, rub the salt and herbs together in your fingers to release the oils. Some of the more popular bath-time herbs include:


Rosemary
Thyme
Mint or peppermint
Basil
Sage

, When you are sick or feeling under the weather, a calming bath with medicinal bath salts might be exactly what the doctor ordered. To make a batch of cold-relieving bath salts that will help clear your sinuses, add in:Five to 10 drops of eucalyptus essential oil
Five to 10 drops of rosemary essential oil
Two tablespoons of fresh or dried ground peppermint

, Similar to the herbal bath salt concoction, floral bath salts can be made with a combination of essential oils and fresh or dried flower petals or pods. Like with the herbs, if you are using fragrant flowers like lavender, rub the flowers or leaves between your fingers to release the oils after adding them to the salt.Popular flower choices are:One-quarter cup (9.6 g) of rose petals
One-quarter cup (9.6 g) of chamomile flowers
One to two tablespoons (2.4 to 4.8 g) of lavender flowers or leaves
Fresh vanilla or vanilla extract
Ylang ylang essential oil

, If you used coloring agents to give your bath salts different colors, you can mix and match layers in the same jar to create fun and unique rainbow bath salts. For instance, you could layer together a mint-green mixture and a pink grapefruit blend to create a minty, citrusy, morning bath salt mix.


Pour in two to three inches of your first bath salt color choice. Shake the jar gently and tilt it so the salts settle on an angle. Then, add one to two inches of another color, and tilt the jar to help the new layer settle at the same angle.Repeat with as many colors as desired. Be sure to slightly vary the thickness of each layer.

, It may also help loosen phlegm.Peppermint, on the other hand, contains menthol, which is a natural decongestant. It also helps thin out phlegm.Lastly, lavender does not help much when it comes to congestion, but it is naturally soothing and calming; it may help relieve any headaches that are caused by congestion.If you want something more fragrant, you can use 3 to 4 drops of each oil instead. Don't use more than that, however.
If this is for a child 10 years or older, stick with 2 drops of each oil. Anything more than that may be harmful.If the child is younger than 10, seek a doctor's advice.

, Add the liquid 1 tablespoon (15 milliliters) at a time, mixing it in with a rubber spatula after each addition. Keep adding your liquid and mixing until you get the consistency of wet sand and the mixture holds together.You can also spritz the water or witch hazel in using a spray bottle instead. It will take about 5 to 7 squirts.Avoid adding too much liquid, or the mixture may start to fizz.
Alternatively, you can use ¼ cup (50 grams) of melted coconut oil instead. The oil may make the shower floor slippery, but it will help the shower bombs hold together better., Choose something that has a flat bottom; this way, the shower bombs will be able to sit in your shower without rolling around. The type of mold used for baking cupcakes or making chocolates/candy would work great. You can use other kinds of molds as well, such as a plastic candy-making mold or mini muffin tins.


Make sure that you pack the mixture in firmly. If you don't, the shower bombs won't set properly, and may crumble when you handle them., A great place to keep them would be on a baking sheet in a cool oven.

, If the shower bombs start to crumble, stop, and let them sit in the molds for a few more hours. Once the shower bombs are dry, carefully pop them out of the molds, and let them sit on a flat surface overnight., Turn on your shower, and place one shower bomb on the floor, close to the drain. The hot water will cause the shower bomb to dissolve, and to release the essential oils into the air. Store any leftover shower bombs in an airtight container.

If you cannot get any cornstarch, try arrowroot powder. If you cannot find any of that either, you may be able to make your shower bombs with just baking soda and water.

, You will need up to ⅓ cup (80 milliliters) of water. Stir the water into the baking soda mixture using a rubber spatula.








, Make sure that the mold you are using is safe to use in the oven. Some molds may be labeled as ""silicon,"" but are not actually oven-safe. The silicone molds for baking cupcakes or for making chocolates/candy would be ideal.









Make sure that you are packing the mixture as firmly as you can, or the shower bombs will be more likely to crumble.

, During this time, the mixture will dry and harden. If you do not wish to use an oven, you can set these out someplace where they won't get disturbed for 24 to 48 hours; they must be perfectly dry.







, Do not take them out of the molds just yet. If you take them out too soon, they might not be fully dry, and might crumble as a result.







, If the shower bombs start to crumble easily, they might not be dry all the way; wait 12 hours before checking on them again.

, They may also help loosen or thin out any phlegm. Lavender, on the other hand, will help relax your muscles, and sooth any headaches that might be caused by the congestion.








, Turn on your shower, and place one of the shower bombs on the floor, near the drain. The warm water will dissolve the shower bomb, and help release the essential oils into the air. Keep the rest of the shower bombs in an airtight container.

Use a boar bristle brush when your hair is dry.",How to Have Smooth and Silky Hair1," It might be hard to wash your hair in ice-cold water, but if you want silky, smooth hair, make it as chilly as you can take. Cold water helps the hair shaft lie flat, so when it dries it has a smooth, shiny appearance. Hot water has the opposite effect, creating frizz and drying out your hair.


If you can’t stand the thought of taking a cold shower, take a shower using warm water and wash your hair separately.;
, In order for your hair to stay soft and smooth, it needs the natural conditioning of sebum, the oil that your scalp produces to keep your hair strong. If you wash your hair every day, you rinse away this nourishing oil before it ever gets the chance to soften your hair. Washing your hair every day will eventually make it feel dry and coarse instead of smooth and silky.


Find the washing routine that’s right for you. Some people do it two or three times a week, while others wash every other day if their hair is especially oily.
In between washings, dry shampoo to keep your hair looking fresh.

Sulfates are effective and washing away oil and grease, but using this ingredient on your hair can be too harsh and damaging. Look for sulfate-free shampoo that will cleanse your hair without stripping away its protective oils.

, Conditioner helps hair stay smooth and silky by moisturizing it and keeping it tangle-free. Look for a conditioner that will keep your hair smooth without weighing it down. Silicone-free conditioner is best, since silicones build up in your hair and cause it to look dull after awhile.


Leave-in conditioners are great for hair that tends to be dry or coarse. Since you don’t rinse them out, they add an extra layer of protection against dry air and humidity that can cause your hair to frizz up.

, Gently combing your hair instead of brushing it while it’s wet will prevent it from getting broken and damaged. Hair is fragile when it’s wet, and using a wide-toothed comb allows you to detangle it without causing problems. Start near the tips and work your way up to the roots so you don’t pull out any hair.

, This type of brush is made using natural bristles that are similar to the texture of human hair. It’s used to pull sebum from the scalp down to the tips of the hair, so that the entire length of hair gets its nourishing benefits. Brushing your hair using a boar bristle brush is as effective as a deep conditioning treatment in helping your hair feel soft and silky.


However, don’t brush your hair when it’s wet, since this can cause it to break.
Only use a boar bristle brush, or another one designed specifically to distribute your natural oils. Plastic-bristled brushes don’t work the same way, and they can damage your hair.

Smooth some in after taking a shower, or apply it while your hair is dry if it frizzes up during the day.

, This oil is made from a tree that grows in Morocco. It has been found to have restorative properties that help hair stay smooth, strong and healthy. It’s so lightweight that you can apply it to your hair as a leave-in conditioner. Just smooth a little into your hair, focusing on the tips, while your hair is still damp after shampooing.


There’s no need to apply as much oil to the roots area, since this part of your hair will naturally get oily faster than the rest of your hair.

, Once a week, try this treatment to get soft, smooth, shiny hair. Take a tablespoon or so of coconut oil and comb it into your hair from the roots to the tips, making sure every strand is covered. Cover your hair with a shower cap or a piece of plastic wrap and let the oil sit in your hair for an hour or overnight. Shampoo your hair two or three times to rinse out all of the oil. When your hair dries, you’ll be impressed with the results.


Coconut oil is solid at room temperature, so you may have to warm it up before applying.
Use unrefined coconut oil, rather than refined coconut oil, since it is better suited to cosmetic use.

, Comb a tablespoon of olive oil through your hair, then cover your hair with a shower cap or piece of plastic wrap. Let it soak into your hair for an hour, then remove the cap and shampoo your hair two or three times to rinse out the oil. Dry your hair as usual.

, This makes a great stand-in for conditioner, and will instantly create a softer, shinier look. Separate two eggs and whisk the whites in a bowl. In the shower, wet your hair and apply the egg whites, making sure to comb it through from the roots to the tips. Let it sit while you do everything else you need to do in the shower, then shampoo your hair to rinse it out.

, Honey brightens, smooths and softens hair, and banana adds some moisture. Mash up a banana with a tablespoon of honey. In the shower, wet your hair and comb the honey banana mask through from the roots to the tips. Let it sit in your hair while you take your shower, then shampoo your hair to rinse it out.

, Look for a deep conditioner that contains nourishing oils and is silicone-free, so your hair doesn’t end up feeling weighted down. Apply it according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Deep conditioning once a week will help your hair look shiny and smooth.

Blow out your hair.,
Use a straightening iron.,
Get regular trims.,
Get a professional deep conditioning treatment.",How to Have Smooth and Silky Hair3," Applying heat to your hair can create a soft, silky effect. Use a round brush to brush out small sections of hair, starting at the roots and slowly brushing down to the tips. Angle the hair dryer at the section of hair as you brush it out. Repeat several times until the section is dry, then move on to the next one.


Using a heat protectant product will help ensure your hair looks smooth and silky.
Don’t blow your hair out every single day, since it will eventually get dry and brittle. Save it for special occasions.

, For super smooth, silky hair, consider straightening it. First blow out your hair, then heat up a straightening iron and straighten it section by section. Make sure each section is combed out before using the iron.


Doing this too often is damaging to hair, so save it for when you want the smoothest hair possible.
You may also want to consider getting your hair professionally straightened. Look into permanent treatments offered by salons in your area.

, Trimming off the dry, coarse ends of your hair will keep your overall look lighter, smoother and softer. Get a trim every four months or so to keep your hair maintained and smooth-looking.

, Many salons offer professional conditioning treatments. The treatments are composed of special oils and other ingredients that penetrate the hair and leave it silky for days to come. A good coconut oil deep conditioning treatment has similar effects, but if you prefer professional treatment, ask about it at your local salon.

Sulfates (such as sodium laureth sulfate and sodium lauryl sulfate) are chemicals that are often included in shampoos and conditioners. However, they are very damaging to the hair. They are harsh irritants that can negatively affect not only your hair, but also your skin, scalp and eyes. Check the list of ingredients on your current shampoo and conditioner products. If sulfates are listed, replace them with sulfate-free products.Avoid products containing alcohol, which are very drying to the hair.
Avoid clarifying shampoos and conditioners. These products strip moisture from the hair and can result in limp, lackluster hair.;
, For sleek and glossy results, you'll need to start the transformation to straight hair in the shower. Look for shampoo and conditioner products that advertise as ""smoothing."" Check for ingredients like Argan oil, coconut oil and Moroccan oil. These oils will help smooth out your natural waves or frizz.After you apply the conditioner, run a wide-tooth comb through your hair to evenly distribute the product. Leave in for a few minutes before rinsing it out., Carefully squeeze out any excess water and then pat your hair with the microfiber towel, starting at the roots and working your way down to the tips. Avoid using terry cloth towels, since their tiny fibers can cause your hair to become frizzy. Instead, use an old T-shirt or a microfiber towel. Avoid rubbing or scrunching your hair as you do so.
When you use rough motions to towel dry your hair, it can cause your hair to curl up and become wavy.

, Use a wide-tooth plastic comb to get any tangles out of your wet hair. Start at the bottom and work your way up toward the roots, working in small sections. When finished detangling, apply a small amount of leave-in conditioner, avoiding the inch or two closest to the roots and focusing on the ends.


Comb through your hair a few more times to make sure the conditioner is evenly distributed.
After detangling, allow your hair to air dry until it is about 80% dry, then blow dry it until it is completely dry.
Blow drying wet hair can be incredibly damaging to the hair shaft. It can also cause your hair to become unnecessarily frizzy and unmanageable., The straightening process is damaging and can wreak havoc on your strands. If you have wavy, curly or coily hair and you’re straightening it regularly, the process is even more damaging. No matter what your hair type is, you should deep condition your hair at least once per week to minimize damage and keep it healthy.


Deep conditioners and hair masks are very similar, but a mask usually works on strengthening hair while a deep conditioner creates more “slip”, meaning that the hair strands become smoother and easier to detangle.Hair masks usually include ingredients like proteins, amino acids, natural oils and lipids, which can help to strengthen your hair.Hair masks and deep conditioners can be purchased at beauty supply stores, drug stores, or grocery stores. Masks are also a popular thing to make with ingredients you may already have at home. Simply search online for “hair masks to make at home” and thousands of results will be at your fingertips.

, Before you blow dry, apply a smoothing serum product on your hair. Use the product sparingly – it only takes a small amount, especially if you have thin hair. Start at the roots and work the serum down to the tips. Always apply the serum from roots to tip for the smoothest, shiniest results.Try to use a serum product that lists Argan or Moroccan oil in the ingredients.
Avoid serums that have alcohol listed in the ingredients, since alcohol can severely dry out your hair.

, These blow dryers will dry your hair incredibly quickly and cause very little damage to your hair cuticle. As you’re using it, the blow dryer releases negative ions, which force the cuticle of your hair to lay down flat. A flattened hair cuticle results in straight, frizz-free, shiny hair.If you have wavy, curly, very thick or frizzy hair, an ionic blow dryer is even more essential. These hair types usually take longer to dry, and since the ionic dryer shortens drying time, you will cause less hair damage., Buy one that has a combination of boar hair and nylon bristles, which will give you silky, shiny strands. These brushes are the best kind to use during the drying process. Place the paddle brush under a section of hair, then angle the blow dryer so that it's hitting the hair that's on the brush. As you move the brush down the section of hair toward the ends, move the blow dryer along with it as well so that it remains connected to the brush at all times. Do this to each part of your hair.Always point the barrel of the blow dryer downward. This will blow air in the direction of the hair cuticle, rather than blowing against it and causing damage/tangles.After your hair is dry, turn on the blow dryer’s cool setting and blow the cool air onto your hair for about one minute. This will make your strands extra shiny., Heat protectant products won't completely prevent damage caused by straightening your hair with a flat iron, but they can certainly help to limit it. Spray one of these products all over your hair before flat ironing.


Be sure to get the underside as well as the top.
To make this easier, flip your head upside down and then spray the underside.
Heat protectant sprays are often formulated for different purposes, such as flat ironing or blow drying. Select one that is made for flat ironing your hair. These can be purchased at beauty supply stores such as Ulta.

, To minimize damage, be sure you're using the right heat setting for your hair type. Fine hair should be straightened on a low setting. If you have curly or wavy hair, use a medium setting. For thick to coarse hair, use a medium-high setting.If possible, invest in a high-quality ceramic flat iron. These salon-quality tools are worth the extra money if you plan to straighten your hair often. A high-quality ceramic flat iron could last for years.
The ceramic plates on the iron will straighten your hair quicker than other types of flat irons, causing the least amount of damage., After you spritz the heat protectant on your hair, separate your hair into small sections and run the flat iron over each one. Start near the roots and slowly move toward the ends. Avoid ironing over the same section of hair more than two or three times, which causes damage. Be certain that your hair is completely dry before you start flat ironing it.


Listen for a sizzle – if you hear one, stop flat ironing your hair immediately. This means that your hair is still wet and needs to be dried more.
Use your blow dryer for a few more minutes until your hair is thoroughly dry., Use a tiny dab of serum to smooth down any fly-aways or frizz. Concentrate on the ends of your hair, since they tend to dry out the fastest. Make sure you use the product sparingly – your hair can end up looking greasy if you use too much.After applying the serum, wait a few minutes before moving on. This will give your hair time to cool down completely.

, Once your hair has cooled down, lightly mist a hairspray or finishing spray over your entire head. This will set the hairstyle. Another technique would be to spray the product onto the bristles of your flat paddle brush and then gently brush your hair with it. This can help to prevent any stickiness that the product could potentially cause.If you hear any sizzling when you spray on the product, this means your hair hasn’t cooled down sufficiently. The sizzle sound means you are causing damage to your hair.

, Your hair’s texture and length, as well as the climate where you live, will play a role in how your straight style holds up throughout the day. Think about using an anti-humidity (or anti-frizz) cream or spray if you live in a particularly humid area. Try styling cream if your hair is short and needs a little more weight to keep the curls from springing back up. The cream will lightly weigh the hair down and prevent this from occurring.


Experiment with a shine spray product, which will specifically add shine to your hair but use them sparingly. These are often silicone-based products and will need a special shampoo to remove the residue., Instead of going through this time-consuming process every day, aim to do it every other day or every three days. In between washings, touch up your limp roots and remove oil with a dry shampoo.


Use a flat iron to spot-straighten any strands that have re-curled overnight.
If you using smoothing and straightening tools and products on a regular basis, you run the risk of damaging your hair. Make sure to use deep conditioning treatments at least once per week to repair any damage."

Read the ingredients listed in the shampoo and conditioner that you purchase. Make sure alcohol is not one of the primary ingredients, since it will dry out your hair and make straightening more difficult.
Consider purchasing a straightening serum or leave-in conditioner to help with straightening your hair follicles.;
, Leave the conditioner in your hair for 15 to 45 minutes, depending on the relative moisture level of your hair beforehand. Rinse the conditioner out and towel dry your hair to remove excess moisture.








, This protects the hair follicles during the blow-drying process and adds shine to your hair. Comb the product through your hair to evenly coat it with the protective serum.








, Section your hair into manageable parts, working from back to front and not moving on until one section is sufficiently smooth. Blow dry your hair from root to tip, using a boar-bristle or solid plastic brush to brush it out along the way.

Section your hair into four quarters.,
Start drying from the roots.,
Brush a section of hair while following closely behind with the blow dryer.,
If you're not getting a smooth result, keep trying.",How to Have Straight Hair1," All brushes will give a different effect when paired with a blow dryer. Make sure you have the right tools to prevent wavy, frizzy, or out of control hair styles.


Using a vented brush allows for hair of all types to be dried from all directions while still being controlled. A vented brush will reduce drying time and excess damage, while being a valuable asset to any hair type.
A round, ceramic brush will help remove big curls and keep frizz down. This type of brush can be particularly helpful for smoothing and straightening the upper portions of your hair while giving the bottoms a soft bounce.
Paddle brushes will need the most gentle stroking to prevent hair breakage, but are great for quick-blow drys with no styling necessary. These may be a better option if you have relatively straight hair.
Opt for a brush with natural bristles. Natural bristles are thicker and smooth, allowing them to grip the hair while providing a shorter drying time.;
, Find your natural part and section each side of your hair into two parts. Keep each section of hair tied gently. The tie will prevent your hair from becoming tangled and knotted while you dry the rest of your hair.


Use pull-free hair bands or toothless-barrettes to keep your hair out of the way. Barrettes with no teeth allow for smooth removal from hair, while pull-free bands have no metal pieces to catch and tangle your hair.

, Try starting on a low heat setting before cranking up the heat. While lifting layers of your hair, quickly dry your roots. Drying your roots will allow the rest of your hair to dry fast because there will be no moisture dripping down. Keep the dryer facing away from your roots and towards the tips of your hair.


After your roots are over 50% dry, massage a penny sized amount of smoothing oil between your hands. Pull it through the ends of your hair and gently pull the oil through. The oil coats the hair shaft, helping it keep smooth and reducing overall frizziness. This works particularly well on curly hair.

, Using the brush, turn your hand outwards, away from your head, and in the downwards direction. Again, keep the blow dryer facing towards the ends of your hair and follow the brush as you move downwards. When arriving to the tips of your hair, round the brush downwards and slightly towards you. The inwards turn will keep any split ends hidden from your mane.


Blow drying towards your roots will cause unruly and uncontrollable hair. Always keep the dryer facing away from the roots.
If you're using a rounded brush, slowly roll the brush while keeping the blow dryer steady. This will help remove wave from your hair.
To add volume, flip your head upside down and continue to blow dry. The action of gravity will keep your roots pumped and give your hair extra body.
The styling effects of a blow dryer are best seen on damp hair because the moisture allows the hair to take shape and be styled effortlessly, without having the excess drying time of soaking wet hair. If your hair is freshly washed, try squeezing out some of the moisture with a soft towel. Contrastingly, if your hair is already dried, try misting with water in a spray bottle.

, Proper blow drying is a skill accumulated over time and it does have a learning curve. Hair types vary between each individual and it may take a trial and error process to figure out what works for you.


As a finishing touch, seal in your styling with the cool setting on your blow dryer. Continue styling with a cool temperature to settle any remaining frizziness.
When frizziness is unbearable, invest in a ceramic or ionic blow dryer. These high quality blow dryers encourage even heat distribution, shortened drying time, and smoothness. Your hair may need the extra attention to ensure less damage."

Foods like fish and milk that are high in protein can help improve hair texture, strengthen your hair, and even eliminate dandruff. Green vegetables like spinach and broccoli and nuts are also good options.;
, Keep pressure on the comb to help stimulate blood flow to the area. This will also assist in spreading around the natural oil from your scalp that keeps your hair from getting dry.

, You can stick just your head under the water if you’re worried about the rest of your body, but the cold water causes your hair to retain more moisture keeps your cuticle closed which in turn leads to silkier hair.

Style as normal.",How to Get a Permanent Hair Straightening1," Any make up or hair supply store will have a variety of choices when it comes to hair relaxers. You could even try your salon (or their supplier) for access to other products. But what it really comes down to is choosing between a relaxer with lye and a relaxer without lye.


Products without lye are most commonly found when it comes to home applications. The downside of this product is that it can leave your hair dull and damaged (like normal, everyday straightening).
Make sure you know what you're getting into! Once you straighten your hair with a relaxer, it will not be able to hold much of a curl. If you want to have super curly hair sometimes, this is not the way to go!;
, You'll want to protect your skin, clothes, and hands as you handle this product. Throw on an old t-shirt, disposable gloves (should come with your kit), and an old towel over your shoulders.

, Usually hair relaxer kits come with a couple different packets of creams or pastes. Follow the directions on yours. Use a wooden spatula if you have one available.


Let the product sit for a few minutes before you start using it. This helps everything combine and fuse.

, That's Vaseline, by the way. You want to protect your skin from soaking in the chemicals. Just a thin layer on all edges of your hairline will do the job.


It's important that the relaxer doesn't get anywhere other than your hair. It's not good for your skin, and definitely not good to eat or get in your eyes!

, You don't want to slather a chemical all over your head without doing a test first! What if you had a reaction? So grab a small section of hair at the bottom of your neck and do an experiment first.


Apply relaxer to the section (not including parts that have already been treated in the past). Leave it on per the instructions or until you see results. Wash off the relaxer and dry. Do you notice any breakage or damage? If all is well and good, continue. If it's not, do not use this product any further.

, It's incredibly important that you only leave the hair relaxer on for the appropriate amount of time. Whatever it says on the box is the maximum amount of time the relaxer should be soaking into your strands. Any more could do serious damage.

, Now that your experiment is over, you can start applying to your whole head. Work in small sections, starting at the root and going to the tip, applying as evenly as possible. Don't get any on your scalp!


Only work with hair that hasn't been previously treated. If you're just doing a root touch-up, just work with the roots.

, If you have a wide-toothed, plastic comb, go through your tresses, evening out the relaxer. This helps make sure every strand is getting its due on all sides, and from start to tip. Keep your eyes on the clock, though!

, When the time is up, rinse your hair well, getting rid of all the relaxer. Some relaxers takes on a color so you can easily see where it is. Then, shampoo with the shampoo from the kit, and rinse that out, too.


Take a good look when you think you're done. Did you get everywhere? If you didn't and there's still residue, it could cause damage -- so be thorough!

, Many products include a leave-in conditioner with the kit. This will help seal the hair and prevent damage from rearing its ugly head. Make sure to get all the layers of your hair! Then, towel dry.

, Tada! Straight hair -- almost too easy, huh? Now all you've gotta do is learn a whole bunch of straight-hair styles.

Start out with a quality iron.,
Comb your hair into four sections while heating up your flat iron.,
Separate one inch from your chosen section of hair and, starting from the roots, clamp your iron and pull down smoothly.",How to Have Straight Hair2," Just like with blow-drying, improper flat ironing can cause more harm than good. When picking a flat iron, choose heating plates that are smooth and won't catch or pull hair. Also consider the width of the iron. A slimmer iron allows for more precision, while a wider iron is better for a quick, all-over style. Thicker, longer hair may need a wider flat iron to cover more area over a shorter period of time. Think vice versa for shorter hair; your short hair needs a slimmer iron for more precision.


For fine, thin hair use straightening iron with lower temperatures. If your hair is fragile you must be careful of excessive burning.

, If four sections feel unmanageable, try more smaller sections. Starting with one section, brush out any knots or tangles.


When your flat-iron is completely heated up, the digital temperature reading will become stable. If your iron doesn't have a digital reading, it will often have a light that becomes solid in color when completely heated.
Be careful not to burn yourself or your surroundings with your straightening iron. With exceedingly high temperatures, fires can be a real hazard.

, Don't allow your flat iron to linger on a section too long. When using your iron, keep your hand steady and pull evenly down the length of your hair. Starting with smaller sections allows for more control and even straightening.


Use a balm or oil to control frizz. Apply a small amount to your hands and rub through your hair before, during, or after you use your flat iron. The oil weighs down hair and proteins within it will keep hair protected and strong.
If your hair isn't straight with the first iron, try brushing and ironing immediately following the first pass. The brushing motion will help keep hairs straight and organized, allowing the flat iron to be as efficient as possible.

Use a high quality straightening shampoo and conditioner.,
Opt for a dry shampoo.,
Moisturize your hair.,
Protect your hair when you use heat on it.",How to Have Straight Hair3," Straightening shampoo and conditioners contain deep-penetrating proteins to help coat, unwind and shine up your hair.Avoid products with sulfates as these foaming agents remove moisture from the hair which promotes frizziness, and in turn prevents straightness.Ask a local hair stylist for help in determining which brands are high quality.


If you can, less shampoo is more. Shampooing your hair less will allow it to soak up your natural oils. If you must shampoo daily, try using dry shampoo on alternating days.

, Dry shampoo is a powder that is massaged into the roots of the hair to remove excess oil and grease. It will keep your hair looking fresh and clean without needing to wet shampoo daily, which strips it of moisture. Dry hair is frizzy, out of control hair. When in a pinch, cornstarch can be used in place of dry shampoo.


Dry shampoo is best used the night before. A quick application before bed will allow the powder to absorb into your hair and prevent powdery-looking locks.

, Look for products with organic oils such as coconut, argan, or shea. Avoid compounds like mineral oil and petrolatum, which prevent moisture absorption in hair.Hot oil treatments can be purchased or home made. Warm the oil and massage through the hair. Let the oil absorb for 30 minutes and wash with quality shampoo and conditioner.
Make your own moisturizing hair mask. Mix half a cup of milk with half a cup of water. Warm and comb through the hair using a wide toothed comb. Allow your hair to soak up the moisture for 30 minutes then rinse and condition.
When you have naturally oily roots, apply conditioner on the ends of your hair. By skipping the roots, you stop adding additional oils to your hair.

, Hair is porous, especially when previously damaged, and will absorb heat quickly. A heat-protectant spray contains proteins that work into the hair sheath and prevent damage from the heat. A light spritz and comb from your hair roots to tips will help seal in moisture and protect your hair.

Coat your hair with gloss or hair glaze.,
Use a shine spray.,
Choose the right shampoo and conditioner.",How to Get Silky Smooth Hair2," You can buy these types of products at your local pharmacy and they will keep your hair looking shiny and beautiful. This is the type of product that many celebrities use to keep their hair looking so shimmering. The downside is that you have to use this everyday, but it isn’t too expensive.

, If you don’t have time for all the lifestyle changes before a big date or an interview, this might be the way to go. Buy a shine spray online or at a local hairdresser, but be sure not to use too much. Spray it on a brush and then comb lightly through your hair. Be careful not to overdo it or your hair might end up looking greasy rather than shiny.

, Shampoos that contain natural oils in them will do the most to help your hair look silky and smooth. Avoid shampoos containing alcohol at all costs, as this will cause your hair to become dry and break. Moisturizing shampoos can also help to keep the moisture locked in and have your hair looking the way you want it. You can find shampoo and conditioner like this at your local grocery store or pharmacy, so you won’t have to look far.

Use coconut oil in a spray bottle.,
Make an Aloe Vera hair mask.,
Use apple cider vinegar in your hair.",How to Get Silky Smooth Hair3," Once again, this is a spray that you won’t want to overdo or you hair could start looking greasy. Some think that coconut oil can help protect the proteins in your hair from the natural wear and tear it goes through day to day such as being exposed to the sun and wind. , This mask will supposedly bring new energy to your hair, causing it to grow faster and look more radiant. To make the mask, you’ll need to mix ripe avocado, one tablespoon of linen oil, a tablespoon of warm honey, a tablespoon of lime juice, three tablespoons of Aloe Vera gel, and two egg yolks. Massage this concoction into the roots of your hair and along the length of it as well. Wrap a warm towel around your hair for about half an hour, and then shampoo and condition as you normally would. It sounds funky, but some swear by it.

, You can find apple cider vinegar online or at a grocery store, and all you will need to do is mix half a cup of it with one cup of warm water and then put it in a spray bottle. Spray your hair after a shower and let it sit for ten minutes before rinsing it out. There’s a chance you’ll smell a bit like vinegar, but you will see immediate results.

Find a salon that does Brazilian straightening.,
Find out if your hair type allows this type of straightening.,
Decide how strong do you want the effect to be.,
Proceed with the straightening.,
Enjoy your freshly straightened hair!",How to Get a Permanent Hair Straightening2," They may call it a Brazilian Keratin Treatment or a Brazilian Blowout. In addition, L'Oreal has a new procedure called X-Tenso that promises straight hair for up to 6 months. However, most Brazilian straightens normally last around two to four months.With this method, the bonds in your hair aren't completely broken and your natural texture will gradually return. In other words, it's much better for your hair, but the contrast will be less stark. You can still style your hair and it may still hold a curl, unlike the results when you use harsh chemicals.

, Very thin or very damaged hair may not pass the test. You should ask the hairstylist whether you can try it or not. Hopefully, they'll be honest with you.


Some hairstylists may just see money signs when you ask. Try to ask a stylist you trust -- or a friend that knows a lot about this topic!

, You may want pin-straight hair or just naturally straight, so make sure you mention this to the hairstylist. They may have ideas for you that you haven't considered.


Do know that some treatments are said to contain formaldehyde. It's not in toxic amounts or anything, but they're there.If you're concerned, mention this to your stylist.

, Your stylist will apply the product, blow-dry your hair, and flat iron it (possibly the last time for a while!). Then, all you need to do is not wash it for the next three or four days. The process at the salon usually takes a couple of hours.


Depending on where you live, this could cost a pretty penny. It's normal for salons to charge a few hundred dollars for this procedure.

, With this treatment, you'll still have to blow dry your hair and maybe do a few touch-ups, but your daily routine will be cut down massively.


Slowly but surely your hair will return to normal. Think of it as Hermione Granger but in reverse and sped up.

Be a straight-haired goddess.",How to Get a Permanent Hair Straightening3," Thermal reconditioning (otherwise known as Japanese hair straightening) is a process that straight up breaks the bonds of hair. You'll be left with pin straight hair that will not curl. It's most effective on medium or wavy curls, not kinky hair.


Still interested? The process could set you back anywhere from $500-$1,000, depending on your salon., This is a difficult process to maneuver effectively. You do not want to undergo this with a student who's never done it before. Scope around your town for a stylist that could do it in her sleep.


If things go awry, your hair could get seriously, seriously damaged.Don't cut any corners with this one. Your hair can't afford it.

, You could be there for an entire work day (8 hours), depending on your hair type and how much hair you have. When you go in for touch-ups, that'll take 3 or 4. During this time, the stylist will saturate your strands with a chemical solution, rinse, wash, blow dry, and flat iron until the cows come home.


So bring a good book! Or even better, a friend.

, Basically, your hair needs to be left as is. Nothing that will put a kink in it or take away from the powers of the chemical. Easier said than done, huh?

, Don't bother getting a curling iron or hot rollers -- they won't work. But you will have super straight hair in all weather at all times! Like a miracle, ain't it? Roll outta bed, shower, and you're ready? The others will be green with envy.

Use hair gels.,
Treat your hair with Moroccan oil.,
Try to use a natural texturizer.,
Try out curl-enhancing shampoo.",How to Get Curly Hair (Men)1," If you want to use hair products to get your hair curly, the best way to do it is with hair gel. Regardless of how your hair is styled, using a pea-sized amount of gel and running it through clean hair can help you curl it up however you want. Take the time to make individual curls, or run your hands through it quickly for a messy look.


After rinsing your hair, squeeze a small amount of gel into your hands and run your fingers through your hair, from the forehead to the back. Let it start to set up for a minute, then take a pencil and wrap little curls of hair around the pencil. Count to 30. Keep working your hair into tiny curls until you like the look.
If you have less time, try just running your hair through your hands quickly and getting your hair to stick in a lively, curly-looking position. If you don't like that crunchy hair gel style, try using a softening gel like IC Fantasia, which can help to keep your hair extremely soft, as well as train it into curls.;
, One common way of training your hair naturally is by using a natural hair oil that will help to moisturize and keep your hair strong, making it more likely to take on natural curl and body. Once or twice a week, use a pea-sized amount of hair oil on a plastic comb and comb through your hair after rinsing to treat your hair and keep it strong.


It's also common to combine this treatment and cover your hair with a tight-fitting bald-cap or do-rag, to keep your hair kinked up and keep the oil close to the scalp overnight. When you remove the cap, your hair should be able to take on curl more easily.
Olive oil and coconut oil are also versatile food-based products that are commonly used in the hair to help keep moisturized and curly. Treating your hair with these products can help to keep them light and silky, making them more amenable to taking on curl.

, Texturizing spray is typically marketed to women, but it's perfectly fine to use for men to use in their hair to increase the natural curl. If your hair has curl in it, you'll be able to emphasize it with texturizer, and if your hair isn't, it can help to create it. These products are sprayed directly onto the hair and can be used to loosen the follicles and increase the natural curl.

, While the claims of many curl-enhancers are somewhat dubious, there are a number of products on the market that claim to curl up naturally straight hair with washing. These shampoos should be used in conjunction with other methods of curling, but it's worth trying out.


When you select a shampoo, try to pick a product made primarily of natural ingredients, avoiding the use of shampoo with parabens, aluminum, and other artificial ingredients. You want the shampoo to keep your hair moisturized, promoting its natural oils, rather than drying it out.

Brush your hair out before showering.,
Rinse your hair regularly.,
Wash your hair less.,
Let your hair air dry.",How to Get Curly Hair (Men)2," It's possible to give your hair body and lightness by brushing it out before you wet it for the shower. Whether you're going to shampoo or not, running a brush through your hair will keep your hair from matting and clumping, giving it body and lightness for afterward. Brushing alone can't give you curls, but it's a helpful first step in the process.

, If you want naturally curly hair, rinse your hair regularly to keep it clean and fresh, but don't use shampoo more than once or twice a week if you have naturally straight hair. This is because shampoo will dry out your hair and strip it of its natural oils, which help to give hair body, bounce, and curl. If you want curlier hair, rinse it, don't wash it.

, If you want to help train your hair to curl naturally, stop washing it so much. Regular rinsing helps to keep your hair lighter, keeping the dirt and build-up out of your hair, but it also allows the natural oils in your hair to keep your hair silky and light, giving it body and curl in the right conditions. Shampoo dries your hair out and weighs it down over time, making it less likely that it'll be able to curl. Washing your hair will straighten, rinsing your hair will curl.


Different people will need to wash their hair more or less, accordingly. If you have particularly greasy hair, you might need to wash it every other day at least. If you have dry hair, try washing it only once a week or less and rinse every day.

, If you want curly hair, you can't use a blow dryer or towel-dry your hair to death. The best way to get hair to curl naturally is to let it dry on its own, preferably overnight. Sleeping on your hair might make it look kinked up and messy, but it may also help to give it the kind of curl you're looking for, depending on your type of hair.


In general, if you want curlier hair, it's better to bathe at night, as opposed to in the morning. If you're in the habit of showering every morning before school or work, switch up your routine to rinse your hair at night instead.

Try a heat curler or roller curlers.,
Get the right hair cut.,
Train your hair into 360 waves.,
Consider getting a perm.",How to Get Curly Hair (Men)3," Again, commonly marketed for women, but if you have medium or long hair, using a curler is another easy and quick way to get your hair curled up. Use small-gauge curlers in your hair overnight to get tight ringlets, or try drying your hair with a hair curler after you bathe for the best effects.

, If you want curly hair, it's a good idea to get a haircut that emphasizes the kind of curl you want. For guys, that can be tricky, but you want to start out with short-medium hair to get the most bounce out of the curls you have. Talk to your stylist about appropriate haircuts if you want to make your hair look more curly than it is.


Try out a pompadour style cut do for something that'll help to give your hair a bit of body. Keep the sides short and let it grow out on top, giving yourself a mop that you can train up and out into a pompadour., Training your hair into ""waves"" can help give you the appearance of curly hair, even if it's not strictly-speaking curly. While this practice takes time and some dedication, with daily combing sessions and a bit of pomade, you can get your hair to grow in rounded waves that extend all the way around your head. It's a cool look.


Start by getting your hair cut extremely short, buzzed all the way around. After you bathe, comb your hair with pomade and start brushing it hard, from the crown of your head down toward your forehead, your ears, and the back of your head, for at least an hour each day. After doing this, wear a skull-cap or a do-rag to sleep, keeping your hair moist.
If you keep up a strict brushing routine for several weeks, your hair will start to take on a wave-like appearance as it grows out. This was popularized in the mid-2000s by rappers like Nelly. Done correctly, it can help make your hair look curly and awesome.

, Getting a permanent or a ""perm"" from a hair stylist is the easiest way to get your hair curled up. While some people don't like to pay for perms and treat their hair with ""frying"" chemicals, permanents are the surest and easiest way to instantly curl up your hair. While they're more common and popular with women, perms are commonly given to men. Don't be embarrassed to ask for a perm.

This can be done anytime in the day, but since the hair needs to be left like this for a while (overnight), and you probably won't want to go out with this style, it is best done in the evening.

,
Wash hair as usual, squeeze hair out a little and add some curl enhancing or other; product.

,
Now split the hair into sections and twist them tightly.,Clip each twist to the top of the head, perhaps winding them round the head first, if the hair is long.,

,

,
In the morning remove clips from all of the twists and if they are still damp, let them hang down and dry while you are getting ready for school/work.

,
Then finger-comb the twists out, so they separate in to loose ringlets.

",How to Enhance Curly Hair2,",, When twisted, the sections should be about 1 centimeter (0.4 in) wide/thick.

,
When they are heated, section off a piece of hair - the thicker, the more ring-like effect - and twist it as in method 2.

Be patient with the hair at the back of your head.",How to Flat Iron Short Hair," Different styles of flat iron are intended for different purposes. Hair that is is especially short and/or fine can benefit from the precision offered by a thinner plate flat iron.The thinner-sized plate will be more maneuverable, which can lead to more efficient straightening while decreasing the chances of you getting burned.;
, If you don't have an appropriate flat iron, you'll need to buy one at a local boutique or borrow one from a friend. You will also need a heat protectant product to prevent your hair from being damaged by excess heat, and brushes to help with styling and blow drying., Oils and any dirtiness that may have accumulated in your hair might cause less-than-desirable results when ironing.Use your normal shampoo to thoroughly wash your hair. Rinse your hair of the shampoo and follow it with a deep conditioner, allowing this to remain in your hair for the time recommended on the label, and then rinse once more.

,, For short hair, you might only have one or two layers, depending on your hair thickness. Layering your hair is important because it creates even sections of hair, which will be easier for you to manage while ironing. This can also prevent you from accidentally going over a section you've already ironed, which can cause heat damage.Collect the hair you are sectioning off for later atop your head and clip it out of the way while you work on lower layers.

, Inspect the flat iron for dirtiness before use. You can effectively clean your flat iron while it is unplugged and cool with a clean rag dampened with rubbing alcohol.Wipe your plates dry with a fresh cloth and your flat iron should be ready to straighten.

, There should be a few different settings available on your iron. While there is no hard-and-fast rule for temperature, as each persons' hair will respond to the heat of your flat iron differently, the following generally applies:


250–300° for fine or damaged hair.
300–350° for medium/average hair.
350–400° for thick or coarse hair., You should first consult the label of your product, as your brand of heat protectant may have special instructions. Most heat protectants should be applied to wet hair that has already been deep conditioned, so the a good time to administer this product is after washing your hair., Bangs are already divided from the hair on the crown and sides of your head and are easy to see, making this a great place for you to start. Work your way from the root to the tip of your hair.Depending on the curliness or waviness of your hair, you may have to run your hair through the iron a few times.
If your hair is long enough, consider running a comb through your hair and following it with your straightener., Take your bottom layer in segments and work these from the root of the hair to its end, slowly sliding your flat iron down each length of hair. Repeat this process a few times until you achieve the desired result.Exercise caution when ironing close to your scalp or ears. The heated ends of your flat iron will burn you if you are not careful.

, You can clip sections of straightened hair aside by using an alligator clip or hair tie. This will make it easier for you to iron each section while minimizing your chances for unnecessary over-ironing.

, You'll likely need to clip the top layers of the hair on the sides of your head out of the way, if you haven't already done so. Start with the bottom layer and in smooth motions, draw your iron steadily through segments of your bottom layer until you are satisfied.


Gather finished hair together out of the way and then release the next layer of hair from the unfinished top layer that you clipped aside earlier.
Ironing at an angle in front of a mirror can give you a better view of the hair you are working on, allowing you to be more precise when straightening.

, The hair at the top (also called the crown) of your head can be difficult to manage. By pulling your hair upwards toward the ceiling, you'll give your flat iron better access to the roots of the hair there and improve hair volume., The hair at the back of your head is difficult to see and ironing it can be awkward.Divide hair at the back of your head down the middle vertically, and then pull it to either side of your head. Now you can stand at an angle to a mirror and have a decent view of the hair you are straightening.

Put your damp hair in a bun before bed.",How to Change Wavy Frizzy Hair to Straight Hair3," Your shampoo and conditioner can’t straighten your hair automatically, but they can give you a leg up. Purchase hair products that guarantee “smoothing.” After conditioning your hair, use a paddle brush to evenly distribute the conditioner, before rinsing out your hair.When drying hair, do not rub your hair with a towel. Instead, gently pat hair to absorb the moisture.
Invest in a Deva Towel. This softer alternative to regular towels helps fight frizz.

, If you hear your hair sizzling, that means the hair is still damp and you should stop straightening immediately. If your hair is dry when you straighten it and you’re still not getting the results you want, you may be using too much product.Only apply product to damp hair, never dry hair. The iron traps the product in dry hair, causing you to boil the product inside your hair follicles.
The more heat you use on your hair, the less products you should use. Try to limit your product usage to one or two serums, applied directly to damp hair.

Determine your hair type.,
Set a budget.,
Decide on a retailer from which to purchase.,
Decide on a plate size and heat settings.",How to Buy a Flat Iron,"


Consider whether your hair is fine or thick. Fine hair requires less heat to straighten.
Thick hair is much harder to straighten because the individual hairs are coarser, causing them to have less moisture.
Those with curly or wavy hair should purchase an iron with a higher heat setting.;
,


Flat irons can range anywhere from $15 to $300, depending on heat settings, plate sizes and brand names.
The more often you plan to use your flat iron, the better quality product you should look for.

,


Research retailers and their reviews online, making sure to look through the customer reviews on product and service quality.
Consider shipping costs in the price of your flat iron if you will be buying online.

,


Irons with adjustable heat settings are more useful, because they can be used on all types of hair.
Smaller plates up to 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) wide are better if you are going to use your flat ​iron to curl your hair.
Larger plate sizes, up to 2.5 inches (6.4 cm), are better for those with thick or curly hair, because your can straighten more hair in less time and with fewer passes.

Cool your curls after setting them.,
Use hair gel.,
Use a hair spritz.,
Leave any rollers in as long as possible.The longer the better.,
Condition and moisturize your hair to prevent damage.,
Avoid hot, humid, or windy conditions.,
Don't touch your curls.,
Take care of your hair.",How to Get Curls to Stay1," Use a bobby pin to hold the curl in place, then hit them with cool air from your hair blower. The cool air causes the hair to relax while still curled, helping them stay in place after their inevitable cool-off later in the day., Hair gel is one of the more conventional ways to get curls to stay. Apply as you style. The protein based goop dries in 15-30 min, stiffening and acting as support to hold hair in the place you left it.


Be aware, though, that adding more gel isn't always better. Too much can leave hair feeling crunchy and hard and actually weigh curls down and take away their form.

, This is a staple in urban hair salons, as it accomplishes what little else can. It can be applied before styling or after. A little stronger holding than conventional hair spray, spritz is responsible for some of the more complex updos not falling flat after two hours of wear. B&B or Luster's Pink are some of the best options.


Like gel, spritz can leave hair feeling crunchy or hard if applied too liberally, and can have an unpleasant chemical smell if too heavy.

, For best results, roll hair when wet and apply heat from a dryer. The curls will mold to your rollers and once they're removed, lightly run your fingers through to loosen to desired style. For a little more curl, apply a curling creme before rolling, and a bit of hairspray or spritz afterward.

, This is especially important when you use heat to curl your hair. Whenever applying heat to hair, proper conditioning and moisturizing is a must. Applying a light oil or moisturizer before styling keeps curls shiny.


Consider heat-protectant before turning on the hair dryer.

, These will turn your curly hair frizzy in a heartbeat, so do your best to avoid the weather with a hat. If you need to head outside, some spray may help prevent damage for several hours, but it will not last forever.

, Touching introduces oils and dirt to your hair, which weighs it down and causes your curls to flatten.

, Excessive heat treatment and shampooing every single day can damage your hair and make it easier to manage. Brushing your hair when it is wet can cause hair to break, as it is weakest when wet. Keep you hair clean, drink plenty of water, and eat healthy, and your hairstyle will hold for longer no matter what your style.

Use a headband.,
Brush back your hair.,
Use a half-up style.,
Make a half-crown braid.,
Accessorize.",How to Do Hairstyles for Curly Hair1," Headbands work wonders with short, medium and long hair. The classic way to wear a headband is to pull the hair back from the face, but you can also wear a circular headband over your hair, including bangs (if you have them). Use mousse or gel to keep your curls in shape..


Experiment with different types of headbands: thin and sparkly, wide and bold, bows, flowers, colors, knitted materials, and more.
A headband can also be a perfect addition to updos, such as the curly topknot or ponytails in Method 2.;
, For a more formal look, or a hairstyle for a night out, this is a great choice. Brush back the top front sections of your hair, making sure it is not too sleek. Next, brush the sides away from the face and spritz with hairspray.To dress things up, place a cute clip to one side.


Again, mousse works great to keep your curls manageable. Alternatively, add a little hair putty to your curls to keep them separate and soft.

, This is an easy yet elegant way to bring the hair away from your face and at the same time show off its length. The simplest way to do this is to rake your hair back with your fingers from the sides of your face (and the top, if you don't want a part), then secure with a barrette, claw clip, or elastic.You can create a bun or braid with the hair you pull back.
Try twisting the sides as you bring them behind you for a fancier version.
Experiment with parting your hair in the center, or making a deep side part.

, Two braids pulled back from the sides complement your curls and keep hair back from the face. What's more, this romantic style is ready in just a couple of minutes.


Separate a 1-2 in (2.5-5 cm) section of hair from behind the left ear and make a braid, angling it around the back of your head towards your right ear. Secure with a clear elastic. (Note that if you have very long hair, you won't braid the full length of your hair – just braid enough so that it goes across the back of your head.)
Repeat with a section from behind the right ear, angling it around the back and towards your left ear. Secure this braid with a clear elastic as well.
Draw one of the braids across the back of your head towards the opposite ear and fasten it into place with bobby pins.
Draw the other braid over the first one, tucking the end into the braid underneath, securing with bobby pins., Accessories can be a girl's best friend. Beauty supply stores are great places to find sweet hair accessories for a reasonable price. Changing up barrettes, headbands, or pins can bring new life to tried-and-true hairstyles.

Consider detangling your hair with water and conditioner.,
Consider detangling your hair while it's dry.,
Try different methods for transitioning hair.",How to Detangle Curly Hair1," This method is best for dry, coarse, or tight curls. These types of hair are not well-suited to dry detangling. Dry hair will be prone to breakage, and tightly curled or coiled hair needs extra moisture to properly detangle. Water breaks down the bonds in your hair, making it weaker, more fragile, and more malleable.Condition your hair after you take out braids. If you have had your hair in braids for a while, do not comb through your hair when it’s dry. Use the wet conditioner method to detangle your hair. This will ensure that you do not yank out hair.
Brushing dry, curly hair can make it frizzy and even more knotted.;
, This method can work well if you have loose curls or thicker, heavier hair. You will use your fingers, a wide-mouthed comb, or a paddle brush to work through the tangles and smooth out your hair. Even if you plan to wet detangle your hair, try to dry detangle as much of your hair as you can to make the job easier.In general, hair is easier to detangle when it is dry. Dry hair is stronger, so it won't break when you pull it. If your hair is too stubborn, then you may need to coat your brush in lubricating oil or olive oil to ease the detangling process., If you are growing out your hair, you might need to experiment with different methods of detangling. If you have shorter hair, you might be able to use dry-detangling. If you have longer hair, you might need to condition while detangling. As your hair changes, check to see if you need to change your detangling method from dry to wet.

Start with day-old hair.,
Skip the deep conditioner.,
Pick the right products.,
Use the right tools.,
Try the post-iron pin technique.,
Braid before bed.",How to Get Curls to Stay2," Your hair’s natural oils give your hair texture and make your strands more moldable. Try to avoid washing your hair for a day or two. If your scalp feels too oily without shampoo, sprinkle a little dry shampoo along the roots and leave the rest dirty.

, Deep conditioning treatments have a tendency to weigh hair down and make it harder to style. Stick to a lightweight conditioner, and save the more intense hydrating treatments for another day.

, Many people make the mistake of piling on products after curling and using nothing before. But stiff, crunchy curls are not the goal here. Before begin curling, use a lightweight styling lotion to give your hair some texture. It’s also a good idea to use a heat-protectant product so you don't fry your strands. Once you are done curling your whole head of hair, finish by misting your curls with a light hairspray. Use just enough hairspray to make your strands stay without feeling stiff.

, Having the right tools makes all the difference. To begin, make sure you've selected an iron with the right size barrel. Also, if your hair always falls flat, consider investing in a professional-grade curling iron. Try the NuMe curling wand or the Sarah Potempa Beachwaver if you're willing to invest, or Hot Tools to get the most bang for your buck.


For hair that doesn't hold a curl well, try a ¾-inch barrel. The curls will be tight without looking ringlet-y, and will loosen as the day goes on.
If your hair holds a curl well already choose a 1-inch iron for instant beachy waves.

, Once you release your hair from the iron, simply pin the curl to your head until it sets. Once your entire head is pinned, mist it with hairspray. Then, carefully unpin your curls and comb through them with your fingers.


Cool down those curls. Take each fresh curl (still keeping the curl shape) and secure it with a clip or a bobby pin.
Try holding the curl in a coil in the palm of your hand for 10 seconds as soon as you remove it from the heat. This will keep the curl bouncy and stop it from falling out.

, If you know you're going to curl your hair the next day, sleep with it in a braid or two (depending on how thick your hair is). The next morning you will wake up with instant textured waves—the perfect canvas to take a curling iron to.

Make a curly topknot.,
Make a headband roll-up.,
Make a twist-and-pin braided updo.,
Try different ponytail styles.,
Do rope braids!",How to Do Hairstyles for Curly Hair2," This simple and practical style is perfect for work or hot days when you want your hair off your face and neck. Take advantage of your full curls to create a high, oversize bun.


Make a high ponytail. Rather than using a brush, smooth curls and align any bumps with your fingers. Secure the ponytail with a hair elastic.
Pull your ponytail through a hair donut so that the donut sits at the base of the ponytail. If you don't have a hair donut, you can use an old (clean) sock: cut the toes off and roll the sock in on itself to create a donut shape. The donut/sock pads out your bun for added fullness.
Tilting your head forward, fan your ponytail around the donut and start twisting your hair around it. Make sure you've covered the donut completely.
Tuck the ends of your ponytail into the donut and secure with a few bobby pins. Spritz with hairspray if you want a little extra hold., This pretty style is incredibly easy, yet pretty enough to wear to formal occasions.


Place circular headband over your hair so that it sits about an inch (2.5 cm) behind your hairline.
Tuck your hair into the band at the base of your head, rolling the band under a few times until the hair is secure. Add a few bobby pins to hold the style in place., If you're looking to put your curls in a fancier style, this look is elegant yet fast to create. The face is framed by a Dutch braid, created by crossing strands under each other (as opposed to the French braid, where strands go over each other). At the base of the head, your hair gathers into twists that are pinned into place.


Create a deep side part.
Grasp a 1 inch (2.5 cm) section of hair where the part begins and divide the section in three.
Begin the braid by weaving the sections under each other (rather than over, as in a French braid).
Work your way along the hairline (towards the ear farther from the part), adding small sections from your hairline to the braid as you go. Continue until you reach your ear.
When you reach your ear, finish the braid without adding any more hair to it. Secure with an elastic (a clear one is preferable).
Twist the braid into a bun behind your ear and secure with pins.
Finally, twist sections of the remaining hair into knots around the braid bun, using pins to secure them. The sections should be about 1 inch (2.5 cm) so that the resulting knots are all roughly the same size as the braid bun., Ponytails are a perfect fix when you need to get your hair off your face. That said, you might get tired of wearing the same style day in, day out. Try variations on the theme:


Make a roll ponytail. With rolled-in sides, this is a graceful take on the classic.
Create a french ponytail, a cascade of half-ponytails joined together.
You can also try putting the whole ponytail into ringlets. Pull the hair back when still wet, divide the ponytail into 1 inch (2.5 cm) sections, and twist them around your finger. Add a small dollop of gel to shape and hold the ringlets. Let it dry naturally or use a hair dryer with a diffuser attachment., These are great for curly hair because they only require twisting, and the hair doesn't develop bumps or need to be separated as with a normal braid. Pigtails, a single braid, or a half-up style looks great.

, Before you begin, make sure that you will be able to see the front and back of your hair by placing one mirror in front of you and another behind you. The mirrors should be facing each other. Adjust the mirrors until you can see the front and the back of your head in the mirror in front of you. If you have long hair, this step is optional since you should be able to bring each strand forward as you trim your curls., Using a pair of sharp haircutting scissors, trim the ends of each of your curls. Make sure the scissors you use are meant for cutting hair and that they are very sharp.Cut the hair near the ends or in the curve of the curl. Begin by trimming the topmost layers and work your way down through your curls, layer by layer.

, After you finish trimming the ends of one layer, use a hair clip to separate the trimmed hair from the hair that you have not yet cut. Keeping the trimmed hair separate will help prevent you from cutting the same curls twice. Continue trimming the ends of your curls until you have trimmed them all. This may take a while, especially if you have thick hair. Just be patient and don’t rush!, When you are finished, run your fingers through your curls and shake them out.

, Inspect your hair from all angles and make sure it looks how you want it to look. Use the scissors to touch up any spots that don’t look right. Look for any strands that are drastically longer than others or that are angled differently and trim as needed. "

Work the knot from the end to the root.,
Pin each detangled section into a loose twist.,
Continue detangling the rest of your hair.",How to Detangle Curly Hair2," When dry-detangling your hair, you can use your fingers, a wide-tooth comb, or a paddle brush.


Using fingers can make it easier to find and work through smaller knots.
Combing or brushing hair can result in some breakage. Your hair is not very flexible when it is dry, so take care when detangling it this way.
A paddle brush is better for long, loose curls. It probably won’t work on tightly curled hair.

, Pin your hair into four sections so that you can tackle each section separately. If your hair is especially thick, it might help to separate your hair into more than four sections., Put a bit of lubricating oil, such as coconut oil, on your fingers. This will reduce any friction that your fingers may experience as they run through your hair.


Consider using argan oil to lightly spritz your hair. This will make it easier to comb through your hair with a comb or paddle brush. You can find argan oil at your local beauty supply store.
Consider wearing latex gloves to make your hands slip through your hair. You may also consider wearing gloves if you don't want to get the skin of your hands oily.

, As you start to comb through your hair, find where the thick and thin masses of tangles are. Separate out one tangle at a time. Pull the knotted area away from the rest of your hair if possible. If you can see it in the mirror, try taking a quick look to get a read on the situation.

, Run your fingers through your hair, working each knotted area one at a time. Start at the end of the chunk of hair. Work your fingers through the bottom of the knot. As your fingers undo some of the knot, work your fingers through more of the knot until you get to the root.

, As you finish detangling a section of hair, loosely twist it and pin it up. This will break up your work and prevent your detangled sections from re-tangling.

, Work through the rest of your hair, section by section. Pin up detangled sections as you go until all of your hair is detangled.

Style your tangle-free curly hair.",How to Detangle Curly Hair3," Many people have hair that cannot be fully detangled when it’s dry. However, you may be able to make the job easier if you detangle as much as possible before you cover your hair in conditioner.

, Detangle your hair in the shower, or simply rinse your hair down. This makes it easier to detangle, as the hair will be smoother.


Consider towel-drying your hair before conditioning. This may ensure that your hair isn't too wet for the product to take hold, but is moist enough to avoid further tangling.

, Apply the conditioner onto the wide-toothed comb while standing under a low pressure shower. Smooth the conditioner into your hair, from bangs to back and tips to roots, and slowly take out the knots and tangles. Make sure that your hair is fully and thoroughly slathered with conditioner. If the hair is too thick, use your fingers. Do not pull the hair, as that may lead to hairfall.


Make sure to spread the conditioner inside the tangle. Poke your fingers through the tangle; put product on the ""inside"" of your hair and not just on top.

,, Using gentle detangling motions, start at the bottom of the hair and work your way up. When you come to a big knot, use your fingers to tease it apart. Do not rip through tangles with a brush or comb. Comb gently, with small quick movements.


As you comb, immobilize your hair with one hand so that you don't feel it pull at the roots.
You may get a knot or pluck some hair out, but don't worry too much. You are not damaging your hair, you are just removing hair gone wrong. The conditioner will protect against damage, and your hair will be smooth and tangle-free when it dries.

,, Once the wide-toothed comb can slide easily through all of your hair, rinse out the conditioner and pat your hair dry. Use a microfiber towel or old tee shirt — traditional terrycloth towels can cause frizz.

, Put in your styling product of choice (whether it is mousse, gel, or a styling cream) and let your hair dry. You can also dry it with a hair dryer (with a diffuser) on a low heat and intensity setting. Try to avoid touching your hair before it is completely dry, which may create frizz.

",How to Detangle Curly Hair4," To help prevent tangles in curly hair, condition your hair every day with the help of a wide-toothed comb. Overall, the ultimate key to fewer tangles is keeping your hair nourished, moisturized, and protected from environmental factors such as the sun and pollutants.

, This will also help control frizz. Avoid washing your hair every day, no matter your hair type, as this can dry out your scalp and your hair. Shampoo your hair a few times a week, at most.

, Try to shower in the morning. Hair is more malleable when it is wet, so it might get rubbed the wrong way while you toss and turn in the night. It may be very hard to tame your tangled hair in the morning if you showered the night before. If you must shower at night, give yourself a few hours before bed so that your hair has time to dry out.

, Keep your hair in healthy shape by getting regular trims. Cut a small amount from the tips of your hairs to remove any split ends from your hair. Your hair will have fewer tangles if you don’t have split ends.

, Consider braiding your hair or tying it up loosely before bed. Securing your hair on top of your head will reduce friction and tangling overnight. Your hair won’t be able to move about so freely, and you will be less likely to roll over it and tangle it.

, Satin is a slippery fabric, so your hair will slide more easily over the surface and tangle less than with a cotton pillowcase. This will help keep your hair from tangling up in friction when you sleep., Consider simply trying a new, shorter hairstyle, especially when it is warm. You might even look younger. Maintain your hairdo by keeping it simple and easy, washing it only according to what your hair type needs. For instance, if you have dry and thin hair, only wash your hair twice a week, and make sure that you use a quality shampoo and conditioner. In the winter, when the weather is cooler, you can grow out longer hair to cover the nape of your neck.

, After you finish trimming the ends of one layer, use a hair clip to separate the trimmed hair from the hair that you have not yet cut. Keeping the trimmed hair separate will help prevent you from cutting the same curls twice.Continue trimming the ends of your curls until you have trimmed them all. This may take a while, especially if you have thick hair. Just be patient and don’t rush!

, When you are finished, run your fingers through your curls and shake them out.

, Inspect your hair from all angles and make sure it looks how you want it to look. Use the scissors to touch up any spots that don’t look right. Look for any strands that are drastically longer than others or that are angled differently and trim as needed. "

, Make sure to do so when your hair has a good amount of conditioner in it. For a little added moisture try adding honey to your conditioner, but be sure to rinse most of it out.

, This adds shine and prevents frizz. For a little extra root volume try rinsing upside down.

, At this point, make sure your hair has no tangles left. If it does gently untangle with your fingers and then give your hair another rinse in the sink, making sure to reapply your conditioner. While you can skip a leave in, it's best to use one so your hair stays moisturized, and frizz free throughout the day.

, Make sure this is well distributed on the whole hair. Products like these are key for preventing frizz in high humidity.

, Smooth the product on with your hands, making sure to evenly coat every section. Experiment with products and amounts of products until you get the right combination for your hair.

, Here are two methods, so see which one works best for you.


Scrunching: Cup your hair in your hands and scrunch in an upwards motion. The more you scrunch, the curlier your hair will be.
Twirling: Twist a section around your finger, making sure to go with the natural curl of the section. This method will produce perfect ringlets, and a detailed explanation is included in the video below.

, Generic towels are made of terry cloth, and the little loops that make up the cloth tend to catch on curly hair and cause frizz. Once you have removed as much water as possible, you might want to plop while you apply makeup or put on your clothes.

, Air-drying leads to the least amount of frizz, but if you don't have the time make sure to blow dry with a diffuser attachment.

, Once dry, scrunch out any crunch from your products, and enjoy your frizz free spirals!

Space out time between root touch-ups if you color your hair.",How to Care for Your Curly Hair," Curly hair is dryer than regular hair, and because of this it's more prone to damage. It's a good idea to baby your hair slightly during the shampooing process if you have curly hair. Purchase shampoos made for damaged hair, which include milder ingredients that are less taxing on hair.You can probably get by using a drugstore or department store brand of shampoo. The ingredients used in salon style products in comparison to generic varieties are fairly similar.
If you can't find a shampoo for dry or damaged hair, some stores sell shampoos for curly hair specifically. The formula in these shampoos are similar to the formula in most products sold for damaged hair.;
, If you have curly hair, you should not shampoo every day. Shampooing can dry out hair and cause it to look frizzier.Shampoo your hair no more than twice a week.
When you do shampoo, you can expect some tangles afterwords. Curly hair is very prone to tangles. Brush it gently to avoid damaging your hair.

, Co-washing simply means conditioning your hair in the shower but not adding shampoo. This can be particularly beneficial to curly hair, as it needs moisture replenished more often than regular hair.Read product labels before choosing a conditioner. Products that contain silicone-based ingredients, which are ingredients that end in ""-one"", should be avoided. Such products will be very harsh on your hair.
After conditioning your hair, see how it feels. If you hair feels spongy or mushy, you may be over-doing it. You usually only need a quarter-sized drop of conditioner.If you have dermatitis, co-washing may make your condition worse. Talk to a dermatologist before you begin co-washing.

, Deep conditioning treatments are important to replenish moisture in curly hair that has dried out. If your hair starts to feel frizzy and dry, do a deep conditioning treatment and see if it helps.Apply a conditioner to your hair before getting into the shower. Place a shower cap over your head, covering your hair completely. Shower with the cap in place. The heat and steam from the shower helps lock in the conditioner's moisture.
When you're done, rinse out the conditioner and brush as usual.

, Curly hair may not take well to being dried with a towel. A towel can irritate your hair, causing frizz. Instead, use a light t-shirt to gently dab your hair dry.Ideally, you should go for a t-shirt made out of a lighter material.

, Place a diffuser over your hair dryer before blow drying your hair. This lessens your hair's exposure to heat, and allows you to style your hair as you blow dry.You should always apply a heat protectant before blow drying your hair.
Flip your hair over your head. Start diffusing at the roots, and stop at the midway point between your hair and your roots. This should give your hair some volume for the day.
Use a lower setting on your blow dryer. Limit blow drying to twice a week to avoid drying out your hair. Curly hair should normally dry naturally.

, Something like a paddle brush is not appropriate for curly hair. Regular brushing can cause split ends and frizz. If you have tangles, get them out with a wide-tooth comb and your fingers.Never start brushing at your roots. This can cause strands of hair to break. Start the detangling process at the end of your hair and work your way up.
The wide-tooth comb should be able to comb out some tangles. You may have to use your fingers at the same time as the comb to work out more difficult tangles.

, As curly hair is prone to being drier than average hair, you should never flat iron at a high heat. Excessive use of heat treatments like a flat iron can cause your curls to grow limp.Never set a flat iron higher than 400 degrees. If your flat iron only comes with a high and low setting, use the low setting.
Do not flat iron too often. If your curls seem to be becoming limp, or your hair becomes very frizzy, you may want to avoid heat treatments for a bit.

, Product can help style curly hair, and it can also keep it from becoming too dry. Stop by a local salon or department store and stock up on products that meet your needs.If your hair is becoming coarse, go for a silicone serum. Apply the serum to hair before brushing or styling it. If your hair is getting thin and fair, a silicone spray can work. Spritz only a small amount of your hair, as a little goes a long way.
To keep your style intact, you have a few options. If you do not want your hair to look too stiff, go for styling lotions and gels labeled ""lightweight."" If your hair tends to be somewhat uncontrollable, you may need a stronger product. Sculpting-gels and extra strong creams can help.

, Anti-frizz serum can help your hair look smoother, and may help eliminate frizz after showering or blow drying your hair. However, a little bit goes a long way. You only need a dime-sized portion of frizz serum for it to be effective. Make sure to smooth the serum evenly throughout your hair., If you have curly hair, there is no strict number of days or weeks recommended between haircuts. You simply need to keep an eye on your hair. When it starts to flatten out at the crown, you should go in for a haircut.Do not style your hair before going to a salon. You want your stylist to cut your hair based on its natural curls.

, You want to know exactly how your hair will look after a cut. Curly hair looks a lot different when it's wet than when it's dry, so ask your stylist for a dry cut. This will assure that you know your hairstyle before leaving the salon., The good thing about curly hair is that it tends to retain color more. You will not need root touch-ups as often as people with straight hair.For roots, you only need touch-ups every 6 to 10 weeks.
For highlights, you will need a touch-up every 10 to 14 weeks.

Divide the hair into at least four sections.,
Comb out your hair.,
Wet your hair if combing causes pain.,
Clean out hair products.",How to Comb Curly Hair1," The bigger the gap, the better it teases out the curls. Choose a comb with sturdy teeth, that won't break against your hair.;
, If you struggle to get a comb through, use one of these treatments before you begin combing:


If your hair feels extra greasy, apply dry shampoo, followed by dry conditioner.
If your hair isn't greasy, but still hard to brush, use detangling spray, coconut oil, or olive oil.

, Divide your hair into front right, back right, front left, and back left sections, and clip them apart. Divide each of these sections in half again if your hair is extra thick.

, Comb each section with downward motions. Start near the end of your hair, teasing out knots before moving to a slightly higher position.


Be careful not to snag knots too hard or you'll rip the hair from the root. If your comb gets stuck, work the hair off it with your fingers and try again.

, Wet hair is sometimes easier and less painful to comb, but is also more likely to break or split. If your scalp is sensitive, wet your hair and try again. For better results, try the following:


Wet hair and apply conditioner.
Leave in for one hour.
Rinse out conditioner.
Pat dry with a microfiber towel or cotton T-shirt, then comb. Do not use a towel, as the friction from towels adds frizz to your hair.

, If you treated your hair with oil, get rid of it with an application of dry shampoo.

If your hair is dry, coarse, or very curly, do not use shampoo!,
Never brush with a hairbrush!,
Once you have finished combing your hair, you will need to style it.,
Let your hair air-dry.",How to Condition and Brush Your Curly Hair," Yes it sounds weird and unsanitary. But shampoo's purpose is to clean off all oil, which is exactly what curly hair needs to be, well, curly. Curly hair is dryer than straight hair; you need to moisturize it! Use conditioner specifically for curly hair, and use it the way you would a shampoo. You know, scrub your scalp with it. Shampoo once a week, or if you're extremely active, every couple of showers. You don't want to have a grungy scalp; you just don't want to have dry coarse hair either.;
, Curly hair can be matted when wet, and even though a brush gets through the rats faster, it causes split ends, and yanks out your hair. If you want, finger comb it. If that's impossible, get a comb specifically for curly/thick hair. The teeth of the comb are proportioned to get through curly hair.

, The best things to have are 1) leave in conditioner (spray in or gel) and 2) a mousse that eliminates frizz. If you don't want to buy a leave in conditioner, here's an idea. You can use the conditioner you used to wash your hair! Just plop some in your palms, rub it together, and massage it into hair. The best way to do this is start in the middle of your hair (like you're making a ponytail) and massage downwards. Your roots don't need to be moisturized. They already have oil.

, Blow dryers cause frizz and that just doesn't work for most! Who needs anymore frizz? No one. Instead, put on your lovely hair products, flip your hair, and massage the roots to get some volume on top. (To avoid having pyramid hair) As your hair is drying, occasionally flip, massage, and BAM! You should be okay. If absolutely necessary, blow dry your hair with cold air. It will minimize some frizzing. But curly hair takes forever to dry, so beware.


If you don't want to have to get up early to shower and redo your hair, that's totally understandable. But it's annoying to wake up and realize your hair looks like a hornet nest. The best way to keep your hair tamed? The night before, after you've showered and your hair is dry, pull your hair back. Ponytails work well, and even stretchy fabric headbands work. Don't just make a ponytail; put a ponytail at the base of your neck, in the middle of your hair, and almost on the ends. When you wake up, take it out, flip your hair, massage your scalp, and you should be good to go.

Start with a detangling product.,
Avoid brushing your hair.,
Work with your curls.",How to Braid Curly Hair1," Before you braid curly hair, you want to make sure that it’s as manageable as possible. That’s why you should apply a detangling product first to ensure that your curls aren’t knotted or coiled together when you try to braid. Apply the product to your hair and gently work it through with your fingers to carefully get rid of any tangles.Many detangling sprays can be used on wet or dry hair.
If you’re detangling wet hair, you can use a leave-in conditioner or smoothing serum.
For dry hair, a small amount of hair oil can work as a detangler.;
, While it’s important for your hair to be free of tangles before braiding, you shouldn’t use a brush to smooth your hair. Brushing curly hair can often leave it frizzy, which makes braiding much more difficult. Use your fingers to work through your hair if it’s tangled or knotted.If your hair is too tangled for your fingers to get the job done, opt for a wide-tooth comb, which is less likely to create frizz than a brush.

, When it comes to actually braiding your hair, it’s important to work with your curls, not against them. As you’re gathering sections of hair to work into the braid, take whole curls. Don’t try to separate pieces to create sections that are the precise size that you prefer or you may wind up creating frizz.Working with your curls while braiding may sometimes mean that the sections you pull into it aren’t even. Don’t worry -- the curls will add a pretty textured detail to your braid that straight hair doesn’t have.

Wet it with cool/warm water allowing the water to run through the curls for a minute or so until it is completely wet.,
Apply a palm full of conditioner starting with the ends and working your way to the scalp and scrunch it in but don't rub it in.

,
If you're showering, cover your hair with shower cap for 3 to 5 minutes and go on with your shower.,
With conditioner still in it, extremely carefully, (wet hair is very vulnerable), comb it through starting with the Tips and moving up to the scalp.,
Massage the scalp, this loosens potential dandruff and oil to be rinsed away and promotes good hair growth.

,
Rinse with cool water, it's important not to expose it to even medium hot water.,
Gently towel dry until it is still wet, but no longer sopping.

,
Apply a small amount of serum (only a few drops, more or less depending on length and thickness of hair) starting with the ends and working your way to the top as you scrunch it, but not the scalp.,
Set a part in your hair with your fingers dividing it slightly to one side.,
All over the head, twist out individual curls, in their natural direction.,
Allow hair to air dry naturally (A hairdryer with a diffuser set to low is okay), this may take some time depending on the length.

,, Try not to get soap in it or expose it to hot water.

, You may use a wide toothed comb for this step.

,, If you do so it will frizz.

,, The type of serum isn't important.

, This is more attractive than parting it straight in the middle.

, Begin at the back of the head and work your way to the top and front. This loosens tight curls significantly into something more sculpted and elegant. If tighter, more random curls are desired you may shake out your head first, and twist a select few curls.

Choose a brush or comb.,
Section hair into four quarters.,
Start with the lower sections.,
Brush in downward motions, starting at the end.,
Wet hair as a last resort.",How to Comb Curly Hair2," For very tangled hair, use a wide-toothed comb. For regular upkeep of wavy hair or soft curls, use a paddle brush. Paddle brushes are flat, usually square, and usually have more bristles. This provides a larger surface area to run your hair through as you try to untangle it. The bristle material also makes a difference:


Boar bristles are a strong, natural material good for taming thick hair.
Nylon bristles are softer and slide more easily, good for fine or fragile hair.
More cushioning on the brush gives more flexibility but less pull. Some flexibility is good to avoid tugging, but keep the cushioning low if you have thick hair.

, Separate your hair into two halves, from front to back. Separate each of these in half again, on your left and right sides. Use clips to secure the sections you aren't currently brushing.


If you have extra thick hair, separate into additional sections.

, Starting at the base of the head is an easy way to do it. After you have worked through a section, just leave it down and go to the one above, without the lower one getting in the way.

, Brush each section of hair starting with the ends. Tease out each knot or tangle with repeated downward motions. Once finished, brush downward from a slightly higher position.

, When your hair is wet, it is at its weakest. The cuticles (outer hair walls) are expanded, soft, and full of water. However, combing wet hair is less painful on the scalp, and may make it easier to untangle. Brush very gently, to avoid breaking the hair.


When combing wet hair, a wide-toothed comb is safer than a brush. Progress to more and more narrow combs to get rid of smaller tangles.

Gather your hair at the nape of the neck.,
Create three sections and braid.,
Secure the braid and pull some pieces loose.",How to Braid Curly Hair2," For a casual look, allow your hair to fall naturally over your shoulders. Comb through it with your fingers to smooth it if necessary, and then gather it together at the nape of your neck.If your hair is extremely thick and unruly, you may want to use a hair elastic to secure it at the nape of your neck so it’s easier to braid.

, When you’ve gathered your hair at the nape of the neck, divide it into three sections that are roughly the same size. Braid your hair by taking one of the outer sections and crossing it over the middle section. Cross the other outer section over the middle, and repeat the process until all of your hair is braided.If your hair is extremely thick, you can also create a braid with just two sections. Cross the sections over one another until you reach the ends of your hair.

, Once you’ve braided your hair, use a hair elastic or clip to secure the end of it. Pull some pieces of hair out of the braid to give it a more relaxed, casual look. It’s especially pretty to pull some curls loose around your face.If you prefer, you can gather your hair over to one side and create a side braid instead of a traditional style at the nape of the neck.

"
"
Gather some hair at the crown and start to braid.,
Pull more hair from each side of the head before repeating the pattern.,
Continue the braiding process to the end.",How to Braid Curly Hair3," At the top of your head, gather a chunk of your hair. Divide the hair into three sections, and begin to braid by crossing the right section over the middle and then crossing the left section over the middle.Be sure to only cross each outer section over hair over the center once for the first step.
Pull the hair tightly as you’re braiding to ensure that the braid won’t come undone as you’re working. Curly hair is more likely to come loose if you don’t create a tight braid.

, Before you repeat the braiding motion of crossing the outer sections over the center, take a little more hair on each side to incorporate it into the braid. For example, when you’re crossing the right section over the center, gather a little more hair from the right side into the outer section before crossing it over.French braiding your own hair can be difficult because you can’t see the back of your head. To make it easier, hold the right section in your right hand, the left section in your left hand, and the middle section between the thumb and forefinger or middle finger of either hand. That will keep the sections separate., Repeat the braiding process, taking more hair from each side as you work and incorporating it into the braid. As your reach the end of your hair, you’ll finish with a regular braid by just crossing the the outer sections over the center section without adding in any other hair. Secure the end of the braid with a hair elastic or clip.You may want to apply a little flexible hold hairspray to your curly French braid to ensure that your curls don’t come loose and get frizzy.

Fluff up your curls.",How to Style Curly Hair for Volume," This step is optional, since it may make your hair tangle, but if it doesn't, washing your hair will add a lot of volume to it.;
, Make sure to have detangled in the shower, and then rinsed your hair. Do not comb your hair after this point.

, This will give your hair the moisture it needs, and it will frizz less once dry. When the hair frizzes, it is moving outwards in search of moisture, but it will lie flat when well moisturized. Continue applying leave-in conditioner until your hair feels like seaweed.

, The curlier your hair, the more volume it will have. Hair products with magnesium sulfate in them, mimic the properties of sea salt. If you've ever noticed that your hair is much curlier after swimming in the ocean, then this is the sort of effect a curl activator will have on your hair. If you don't have a curl activating product, you can mix some Epsom salt, oil, and water in a spray bottle for a similar effect.

, In general, you want to keep your hair products lighter, to avoid weighing down your hair and decreasing volume. But you do want some definition, so make sure to apply a gel or mousse. Use a scrunching motion when applying your products, and try flipping your head upside down to add more volume.








, Scrunch more than you usually would to create more curls.








, The more you scrunch your hair, the curlier it will be.








, Plopping works well for medium to long length hair. It adds volume and curl because the hair is squished against the head; picture an accordion being stretched back and forth. It also remove more moisture from the hair.








, If you tend to get flat roots, but big hair everywhere else, use duckbill clips to give your roots a lift. You may want to do this before you plop.

, This will add more curl and volume, but be careful to always use a diffuser. Also, blow dry the curls with diffuser pressed up against your head, not with the diffuser held far away. Blow dry your hair until it is 70-80 percent dry, but not all the way, because that will cause frizz. If you have a few frizzies after blow drying, calm them down with a light product.








, Don't touch your hair while it's wet or it will frizz.

, Bend over at the waist and insert your hands into your hair close to your roots. Then, fluff! Also stand back up and pull apart curls, and fluff up the sides. Voila! Enjoy your voluminous, bouncy curls.

Apply conditioner in the shower.,
Rinse out the conditioner with cool water.,
Gently squeeze excess water from your hair.,
Smooth leave-in conditioner into your hair.,
Get your diffuser ready.",How to Blow Dry Curly Hair with a Diffuser1," This will keep your hair moisturized and help your curls stay together instead of frizzing. After you rinse out your shampoo, apply it about an inch from your roots (since your scalp's natural oils will keep your roots area conditioned) and use your fingers to comb it through to the tips.Some people with curly hair opt to wash with conditioner only, since shampoo tends to dry out curly hair. Find the routine that feels right for your hair's texture. If your hair has been dry and brittle conditioner washing might be worth a try.;
, Rinsing with cool water (as cool as you can handle) is better for curly hair. It causes the hair shaft to lie flat, rather than frizzing up, resulting in sleeker curls. Taking this step will help hold your curls together when you diffuse them after showering.

, Flip your hair upside down and use your hands to squeeze out the water rather than twisting or wringing it out. Again, this will help your curls stay pretty and bouncy. When you towel dry your hair, the curls separate and frizz up.








, This is optional, but it's a great help if your hair tends to get very dry and frizzy. Rub some leave-in conditioner between your palms and gently work it through your hair, section by section, until all of your curls are covered.








, Most hair dryers come with a diffuser attachment. It looks like a wide, circular nozzle with several prongs sticking out. Attach it to your hair dryer and set the dryer to a cool or warm setting.








Using a cool or warm setting, rather than a hot setting, is much better for curly hair. A hot setting will cause your hair to dry out and get brittle.

Start with wet hair.,

Apply heat protectant.,
Blow dry your hair.,
Section out your hair.,
Begin curling your hair.,
Alternate the direction of your curls.,
Bring your hair to one side.,
Bobby pin your hair in place.,
Cover the bobby pins with hair.,
Secure the style with hair spray.",How to Create Side Swept Curls," The easiest way to ensure your hair stays to one side is to blow dry it that way! If you’re working with leftover curls, you certainly don’t need to wash your hair all over again. However, this step is definitely helpful if your hair was straightened or if the part isn’t on the side. Wet hair will let you start with a brand new canvas, and you can mold it into a side swept style right off the bat., For this side swept style, a deep part works best. Part it on the opposite side that your hair will be going on. In other words, part it on the left side if your hair will go over your right shoulder, and vice versa. This way, the majority of your hair will already be flowing in the right direction. The less you have to worry about keeping pulled to the side, the better.








To get a perfectly straight part, use the pointed sign of a rattail comb. Trace the part from front to back, pulling your hair to either side.

, Any time you work with hot tools, it’s important to apply a heat protectant. Blow dryers and curling tools are damaging to hair, and a good heat protectant will keep your hair from becoming broken and fried. There are sprays, creams, and serums on the market, so you have many options to find one that works for your hair.You can find heat protectants at your local beauty supply store, as well as pharmacies.









Heat protectants can also add shine and prevent frizz, so pick a product that addresses any other hair issues you may have.

, After you’ve parted your hair and applied your heat protectant, it’s time to get blow drying. The important thing to remember while you’re doing this is simply to keep brushing it in the direction you want it to go. Using a round brush or a paddle brush, continue sweeping your hair to one side.








Don’t worry about making this a perfect blowout. Focus on pulling the hair the proper direction.

, Once your hair is dry, the fun part begins. As your curling wand warms up, section out your hair. Clip up the top and middle sections of your hair, leaving only the bottom section of your hair down. By curling one section at a time, you can ensure that you don’t miss any pieces.







, The easiest way to do this is with a curling wand, because you can have total control of the curls you create. If you want loose curls, you can wrap your hair loosely around the wand, and you can create tighter curls by doing the opposite. Pick up one-inch sections of hair and wrap the hair down the barrel of the wand.








Hold the hair in place around the wand for three to five seconds. The longer you hold your hair, the tighter the curls will be.

, As you continue curling pieces and working through the sections, alternate the direction that you curl your hair. In other words, wrap some pieces going towards your face and other pieces away from your face. This will help create extra volume by making sure that multiple curls don’t blend into one big curl.









Curl the strands of hair near your face going away from your face. This will keep your look sleek and tamed.

, Once your entire head of hair has been curled, pull your hair to the direction you desire. Use your fingers to comb it to one side, going over the shoulder opposite of your part. Double check that all strands are curled and you’re happy with the result.








, Once all of your hair is pulled to one side, use one hand to hold it taut. Carefully insert a bobby pin at the nape of your neck going upwards, holding the pulled hair to one side. Insert another bobby pin directly above the first, again going straight up. Add as many bobby pins as you need in order to hold all of your hair in place, going to the side. They should form a vertical line going halfway up the back of your head.








Choose bobby pins that are the same color as your hair. You will be concealing them with hair afterwards, but this will help minimize any pin showing through your hair.

, Grab a section of hair from the top of your head above the bobby pins. Use your fingers or a brush to gently comb the hair and smooth it out. Bring this section down so that it conceals the line of bobby pins you just created. Carefully tuck the end of this section of hair at the nape of your neck, securing it in place with one more bobby pin. This time, insert the bobby pin underneath your hair, so that it is hidden under the rest of your hair.








If you’re having trouble visualizing this step, think of it this way. The first bobby pins will help sweep your hair to one side and hold it there. Then, hair from the top of your head will go straight down, hiding these bobby pins. This hair will be secured by tucking it underneath the side swept hair with one more concealed bobby pin.

, After you’ve added all of your bobby pins, move your head around a bit. Double check that everything feels secure. Use a handheld mirror to look at the back of your head and double check that your bobby pins are mostly hidden. Finally, spray your hair with hairspray. This will help hold your bobby pins in place and also prevent any flyaways or stray hairs.

Lay a handful of curls in the bowl of the diffuser.,
Lift the diffuser until it touches your head to dry your roots.,
Move on to the next section of hair.,
Continue until your hair is dry.",How to Blow Dry Curly Hair with a Diffuser2," Most curly-haired people know that volume at the roots is important, since curls are heavy and tend to flatten at the top of the head. To avoid this, start by flipping your head upside down. Your hair will dry in an upside-down position, and once you're finished your roots will have much better volume.


If keeping your head upside down gets uncomfortable, you can lean your head to one side or another instead. The important thing is not to sit upright, since gravity will cause your roots to flatten as your hair dries.
Another option some people like to use is lifting the roots with hair clips. Use claw clips to lift the roots from your head, and dry your hair with the clips in place. That way you won't have to hold your head upside down to get volume.

, Remember to use a low or medium heat setting. Hold the dryer so that the bowl-shaped diffuser is pointing to the ceiling.








, Take a small handful of hair, keeping the curls intact, and coil it in the bowl of the diffuser. Just drop the hair into the diffuser; don't push it down or bunch it up. Handle your hair gently at all times.








, You should feel the prongs separating the hair at your scalp in order to access your roots. Hold the diffuser there for several seconds to allow your roots to get dry. You can move it in a circular motion to lift the roots make sure all the hair in the section gets dry. When the roots feel dry, lower the diffuser and let your hair drop out of the bowl.








Don't hold the diffuser in place for too long. You just want your hair to get about eighty percent dry. If you dry it too much it will frizz up.
Try not to over-dry the tips. If you can leave the tips of your hair hanging off the side of the diffuser, they'll quickly air-dry and you won't risk getting over dried ends.

, Take another handful from next to the first section and repeat the process. Coil your hair in the diffuser, then bring it up to your head to dry your roots. When your hair is eighty percent dry, lower the diffuser and let your hair loose.








, Section by section, dry your roots and curls with the diffuser. Since you'll need to have your head upside down, you might want to take a few breaks.

Apply hair serum or gel.,
Try not to handle your hair too much during the day.,
Use light-hold hairspray if needed.",How to Blow Dry Curly Hair with a Diffuser3," This will define your curls and keep them from getting frizzy. Apply the product section by section, taking care not to pull your curls apart. There's no need to use a brush or comb; just use your fingers.








, Curls tend to puff up when they're over handled. Now that your hair is dry, just let it be for the rest of the day. Try not to crush your curls with restrictive styles, hats and other accessories that might cause them to get too fluffy.

, Avoid using firm or maximum hold spray, since it tends to make curls look rigid and helmet-like. Use a light hold spray that allows your curls to move and bounce easily.

Maintain your curls.",How to Blow Dry Curly Hair," You will need to wash your hair before drying it, but do not wash your hair every day if possible. When you do wash it, do not use shampoo every time. Look for shampoo that does not have alcohol or sulfates. Do not aggressively rub the shampoo into your hair. Instead, let the water run through it, and gently massage your scalp. Buy a shampoo that is 100% sulfate free. Sulfates are usually too harsh on curls, and alcohol dries your hair out.
You can go three days without washing your hair if it is thick.
A few good shampoos for curly hair are: Garnier Fructis Curl and Shine Fortifying Shampoo, Curl Junkie Curl Assurance Gentle Cleansing Shampoo, and Curly Solutions Treatment Shampoo.;
, Take a soft towel and gently squeeze and pat the excess water out of your hair. Do not use too much force while using a towel because it can cause breakage. Your hair should still be wet, but not sopping.You can use a soft, cotton t-shirt instead of a towel to further prevent breakage.
Consider investing in a towel specifically made for hair drying.

, It takes natural oils longer to travel from the scalp to the ends of curly hair, which makes curly hair more vulnerable to damage. That is why it is important to condition your hair well. Look for a leave-in conditioner that is made for curly hair. Use a wide-tooth comb to evenly distribute the product throughout your hair. You should deep condition with a masque every week. A few good masques for curly hair are: Ouidad Curl Recovery Melt-down Extreme Repair Mask, DevaCurl Heaven in Hair, and Jessicurl Deep Conditioning Treatment., Apply a styling product while your hair is still wet. Using a styling product before drying will help your hair maintain full, bouncy curls. The type of styling product you use depends on your hair type. Distribute the product through your hair from root to ends, scrunch, and then squeeze your hair upwards, towards your scalp. Sprays are best for those with soft curls.
Use thicker gels for medium to big curls. A thick gel should have a consistency similar to shampoo and be fairly easy to spread in your hands.
Try dense gels for tight coils. A dense gel will probably be a bit sticky and more difficult spread.Don’t use more than a dime-size portion of product. Too much product will make your curls crunchy., You should use a heat-protectant product no matter what your hair type is, as the heat of blow drying has damaging effects on hair. Heat-protectant products come in both creams and sprays. To use it, divide your hair into four sections with clips or bobby pins. Then, coat each section thoroughly with the product of your choice.


Some recommended heat-protectant products are: Wella Thermal Image Heat Protectant Spray, Tom & Guy Heat Protectant Mist, and Carol’s Daughter Choclat Smoothing Blow Dry Cream., Some hair dryers come with an attachable diffuser, but you may have to buy one separately. A diffuser is a must for curly hair because it dries curls evenly for a full, uniform look. A hair dryer without a diffuser only focuses on one section of hair at a time, which disrupts the curl pattern.A diffuser will also help to prevent frizz.

, You should not dry all of your hair at once. Instead, part it into three sections. The amount of sections may be less or more depending on the thickness of your hair, though. Part your hair in the middle and make two buns on either side of your head. Leave the back section of your hair in a ponytail or down.Dividing your hair into sections will make sure the heat is distributed evenly while you are drying it.Make sure the sections are clean and neat. Use bobby pins, barrettes, pins, or ponytail holders. Don’t make any section larger than what your pin, barrette, or hair tie can easily hold.

, A high heat setting is more damaging than a lower setting, and it makes your hair harder to style. Use a low heat setting to start off with. You can switch to a medium heat once your hair begins to dry., Choose a top section of your hair, take it down, and apply the diffuser to the roots. Constantly move your hair dryer around, and work from root to end on each section of hair. The ends are the most easily damaged part of your hair, so allow them to air dry as long as possible.Keeping the hair dryer in one place for too long promotes damage.

, Once your hair is dry, bend over and flip your hair. Press the “cool” button, and blast your hair on that setting for a few minutes. Flipping it over and blowing it upside down will add some volume to your hair.Do not do this step if you are satisfied with the volume of your hair.

, Once your hair is dry, apply a pomade or oil to your hair to promote smoothness and tame any excess frizz. Take your hair in you hands as if you were putting it in a ponytail, apply the product from roots to the ends, and then let go. Then, massage your scalp for added volume.It is recommended to use a pea-sized drop of product, or only use a few spritzes if you’re using a spray. If that is not enough to coat your hair, then apply a few more drops until every section of hair is covered.
If possible, search for organic products that do not have alcohol in them. A few organic styling products are: Nashi Hair Spray, Saach Organic Herbal Hair Oil, and Far Botanicals Smoothing Preservation Hair Butter., Avoid brushing your hair until the next time you wash it. If possible, completely avoid using a brush. The bristles of a brush contribute to fraying your hair, therefore promoting frizz. Keeping your brush away from your hair will keep your curls fresh and shapely.Comb out tangles with a wide-tooth comb.

, Curls can lose their volume pretty quickly, but there are a few things you can do to prevent them from going limp. Along with avoiding a brush, you should also avoid running your fingers through your hair to prevent frizz. To renew volume, spray your hair lightly with water and blow dry on a low heat setting for a few minutes. This will reactivate your styling products.You can make an anti-frizz spray by adding four parts water and one part conditioner to a spray bottle.

Wash and condition your hair.,
Towel dry your hair.,
Apply product.,
Let hair dry naturally.",How to Scrunch Hair1," You should always wash your hair before attempting to scrunch it, as scrunching only works properly on wet hair. If you try to scrunch dry hair it will end up looking like a ball of frizz! If possible, use a volumizing shampoo which will help give your scrunched hair body and texture. Use only a small amount of conditioner, and be sure to rinse your hair very well to keep it from being weighed down by product.


While you're still in the shower, use a wide-tooth comb to detangle your hair while you have conditioner in it. The conditioner will make it easier to tease out any tangles and will minimize damage to hair, making it less prone to frizz.
Part your hair wherever you like - down the middle, at the side, or zig-zagged - keeping in mind that the scrunched hair look is made to be messy, and a perfect part is far from necessary.;
, Once you've rinsed out your hair and stepped out of the shower, wrap a large, absorbent towel around your head like a turban for about two minutes. Then unwrap the towel and use it to pat any excess moisture from the hair. You can do this by grabbing small sections of hair and squeezing them against the towel. This will provide some pre-scrunching curl.


Make sure to pat your hair with the towel rather than rubbing it. Rubbing it dry causes a lot of hair damage and breakage, which leads to frizz rather than smooth, sleek curls.
Don't dry your hair too much - you still need it to be wet for scrunching, you just don't want it to be dripping, as the styling products will drip out also.
Avoid using a hair dryer to get rid of excess moisture, as this will dry the hair too quickly and have a straightening effect on the hair, which will not help you to scrunch curls.

, At this point, you can apply whatever curl-enhancing product you choose. Such products come in a variety of forms - mousses, gels, sprays, serums, etc. Mousse is probably the most popular product for hair scrunching. Choose a volumizing or strong-hold mousse, particularly if your hair is not naturally wavy, as this will help to give you long-lasting, voluminous curls.


To use the mousse, squirt a golf ball size amount into your hand, turn your head upside down so your hair is in front of your face, then work the product evenly into your hair with both hands.
Only work the mousse into the ends and mid-lengths of your hair - avoid putting it in the roots as this may weigh your hair down or cause it to look greasy.
Keeping your head upside down, scrunch your hair by grabbing a small section in your hand and crumpling it up towards your scalp, using the same motion as you would use to crumple a piece of paper.
The same technique can be used regardless of what product you use, just adjust the amount of product according to the instructions on the bottle and the length of your hair - more for longer hair, less for shorter hair.

, At this point, it is possible to stop and just let your hair dry naturally, especially if your hair is prone to even a little wave or curl. Just continue to scrunch up your hair (using the paper crumpling technique) every 5 to 10 minutes or so, until your hair is dry. Once dry, you can apply a little hair spray for extra hold or serum for added shine - then you're good to go!


Avoid using a regular hair dryer to speed up the drying process - the strong air flow will pull your hair and cause your curls to straighten or become frizzy.
If your hair is normally very straight, or you just want to add a little extra ""oomph"", try using one of the additional scrunching methods below.

"
"
Clip your hair up.,
Spray with hairspray.,
Remove the clips.,
Apply some hair gel.",How to Scrunch Hair2," Once you have applied your product and scrunched your hair, you can add extra defined curls by clipping your hair up while it naturally air dries. Using butterfly clips, gather small sections up to your roots and clip them in place. If you don’t have butterfly clips, you can make small messy buns in your hair and secure with bobby pins or hair ties.









You can do as many bunches or buns as you like. Fewer buns will create larger, looser waves, while many buns will give you smaller, tighter curls.
You can also experiment with twisting each section of hair tightly before clipping, rather than collecting it in bunches. It will still curl the hair, but will give you a slightly different look.
If you want to achieve a messier, ""bed-head"" look, try clipping up different size sections of hair at random. This will make your curls less-uniform and more spontaneous-looking!

, With the clips still in your hair, spray all over your head with a strong-hold hairspray. This will help to set your curls as your hair dries. After spraying, let your hair sit in the clips for about a half an hour - or until your hair dries - for maximum effect. In the meantime, you can do your makeup or enjoy a cup (or two!) of morning coffee.


If you are in a hurry, you can help the process along by using a hairdryer to finish drying off your clipped hair.
Some hairsprays can be sticky or cause your hair to feel ""crunchy"", so it may be worth investing in a good brand-name hairspray that will hold your curls in place, while still leaving your hair feeling soft.

, Once your hair is almost or fully dry, take out the clips and let your hair fall down, gently scrunching each section to separate the curls. Then you can turn your head upside down and use your fingers to fluff up your hair, giving it volume and shape.









Whatever you do, do not brush your hair out with a hairbrush or comb. This will undo the curls and cause your hair to look frizzy.
If your hair is a little knotty, just use your fingers to comb through the tangles and separate the strands of hair. Again, scrunched hair is not meant to be perfect - it's meant to look a little wild and spontaneous!
If you're not 100% happy with how the curls turned out, it's okay to cheat a little and use a curling tongs to give a little extra definition. Shhh...nobody needs to know!

, The last step is to apply a dime-sized amount of hair gel or serum to the ends and mid-lengths of your hair. Make sure to work it evenly into the hair, using a gentle scrunching motion. This will help keep frizz at bay and add extra shine to your hair.


Again, remember to avoid the roots when applying gel or serum, as they can weigh your hair down or cause your roots to look greasy.
Look for gels or serums specifically geared towards frizz control or curl definition - there are plenty available at drug stores and hair salons.

Attach a long-finger diffuser to your hair dryer.,
Turn the hair dryer's speed and heat settings to low.,
Dry your hair.,
Apply some hairspray or gel.,
Finished.

",How to Scrunch Hair3," A diffuser is an attachment for your hairdryer which helps keep curls intact by reducing the pulling and straightening effect of regular blow drying. Long-finger diffusers usually have a bowl or cup for the air to sit in while drying, this allows for less movement and produces less frizz.

, When using a diffuser, you should always set your hair dryer's heat and speed settings to low. The low heat protects your hair from burning while your hair is sitting in the cup of the diffuser, close to the heat source. The low speed minimizes air movement, thus preventing frizz.

, Turn the hair dryer on and direct the flow of air upwards, to help lift the roots. Take a section and scrunch the hair up towards the scalp, holding it there with the fingers of the diffuser until the hair is dry. Rotate the diffuser in a slight circular motion. Move on to another section of hair and repeat, until all of your hair is dry. Don't forget to turn your head upside down to dry the underside.








, Once all of your hair is dry, you can spritz it with some hairspray to hold the curls in place, or work in a dime-sized amount of gel to help give the curls some definition.

Use some tricks and remedies to clean your nails and remove stains.,
Massage your nails.",How to Care for Your Nails at Home," Cut nails when they reach a point that's to high for you. If you don't clip them when needed they can tear or get caught on things. Even worse it can scratch things.... like you.









Take special care with your toenails. For true nail care, trim your toenails in a straight line and not in a curved manner. Inappropriate toenail cutting, toe injuries and even ill-fitting boots or shoes might result in minute pieces of these toenails splitting up at the corners. This can also lead the problem of ingrown nails. ;
, Fragile nails can be caused by iron deficiencies. Foodstuffs abundant in iron include liver, trim red meats, species of fish, soy products, beans, lentils, whole grain products, green spinach, fresh vegetables, asparagus, parsley, poultry along with turkey, nuts, egg yolks, dry fruits like raisins, dates and apricots, etc. Eat a lot of these to help keep your nails healthy!









Beetroots usually contain more calcium and also vitamin D to supplement healthy nail growth. Day-to-day consumption of beetroots is likely to make all your finger nails incredibly healthy and sturdy.













Likewise for daily nail care, incorporate additional calcium loaded food items for instance milk products into your daily diet.

Cut finger nails about once a week.,
Cut the nails straight across.,
Smooth any rough edges with a nail file.,
Trim after a bath or shower.,
Make it a game.,
Trim a few fingers and try again later.",How to Care for Your Toddler's Nails1," Finger nails grow at a rate of about .1 millimeters each day. That doesn’t sound like much, but it means that your toddler’s nails can grow enough in a couple of weeks to inadvertently scratch herself or others. You may get a reminder in the form of a small cut, if you fall behind.Smaller children may need more frequent trims. Infants, for instance, have very fast growing nails that can need to be clipped twice a week.Toenails grow a bit more slowly than fingernails, on the other hand. You probably only need to cut them once or twice per month.;
, Using nail scissors or clippers, cut nearly straight across and round a little at both edges of the nail. Do this for both the finger nails and toe nails. It will reduce the chance that your toddler develops a hangnail, which can cause infections.For infants and smaller children, you can use blunt-nose toe nail scissors or baby nail clippers. Do not use adult nail clippers. Be very careful so that you don’t accidentally cut the tips of the toes or fingers, as well.Do not trim a child’s finger or toe nails by biting them. This can transmit a condition called herpetic whitlow, an infection of the finger or thumb caused by the herpes virus., Once you’ve trimmed the nails, look for any ragged edges that could scratch or catch onto something like fabric. Use a nail file or emery board to smooth off these rough patches.Always make sure to pull the emery board in the same direction when filing nails. Going back and forth can weaken nails.
Leave your toddler’s cuticles alone. Cuticles protect the nail root, so you don’t need to cut them back or push them down.

, Warm water from the bath will temporarily soften your toddler’s nails. Try to trim immediately after one so that the procedure is easier and less daunting for you both. As a bonus, the water can also relax your child.Some children just don’t like nail cutting and throw fits at the first sight of clippers. Try clipping the nails when your child is asleep, if you have this sort of problem.

, Toddlers are often uncooperative. You might find that nail clipping time elicits squirms, tantrums, or refusals. One way that you can make nail trimming easier – on you as well as on your toddler – is to turn it into a game. Having a bit of fun can make your child forget all about being antsy or scared.You might inject a little fun by singing a finger nail-themed song, like “The Itsy Bitsy Spider Went to the Nail Salon.”
You could also pretend with your toddler that her fingers are a big family and that the nails are their hair. Explain that every week, the mommy, daddy, and kids need to go for a trim.
Be mindful of language, too. Toddlers may be uncooperative because you’re using the word “cut,” which they associate with pain. Opt for a more neutral word like “trim” or “clip” instead.

, Don’t feel that you absolutely need to trim every finger and toe nail in the same sitting. There’s no fast rule. For really a resistant toddler, try to do what you can before she gets too squirmy or escapes.Get a few nails clipped and then try again later. You might even wait until the next day to complete all ten fingers.

Check your nails often.,
Dry and moisturize.,
Get rid of hangnails properly, right away.,
Don’t pick or chew your nails.",How to Care for Your Toddler's Nails2," Teach your child to check her nails from time to time to make sure that they’re healthy, forming a good habit. Nails can show signs of certain kinds of health problems, like if they have dark streaks on them or become brittle. Both of these are signs that you should see a dermatologist.Start this with your toddler from a young age. Check her nails while explaining what you’re doing, i.e. “Daddy’s just looking at your finger nails to make sure they’re healthy. Sometimes, if something’s wrong, the nails try to tell you.”
You can teach children more about what to look for in healthy and unhealthy nails as they get older, like thickened or discolored nails or deformations in the shape of the nail.

, Teach your toddler how to properly care for nails once they’ve been trimmed, as well. This includes making sure that the hands and feet remain dry, which can reduce the risk of infection, and also that the nails and cuticles are kept moisturized.Apply some lotion to your toddler’s nails after a bath or shower, particularly when the air is dry. This can prevent nails from splitting and cuticles from cracking.
As before, explain what you’re doing, i.e. “Now we’ll just put a little bit of lotion on each nail. This keeps the nails healthy so they won’t crack.”

, A hangnail is small, torn piece of skin at the edge of a nail. They are common but can hurt and, if removed incorrectly, can lead to an infection of the nail or the surrounding skin. Check your toddler’s fingers and toes for hangnails and remove them safely.Always wash your hands and your toddler’s hands with soap and water before trying to get rid of a hangnail, to reduce the chance of infection.
Never bite or rip off a hangnail. Instead, cut away the extra skin with a small pair of scissors or a clean nail clipper. Apply some antibiotic ointment to the area afterward.
Talk to your toddler through this procedure, especially if she is anxious. Reassure her that cutting the hangnail won’t hurt and that it needs to come off, i.e. “Don’t worry sweetie. We just have to take this little tiny piece off – it won’t hurt at all.”

, There are a lot of bad habits that can damage finger and toenails. Picking at the cuticle, biting and chewing, or frequently sucking on a finger or thumb can cause infections or deform the nails. Try to model good habits by not doing any of these things while also teaching your toddler to avoid them.


Biting or picking at the cuticle can lead to deformation, especially when the nail root is affected. These nails will grow in ridged or wavy. Damaged skin around the nail from biting or sucking can expose your toddler to an infection, called paronychia. This occurs when bacteria enter into the body and can cause swelling, tenderness, and the accumulation of pus.

"
"
Soak an infected nail in warm salt water.,
See a doctor if the infection spreads or if there is an abscess.,
See a doctor for avulsed nails.,
Keep the injured area raised, is possible.,
Follow your doctor’s orders.",How to Care for Your Toddler's Nails3," Your toddler might have paronychia if you notice redness, swelling, or the formation of an abscess around one of her nails. This is a bacterial infection. It’s usually not serious, but observe it closely so that it heals it good time.Infections in and around the nails will most often heal on their own. However, you can soak the infected finger in warm salt water a few times per day. This will promote healing.
Use warm water, not hot water. Test the water before using it on your toddler.

, Keep a close eye on nail infections and take your toddler to see a doctor if you notice the infection start to spread. Also be aware of small pus-filled blisters that form in the center of the infection. These are abscesses and may need to be drained.A doctor can treat an infection with antibiotics and, possibly, by draining pus from the finger. Don’t try to treat or lance abscesses by yourself, as this can cause complications and worsen the infection.

, An avulsion is when a finger or toe nail gets partially or totally separated from its normal position, usually from injury. A child might accidentally snag a toe nail on carpeting or slam a finger nail in a car door, for example. This sort of situation may need emergency medical care, especially if there’s damage to the nail bed.Take your toddler to a doctor or to a medical center for care. She may need to get stitches or the doctor may need to remove the nail, put it back in place, or repair the nail bed.Stay on top of follow-up care and make sure that you bring your child to all appointments. Be ready to call the doctor again if she is having problems.

, A finger with an avulsed nail may be sore for a few days after the injury. It may take several days for the wound to completely heal and longer for a nail to grow back – 6 months for a finger nail and maybe 12 to 18 months for a toe nail. Treating the wound well at home will help to speed up this healing process.At home, try to keep the injured area elevated on a pillow whenever the child lies down for the next three days. This will reduce swelling.

, Your doctor will likely have instructions for how you should handle any bandages and pain relievers after an avulsion. Follow these as closely as you can and always give medicines exactly as directed.Leave the child’s bandage on and, if she got stitches, don’t let the area get wet. Cover the affected hand or foot with a plastic bag when she bathes.
In general, you should remove the bandage and gently clean the wound two times per day after the first 24 to 48 hours. You can apply a thin layer of Vaseline or petroleum jelly to the wound and cover with a non-stick bandage. Replace as necessary.
Follow your doctor’s order for medication. Do not give your child two or more pain medications at once unless the doctor has explicitly directed it. Never give anyone under age 20 aspirin, either, as it has been linked to a serious inflammation of the liver and brain, or Rye’s syndrome, in children and adolescents.

In the microwave, warm up a bowl of 1/3 cup hand cream, a few glugs of olive oil (or grape seed oil, if you have it), and 3-4 drops of lavender oil (found in the health food store) to a temperature that is warm but not too hot to touch.
Apply a generous amount to each fingernail and gently massage into the nail, cuticle and surrounding skin, spending a minute or two on each. The cream is extremely good for your hands (and feet!) and will keep your cuticles soft.
You can keep and re-warm this homemade cream for up to 3 days in your fridge if you store it in a dark glass bottle.;
, If you can afford it, investing in a hot wax treatment at your local nail salon can work wonders for hands, nails and cuticles.


During a hot wax treatment, a special oily wax is melted down and applied to the hands and fingertips. Then you will be asked to wear a pair of plastic gloves and place your hands in a mitt.
After 10 to 15 minutes, you will remove your hands from the mitt and the wax will be removed, leaving the skin of your hands and cuticles feeling soft and supple.It is also possible to buy paraffin wax treatment kits online, which you can use yourself at home.

, If you're looking for a cheap yet effective option for moisturizing your cuticles, buy a tub of petroleum jelly and rub a generous amount into the cuticles every night before bed. Petroleum jelly will soften your cuticles and stop them from peeling, but it can be a little greasy for use throughout the day.

, Essential oils can be helpful in moisturizing your cuticles, while also smelling great! Some of the most effective ones are jojoba oil and orange oil, while tea tree oil is great for clearing up any small infections.

, If you're out and about and your cuticles are bothering you, have a look in your bag for a stick of lip balm and try rubbing a little on your cuticles. It should provide some temporary relief until you can get your hands on some hand cream., Give your hands a soak in hot (not boiling) water or take a long bath. This will help to soften the cuticles and any loose skin. If you like, you can add a teaspoon of freshly-squeezed lemon juice or vinegar to the water. This will help to exfoliate any dead skin.

, Once your cuticles have been softened, it should be easy to push them back using an orange stick.


An orange stick is a small wooden or metal stick used to push back cuticles and clean under the nails. They can be purchased cheaply at the drug store or online.
Use the flat end of the orange stick to push back the cuticle. Try to do this very gently - if you push too hard you might hurt yourself and make your cuticles worse!
Push the cuticles back until you can see the white half-moon shape (called the lunula) at the bottom of each fingernail. Don't do this more than once or twice a month, as the cuticles are quite sensitive.
Metal orange sticks need to be sterilized after each use, while wooden orange sticks should be thrown away., Your cuticles are important - they protect your nail's growth matrix (the part the nails grow from) by preventing any dirt or bacteria from entering. As a result, you should refrain from cutting your cuticles and switch to pushing them back instead.


Cutting your cuticles removes this protective layer and exposes your nails to infection. It also makes the skin of the cuticles harder and more prone to splitting and peeling.
Don't worry about your cuticles growing back faster once you stop cutting them - this is a myth. Their rate of growth will remain the same even if you stop cutting., Regularly moisturizing your cuticles is one of the most important steps in stopping your cuticles from peeling. You should moisturize them at least twice a day - once in the morning and once at night.


Don't forget that your cuticles are made out of skin (despite their thicker texture), and all skin needs to be moisturized in order to stay hydrated and prevent peeling and flaking.
During the day you can use a moisturizing hand lotion which soaks in quickly and doesn't leave your hands feeling greasy. At night, however, you should use a thicker cream or cuticle ointment for more intense hydration.
After you moisturize your hands and cuticles at night, it is a good idea to wear a pair of cotton or wool gloves to bed. This prevents the cream or ointment from rubbing off on the bed sheets, while the extra heat will help your skin to really absorb the moisturizer. You will wake up in the morning with really soft hands and cuticles!

, If the skin around your fingernails feels cracked and irritated, you may have a small infection. If this is the case, you will need to clear up the infection before your cuticles can start to heal.


You can do this by applying a generous layer of topical antibacterial ointment (such as Neosporin) to the cuticles.
Once you have applied the antibacterial ointment (which is more effective than the cream version), you should wrap a band-aid around each affected nail.
Leave the band-aid on overnight and in the morning you will find your cuticles looking and feeling a lot better!, If your cuticles are painful, have pus or swelling, or develop red spots, you may have an infection called paronychia. If you suspect this could be the case, see your doctor as soon as possible as you may require a course of antibiotics to clear the infection.

, Cold weather can be very drying to your hands, causing cuticles to crack and peel.


Therefore, it is important to pay special attention to protecting your hands in wintertime, or whenever you are experiencing very cold weather.
Always wear gloves when you are outdoors and remember to carry a small hand cream in your purse that you can apply at regular intervals.

, People who tend to bite their nails or nibble at their cuticles are much more likely to develop dry, peeling skin around their fingers than those who don't.


You are also at risk of developing an infection, as your mouth contains bacteria which can easily transfer to your nails. Saliva also contains enzymes which break down the skin, leading to further dryness.
Therefore one of the most effective measures you can take to prevent dry, peeling cuticles is to stop biting and keep your hands away from your mouth.
To help you, you can purchase special foul-tasting ointments for your nails. They make your fingers taste so bad that you'll think twice before biting again!

, Having dry hands can accelerate the cracking and peeling of cuticles, so make sure to protect them from any unnecessary exposure to drying agents.


Frequently washing the dishes in hot, soapy water can be very drying for your hands, so protect them by wearing rubber gloves every time you do the washing up.
If you don't like wearing the gloves, then at least invest in a more moisturizing dish soap designed to hydrate hands as you wash.
Steer clear of acetone-based nail polish removers, as these sap moisture from your nails like nobody's business. You should also try to keep hand washing to a minimum, as frequent washing removes important natural oils from the surface of the skin and nails.

, Be careful when choosing a nail technician for your manicures and pedicures, as a poorly executed manicure can do more harm than good.


Some nail technicians can be very rough with your nails and cuticles, which can result in peeling, cracking and soreness.
If your nail technician tries to cut your cuticles, or tries to push your cuticles back too far, politely ask her to stop. They're your nails, so you get to decide what happens to them.
If your nail technician cuts your cuticles and you end up with soreness or an infection, this could be the result of improperly sterilized equipment. If this happens, you should consider switching to a different nail salon.

Play with that constantly in place of biting your nails.
Distract your hands at times when you usually bite your nails, such as car rides, or when you're sitting in class. Find a new way to replace the habit depending on where you are. If you're in class, focus on writing extremely thorough notes. If you're in the passenger seat of a car, fiddle with your keys.

Chew gum or suck on mints or candies throughout the day. Biting your nails will be tough if you're busy chewing gum or taking in the flavor of a delicious sucking candy. Also, the sensation of your bitten nails mixing with the flavor of minty gum or an orange-flavored candy will just be gross.
Snack small throughout the day. Though you should avoid snacking so much that you end up gaining weight, you should carry around healthy snacks like carrot sticks or celery so you can munch on them throughout the day.
Carry around a water bottle. Bring water with you wherever you go so you can always take a sip of water when you're having a weak moment.

, Putting nail polish on your nails may help to discourage you from nibbling on them since a vibrant color can catch your attention and snap you out of your nail-biting habit. You'll also have more motivation to avoid biting your nails since you won't want to ruin the nice appearance.

Pick one nail to ""protect"" at a time.,
Go a few days without biting that nail.,
Notice how much better that nail looks than the others.,
Pick another nail to stop biting.,
Repeat the process until you have successfully avoided biting all of your nails.",How to Stop Biting Your Nails5," If you have one nail that appears more damaged than the rest, it might be in your best interest to start with that nail. If all nails appear the same, however, you can pick any nail you wish.


If you find it difficult to break the habit all at once, working on one nail at a time can make things easier by allowing you to slowly build better habits instead of demanding too much of yourself all at once.

, You might be able to do so without help, but if you need some extra assistance, consider wrapping an adhesive bandage around the fingertip of your chosen nail. Doing so should block your access to the nail, making it harder to bite it.

, After a few days, a non-bitten nail will flourish and reward you.


Do not bite your chosen nail during this time. If you must, bite one of the 'unprotected' ones. Sometimes it even helps knowing that you have another nail to bite, even if you don't actually nibble at any unprotected ones.

, Once you have grown your non-bitten nail for a while, start protecting another one. During this time, however, it's important that you leave both the first and second nails alone. You wouldn't want to undo the good work you accomplished on the first nail by biting it after switching your focus to a new one!

, If you ever really feel the urge to bite your nails, do the reverse of this process by focusing on just one nail to bite. That should help you limit the amount of damage done to the other nails.

, You can apply fresh bandages every time you shower, every time the bandage gets soggy or dirty, or every few days.


You can remove them for a special occasion, or choose to keep them on so you look silly during the occasion and are even more motivated to stop biting your nails.
Unless you bite your nails in your sleep, it's probably a good idea to take the bandages off at night. Doing so will give your skin a chance to ""breathe."" You should also remove bandages that look notably moist or dirty.

, It takes at least 21 days to break a habit, so you should be prepared to stick with this method for at least that long. You can remove the bandages after that point.


To really break a habit, though, you should also work on replacing it with a positive habit. For instance, switch the chewing sugar-free gum or playing with a stress ball while consciously following the bandage procedure.Replacing a bad habit with a neutral one usually makes it easier to break.

, If you start biting your nails again, put the adhesive bandages back on for a longer period of time or attempt another method to quit.


Some research suggests it may take up to three months to successfully break a habit, so don't expect yourself to be in the clear just yet.Remain conscious about your habit and your desire to break it, even after you take the bandages off.
Consider backing your efforts by painting your nails, getting a professional manicure, or using a bite inhibitor after removing the bandages.

Exfoliate your lips before applying make-up.,
Hydrate your lips to keep them looking full.,
Pick the right shade of lipstick.,
Outline them with lip-liner.,
Apply lipstick near the middle of your lips.,
Apply some lip gloss.,
Highlight your lips as well.,
Try a lip plumber.",How to Get Big Lips1," Basic facial scrubs can be used on the lips as well as the rest of the skin on the face. These do a great job cleansing pores and exfoliating dry, dead skin from the surface. Spend a few minutes massaging this into your lips to remove flaky skin cells that will keep your lips from looking full and healthy.


You can make a natural sugar scrub at home with equal parts of sugar and olive oil, or you can buy these products at most beauty supply outlets. You can also gently brush your lips with a dry toothbrush.;
, Hydrating your lips will keep them from drying out and peeling under your lipstick. You can use a variety of moisturizers and lip balms to keep the skin on your lips from becoming too dry. Try to apply moisturizer ever day, especially if it's cold, or especially dry and windy out.

Hydrate from the inside out as well. This means drinking a minimum of 64oz (8 cups) of water per day. This is not only healthy for your body but it keeps your skin, and lips, hydrated.

, When choosing a lip colour, try to stick to lighter colours. We are all aware, when dressing ourselves, that dark colours are slimming and light ones are not. The same applies to lipsticks, so any dark tones are going to firstly make your lips look smaller and secondly draw more attention to that fact because of how attention grabbing they are., Line right along the outer edge of your lip using liner, then line just a bit on your actual lip. This helps the lipstick you'll apply last, and will prevent it from running on your face, which sometimes happens, especially with darker colors.Be subtle. Think Kylie Jenner. Don't give yourself a dramatic cupid's bow, this not only draws attention to the fact that your lips are drawn on, but also make them appear smaller. Instead follow the natural shape of your lips.

, Take the lipstick color of your choice and place it onto your lips, using a brush to blend it into your lip liner, as to remove any harsh lines. Take a slightly lighter lipstick in tone to your last one and pat it into the inside of your lips, where they are at their biggest and light would naturally hit it. Take your brush and blend this with the base color to ensure it looks natural.


If you want, try taking a highlighter or use a little white eye shadow and try applying a small amount right above the middle of your upper lip in the ""cupid's bow"" if you want to try. If using white eye shadow, blend in well so it doesn't look like a glob of white, but a just slightly lighter, slightly shimmery spot. This trick makes your lips appear fuller, but can also make it look a little fake.

, Use a clear gloss on top to help reflect the light to give the illusion of a fuller lip. If you do not like the look of a gloss, then make sure the lighter lip shade you use has a sheen to it and is not matte.Apply it to both top and bottom lip, but apply to the middle of your lips not the right and left sides. It will spread when you smoosh your lips together but will be concentrated in the middle, making your lips look fuller.

, Take a sheer highlighter in your preferred form, brush or liquid, and touch up the top of your natural cupid's bow to make your lips seem fuller. Using a matte bronzer, apply some in the curve under your lips and above your chin. This will give the impression that your lips are more raised up.

, Some people swear by lip plumpers, which are essentially lip-glosses which have irritants contained within them which causes your lips to 'swell' up as blood flow to them increases, hence the tingly feeling. DuWop, Laura Mercier, Smashbox and Dior have some good lip plumpers, however most 'beauty' brands will have one.


Lip-plumpers do have their shortfalls. The effects are temporary and the products can be really drying on your lips.

Extra virgin coconut oil is a favorite amongst DIY beauty product aficionados. It is antibacterial, and full of antioxidants and free radicals that keep the skin looking young.
Avocado oil is a rich moisturizer. Unlike the other oils, it is not antibacterial.

, Use your favourite facial cleanser to remove make-up and wash your face. Use warm water, instead of cold or hot, since warm water is the best temperature for delicate facial skin.


Be sure to remove all of your make-up before you continue with the facial.
If you're in the mood to try something new, use the oil cleansing method to wash your face. Apply almond, jojoba or olive oil to your face, then wipe it away with warm water. This is an excellent way to remove make-up without damaging skin.

, Dead skin cells build up on the face and leave it looking a little dull. Ex-foliating your skin to brighten it up is an essential part of any facial routine. Use your favourite facial scrub to gently rub away the dead skin. If you don't have a scrub, you can make your own. Try these simple combinations:1 teaspoon sugar, 1 teaspoon honey and 1 teaspoon milk
1 teaspoon ground oatmeal, 1 teaspoon honey and 1 teaspoon olive oil
1 teaspoon ground almonds, 1 teaspoon honey and 1 teaspoon water

, Give your face a final rinse to remove all traces of your facial scrub. You may need to use a washcloth dipped in warm water to remove scrub from around your eyes and nose. Finish by patting your face dry with a soft towel.

, Massage increases circulation, leading to brighter, healthier skin. Now that your face is clean, give yourself a massage before moving to the next phase of your facial. Use your forefinger and middle finger to massage your face in a gentle circular motion.


Massage your forehead, starting in the middle and moving down to the temples.
Massage your nose and cheeks.
Massage your lips, chin and jaw.

, Boil a small pot of water on the stove. Turn off the heat and stand over the pot with a towel draped over your head, so that the steam coming from the water will be trapped around your face. Steam your face for five minutes or so, making sure to come up for air when you need to. Steaming helps to open your pores in preparation for a facial mask, which draws out impurities.


For a more luxurious experience, add some essential oils to the water. You'll get a steam and aromatherapy treatment in one. Try a few drops of lavender, lemongrass, rose, or grapefruit essential oil to lift your spirits.
If you don't have essential oils, throw a few herbal teabags into the water. Chamomile, chai and peppermint tea all have aromatic herbs.

, Next up is a facial mask, which will draw out impurities (like dirt and dead skin) from your pores. You can buy a facial mask product from the store, but it's easy and fun to make your own at home. Try one of the following masks:For dry skin: mix 1 mashed banana and 1 tablespoon honey

For oily skin: mix 1 teaspoon cosmetic clay and 1 teaspoon honey
For any type of skin: use plain honey, which has antibacterial and moisturizing properties perfect for any skin type

, Smooth it over your skin, then wait for it to do its magic. In the meantime, why not give yourself an eye treatment? Lie back and place two cool cucumber slices over your closed eyes. If you don't have cucumbers, two chilled teabags work just as well.

, Use warm water to remove all traces of the facial mask. Be sure to remove the honey from around your eyes and nose, since if you leave it in place it will feel quite sticky.

, Toner helps to brighten the skin and restore its balance. You can use a store-bought toner, but many products you probably have on hand at home work just as well. Try one of the following homemade toners:1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar mixed with 1 tablespoon water
1 tablespoon witch hazel mixed with 1 tablespoon water
1 tablespoon rosewater mixed with 1 tablespoon water

, The final step is to apply moisturizer that suits your skin type. Moisturizer will keep your skin from drying out, preserving the results of your facial. Look for a facial moisturizer that doesn't contain alcohol, since this can cause your skin to dry out more quickly.


If you want to use a homemade, all-natural moisturizer, try argan oil, almond oil or jojoba oil.
Aloe is another great natural moisturizer that has healing properties as well. It's especially useful if you're recovering from a sunburn.

, Wait a little while before you start your regular makeup routine to give your facial skin the chance to rest and reap the full benefits of your facial. Makeup normally contains alcohol and a wide range of chemicals, and applying it right after exfoliating your face and cleaning your pores could cause irritation.

, Place the beauty mud on the apples of your cheeks and gently spread it around your cheeks, forehead, temples, chin, and forehead. You can apply a thin layer if you want a quick mud mask that's easy to remove./images/thumb/7/72/Apply-a-Mud-Mask-Step-2-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Apply-a-Mud-Mask-Step-2-Version-2.jpg

If you apply a thick opaque layer of beauty mud, you'll be able to keep it on your skin longer since it won't dry out your skin's face as quickly.

, While you can cover your entire face with the mask, you should avoid using the beauty mud around your eye. The skin around your eye is delicate and if you apply mud to the area, you risk getting it in your eye, especially when removing the mask.Stand in front of a mirror when you apply the mask so you can easily avoid the eyes.


You should make sure to cover any blemishes or acne-prone areas of your skin. Just be gentle when you apply the beauty mud so you don't irritate the skin further.

, Once you've applied the mud mask, leave it on for 15 minutes or until the mud starts drying out./images/thumb/2/2e/Apply-a-Mud-Mask-Step-4-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Apply-a-Mud-Mask-Step-4-Version-2.jpg

, Take a clean cotton cloth and soak it in lukewarm water. Wring it out completely and gently rub it against the mud mask. Keep rinsing and wringing out the cloth in between rubbing the mask off./images/thumb/6/6b/Apply-a-Mud-Mask-Step-5-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Apply-a-Mud-Mask-Step-5-Version-2.jpg
/images/thumb/6/6b/Apply-a-Mud-Mask-Step-5-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Apply-a-Mud-Mask-Step-5-Version-2.jpg









Be gentle when you remove the mask. Rubbing your skin roughly can damage your delicate skin.
If you're having trouble removing the mask, soak your cloth in hot water and place it over your face for about 30 seconds. Then, use the clothe to wipe the mask off., After most of the mud mask has been cleaned off, splash your face with lukewarm water. This will help remove any remaining mud mask./images/thumb/7/7d/Apply-a-Mud-Mask-Step-6-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Apply-a-Mud-Mask-Step-6-Version-2.jpg

, You have lots of options when choosing a mud mask. Read label descriptions to find a mud mask that will work with your skin type. Depending on your skin type, look for a mask that has specific qualities. For:Dry skin: look for a hydrating product with moisturizing oils
Blemish-prone skin: choose a clay mask that can reduce oil and clear up acne
Sensitive skin: pick a mask that has minerals to reduce inflammation
Combination skin: consider applying two different masks to different parts of your face based on your skin type

, If you have longer hair, you should tie your hair back into a ponytail. This will keep your hair from falling in front of your face or getting stuck in the beauty mud while you apply the mask.If your hair does get mud mask on it, simply wet the strand with a wet cloth and rub the beauty mud out.

, It's a good idea to remove excess oil and buildup from your skin before you apply a mud mask. It will also make the mud mask adhere to your skin easier. Wash and dry your skin or do a steam facial./images/thumb/1/17/Apply-a-Mud-Mask-Step-10.jpg/v4-550px-Apply-a-Mud-Mask-Step-10.jpg
/images/thumb/1/17/Apply-a-Mud-Mask-Step-10.jpg/v4-300px-Apply-a-Mud-Mask-Step-10.jpg









Steam is a great way to open up your pores. It will also let the mud mask penetrate deeper into your skin.

, Put a few drops of the oil in the palm of your hand and rub your hands together. Gently pat your hands over your face so that the oil is evenly applied to your skin. You can do this before applying the beauty mud since it can dry out your skin./images/thumb/f/f9/Apply-a-Mud-Mask-Step-11.jpg/v4-550px-Apply-a-Mud-Mask-Step-11.jpg
/images/thumb/f/f9/Apply-a-Mud-Mask-Step-11.jpg/v4-300px-Apply-a-Mud-Mask-Step-11.jpg









Consider using a facial oil or moisturizer after removing the mud mask to further hydrate your skin.

, When used correctly, mud masks can improve your skin tone. But, since mud masks can dry out your skin, you shouldn't apply them more than once a week. If you have oily skin, you might be able to apply a mud mask up to twice a week to control oil production.If you have zits or blemishes, you can apply a mud mask just to the trouble spots. Do this whenever you have a breakout.

Store the perfume in a cool, dark place.",How to Make Vanilla Scented Perfume at Home," To create the vanilla essence for the perfume, you need fresh vanilla beans. Use a sharp knife to cut 8 to10 beans open lengthwise so you expose the paste inside. Scrape the paste out of the beans with the knife, and chop the bean shells into pieces. Place both the paste and chopped shells in a small glass jar that has a lid.Vanilla beans can be fairly expensive, so it’s usually best to buy them in bulk. You can make larger batches of perfume and give it as gifts for special occasions.
Scraping the paste out of more beans means you’ll create a more intense vanilla essence. However, if the beans are large, you may only need 8 or so.;
, After you’ve scraped out the vanilla bean paste and chopped up the shells, add vodka to the glass jar. You should pour enough liquid to cover the paste and chopped shells completely, with approximately ¼-inch (6.35-mm) more on top of the vanilla beans.Be sure to use vodka that’s at least 70 proof.

, When the vanilla bean paste and shells and vodka are mixed, cover the jar. Store it in a cool, dark location for three weeks to three months. The fragrance will come out of the vanilla bean paste and shells to scent and color the vodka.The longer you allow the vanilla to infuse the vodka, the stronger your perfume’s fragrance will be.
Check on the essence periodically while it’s steeping to analyze the scent and color. When the vanilla scent is strong and the color is rich and dark, the essence is ready.
Shake the mixture every so often while it’s steeping to ensure that the scent is distributed throughout the liquid.

, Even if the vanilla essence smells and looks right, it’s important to test it out before you make the perfume oil. Dab a small amount of the liquid on the inside of your wrist, and allow it to dry for 5 to 10 seconds. Smell it, and if you’re happy with the scent, you can mix up the perfume oil.If the vanilla fragrance isn’t strong enough when you test it on your skin, leave the mixture to steep for longer.

, Find a clean glass jar that you want to store your perfume in, and place a piece of nylon stocking or cheesecloth over the opening. Make sure the nylon or cheesecloth piece is long enough to hang over the sides, so you can secure the fabric with a rubber band or piece of string.Make sure sure that the jar or container you choose for your perfume has a lid for airtight storage.

, When the nylon or cheesecloth is secured over the top of the jar, pour the vanilla and vodka mixture through the fabric. That will catch any vanilla bean residue or particles to strain them from the vanilla essence.You can save the leftover vanilla residue and use it for more perfume in the future. Store it in an airtight jar, and add some fresh vanilla bean paste and shells to it when you’re ready to make a new batch.

, With the vanilla essence in the perfume jar or container, pour in approximately 1 ounce (30 ml) of jojoba oil. There should be double the amount of oil as there is vanilla essence, so you may need to use more or less of the oil, depending on how much essence you wind up with.You can substitute sweet almond oil for the jojoba oil if you prefer.

, To ensure that the vanilla essence is completely mixed with the oil, place the lid on the jar and shake it gently. The two may separate when you store the perfume oil, so be sure to shake it before each use., Once the oil and vanilla essence are mixed, the perfume oil is ready to use. When you’re not using it, keep the jar in a cool, dark to help preserve it.The perfume oil should be good for approximately 3 to 4 months if stored properly.

Make a solid perfume.",How to Make Perfume With Essential Oils," When making perfume from essential oils you'll need to follow an order: you start with a base oil, then have the middle tones, then finally the top notes. The top note is what you smell when you first smell your perfume, and then you are gradually able to smell your others. You'll need to add oils in this order.The top notes reach our senses first, but dissipate quickly. The middle notes are essentially the ""heart"" of your fragrance. They add warmth and fullness to your perfume and their smell is what lingers. Base notes evolve over time, so you may not smell them at first. However, after all other smells have faded, the base notes remain. They are often a more invigorating scent like pine, musk, glove, cedar wood, sandalwood, etc.;
, This is important because a dark bottle will help preserve your fragrance by keeping the light out. Make sure you shake your perfume before you apply it so that the scents mix together. When storing your bottle, try to keep it out of direct sunlight.


You can also use a roller bottle for essential oils. These sometimes work better because the fragrance tends to be thicker than regular perfume, making it somewhat harder to spritz onto your skin.

, Although you can use your perfume right away, it's best to allow the scents to combine and fuse together before using them. You can choose to use your perfume right away, but the scent will be less fragrant and the individual oils will not have had as much time to combine into one lovely scent. That's why allowing it to sit for a while is helpful, because then you've allowed your perfume time to reach its final scent.A perfume made out of essential oils may smell great right away, but overtime the scents may combine to something that doesn't smell very appealing. Allowing your perfume to sit will give you a better idea of what your combined scents will smell like for the majority of the perfume's life.

, While regular perfumes may last longer on your skin, essential oils are great because they are derived directly from nature. They don't have the many chemicals that commercial perfumes have, so if you're looking for something organic and natural, essential oils are the way to go. You also have the option to create tons of different scents and fragrances with essential oils.Essential oils are also good for people with sensitive skin or who react negatively to perfume products. These oils are natural so you can create a variety of different smells that your skin will hopefully handle better than commercial perfumes.
Commercial perfumes have preservatives and other chemicals which help the scent and fragrance last longer. Essential oils, because they are derived from nature, will fade faster. However, you can add a drop or two of a natural fixative or extender if you want your fragrance to last longer. These are usually very pungent so you don't want to use them frequently or in large amounts, but one drop here and there won't hurt.

, The first step to creating your fragrance is adding your base note. Often times base notes are earthy scents that provide a good lasting smell for your perfume and can be five to 20 percent of your blend (but this varies). However, some people choose to use scents like grape-seed oil or sweet almond oil. It's your personal preference and you may experiment to see what scents you like. If you aren't sure where to start you can follow this guideline:For a fresh and energizing perfume add 17 drops of grapefruit oil to your perfume bottle or roller bottle.For a romantic and floral blend, add 25 drops of rose essential oil.
For a sensual and earthy fragrance, add 20 drops of sweet orange essential oil.

, This is the heart of your fragrance, the smell that appears after your top note has dissipated. Some people choose to use a more floral scent for this note, but once again it is your personal preference. Often times middle notes are the biggest portion of your blend (50 to 80 percent), but once again this varies with experimentation. Here are some suggestions that follow the previous step:For a fresh and energizing perfume add 14 drops of ginger essential oil.For a floral and romantic blend add 10 drops of lime essential oil.
For a sensual, earthy fragrance add 15 drops ylang ylang oil. Ylang ylang is an oil derived from the cananga tree, and is known for it's rich floral scent.

, Finally, your last main addition to your perfume is the top note, which will fade quickly but will be the first scent that you smell when you open up your perfume. They can often be five to 20 percent of the blend, but you can add more or less if you choose. Some people prefer to use fruity, minty, or refreshing scents for their top note. Try out different scents if you aren't sure and see what you like the best. You can also follow this guideline:For an energizing, fresh blend add 10 drops of vetiver essential oil. Vetiver is a bunchgrass that is native to India and is often used as a flavoring agent because it creates a thick syrup. It also has fixative properties, which are what help the fragrance of the perfume to last.For a floral, romantic perfume add 10 drops of vetiver essential oil.
For an earthy, sensual fragrance add 10 drops of cedar wood essential oil.

, If you have tried out several different combinations and aren't pleased, you may need to just experiment with your scents. Play with different scents until you find one you like.


You may prefer a more woodsy scent and want to stick to vanilla, sandalwood, and sweet almond oil. Or you may enjoy very floral scents and want to use lavender, ylang ylang, and grapeseed oil. Maybe you appreciate fruity scents and want to use lemon, sweet orange, and mandarin.
If you have created a great scent thus far and then messed it up with another oil, don't fret. You can add a drop of orange oil, which supposedly helps cancel out other perfumes., This step isn't necessary, but can be helpful if you want your scent to last longer. Depending on the size of bottle you choose will determine how much alcohol to use. If you are using 60 or so drops of essential oil, you can use three to four ounces of alcohol. If you are only using 20 to 30 drops of essential oil, you should probably drop the amount of alcohol to one to two ounces.You can use any type of alcohol for this, but you may want one that blends well with your scents. Some people choose vodka because it is relatively flavorless, but a spiced rum might be nice. If you aren't sure, start with an alcohol that has less flavoring.

, After you have added all of your ingredients to your fragrance, shake it up. This will allow the scents to fuse and mingle. Then, if you are patient enough, let it sit for about a month before you use it. You can use it beforehand, but the scents will become stronger as it sits and the alcohol scent will also fade off., You can also create a solid perfume by using beeswax and jojoba oil. Some people use jojoba oil only for their liquid perfume, but if it becomes cold it will harden. So, it's best to use it if you are going for a solid perfume.One recipe you might try is four tablespoons beeswax, four tablespoons jojoba, 27-32 drops sandalwood oil, 27-32 drops vanilla oil, 25-30 drops grapefruit oil, and 20-25 drops bergamot oil.
Start by grating and melting the beeswax in a boiler over low heat. Then add the jojoba oil until thoroughly blended. Allow the mixture to cool below 120 degrees Fahrenheit and then proceed to add the rest of the oils. Store in a small jar or lip balm tube.

Try a variation.",How to Make Perfume," Perfumes are a blend of different levels of scent, also called “notes”. When you spray a fragrance on your skin, it moves through these notes in the following order:Top notes are what you smell first. They are also what disappears first, usually within 10 to 15 minutes.Middle notes appear as the top notes die off. These are the fragrance’s core, determining which family the perfume belongs to — for example, oriental, woody, fresh, or floral.Base notes accentuate and fix the fragrance’s middle notes, also known as its theme. They comprise the fragrance’s foundation, making the scent last up to 4 or 5 hours on your skin.;
, Popular top notes include basil, bergamot, grapefruit, lavender, lemon, lime, mint, neroli, rosemary, and sweet orange., These include black pepper, cardamom, chamomile, cinnamon, clove, fir needle, jasmine, juniper, lemongrass, neroli, nutmeg, rose, rosewood, and ylang-ylang., These include cedarwood, cypress, ginger, patchouli, pine, sandalwood, vanilla, and vetiver., When mixing a fragrance, first add your base notes, then your middle notes, then finally, your top notes. The ideal ratio for blending notes is 30% top notes, 50% middle notes, and 20% base notes.


Some perfumers recommend combining a maximum of 3 to 4 dominant notes., To make a perfume, you need more than just the top, middle, and base notes: you also need something to add them to.


Your process begins with a carrier oil. Popular choices include jojoba, sweet almond, and grape seed oil.
Next, you’ll slowly add drops of your base, middle, and top notes to the carrier oil.
Finally, you’ll add something to help merge the ingredients together. Alcohol is a popular choice because it evaporates quickly and helps diffuse the perfume’s notes.A common choice amongst DIY perfumers is a high-quality, 80- to 100-proof (40% to 50% alc/vol) vodka.
If you’re looking to make a solid perfume (more like a lip balm), use melted beeswax for the fixative instead of alcohol or water.

, If you’re unsure of how to structure a perfume, have a look at the ingredients of your favorite commercial scents.


If you have trouble finding the ingredients or separating them into notes, the Basenotes website is a great resource for breaking down the notes in popular perfumes., Many people recommend using dark glass containers because the dark glass helps protect your perfume from light, which can shorten its lifespan.


You’ll also want to make sure your glass containers haven’t previously contained any food items, as any residual scents will transfer to your perfume.
The exception to this would be if you actually wanted to use the scent of what was in the glass container before. (Warning: peanut-butter-banana-chocolate perfume might taste better than it smells!)

, A carrier oil is what carries the scents in a particular fragrance on to your skin. These are generally unscented, and are used to dilute concentrated oils and aromatics that can otherwise irritate your skin.


Your carrier oil can really be anything. You can even use olive oil if you don’t mind the scent.
One popular perfumer simmers rose petals in virgin olive oil, then combines it all with vitamin E oil to stabilize it., A common choice amongst many DIY perfumers is a high-quality, 80- to 100-proof (40% to 50% alc/vol) vodka. Other DIY perfumers favour 190-proof (80% alc/vol) alcohol.


Popular choices for 190-proof alcohol include organic neutral grape alcohol and the much cheaper Everclear, which is a grain spirit., Your perfume can be made out of a wide variety of ingredients. Common aromatics for perfumes include essential oils, flower petals, leaves, and herbs.

, The method for making perfume will vary slightly depending on your materials. Two common aromatics used for perfume are plant materials (flowers, leaves, and herbs) and essential oils; the methods vary for each of these.

, The type of container isn’t as important as the material: just make sure that a) it’s clean and b) it’s glass. The container also needs to have a tight-fitting lid.


Perfumers generally recommend using dark glass, which can lengthen the fragrance’s life by protecting it from light.
Avoid using jars that have previously contained food items, even if they’ve been washed out, as the glass might pass the scent on.

, Popular choices for use in perfumes include jojoba oil, almond oil, and grape seed oil.

, Be sure to collect plant materials when the scent is strong and the leaves are dry. Letting them air out can leave them limp and with a less effective scent.You may want to collect and dry more plants than you need, just in case you want to add more to strengthen the oil’s scent later on.

, If you’re using flowers, use only the petals. If you’re using leaves or herbs, remove any twigs or other bits that might interfere with the scent.

, This step is optional, but may help to bring out the scent more. You’ll just want to lightly press on the plant materials with a wooden spoon.

, It need only be a small amount — just enough to properly coat and cover your petals/leaves/herbs.

, Ensure that the lid is closed tightly.

,, If the oil doesn’t smell as strong as you’d like it to after one to two weeks, you can strain out the old plant materials and add new ones to the scented oil, then store it once more.


You can repeat this process for several weeks or even months until the oil has reached the desired strength.
Be sure to keep the oil! It’s the old plant materials that you want to discard.

, Once you’re happy with the oil, you can add 1 or 2 drops of a natural preservative such as vitamin E or grapefruit seed extract to your scented oil to help extend its life.If you’d like to turn the oil into a balm, you can also add some beeswax to it: melt some beeswax in the microwave, combine it with the perfume, then dump the whole mixture into a container to cool and solidify.

, You’ll need the following ingredients:


2 tbsp carrier oil (jojoba, almond, or grape seed will do)
6 tbsp 100- to 190-proof alcohol
2.5 tbsp bottled (not tap) water
30 drops of essential oils (at least 1 of each: base, middle, and top)
Coffee filter
Funnel
2 clean glass containers

,, You’ll want to add roughly 30 drop in total. Start with your base notes, then add your middle notes, then add your top notes. The ideal ratio is 20% base, 50% middle, and 30% top.


Pay attention to the scents that you are adding: if one scent is much stronger than the rest, you’ll want to add less of it so that it doesn’t overpower everything else.

, Use a high-quality alcohol with a high alcohol content. Vodka is a popular choice amongst DIY perfumers.

, Shut the lid and allow the perfume to cure for at least 48 hours. You can leave it for up to 6 weeks, which is when its scent will be at its strongest.


Check the bottle regularly to see where the scent is at.

, Once you’re happy with the scent, add 2 tbsp bottled water to your perfume.

, Do this for 1 minute to ensure that the contents are well blended.

, Using a coffee filter and a funnel, pour your perfume into a clean, dark glass bottle. You can also transfer it to a fancy bottle if you’re giving it as a gift.


You may want to label the bottle with the ingredients and a date on it so that you can keep track of how long it lasts. That way, you’ll know whether you should make more or less the next time around.

, To make a solid perfume (like a lip balm) instead of a spray/liquid perfume, try substituting the water with melted beeswax. You would add the melted beeswax to your perfume and then pour the warm mixture into a container to solidify.


You can buy beeswax at most health food stores.

Add the Kool-Aid.,
Measure out petroleum jelly.,
Stir the mixture.,
Divide it into containers.",How to Make Kool Aid Lip Gloss1," Let the mixture cool a little bit before adding the powder, as it will dissolve better.The Kool-Aid gives the lip gloss color and flavor, so pick a color that you'll like on your lips. Some good options are Strawberry Kiwi, Cherry, and Tropical Fruit Punch. How much Kool-Aid you add depends on how deep a color you want.








If you want a very dark lip balm, you can divide the petroleum jelly into six smaller pots and add one packet per pot. You may end up with grainier lip balm with this method.
For a smoother lip balm, add one to two packets of Kool-Aid to the whole bowl of of petroleum jelly. Some people use one packet per cup of petroleum jelly.You can also add a bit of sweetener or sugar to the mix to make it taste less bitter.;
, You'll need about 4 big spoonfuls. Add it to a microwave-safe bowl. Heat it up in the microwave, starting with 30 seconds. The petroleum jelly will eventually melt completely, forming a thick liquid.








As you heat it, take it out every 30 seconds to stir it, until it's completely melted. Stirring it will help it melt more evenly., Use a fork or whisk to thoroughly incorporate the mixture. This step may take a while, but it's very important. You need to mix it thoroughly so that it's not grainy. You may need to keep mixing it for a few minutes.








Some people add a tiny bit of water to help get Kool-Aid dissolved.
If you add water, you may need to pour some of it back out or add in some extra petroleum jelly after stirring it for a bit.

, You may need a small funnel for this step. You'll also need several small containers to put the lip gloss in. You can find small screw-top containers at the drug store in the travel section, and you may also be able to find some at the craft store. Divide up the liquid into as many containers as it takes.Spoon it from the top, as it will be less grainy at the top.You can also pour from the top, leaving the Kool-Aid sediment in the bottom.

",How to Make Kool Aid Lip Gloss2," Put 2 tablespoons (29.6 ml) of coconut oil in a small, microwave-safe bowl or cup. Stick it in the microwave. It will only take a few seconds to heat up and soften. Start with 5 seconds.You don't want the coconut oil as a liquid. You just want it to be softer.
If it's too solid to stir, heat it a little more.
If you're making a bigger batch, you can start with 1 cup of coconut oil.

, In a different small cup, pour in 1/2 a packet of Kool-Aid. You can use whatever kind you want. You just need to keep the color and flavor in mind. Add a bit of water. You don't need too much, just a little bit. Stir until it forms a thick paste.Make sure you get as much of the Kool-Aid dissolved as possible.
If it's not dissolving, add a little more water.

, Add a teaspoon of sugar to the Kool-Aid paste. Stir it in until the sugar dissolves. You may need to add a touch more water to help the sugar dissolve. The sugar takes away some of the bitterness, though you can use a sweetener instead., Bit by bit, add the Kool-Aid paste into the coconut oil. Keep adding until you get a color you like. Keep in mind that the color you see in the lip balm will be much lighter on your lips, so you may want to go a little darker than you'd think., Once you've got the desired color, spoon the lip gloss into little containers. You can find small twist-off containers at a drugstore or big box store in the travel toiletries section or at your local craft store.,"

Microwave a spoonful of honey.,

Switch to a heavier oil for extra moisture.,
Flavor the scrub with vanilla extract.,
Add essential oils cautiously.",How to Make Honey Lip Scrub," Start with 1 tbsp (15mL) honey. Microwave it for about 20 seconds, until the honey is mostly liquid.This makes it easy and fast to mix in the sugar.;
, Stir in 1 tsp (5mL) oil to keep your lip scrub smooth and help moisturize your lips. Olive oil, jojoba oil, and almond oil are popular options that keep the lip scrub light.







, Stir in 2 tsp (10mL) sugar, an exfoliant that scrapes away dead skin. Most people prefer brown sugar, which can be a little softer than white granulated sugar. If you have sensitive or sore lips, use superfine (caster) sugar instead, which has extra-small, gentle grains.









Your lips themselves carry very little dead skin.A little exfoliation might help, especially if the skin around your lips is flaky, but moisturizing is often more important.This scrub does both.
If all of your sugar dissolves, just add in more until the mixture is a little gritty.

, Dip a clean finger or cotton swab into the scrub, making sure you pick up some sugar grains. Gently rub this over your lips for about 10 seconds.Some of the sugar might dissolve, while other grains will sit on top of your lips.







, Exfoliation should only take a few seconds, but the scrub can also moisturize your lips and soothe cracks and sores.

, We won't tell anyone if you decide to lick it off instead. Once it's gone, check out your lips in the mirror. Hopefully, they look fresher and feel smoother.









If you're looking to keep your lips moisturized long-term, apply homemade lip balm after rinsing.

, An old eyeshadow or lip balm case will work perfectly, although sterilizing is recommended to avoid germs.Depending on how fresh your oil was, this usually lasts about one or two weeks in the fridge before it becomes moldy or rancid.


If the honey crystallizes, just place the container in a shallow bowl of hot tap water until the honey melts.
Honey is a natural preservative, making this safer than most homemade scrubs.It is much less effective when diluted, so don't expect an oil-heavy recipe to last too long., There are many variations on this recipe, and it all comes down to personal needs. If you're not satisfied with the scrub, try these changes:









If your lips are extra-dry, add another 2 tsp (10mL) oil.If your lips are sore or rubbed raw, mix in more honey until the scrub feels soft against your lips.
If your lips still feel flaky after scrubbing, try a lip balm first. You can try to add more sugar to the scrub instead, but this can backfire by making your lips raw and damaged.

, Shea butter or coconut oil contain beneficial fats that add smoothness and flexibility to skin and lips.Whip the product to make it smoother, then stir 1 tsp (5mL) into your lip scrub — or replace the oil completely.If these feel too greasy to you, try jojoba oil or another light, extra-moisturizing oil.
Petroleum jelly's not a great choice for a lip scrub, since the lips won't absorb it.It's better in a lip balm, where it sits on top of your lips and stops moisture from evaporating.

, Is it possible to make sugar and honey even more delicious? Answer the question by stirring in ⅛ tsp (0.6mL) vanilla extract, or another food-safe extract.









These extracts do contain alcohol, which can dry out your lips., Essential oils can add a great scent and possible health benefits, but many can burn your lips or even poison you if ingested.Check with a doctor or an experienced herbalist before adding one to your lip balm. If you do find a safe option, just stir in two or three drops (or 1–2 drops per tbsp/15mL of lip scrub).Lavender, sweet orange, and green mandarin essential oils are typically safe for lips.Peppermint, spearmint, cornmint, and tea tree oils are popular choices, but should never be used on young children. Overuse can also dry out your lips.""Synthetic Flavor Oils"" are non-natural alternatives that are generally safe for lips."

Fill the container with cocoa lip balm.",How to Make Cocoa Lip Balm," Use your spoon to scoop 3 tablespoons of cocoa powder into your bowl. Make sure the bowl is safe to microwave.Choose a high quality cocoa powder and be sure that you're not using bars of chocolate or hot cocoa mix. These contain additional ingredients that could make your lip balm spoil or go bad.;
, Take the same spoon you used for the cocoa powder and measure out 5 tablespoons of petroleum jelly. Add the petroleum jelly to the cocoa powder in your bowl.Use your finger or another spoon to scoop out all of the petroleum jelly from the measuring spoon since it may stick to the sides.
You could substitute coconut oil, shea butter, or mango butter for the petroleum jelly.

, Use a spoon to stir together the cocoa and petroleum jelly until they're completely combined. Don't worry if the mixture looks lumpy and dry in spots when you start stirring. It will smooth out if you keep mixing., Place the mixture in the microwave and heat it for 30 seconds. You should use low heat so that the petroleum jelly melts slowly. Your cocoa lip balm is now ready to be poured into a container.If you don't want to microwave the mixture, you could melt it in a double boiler over low heat.
If your petroleum jelly doesn't melt after 30 seconds, continue microwaving it for 10 seconds at a time until it does melt.

, Fill a small pan with an inch of water and heat it over medium. Set a small glass jar in the pan, but make sure that you don't get any water inside the jar. The jar should be able to hold at pint-size (8 ounces) or smaller.You could use a mason or jelly jar.

, While the water is heating, place your ingredients inside the jar in the pan. The medium heat will slowly melt your ingredients. Put these inside your jar to create enough balm to fill about 18 tubes with lip balm:2 tablespoons cocoa butter
2 tablespoons coconut oil
1 tablespoon beeswax

, Once the cocoa butter, coconut oil, and beeswax have melted, stir them till they're completely combined. Turn off the heat, but leave the jar in the hot water.You want the mixture in the jar to cool while it's still in the pan. This will safely bring it to room temperature before you try handling it.

, On its own, your lip balm won't have an overly strong cocoa flavor. To bring out the cocoa flavor, you can add 20 drops of cocoa essential oil. If you're having a hard time finding cocoa essential oil or you'd like to add a different flavor, you can swap out a different essential oil. For example, try using 20 drops of peppermint essential oil.You can usually find essential oils at health stores, natural food stores, and online.

, You can find small circular lip balm containers from some beauty supply stores or craft stores. These come with tight-fitting lids. You could also use small mask jars or travel-size cosmetic bottles.


If you want to make miniature lip balm containers, try filling upturned metal beer bottle lids with lip balm. Just remember that these don't come with lids so you'll need to use them quickly or cover them with plastic wrap.

, Choose a standard candy bar wrapper and remove the chocolate. Take the wrapper and open it up so that it's completely unfolded. Cut off the sides and back of the wrapper so you're only left with the front of the wrapper.You can eat the chocolate and discard the back and sides of the wrapper.

, Take your lip balm container and place it on the back of the wrapper. Use a marking pen to trace around the sides of the lip balm container.If you want to make more than decorated one lip balm container, trace as many patterns as you can fit on the wrapper.

, Take the lip balm container off of the wrapper. Using scissors, cut the wrapper along the pattern that you traced. Try to cut as smoothly and evenly as possible.Be careful when using sharp scissors. Take care not to cut yourself.

, Use a glue stick and rub glue on the back of the wrapper design that you just cut out. Take the lid of your container and apply wrapper design so that the glue sticks to the lid.Rub your fingers over the lid to remove any air bubbles.

, Use spoon and fill the container with your prepared cocoa lip balm if you used petroleum jelly. Or, use a glass dropper to fill the containers if you used coconut oil. You can fill the containers right to the top. Let a lip balm made with coconut oil set for a few hours. Cover your cocoa lip balms with your decorated lids and they're ready to use!You could also scoop the prepared cocoa lip balm into a plastic sandwich bag, cut a small corner off, and squeeze the balm into your lip balm container.
Be aware that the cocoa lip balm made with petroleum jelly will be very soft and won't harden much like purchased lip balms. If you used coconut oil instead of petroleum jelly, it will harden up more, especially if you refrigerate it.

Use your body wash. You can use this as any other store-bought body wash. Be sure to shake it each time before you use it, as the ingredients will settle.

",How to Make Body Wash3," For this body wash, you will need 2 cups (450 milliliters) of unscented liquid Castile soap, 1 cup (225 milliliters) of rose water, 3 tablespoons of melted coconut oil, and 15-20 drops lavender essential oil. You will also need a quart-sized mason jar for mixing the body wash.


If you do not have rose water, you can make you own by adding 12 drops of rose oil to 1 cup (225 milliliters) of distilled water, and mixing.After you have mixed your body wash, you can transfer it into smaller bottles or old body wash containers.

, Unlike most oils, coconut oil is very thick and solid. You will need to soften it before you can use it in this recipe. You can do this by heating it in the microwave for a few seconds or warming it in a double boiler.

, You can transfer all of your ingredients into a smaller container later.


If you are mixing your own rose water, you will need to do that first in a separate container before adding it to the coconut oil, essential oil, and soap.

, Keep shaking until all of the ingredients are combined.

, The quart-sized mason jar might be cumbersome to handle to the shower. You can pour your body wash into smaller containers, such as mini mason jars, small glass bottles, or even old body wash bottles. If your new container has a small mouth, such as a bottle, then you can place a funnel over the mouth of the small container first before pouring in the body wash. The funnel will make sure that everything goes into the new container and that nothing gets spilt or goes to waste.

, You can leave the smaller containers as they are, or you can give them a personal touch by embellishing them with labels, twine, and other decorations. You can even pour the body wash into tiny bottles and use them as party favors. Here are some decorating ideas:


Print out a label and stick it on the bottle or jar.
Tie a piece of twine or ribbon around the jar lid.
Decorate the bottle or jar with gemstones. You can glue them on using hot glue or purchase stick-on gemstones.
Decorate the cork or lid. You can paint the jar lid with acrylic paint. You can also decorate the lid or cork by hot gluing rhinestones and fancy buttons onto it.

, You want to use something that won't leave a ponytail indent on your hair while you sleep.,, Depending on how thick your hair is, you will only want to wrap it once or twice. The ponytail needs to be loose so it doesn't indent the curls. Don't worry if it's loose.


Note: If you have short curly hair you may want to do two pineapple pigtails instead of one. Otherwise, most of your curls won't make it into the pineapple!

Clip it: If your hair is very long, it is probably flopping around in your face by this point. Take some medium sized claw clips and clip the pony to the top of your head. This will keep the hair from flopping around while you sleep.

Wear a sleeping cap: Another option is to just pull a satin sleep cap over your pineapple. This will keep the curls in place and protect your hair from frizz while sleeping.

, Use your towel to remove water from your hair by gently squeezing your hair in sections rather than harshly ruffling it dry. Patting your hair dry helps prevent excess frizz from occurring after showering.

, You should apply it when your hair is wet because it allows you to evenly spread the serum around your hair without creating clumps. Comb your hair with a wide-toothed comb after applying.


Products with Obliphica Berry, argon nut oil, Moroccan oil, or coconut oil are thought to help keep hair straight throughout the day. Products with silicone will also help to keep your hair straight.

, You want your hair to be as dry as possible when straightening. Not only will this allow your flat iron to work better, it will also prevent you hair from being shocked by the heat and breaking off.


Point the hair dryer downward with the flow of your hair while blow-drying. This downward motion away from your roots encourages your hair to dry straight.
Set your hair dryer on the lowest heat setting. If you have particularly frizzy hair, drying your hair on a lower heat setting for a longer period of time will prevent your hair from puffing up as you dry it.

, There will also be a numbered heat setting near the ""on"" switch that you can adjust to your desired heat level. The thicker and frizzier your hair, the higher the numbered setting should be. If your hair is particularly thin and brittle make sure to set your straightener to the lowest number to avoid damaging your hair.

, The number of sections will depend on the thickness of your hair. The key is to make sections one to two inches thick so that they can easily pass through the straightener.


Pin or clip the sections you are not using out of the way as you straighten each individual section.
An easy way to do this is to pin all of the sections that you are not using on the top of your head or behind your shoulders. Then take each individual section in front of your shoulder to straighten it.

, This will usually mean that your straightener will start about an inch from your scalp.

, Be sure not to clamp too firmly, as this will create a ridge in the top of the hair section where you start straightening. Additionally, be sure not to hold the flat iron in the same spot for too long, as doing so will also cause a ridge to form in your hair.

, Your motion should be a fluid and steady sweep from the roots to the ends. The most important part of this technique is that you don't hold the straightener in any one place for too long. Doing so can damage your hair and create undesirable folds.

, Depending on the thickness of your hair, you may only have to do this once, or you may have to run the straightener over a section of hair several times.


The strength of your flat iron will also determine how many times you will have to run over a particular section of hair.
The lower the heating setting on the flat iron, the more times you will have to run your straightener over a particular section of hair.
Don't be alarmed if you see steam rising from the flat iron. Steam occurs as a result of the hot ceramic making contact with any leftover moisture in your hair. If you start to smell burning hair, however, turn down the heat setting on the flat iron immediately.

, It is generally easiest to move around your head from one side to the other rather than taking random chunks so that you can easily separate the straightened chunks from the non-straightened ones. You may need to brush each section before straightening it if it got tangled while pinned.


If your hair is prone to frizz, apply a hair spray or setting serum to each section immediately after you straighten it.
Avoid getting any product on sections of hair that you have not straightened yet. Product can negatively interfere with the straightening process, causing damage to your hair or to your flat iron.

, Blow-dry your hair for another minute carefully to set your straightened hair. You can use a thick brush to guide your hair in a straight motion if you prefer.

, Anti-frizz serum that contains silicone is especially effective at keeping hair straight after flat ironing., If you live in a climate prone to random bouts of moisture, carry an umbrella with you in case it starts to rain or mist heavily. External moisture will cause your hair to become frizzy again.

Find one that has multiple heat settings, so that you can experiment and find the heat setting that best straightens your hair.Your flatiron should last about ten years, but you don't want one that has been around since the Dark Ages.
Curly-haired girls will want to look for gold or titanium plated flatiron, because these are better for your hair.;
, You want one that has wider plates that range in size from one and a half inches to two inches wide. This lets you cover more surface area in less time.You should also be wary of the weight of your flatiron. You're going to be dragging it through your hair frequently and straightening takes time. You're not trying to end up looking like a bodybuilder because your flatiron is too heavy.

, When you straighten your hair, especially hair that is thick and curly, you need to wash it first. This prepares your hair for the straighten process. It's good to use gentle products because you're about to put your hair through a process that is tough on it.


Use a smoothing conditioner to get your hair on the right track before you begin straightening it.

, It's best to use a microfiber towel or a t-shirt as a towel. These are gentler on the hair cuticle and lead to less frizz when you have thick curly hair.


Getting your hair to the damp stage before blow-drying it means that you spend less time blow-drying it so that it isn't as damaged as it could be.

, You're looking for something that helps to product your hair while you're straightening. Because of the oils in this product you need to apply it two and a half inches from your scalp.








A little goes a long way, so use only a very small amount (little more than a drop of product).
Apply from the bottom of your hair up, using your fingers as a comb.
If absolutely possible, find a heat protector that doesn't have oils or silicone and can protect your hair from frizz.

, Because you can burn your hair if you try to straighten it when it's wet or damp you need to blow-dry it first. With a round-bristle brush pull your hair as flat and as straight as possible while you blow-dry it.









Alternate between your blow-dryer's hot and cool settings so that you are in less danger of overheating your hair.
Remember that this can take awhile when you have thick, curly hair. You really do want to make sure your hair is completely dry before you start to straighten it.
Keep the nozzle facing downwards as you blow-dry to cut down on frizz.

Section your hair.,
Pick the right heat setting.,
Straighten the bottom sections of your hair first.,
Avoid going over the same sections more than once.,
Finish up with some smoothing product.","How to Straighten Thick, Curly Hair Without Damaging It2"," This does not mean that you are randomly grabbing fistfuls and hair and trying to straighten those. When you have sections that are too thick the iron can't straighten them properly and you will need to reapply heat which is more likely to cause damage to your hair.









When you create sections it is easier to keep track of your progress. So split your hair into the middle at the back and bring it forward. This gives you two sections. Because you're trying to straighten thick, curly hair you'll need to separate it into at least four sections. Two on top and two on the bottom.
Make sure the rest of the sections are clipped out of the way when you are working on one of them.

, Because your hair is thicker and curlier you're going to need a higher heat setting. While you still probably won't want to go all the way up to 450 degrees, you'll need to do a little experimenting to see what temperature works best to straighten your hair.


If your hair is color treated as well as thick and curly you will need to stay in the safer zone of 300 degrees to 350 degrees.

, You want to clip the top two sections on the top of your head so they're out of the way. Divide the two sections you've already created on the bottom part of your hair into smaller sections, about one to two inches wide.








Use a comb or brush to pull a section of hair as taut as possible with your one hand, while smoothing your flatiron along that section with the other hand.
You start at the roots of your hair and move the ends of your hair in one fluid smoothing motion.

, This rule isn't set in stone, especially for thick, curly hair, but the more you avoid going over your sections more than once, the less damaged your hair is going to be in the long run.

, This will give you the smooth, polished look and cut down on frizz as much as possible. It's good to have a smoothing product that resists humidity, if you're living in a place where that's an issue.









Serums are the best choice for thick hair.
It's also a good idea to apply it to your hair after it's cooled down from the straightening process. Coat a brush with product and brush it through your hair for an even application.

If this happens then the best thing to do is add a little volumizing spray to your hair to perk it up a bit.








, Frizz is the bane of every curly girl's existence. This is especially true if you live somewhere that has lots of rain or humidity. Product is your friend. Use it.


There is some debate about silicon based serums. Some say they are the best thing ever and some people swear that they make their hair too greasy. You'll have to decide what works best for you, silicone or no silicone.

, This can make your hair a lot more manageable when you're straightening it and it will help you to get those pesky back portions of your hair.

, Two things can cause your hair to sizzle when you're straightening it. One, your hair is not completely dry. If this is the case, cease with the straightening and get with the drying.








If your hair is perfectly dry it could be that there is excess product build-up in your hair. Make sure that you're selective about which products you put in your hair (it's a good idea to avoid alcohol based products).

Avoid sulfates in your shampoos.,
Avoid silicones, waxes, non-natural oils, or any other non-soluble ingredients in your conditioners and any styling products.,
Avoid drying alcohols, if at all possible, in your conditioners and stylers.,
Consider the effect proteins in your hair products may have on your hair.,
Write down the rules for identifying curly girl products on a piece of paper and keep it with you when you go hair product shopping.,
Go shopping and practice identifying CG products.",How to Determine if a Hair Product is Curly Girl Approved," Sulfates are foaming detergents that are found in many commercial shampoos and dish detergents. They can be drying for curly hair, so choose sulfate free shampoos if you are going to use shampoo. Sulfates contain ""sulfate"" somewhere in the ingredient name (usually). Also keep in mind that there are some cleansers that are as harsh as sulfates but are not sulfates. Technically, you want to avoid shampoo altogether to retain the most moisture, but if you decide to use a shampoo, avoiding sulfates is best.


Here is a list of sulfates to avoid:

Alkylbenzene sulfonates
Alkyl Benzene Sulfonate
Ammonium laureth sulfate
Ammonium lauryl sulfate
Ammonium Xylenesulfonate
Sodium C14-16 Olefin Sulfonate
Sodium cocoyl sarcosinate
Sodium laureth sulfate
Sodium lauryl sulfate
Sodium lauryl sulfoacetate
Sodium myreth sulfate
Sodium Xylenesulfonate
TEA-dodecylbenzenesulfonate
Ethyl PEG-15 cocamine sulfate
Dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate


Here is a list of gentle cleansers to look for:

Cocamidopropyl betaine
Coco betaine

Disodium cocoamphodipropionate
Lauroamphoacetate
Sodium cocoyl isethionate
behentrimonium methosulfate
disodium lautreth sulfosuccinate
babassuamidopropyl betaine

;
, This is key to making sure your products do not build up on your hair. Without shampoo, many of the following ingredients will build up in your hair over time. Remember that a silicone is any ingredient that ends with the suffixes -one, -conol, or -xane. Waxes are easily identified because they have ""wax"" in the ingredient name (usually).

Here is a list of silicones to avoid:

Dimethicone
Bis-aminopropyl dimethicone
Cetearyl methicone
Cetyl Dimethicone
Cyclopentasiloxane
Stearoxy Dimethicone
Stearyl Dimethicone

Phenyl trimethicone


Here is a list of waxes and non-natural oils to avoid:

Mineral oil (paraffinum liquidum)
Petrolatum
Waxes: bees wax, candelilla wax, etc.


Here's a list of ingredients that look like silicones, or are water soluble silicones. These are exceptions that are OK:

Lauryl methicone copolyol (water soluble)
Lauryl PEG/PPG-18/18 Methicone
Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein Hydroxypropyl Polysiloxane (water soluble)
Dimethicone Copolyol (water soluble)
PEG-Dimethicone, or any other 'cone with ""PEG-"" suffix (water soluble)
Emulsifying Wax

Benzophenone-2, ( or 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10) - sunscreen
Methychloroisothiazolinone - preservative
Methylisothiazolinone - preservative



, Drying alcohols are commonly found in conditioners, leave in conditioners, gels, mousses, and hairsprays as fillers. For products that you are going to rinse out, this is not as big of a deal, but for products that are going to sit in your hair all day, or for several days, they should not contain drying alcohols. There are also moisturizing or fatty alcohols however, that sound similar, so be sure not to confuse those with drying alcohols.

Here is a list of drying alcohols to avoid:

Denatured alcohol
SD alcohol 40
Witch hazel
Isopropanol
Ethanol
SD alcohol
Propanol
Propyl alcohol
Isopropyl alcohol


Here is a list of moisturizing alcohols to look for:

Behenyl alcohol
Cetearyl alcohol
Cetyl alcohol
Isocetyl alcohol
Isostearyl alcohol
Lauryl alcohol
Myristyl alcohol
Stearyl alcohol
C30-50 Alcohols
Lanolin alcohol



, Most hair needs some amount of protein in its diet, especially damaged hair. However, normal hair, or protein sensitive hair does not need large doses of protein all the time. If your hair feels stiff, frizzy, and dry, then your hair is getting to much protein.

Here is a list of proteins that you can avoid or look for, depending on your hair type:

Cocodimonium hydroxypropyl hydrolyzed casein
Cocodimonium hydroxypropyl hydrolyzed collagen
Cocodimonium hydroxypropyl hydrolyzed hair keratin
Cocodimonium hydroxypropyl hydrolyzed keratin
Cocodimonium hydroxypropyl hydrolyzed rice protein
Cocodimonium hydroxypropyl hydrolyzed silk

Find a good stylist first.,
Realize that you don't need to shampoo everyday, but do condition every time you are in the shower.,
Wash with cold water.,
Dry-brushing is a common cause of frizziness.,
Don't use too much product.,
Use a product straight out of the shower, when your hair is still wet.,
Choose to air dry or blow dry.,
Detoxify your hair about once a month.,
Don't fight the curl!",How to Care for Naturally Curly or Wavy Thick Hair," Ask if they know anything about the technique of ""twist-cutting"", which is great for curly hair. Ask your friends, strangers, someone whose hair you admire, etc. It's best to get recommendations from people who have the same hair type as yours.When you visit the salon also ask for a more experienced person, it may cost a little more but it is worth it.;
, Choose a shampoo and conditioner that leaves your hair feeling good to you. You don't want hair that was washed and still feels like you have product left or leaves it feeling dry even if it isn't.

, Cold water helps making hair shinier, locks in moisture,and reduces frizz.

, Unless you're blow drying your hair straight, use your fingers to comb your dry hair.

, With a styling milk, gel or mousse, put some into your palm and rub your palms together. The product will warm up as you rub and distribute better by not making a blob on one spot. You want to evenly distribute the product through your hair, so you will need to use more if you have longer hair.

, This will 'trap' the moisture and get you thick, moisture-rich curls. When your hair dries, if you look like you have smothered your hair with gel and don't care for that look, take your towel and sort of scrunch your dry hair. This will take the 'wet rat' look out of your hair and leave it 'natural looking' (cotton t-shirts work well; they absorb the moisture, but don't leave frizzy hair; paper towels can also be used).

, Try them both out. Blow drying completely dry can cause frizzies, but a diffuser attachment can prevent this. You may also find that if you stop before it's completely dry that will also tame the frizzies. Try to air dry on the weekends or at night.

, Your hair is one of the most absorbent and dirtiest parts of your body. Think of the smog, pollution, germs from sneezes and coughs, smoke, etc. that you encounter every day. All of this can get trapped in your hair. If you smoke or someone around you does, your hair will trap and smell like smoke. So even if you choose to live with the frizz and not use anything in your hair, please use a detoxifier once in a while. It will help your hair.

, This is one of the worst things you can do. Put down the straightening creams, flat irons, and blow dryers. Embrace your spirals!

Clarify with a shampoo (for the last time) before beginning.,
Throw out your shampoo!,
Buy silicone free conditioners and styling products.,
Have your hair trimmed.",How to Follow the Curly Girl Method for Curly Hair1," This will cleanse your hair of any silicones – ingredients in some hair products that are not water soluble (see the Warnings section below). You do not have to buy a new shampoo for this step, just use something lying around the house. Sulfate containing and sulfate free shampoos will both work to remove most silicones.But to be safe, it's best to use a sulfate containing shampoo for your last wash.



;
, Most shampoos contain harsh, drying sulfates that are extremely damaging for curly hair (ammonium laureth sulfate, ammonium lauryl sulfate, sodium laureth sulfate, sodium lauryl sulfate, etc.). These common detergents found in shampoos make curly hair frizzy and uncooperative.Conditioner can be used sufficiently to clean the hair in a much more gentle manner. If you cannot let go of shampoo, use a more gentle shampoo that contains mild cleansers (i.e. cocamidopropyl betaine or coco betaine).







""You'd never dream of washing a good sweater with detergent. Yet most shampoos contain harsh detergents (sodium lauryl sulfate or laureth sulfate) that one also finds in dish washing liquid. They're great for pots and pans because they cut grease so effectively. Your hair, on the other hand, needs to retain some natural oils, which protect your hair and scalp. Stripping them away deprives the hair of necessary moisture and amino acids and makes it look dry and dull."" - Lorraine Massey
To the bottom is an image of a shampoo and a bottle of dish detergent. Above, the same sulfate is circled in their ingredients list.


, You will probably want a conditioner for washing your scalp, a thick moisturizing conditioner to moisturize the length of your hair, and a conditioner to leave in during the day. You can use the same conditioner or different ones. You will also want any serums, gels, or mousses, but keep in mind these all need to be free of silicones. (You may also want a sulfate free shampoo if you spend a lot of time in chlorine.) For more information about getting the right ingredients check out the tips section or read How to Determine if a Hair Product is Curly Girl Approved.





, This will get rid of any damage or split ends. If you don't want to visit a hair salon you can always trim your own, of course.

Choose a conditioner for curly hair.,
Apply the conditioner.,
Let the conditioner sit for five to twenty minutes.,
Rinse your hair with cool water.,
Use a leave-in product (optional).,
Let your hair air dry.,
Turn heat-styling tools to their lowest setting.",How to Condition Curly Hair1," Don’t just use a conditioner made for straight hair--it won’t help your curly hair repair damage and maintain its natural shape. Look at the label and make sure it’s formulated for curly hair.Light formulas with mild moisturizers are best for looser curls and oily hair.
Tight curls or kinks will usually need a cream conditioner.
Dry curls will need a conditioner with heavy moisturizers or oils.
For damaged curls, buy a conditioner especially for damaged hair.;
, Curly hair tends to see the most dryness and damage at the ends, so focus on conditioning the ends and then work your way up towards the roots. Use more on the ends, and very little at the roots--this will help maintain your hair’s natural shape by preventing oily buildup at the roots., Keep the conditioner in your hair for at least five minutes. You can increase the time to fifteen or twenty minutes if your hair is badly damaged or unusually dry.

, Rinse out your hair thoroughly, using cool water to lock in your hair’s natural oils. Run your fingers or a wide-tooth comb through your hair to detangle it while rinsing.

, Many companies make leave-in conditioners or hair masks especially for curly hair. These can give your hair additional protection and make managing your curly hair a little easier. Apply according to the package directions, leave in, and style your hair as usual., Air drying is the best way to prevent damage and frizz to curly hair. If you normally rely on blow drying to help style your hair, try other methods to curl or straighten your hair., Too much heat can damage your curly hair! If you use a curler, straightener, or hot comb, set it to the lowest temperature possible. If you use a curler, get a wide diameter one to prevent overusing it on your hair."

Let your curls get used to the cut and then decide whether you want to return to that stylist or not.,
Don't get them trimmed regularly.,
Don't turn to the straightening iron, whatever your hair stylist tells you.",How to Get a Haircut for Curly Hair," Haircuts depend on your face structure, how thick your hair is, the health of your hair, etc. With that said, all one length is the safest way to go if you have no idea what you want, but you are unlikely to reach your hair's full potential that way. Short layers may work well on one head of curls, while long layers may be the solution to another head! Ay ay ay! What's the solution you ask?
, A hairstylist is more likely to be experienced if: they have well maintained curls themselves, they have been cutting all types of hair curls for a long time, or they have been specially trained to cut curls. It's best to look for a combination of these traits in your curly hair stylist. Let's get started on the process., Did you know 65 percent of women in the US have curly hair? Amazing! Get out there and ask your friends, co-workers, your neighbors, etc. where they get their curls cut. If your friends have fabulous curls, you'll be able to get the skinny on their hairstylist too., Unless you want to cut your hair yourself (which isn't always a bad idea), you don't have to study the methods intensely, but you should have a general understanding so you can make educated decisions about stylists.

First, curly hair can be cut wet or dry. Proponents of dry cuts base their method on the idea that curls dry much differently than virtually, straightened out wet hair. The DevaCurl company teaches the DevaCut, which is given dry, and emphasizes the ""S"" shape of the curl.
Proponents of wet cuts state that the hair is easier and faster to work with. The Ouidad company teaches the Carve n' Slice cut, which involves running scissors vertically through wet hair. Some stylists use a combination of methods and dry or wet hair cutting.

, This is a fun, impersonal way to find a hair stylist. Your best bet is to go for the stylist with the most positive reviews, but remember to take everything stated with a grain of salt. Personal opinions from friends or online users can often be under-exaggerated or over-exaggerated. Some salon finder sites are suggested below under ""Tips""., If you're not set on getting your hair cut by a certain stylist, you can schedule a consultation, where you just sit down and talk with the hairdresser. Or if that's too much hassle, you can spring for a cut!, Come in with your hair done the way you usually wear it curly, not thrown up into a bun, so they can assess the state of your hair. If you want something specific, come in with pictures of the cut you want, keeping in mind they won't be able to replicate it exactly if your curls and bone structure are different. Be firm throughout the haircut and mention things you want, for example: a cut you can style straight or curly, a cut that can be put up in layers, bangs or no bangs, etc., Be friendly and try to keep a conversation going., Once it's done, make sure you like how it looks and if not, ask for a few last minute alterations. You're paying for their service and it's better to fix things now rather than later., Change stylists boldly, and without hesitation., Your hair grows about 1/2 an inch a month, so getting half an inch cut off per month is the reason that your curly hair never seems to be growing., It damages your curls and you'll never seem to get enough of it. You'll keep straightening and straightening until your hair is fried."

Wash your scalp with conditioner (conditioner washing).,
Distribute conditioner throughout all of your hair and untangle gently.,
Do the final rinse of your hair with cool or cold water.,
Apply products to your hair.,
Gently scrunch your hair with a t-shirt, paper towels, or a micro-fiber towel to remove excess moisture.,
Decrease the drying time of your hair by plopping.Spread an old t-shirt or micro-fiber towel onto a flat surface (such as the toilet with seat down).,
Dry your hair.",How to Follow the Curly Girl Method for Curly Hair2," Begin your routine by wetting your hair in the shower. Distribute conditioner on your entire scalp and massage your scalp with the tips of your fingers (not your fingernails). This rubbing action and the resulting friction will loosen dirt, product residue, and dandruff which can then be rinsed away. (Be sure to avoid silicone in your hair products, see the Warnings.) Thoroughly rinse your scalp afterwards, still massaging with your fingertips as you do so.Depending on how dry your scalp is, you can conditioner wash, once a week, twice a week, or every day.







""The curly-haired can leave their hair hydrated with natural oils and clean their scalps quite well by rinsing only with hair conditioner once a week or less. Rubbing the scalp firmly with fingers is enough to loosen dirt."" - Lorraine Massey

, Use your hands or a wide-toothed comb. Start by untangling bottom sections of your hair and then gradually move upwards. Let the conditioner sit in your hair for five minutes or so for extra moisture.






You also may want to part your hair at this point with a comb. It's recommended that you part your hair to the side to prevent ""triangle-shaped"" hair.
If it is difficult to untangle your hair this way, remember to use a large quantity of conditioner when wet or you may need to trim dead ends
Untangling hair while dry with any tool is not a good idea; separating the curls dry just causes more frizz and lots of damage.

, This will decrease frizz and add shine. Leave some conditioner in your hair, especially in dry sections like the ends. It's fine to run your fingers through your hair gently, but do not comb your hair after this point.





, Do this while your hair is soaking wet if you have curlier hair, but wait five minutes or so if you have medium to wavy curly hair. Put product in your hands and rub them together to emulsify. Then, smooth or rake the product into your hair by sections. A common method is to begin with a leave-in cream or conditioner to decrease frizz and then follow with a gel or mousse for hold and definition. (Using your normal conditioner as a leave-in is fine too. Some prefer curl creams or just conditioner for softer curls, however these products will not help the hair last as well for second day hair. Use whatever type and order of products you like (as long as they are silicone free). Next, finger shape the curls by scrunching them (cup your hair in the palms of your hands and scrunch in an upward motion) and/or twisting individual curls around a finger.





, A generic terrycloth towel will make your hair frizzy. You may wish to finger shape your curls at this time instead. Next, wait five or so minutes so the hair can assume a permanent shape.





, Bend over at the waist and position your hair in the middle of the cloth. With your head touching the cloth, drape the back section of cloth over your head. Twist the sides until they form ""sausage rolls"" and clip or tie them at the base of your neck. You can also use the sleeves of a long sleeve t-shirt to secure. After 15-30 minutes remove the cloth. If your hair is frizzy after plopping lightly graze the hair with gel.





Plopping works best for medium to long length curly hair. The curls usually become weirdly squished after plopping in shorter hair. See How to Plop Your Hair for more info as well.

, Air drying is the easiest and gentlest way to dry your hair. If you must blow dry your hair use a diffuser to avoid frizz. Only dry your hair partially (about 80 percent dry) and air-dry the rest of the way.Do not touch your hair while it is drying or it will mess up and frizz. Both types of diffusers work well in terms of diffusing and decreasing frizz:






A bowl diffuser with fingers causes more volume and clumping (curls sticking together instead of going every which way), is bulky and heavier, and will probably only fit on the hairdryer it comes with. Place a section of hair in the bowl and press the bowl to your head. Then turn on the ""warm"" setting of your blow dryer. Press the cool shot if your head gets too hot.
A sock diffuser is lightweight, fits on any hair dryer, and is portable. Aim the diffuser at different parts of your hair while you scrunch your hair with your hands. Stop scrunching when your hair is about 50% dry."

",How to Follow the Curly Girl Method for Curly Hair3," Not all hair dressers were created equal, so ask your stylist in advance if they are experienced in cutting curly hair and what products they are going to use on your hair. Unplanned haircuts can be disastrous for curly hair. If their products contains silicones, you may want to insist on bringing your own. If your hairstylist uses a razor to thin out your hair it will make your ends ratty and prone to split ends. Remember, it takes a skilled hairdresser to successfully cut layers or other haircuts in curly hair.





, A 1/2-inch or 1/4-inch trim is usually enough to get rid of split ends. Long, rounded layers are more suited to curly hair--short layers tend to stick up and look funny. Curly hair usually consists of a combination of textures, with the crown being the curliest part. For this reason it's hard to tell what dry curly hair looks like when wet – consider having your hair cut dry. Also, take into account that curly hair is much shorter when dry than wet. You may lose only two inches while wet, but that could be four or five while dry!





, It takes 2 to 6 weeks for your hair to adjust to the no shampoo and it may even look worse at first. Hair is a long-term project and it may take a couple weeks for it to regain its health after being stripped of moisture for years by shampoo.

Choose the right oil for your hair.,
Heat up your oil with warm water.,
Protect your clothing.,
Rub the oil into your hair from the ends up.,
Let the oil saturate your hair for five to twenty minutes.,
Rinse your hair with cold water.",How to Condition Curly Hair2," Oils are a natural way to condition your curly hair without using chemicals or risking product buildup. What kind of oil is best for you depends on your hair texture and your own preferences.Jojoba oil is an extra-light oil that feels less greasy than other options. It’s good for all curly hair, but is especially useful for light curls.
Coconut oil is excellent at penetrating hair to restore strength, and is ideal for African-American hair.
Olive oil or grapeseed oil are medium-thickness oils good for medium to tight curls. Olive oil has a strong scent that not everyone enjoys.

, Warm oil is easier to use on hair, but don’t heat it up in the microwave or on a stovetop--this can cause burns! Instead, put the oil container in a bowl of warm water until it feels warm on the outside., Oil can permanently mark clothes, so be sure to put on a hairdresser’s cape, apron, or rain poncho over your clothes before beginning., Use about 1 ounce (30 mL) to start, and increase if necessary. Start at the bottom of your hair and work upwards, rubbing the oil into your hair while using your fingers or a wide-tooth comb to detangle. Be careful not to spread oil directly on your scalp--this can clog your pores!, Allowing your hair to absorb the oil helps it retain nutrients and repair damage. Leave the oil in for about five minutes. If your hair is badly damaged, you can leave it in for up to twenty minutes., Cold water helps lock in oil treatments. Rinsing out oil may take much longer than rinsing out regular conditioner, so make sure you get all the oil out! Leaving your hair saturated in oil will make it appear greasy. Let your hair air-dry afterwards."

Apply any additional products.,
Repeat regularly!",How to Condition Curly Hair3," Deep conditioner helps tame extra-curly or frizzy hair. It’s especially good for treating damaged hair! Make sure your deep conditioner is made for curly hair--the best deep conditioners for your hair will have ingredients like shea butter, avocado oil, keratin, argan oil, and coconut oil. You can also buy deep conditioners with proteins to treat badly damaged hair--look for ingredients like hydrolyzed collagen, Panthenol, soybean protein, or glycoprotein., Work from the ends to the roots just like you do with regular conditioner.

, This is an optional step, but heat will open up the cuticles of your hair, allowing the conditioner to penetrate more deeply. Using blow dryers on your curly hair can damage it, so instead wet three or four hand towels with cold water, wring them out, and microwave until hot, about 1–2 minutes. Wrap the towels around your head and leave on for 5–10 minutes.

, Rinse your hair thoroughly with cool water to remove the conditioner. You can detangle your hair with your fingers or with a wide-tooth comb., Wash your hair as usual, with shampoo made for curly hair. Be sure to wash your hair in a downward motion before rinsing--this prevents tangles! You can use a regular conditioner afterward to help lock in the deep conditioning, but it isn't required., If you have long hair, divide it into 6–8 sections for more convenient handling. Detangle your hair with your fingers or a wide-toothed comb if necessary, but be gentle since wet hair is more vulnerable to damage.

, If you plan to use rollers, hair styling products, or a leave-in hair mask, go head and put them in now before letting your hair air-dry.

, Deep conditioners aren't made for everyday use, but you should be using them regularly. If your hair is very damaged, deep condition every week. If it's not, once a month is fine!"

Look for curl-defining shampoo and conditioner that helps to bring out the curl while also hydrating your hair to keep it shiny and strong., Using your fingers instead of a brush or comb will help your natural curls stay together, rather than pulling them apart. When you want your hair to look as curly as possible, your fingers are the best tools you can use to handle your hair.








, Use your fingers to gently pull apart strands of hair into separate sections, leaving your natural waves as intact as possible. Use a soft towel to blot each section of hair dry, starting at the roots and working down to the tips.









When you let your hair air dry without separating it into sections, the mass of wet hair tends to clump up as it dries instead of separating into well-defined curls.
Don't towel your hair dry roughly, since this can cause it to get frizzy. Just gently blot your hair dry to the tips.

, Instead of running it through your hair from the roots to the tips, rub some product between your palms and cup your hair from the bottom, gently scrunching each section of hair from the bottom and using your fingers to apply it to the length of your hair. This will help your curls stay bouncy instead of weighing them down.









Apply the product to each section separately for best results.
As you apply the product, squeeze your hair gently to help lift up the curls.

, After it has air-dried to the point where it's no longer dripping, flip your hair upside down. Use the diffuser attachment on your hair dryer to dry your hair in sections, pointing up from the bottom instead of drying from the top down. Lift the section you're drying onto the diffuser and gently push up with the diffuser to help define your curls. Continue section by section until your hair is mostly dry.









Drying your hair without the diffuser will blow out your curls, so make sure you use the attachment.
At this point, handle your hair with your fingers as little as possible; let the diffuser do the work. Handling your hair too much will lead to frizzing.

, This will keep your curls from falling out too quickly, especially if it's humid outside. To keep your curls lasting as long as possible, try not to touch your hair throughout the day. Avoid wearing a hat or using hair accessories that might weigh your hair down.

, Curly or kinky hair tends to be a little drier and coarser than straight hair. Since it has a spiral shape, the natural oils produced by the scalp don't make it all the way to the tips, resulting in hair that isn't naturally as conditioned as straight hair. Curlier hair requires a different sort of treatment from straighter hair, and that starts with washing it less often.








If you wash your hair every day, try cutting back to just two times a week and see if you notice that your curls are less dry.
Everyone's hair texture and oil level is a little different, so experiment and see what works for you. It might take a few weeks before you figure out how many times a week you need to wash your hair to keep it clean but also well conditioned.

, Many people with curly or kinky hair have switched from regular shampooing to the co-wash method. They have found that washing with conditioner instead of shampoo gets it just as clean without drying it out. Conditioner moisturizes coils and keeps them in good shape, rather than pulling them apart.


Look for a conditioner that does not contain silicones. These make your hair shiny at first, but eventually they build up and leave curls looking weighed down and dull.
If you choose to use shampoo, get one that's sulfate-free. Sulfates are a cleansing agent that dry out hair, and they wreak havoc on a curly head.

, There are so many deep conditioners on the market that it can be difficult to choose which one to buy. You can actually use your normal conditioner as a deep conditioner; just leave it in your hair for a few hours before rinsing it out. If you're up for experimenting, try adding different different deep conditioning treatments to find one that works with your curls. Here are a few common natural conditioners:









Honey. Mix 2 tablespoons of honey with 2 tablespoons of water. Work the mixture through your hair section by section. Let it sit for an hour, then rinse it out.
OIive oil or coconut oil. Work section by section to finger-comb the oil into your hair. Let it sit for an hour, then rinse it out.
Egg whites. An egg white rinse will leave your hair looking shiny and moisturized. Separate two eggs and stir the whites together. Dilute with a little water. Work the mixture into your hair section by section. Let it sit for an hour, then rinse.

, This seals your hair's cuticle so that your hair will stay hydrated even after your hair is dry.Working section by section, smooth your oil or finishing butter of choice into your curls, finger combing so that the curls stay intact. The following oils and butters are popular choices:


Argan oil
Shea butter
Cocoa butter
Creams that contain one of the above ingredients
Curl-defining serums

, The styling products you use have the potential to dry out your hair and create frizz. Before you use hair spray, gel, and other styling products, test them on just one small section of hair to see the results before you cover your entire head with it.

, If you have curly or kinky hair, particularly if you have tight coils, brushing your hair will separate it and leave you looking poofy and frizzy. This type of hair never really needs to be brushed. If you need to detangle your hair, finger-comb it section by section, or use a wide-tooth comb if you don't have tight coils.









If your hair is more wavy than curly, you can use a boar-bristle brush to brush your hair, but only when it's dry. A boar-bristle brush is made with bristles that are similar to the texture of your hair, so it won't damage your curls. It's used to help move your scalp's natural oils down the length of your hair.

, Curls are notoriously difficult to cut. When it's done the wrong way, you can end up with a style that just doesn't look right with your hair texture. Do some research to find a stylist who's experienced in cutting curly hair. Look online for reviews, or ask your curly-haired friends for a recommendation.


Tell the stylist you want to avoid triangle hair, and see what he or she says. Anyone experienced in cutting curly hair knows what this means. Triangle hair is when the heavy curls grow in the shape of a triangular helmet. A good stylist will be able to cut the curls in such a way that they have better shape and movement.
If a stylist wants to ""thin"" your hair with thinning shears, that's a red flag. Thinning shears can cause curly hair to frizz.

, Using a full blast of heat to dry curls will make your hair texture drier and coarser over time. It's better to let your curls air dry or diffuse on a low setting so your hair retains its bounce and stays hydrated. Finger-comb your curls section by section, then let them air dry so they stay bouncy and sleek.


If you're concerned about getting more volume near your roots, use small clips to lift up your hair near your scalp. The hair will dry with a little more lift than it otherwise would.

, Scrunching, brushing, towel-drying, twisting, and otherwise roughly handling curly hair can crush and separate the curls, making it look frizzy and messy. To keep your curls coiled, avoid touching your hair except when you really need to. When you're applying produce or finger-combing, separate your hair into sections and work on each one gently. Here are a few other ways you can avoid getting frizzy:








Sleep on a silk pillowcase designed to provide a soft surface for your hair. It's good for your skin, too.
Avoid styles that pull too much on your curls, and use hair accessories that aren't too sharp or tight.

, When you wake up in the morning (after sleeping on your fancy silk pillowcase), your curls might look a little flat. To perk them back up, spray your hair with water or a spray gel to add more moisture. Work it through your hair section by section to revive the shape of the curls.








To keep frizz at bay during the day, bring along a little gel or hair oil you can use to smooth down your hair.
Remember not to comb or brush out your curls if you want them to stay coiled.

Remove any chipped polish left on your nails.,
Trim and file your nails.,
Apply your base color.",How to Make a Nail Art Flower1," Before you start painting, you want to give yourself a gorgeous canvas to work on. You can purchase nail polish remover from your local drugstore. If your nails are prone to drying out and flaking, look for a remover labeled “non-acetone.” These are gentler on your nails, and you don’t want to dry out your nails right before giving yourself a manicure!





;
, No matter how beautifully you create your floral nail art, it won’t look perfect if your nails are jagged, uneven, or misshapen. Before painting them, it’s important to trim and file them. First, choose the shape you want for your nails. Some people prefer square tips with sharp edges, while others prefer soft rounded nails.Trim your nails so that they are all the same length. Leave a little extra length when trimming, because they’ll get a bit shorter from filing.
File your nails with the nail file using short, smooth strokes. You’ll see your nail slowly starting to take shape, and continue until you are satisfied.
Double check that all your nails are the same length and shape. Make sure you don’t have any hang nails.

, Choose a color that will provide a nice backdrop for your flowers. Roll the polish between your palms to get it all mixed and ready. Don’t shake, as that will cause air bubbles that can dry out your polish.








Dip the brush into the polish, being careful not to overload the brush with polish.
Try to use only three strokes to apply the polish to your fingernail. If necessary, use a few more strokes to distribute the polish evenly on your nail.Let your base coat dry fully before moving on to the flowers. You can let it air dry, or speed up the process by blow-drying them with cold air."

Take care of your whole body.",How to Grow Longer Curly Hair," Don’t wash your hair every day. Daily washing strips hair of its natural oils, and because curly hair is typically prone to dryness, daily washing can lead to drier hair that’s more likely to break. Instead, wash every other day or a few times a week.


Don’t “wash, rinse, and repeat”--that style advice may work for people with straighter hair, but it’s no good for those with curly hair. When you wash your hair, only wash it once.
If needed, you can wash your hair with conditioner (called “co-washing”) in-between washes. That way you won't be harming your hair with sulfates, which are found in most shampoos.;
, Curly hair can be dense and unruly, sometimes making it difficult to reach all the parts of your hair. If you have particularly thick or curly hair, wash and condition your hair one section at a time.









How large each section should be will depend on the density of your hair--the denser it is, the smaller you should make each section.
Consider using a shampoo specifically targeted for curly hair; it may be more moisturizing and strip away less of your hair’s natural oil.

,









You might also consider using additional moisturizing/protective products after or between shampooing. A number of oils and serums are available that will help “seal” your hair cuticle and help protect it from damage.Apply the conditioner starting from the bottom of your hair. Generally, you won’t need to apply conditioner higher than halfway up the length of your hair unless hair is noticeably dry near your scalp., Don’t try to drag a fine-toothed comb or brush through your hair--it’s only likely to cause damage and undue breakage. Instead, use your fingers or a very wide-toothed comb (like a pick) to detangle your hair before styling.









You should generally avoid brushing your hair, but particularly avoid brushing it when it’s wet and thus more susceptible to damage.

, When using a towel to dry your hair, don’t rub the towel against your head--squeeze your hair gently with the towel instead. The friction of rubbing a towel against your hair will cause damage and lead to easy breakage.









You can also try replacing a towel with a cotton t-shirt or microfiber cloth to dry your hair. Both are generally softer and less abrasive than towels, so they can be gentler to use on hair., This includes blow drying, curling, and straightening. Excessive heat changes the protein structure of hair, leading it to become more limp and less resilient (and thus more prone to breakage) over time.








Although avoiding the blow dryer is optimal, sometimes it isn’t practical. If you do need to blow dry your hair, do so with the dryer on a low setting and use a diffuser. You might also consider using a curl-styling cream before drying.

, An occasional bun or ponytail won’t cause irrevocable harm, but wearing a pulled-back style too frequently can cause wear and tear (ie, breakage).









If you do wear your hair back, be sure to use non-tangle hair ties. Avoid ties with metal pieces and definitely stay away from raw rubber bands.

, Protein and oil treatments are more intensively moisturizing and repairing, which means they help prevent breakage and keep hair healthy. Most people will benefit from using them anywhere from weekly to several times a month. Everyone’s hair will respond a bit differently to various kinds of treatments, so you may need to try out a few different types before finding the one that’s best for you.









If you choose to use a commercial protein treatment, it’s often advisable that you balance it with a conditioning treatment afterward or hair may become stiff or vulnerable to breakage.
Natural protein treatments, like using egg or mayonnaise, may work for those whose hair doesn’t respond well to commercial protein treatments.
Hair oils come in two major types: sealing and moisturizing. Sealing oils, like jojoba or almond oil, are meant to be used with damp hair to protect it and seal in moisture,while moisturizing oils, like castor and avocado oil, are heavier and are meant for periodic deep conditioning.Heating a moisturizing oil and gently massaging it into your scalp for between 5 and 20 minutes can also help moisturize hair and encourage hair growth., Protect your hair by covering it with a silk or satin bonnet, a bandana, or a scarf before going to bed. The added protection will help prevent unnecessary damage and breakage.Alternatively, you can spritz your hair lightly with water and then cover your hair with a shower cap just before bed to create a naturally warm, moist environment that can help keep your hair moisturized and protected.
If putting on a hair cap doesn’t appeal to you, you can also try sleeping on a silk or satin pillow, which will reduce friction against your hair., Though it may seem counter-intuitive to trim your hair when you’re trying to grow it out, untrimmed ends tend to accumulate damage that leads to breakage--ultimately making it harder to grow your hair.








Regularly trimming off dry, damaged, and split ends will improve your hair’s overall health, helping it grow in healthier and more resilient.
On average, most people’s hair will grow about 1/2 an inch per month. If you’re noticing that your strands are breaking more than 1/2 an inch from the end, it will indeed seem like your hair can’t grow past its current length.When going to a hair stylist, ask them to trim or cut your hair while it’s dry--if they don’t know to do so already. (Or, even better, before you even get this far, make sure the stylist you’re seeing is experienced working with curly hair.) Because curly hair texture and length can differ significantly from wet to dry, dry cuts are best., Stress can have a significant impact on the health of your hair; when you’re stressed, your hair becomes more vulnerable to breakage and can begin to fall out in larger-than-normal amounts. So if you want long, healthy hair, you’re going to need to relax a little. Also you need to do yoga if you have stress.


Try taking up meditation, yoga, or tai chi. All are great ways to reduce the kind of stress that can lead to hair loss and damage., Hair responds not only to the kinds of nutrients you put on it, but to the kinds of nutrients that go into it. To keep your hair healthy, you also need to take care of your body by giving it good nutrition and enough exercise.


Eat a generally healthy, well-balanced diet. Be sure you’re getting enough protein, iron, and omega-3 fatty acids, all of which are important to hair strength.Drink lots of water each day.
Get regular exercise. You don’t need to become a gym rat, but getting 15-20 minutes of moderate exercise several times a week will improve your body’s overall function, including hair growth.

Choose two colors to create your flowers.,
Create dots on your nails using your brush or a toothpick.,
Make five dots- the petals- around the original dot, using your second color.",How to Make a Nail Art Flower2," You’ll want to choose colors that contrast enough with your base color that your flowers stand out. Choose opaque polishes, because it is not easy to go over an intricate flower design with a second coat of polish. However, sheer polishes can certainly be used to create more subtle flowers., If your nail polish brush is small enough to create the dots, certainly go ahead and use them. If not, set them aside and instead dip a toothpick into the polish. You should get enough polish on the end to form a dot. If the toothpick is too pointy and isn’t picking up enough polish when dipped, gently press the end of it into a hard surface until it flattens slightly.








These dots will be forming the center of the flower, so place them on your nails accordingly. You may want to just do one flower per nail, or several. Leave room for the “petal” dots that you’ll be painting next!
If you don’t have toothpicks, or don’t like the effect you’re creating with a toothpick, feel free to use any other thin tool to create the dots.

, Dip your brush or toothpick into your second color of polish. Get enough polish on the end of the toothpick to form a dot. You will be placing dots around the original dots you created to form the petals of the flower. You can make as many petals as you’d like, but typically flowers are created with five or six.








Once you’ve created the petal dots, you can leave them as is, or drag them to create different shapes. For example, try placing the petal dots farther away from the center dot, and then using your toothpick to “drag” the polish to the center. This will create more teardrop-shaped petals.
Don’t be afraid to get creative. Experiment with different colors, different petal shapes, etc. Once you get more comfortable using a toothpick to apply the polish, you can try different things.

Allow your flowers to dry fully.,
Paint a stem.,
Enhance the background or add sparkles.,
Apply a clear topcoat.",How to Make a Nail Art Flower3," This is incredibly important, because trying to apply a top coat too early or bumping your wet nails on something will distort your beautiful flowers. Some nail polishes are specifically marketed as quick drying, but others will take at least half an hour to dry fully.

To speed up the process, dry your nails with a hairdryer. The trick is to set it on “cool.” Hot air will actually keep the polish from hardening, so cool air is the way to go.The drugstore sells special polish-drying sprays, so pick one up if you’re desperate to get your nails dried quickly., This is entirely optional. If you have green nail polish, use a super thin brush or a clean toothpick to create a small stem snaking its way from the flower. You can connect multiple flowers with stems, and even add little leaves!








There are special nail polish pens that make intricate details like stems and leaves much easier. Check out your local drugstore or beauty supply store if you are interested in purchasing these.

, If you want to add even more individuality to your nail design, go ahead! You can use the toothpick to add tiny dots to the background, or other thin designs. Combining floral patterns with geometric backgrounds is extremely trendy.If you have a sheer glitter polish, you can paint a coat over the design to give it some sparkle., After your flowers are finished and your nails look flawless, it’s important to seal it all. Find a polish specifically marketed as a topcoat to finish off your manicure. A good topcoat protects the polish from every day wear and tear, and it acts as a barrier to prevent chipping and other damage. Additionally, a topcoat adds a beautiful shine to your nails.








Because you’ve applied several different kinds of nail polishes, a topcoat also helps to smooth out the entire design and help it look more cohesive.

Buy a bottle of vanilla.,
Open the bottle of vanilla extract.,
Place the vanilla on your body.,
Keep the bottle with you.",How to Make a Vanilla Scent Using Extract1," Organic vanilla extract has a potent vanilla scent, and most people use it for cooking and baking, among other things.If you don't already have a bottle of vanilla extract in your pantry, then you can purchase a small bottle at your local grocery store.


Any size will work, but if you plan on using a lot of fragrance, the bigger bottle will come in handy.;
, Once you're home, you can unwrap the bottle of vanilla extract, being sure to take off the protective wrapper underneath the lid. Replace the lid and put your finger on the opening, completely covering it, and turn the bottle upside down. Flip the bottle upright again and you should have a dab of vanilla on your finger.


Be careful not to spill! Vanilla extract pours a very thin liquid, so it's easy to waste if you tip it or pour too much.

, Most perfume hot-spots are the wrists, neck and under your ears. Put a dab or drop of vanilla extract on both wrists and the sides of your neck, or wherever you desire.


If your skin has a reaction to the vanilla, it could be that you're using a non-organic or synthetic vanilla with added ingredients.Stop using the product, or try using smaller amounts on different areas of the skin.

, Using vanilla extract as perfume is a good quick-fix, but it doesn't last long. You'll have to re-apply frequently in order to keep the vanilla scent strong.

Use the basic formula of 15% to 30% essential oil, 70% to 80% of pure grain alcohol, such as vodka, and 5% of distilled or bottled spring water to make perfume.,
Note that you will have to play around with the oils to create the perfect scent.,
Remind yourself that when you are ready to start combining fragrance/essential oils for a scent that is completely unique, understand that there are three different notes in scented oil.,
Check out the Internet!,
Finished.

",How to Make a Natural Perfume," Essential oil can be replaced with fragrance oil for a cheaper quality and price perfume. Fragrance oils however are not natural and do not make a natural perfume. Essential oil can easily be found in a craft store or health food store. Craft store 'essential oils' are most often not natural either, but are fine if being all natural does not matter to you. Store your perfume in a small glass or plastic container. You can buy a container with a sprayer at almost any local craft store. You might also be able to find vintage perfume bottles at thrift stores or flea markets.;
, To start, try mixing ¼ cup of straight vodka with 5 drops of an essential fragrance or oil of your choice. Depending on how strong you want the perfume, you can let the mixture stand for as little as 48 hours all the way to a month. The longer it stands, the stronger it will be. After your perfume has sat for your preferred time, add 2 tablespoons (29.6 ml) of the diluted water. If the perfume is too strong for you, you can add more water to get your desired scent strength. To make your scent last longer, add a tablespoon of glycerin to your perfume mixture. Glycerin is a neutral, colorless, thick liquid. It can be found anywhere soap making supplies are found. When added to water and alcohol, glycerin remains liquid and helps the other ingredients dissolve faster and better.

, The first is base notes, which will stay longest on your skin. Base notes include oils such as vanilla, cinnamon, and sandalwood. The second of the notes are middle notes, which add to the scent for a while, but not as long as the base notes. These oils include lemon-grass, geranium, neroli, and ylang-ylang. The last of the notes are the top notes which do what they say, they top off the scent. The top notes do not last as long as the other two notes, but add to the scent significantly. The top notes include oils such as rose, lavender, jasmine, bergamot, and orchard. When making a perfume of more than one scent, add the base note oil first. Follow the base note with the middle note oil, and finish with the top note oil.

, There are many recipes for perfume online. While playing with scents can be fun, it can also be frustrating if you cannot get the desired scent you want. The website, PioneerThinking, contains some great recipes for beginners. The names are even better than what the designers name their perfumes. Now that you know the basics of perfume making, feel free to give them as birthday or Christmas gifts. Who wouldn't love their own signature perfume, especially if it is named after them?

Separate the oils.,
Apply when needed.",How to Extract Oil from Fruit Peels1," This includes your hands and the fruit you will be extracting oil from. Cold pressing doesn’t involve chemicals for extraction, so it’s important to thoroughly wash the fruit to remove bacteria.


It takes about 25 pieces of citrus fruit to produce a useful amount of oil this way. Plan ahead!;
, Remove the rind of the fruit with a peeler or knife and place it to the side. You may also remove the rind of the fruit with your fingers if you desire, but this can cause a greater amount of pulp and other fruit material to end up in the oils, which will need to be removed later.


The greatest concentration of oils in most fruit is contained in the outer layer of the rind. The lighter portion of the rind contains much less oil.You can use an electric peeler to obtain the skin of the fruit, but note that this may produce more pulp than a hand peeled method.

, Once the fruit is peeled, you can use the leftover fruit for cooking or eating. There are a variety of uses for the leftover fruit peel, even after pressing. Rather than composting the peel, try:


Keeping the peels in a small bag and hanging it somewhere to keep the room smelling zesty.
The oil in orange peel, limonene, acts as a repellant for several types of insects.
Toss a few peels into the garbage disposal and give them a good grinding to freshen up the smell of your sink., Use a pressing device, such as a sieve, to squeeze the fruit peel over a jar. Heavy pressure will squeeze liquid from the peel - this liquid contains the oils you're looking for. Use a fair amount of strength when pressing, but take care not to damage or break the implement you are using. You should see a small amount of oil drain from the peel after a few seconds.


Cold pressing peel is quite a bit of effort for what looks to be a fairly small amount of oil. Don’t get discouraged. The oil is quite potent.A garlic press is a great way of pressing small amounts of fruit peel with ease. A mortar and pestle may also be used, though this method is a little more labor intensive and difficult.

, Allow the liquid squeezed from the peel to stand for a few days. The oil will separate from the rest of the liquid, which can then be collected. A centrifuge can also be used to separate the oil from the rest of the liquid!


A simple way of collecting the oil from the liquid is placing the liquid in the freezer. The oil will remain in its liquid form while the remainder freezes, allowing you to pour out the oil.Oil extracted this way has a small shelf life. Try to use any oil created within a 6 month period., Bottle the oil that you extract from the liquid for later use. Dab a little on your skin for a fresh smell, or use some in cooking recipes that require essential oil. Remember that the oil is very concentrate – a little will go a long way.

You can make a large bottle of perfume for your house, but you can also get a small spray bottle to keep in your purse.Make sure you get a spray cap where you push down, and not pull a trigger. These are much easier to apply perfume.

, You should usually purchase one large bottle, and organic vanilla tends to work the best. Getting a bottle of pure vanilla is important, because the perfume won't turn out well if the vanilla extract has sugar in it.If you're worried about the price, just remember: no matter how much you pay, it's going to be significantly less than the price of those expensive perfumes that everyone else buys!

, Different types of essential oils can be added to your vanilla perfume to create your own unique scent. You can buy small bottles of essential oils, and try them out to decide what you like best.Popular essential oils are rose, lavender, peppermint, chamomile and patchouli., Pour the essential oil of your choice into the spray bottle, and fill the remainder of the bottle's content with vanilla. If the spray bottle is large, then you can empty the entire essential oil bottle.If the spray bottle is smaller, fill it under half-way, and then top it off with vanilla.

You may want to purchase a bottle of vanilla extract, too, if you want to try mixing vanilla as a scent. Other popular perfumes fragrances are jasmine, lavender and rose.

, Alcohol is used to preserve and combine the scents that you use.You want to choose a mild alcohol without a lot of influence on the fragrances you select.


Many people use vodka or rum for their homemade perfumes., You can choose from your essential oil selection which fragrances you'd like to use, but don't use more than three. Put 25-30 drops of the scent you'd like to stand out the most, while adding 12-20 drops of one or two other ""base oils.""It would be best to let these oils sit for several days to allow the fragrances to combine, but this is optional if you need a quick-fix.

, After your oils are mixed, add about four ounces of alcohol of your choosing. Shake the alcohol-and-oil mixture well to allow all the scents to mix and combine. You can either use the perfume right away, or allow it to sit for a few weeks to let the alcohol scent fade and the perfumes to combine.


Sometimes fragrances change after several weeks. You may enjoy the scent right when you mix the products, but then discover that you don't enjoy it after a couple weeks. Alternatively, you may dislike a scent right away, only to discover the scents combined well after two weeks of sitting alone."

Strain the liquid from the peels.,
Apply when needed.",How to Extract Oil from Fruit Peels2," Allow them to air dry until the peels are hard to the touch. This can take anywhere from a few days to up to a week, so remain patient.


Avoid the use of a dehydrator or other drying mechanisms when drying the peels. This can compromise the oil stored in the peels.

, Once the peels are completely dry, cut the peels into small pieces. You can use a knife, vegetable dicer, or food processor to accomplish this. Take care not to over dice or process the peels however, as this can compromise the oils contained in the peels.


Over diced peels will take on a liquid, minced appearance. Avoid expressing liquid from the peels prior to the distillation process.

, Pour enough alcohol into the jar to completely cover the peels. The alcohol should rest roughly an inch above the top of where the peels rest. Allow the jar to sit for several days.


Vodka can be used for the distilling process, but may slightly affect the scent of the oil, depending on the type of vodka used.
Place the jar in a location that gets plenty of sunlight to help the separation process.
Shake the jar several times a day. Give the jar a shake each day to help separate the oil from the peels.

, After several days have passed, use a coffee filter to strain the liquid into a second jar. Place a coffee filter or cloth over the second jar, and allow all of the alcohol in the jar to evaporate. This can take up to a week or more.Oil evaporates much more slowly than water or similar types of liquids. Though oil can technically evaporate, the water will evaporate before the oil, leaving just the oil behind., After the alcohol has evaporated, all that will remain is the oil. Bottle the oil for later use. Dab a little on your skin for a fresh smell, or use some in cooking recipes that require essential oil. Remember that the oil is very concentrate – a little will go a long way.

, You will have to dilute this in a couple of teaspoons of vodka first or it will just float on top of the water. Make sure that you are using pure essential oil, and not fragrance oil. Fragrance oil will only give you the smell, and none of the benefits found in roses and pure essential oils.

, Do this for a few moment to mix the oil into the water.

, You can leave the rosewater in the jar, or you can pour it through a funnel into a misting bottle and use it to freshen your linens or your face.

;
,, Put about an inch of water in a small saucepan, then rest the jar or bowl containing the wax in the water. Bring the water around it to a boil. The wax will melt gradually.








,, A thin stirring stick is used because the wax will start to form a solid on whatever you do your stirring with — your goal should be to find something that has as little surface area as possible so you lose less of the end product, and also something disposable so you don't have to clean it off. Mix thoroughly.








, In about 30 minutes, it will be cooled, solid and ready to use. This will yield about one half ounce (by volume) of solid perfume.








, To use the perfume, simply rub a finger around on the surface of the waxy perfume, then rub that finger on the area you want to smell good — the inside of your wrists and behind the ears works well. You can also use solid perfume in many other ways:

Gather your supplies.,
Strip the lavender buds from their stems.,
Bring the water to a rolling boil.,
Pour the boiling water over the lavender buds.,
Cover the bowl and let the buds steep.,
Strain the buds from the water.,
Funnel the water into the spray bottle.",How to Make Lavender Water1," Lavender water made from lavender flowers won't smell as concentrated as lavender water made from essential oil. Essential oil is the distilled, concentrated essence of lavender made from the flowers. When you use the flowers themselves, the resulting water is very light, but still quite aromatic. Here's what you'll need:


A bunch of lavender stems fresh or dried (for a total of 2 tablespoons of buds)
1/2 cup water
Glass bowl
Spray bottle
Funnel
Fine-mesh strainer;
, Lavender flowers grow as little buds along straight stems. To make lavender water, you don't need the stems; the buds contain the floral scent. To remove them from the stems, hold a stem over the glass bowl. Gently pinch the stem at its base, and run your fingers from the base to the tip. The buds will fall off into the bowl.


You can also buy dried lavender buds that have already been removed from their stems. Look in gourmet food stores or herb shops.
This is a great way to use lavender plants that may be growing in your yard.

, Pour it into a small saucepan and place it over high heat. Heat the water until it comes to a full boil. Don't leave it unattended for too long, or the water will begin to evaporate.

, Carefully pour it over the buds so that the buds can begin steeping in the hot water. The heat will draw out the oils from the flower, and the water will become scented with lavender.

, Leave the buds to steep for a few hours or overnight. The process is similar to making tea. Let the buds continue steeping until the water cools., Set the fine-mesh strainer over a bowl. Pour the water into the strainer to strain out the buds. Discard the buds; they won't have a scent now that their essence is gone.

, Place the funnel over the opening of the spray bottle. Pour the lavender water into the spray bottle. The water is now ready to use on your linens, as air freshener, or as a tool for aromatherapy.


If you want the water to have a longer shelf life, you can mix in one ounce of either witch hazel or vodka. Shake the bottle well to distribute it throughout.
You may also store it in the refrigerator to keep it fresh.

Pour the rosewater into the jar.,
Seal the jar and store it in the fridge.",How to Make Rosewater2," In addition to the dried rose petals and hot water, you will also need two glass mason jars and a strainer.

, If you want to use this water for cooking, then consider getting dried petals from edible roses, such as Rosa damascena, Rosa Centifolia and Rosa Gallica.They will give you the best taste.

, Make sure that you are using distilled water, which is free of any bacteria. If you cannot find distilled water, then you can use filtered water instead.

, This will take about 10 to 15 minutes, depending on the temperature of the room.

, You will be transferring the rosewater into this jar; the strainer will catch the rose petals.

, Carefully put the water in the strainer, so that the water flows into the empty jar and the petals get caught in the strainer. Once all of the water is in the new jar, you can discard the petals.

, You will need to use this rosewater within one week, or it will expire.

Place the petals into a saucepan and pour water over them.,
Cover the pot with a lid and set the heat to ""low."",
Place a strainer over a large mason jar.,
Pour the rosewater into the jar.,
Store in the refrigerator.",How to Make Rosewater3," The fresher your roses are, the better results you will get.Try to use organic, pesticide-free roses; even though you will be washing them later on, there is no guarantee that you will be able to completely rinse all of the chemicals off. Also, try to use just one type of rose; each type has its distinctive smell, and you may not get good-smelling results by mixing them. Be sure to rinse the rose well to get rid of any dirt, insects, and pesticides.


If you wish to use the rosewater for cooking, consider using some edible roses types, such as: Rosa damascena, Rosa Centifolia and Rosa Gallica., You will need enough petals to fill one cup. This should take about two roses, depending on the size of the rose.

, Make sure that the petals are evenly distributed, and that the water level does not come too far past the petals. If you use too much water, your rosewater will be less fragrant.Consider adding up to one teaspoon of vodka. This will not affect the smell, but it will help preserve the rosewater and make it last longer., Do not let the water come to a boil or a simmer; using too much heat will ruin the color and other properties. After about 20 minutes, you will see the petals become paler, and the water take on the color of the petals.

, Make sure that the jar is very clean, and that it is big enough to hold about 2 cups (475 milliliters) of water. You will be using the strainer to catch the petals.

, Using both hands, hold the pot over the jar and tip it carefully. Slowly pour the water and petals through the strainer and into the jar. The water will pass through the strainer, and the petals will get caught in it.


Consider filling a smaller bottle with some of the rosewater. A smaller bottle will be easier to handle than a large mason jar. When you run out of rosewater, simply refill it with more rosewater from the big jar.

, The rosewater will keep about one week in the fridge.If you added vodka, it should last a bit longer.

Simmer the rose water and petals over low heat.,
Pour the rosewater into a jar through a strainer.,
Seal the jar and leave in a sunny spot for a few hours.,
Store the rose water in the refrigerator.",How to Make Rosewater4," You will be crushing one pile first, and using the other one later.

, As you crush the petals, they will release juice; you will be using this juice to make your rosewater. You can also rub the petals against a strainer; simply place the strainer over a jar, and scrub the petals across the mesh using the back of a spoon.

, You can also use a glass jar or bowl. Leave the rose water and petals in the bowl for a few hours; this allows the liquid to become even more saturated.

, Stir the fresh petals through the crushed ones. Cover the bowl and let it sit undisturbed for 24 hours.

, Don't use metal pot; this will react with the oils.

, Place the saucepan on the stove and set the heat to low. Bring the rose petals to a simmer. Once you start to see bubbles, remove the pot from the burner.

, You can also use a coffee filter or a muslin cloth. Keep doing this until there are no more specks of petal in the rosewater.


If you wish to use the rosewater as a toner, then dilute it with some distilled water until you get the strength you like.

, The heat of the sun will help draw out the natural, beneficial oils.

, Use the water within one week, or it will expire.

Look for a lip balm that is wax based for extra protection, such as a beeswax lip balm.;
, To accentuate your cupid’s bow, take a moment to apply a little highlighter to this area and along other areas around your lips if desired. Your cupid’s bow is the curved area right above your upper lip.








You only need to apply a small amount of highlighter to your cupid’s bow.Highlighter is meant to reflect the light and look natural. Adding too much may make your lips look a little odd.

, Liquid lipstick can bleed onto the areas around your lips if you get sweaty or in hot or humid weather. To prevent liquid lipstick from bleeding onto the skin around your lips, apply some concealer to the skin around your lip line using a makeup sponge.







, Lining your lips is not necessary, but it may help you to ensure better definition to your lips. If you want to use lip liner, then apply it at this time. You may even want to just line our cupid’s bow to make sure that it is well-defined.









To line your lips, start at your cupid’s bow and draw a line going in towards the center of your lip. Then do the same thing for the other side of your cupid’s bow. Then use small strokes to line the outer edges of the rest of your lips., To begin applying your liquid lipstick, take your liquid lipstick and use the brush to apply it first to the outer corners of your lower lip.

, Before you move on to your upper lip, press your lower lip against your upper lip to transfer some of the color. You will not be able to cover your entire upper lip this way, but pressing your lips together will start to even out the color and distribute it to your upper lip.







, Next, line the outer edge of your cupid’s bow and then move to the outer edges of your upper lip. Line and fill in these areas and then press your lips together some more.








Only one coat of liquid lipstick is necessary since it often provides full coverage in one coat. However, you may want to apply more liquid lipstick to some areas or do an extra coat for a more intense look., Liquid lipstick may appear glossy when you first apply it, but by blotting your lips on a piece of tissue or a paper towel, you can achieve a matte look instead. Take a tissue or a paper towel and hold it up to your lips. Then wrap your lips around it as if you are biting it with your teeth.







, Liquid lipstick can be hard to remove and it can stain your skin pretty quickly if you make a mistake. Make sure that you fix any mistakes right away by using a cotton swab dipped in some cold cream to wipe the area clean.







, If you do not like the color or if you are just ready to take it off, then you will need to use some makeup remover. Try using a textured makeup remover wipe to take off the color and then follow up by rinsing off your lips.








Make sure that you apply some more lip balm after you have removed the liquid lipstick to restore any lost moisture.

Place 2 tablespoons (30 grams) of petroleum jelly into a heat-safe bowl.,
Melt the petroleum jelly in the microwave.,
Add some color and/or shimmer, if desired.,
Add ¼ teaspoon of coconut oil for extra nourishment.,
Add flavor with extracts, essential oils, or powders.,
Pour the lip balm into small, clean, empty lip balm container.,
Wait for the lip balm to set.",How to Make Lip Balm1," This will serve as the base for your lip balm.Try to use the original, plain, unflavored kind of petroleum jelly. The kind that is already tinted and colored is actually lip balm!






;
, Heat the petroleum jelly for 30 seconds. Give it a quick stir, then heat it for another 30 seconds. Keep heating it at 30-second intervals, stirring between each one, until the petroleum jelly is liquid.The petroleum jelly should be clear, with no lumps or clumps. This will take about 3 to 4 minutes total.







, This step is completely optional. It can make you lip balm double-up as a lip stain or lip gloss. Choose one of the additions from the list below, then stir it into your lip balm base.









Use crushed blush or eye shadow to add color.A smidge of lipstick will also work.Add color and shimmer with cosmetic-grade glitter or mica powder.You can also use edible shimmer dust meant for cake decorating.Add color and flavor with powdered drink mix. Be aware that it may not dissolve very well., You don't have to do this, but it will help make the lip balm more nourishing. It will also give the lip balm a nice, subtle scent and flavor.







, Again, you don't have to do this, but it's a nice way to take your lip balm to the next level. Add in a few drops of essential oil or extract; peppermint and spearmint are great choices! You can also try a flavored drink mix or cocoa powder instead.








If you are using a powdered drink mix or cocoa powder, keep in mind that this will change the color of your lip balm.

, Choose a small, plastic jar with a screw-on lid. You can find such jars online in stores that sell soap-making supplies. You can also find them in art supply stores and supermarkets along the travel-size cosmetic items. Choose something that is about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) in diameter. You have enough melted mixture to fill several such jars.









Mini mint tins work especially well for this as well!

, Set the lip balm down someplace where it won't be bumped. Leave the lid off, and wait for it to harden. This may take 1 to 2 hours, however.If you are in a hurry, you can stick the lip balm into the fridge or freezer for 10 to 15 minutes instead.

Evaluate if it is worth it.,
Decide what colour you want.,
Source a tube of coloured lipstick.,
Break off as much lipstick as you want (probably somewhere between 1/16 and 1/8 of a teaspoon of it) into a small microwave safe container.,
Place into the microwave for 30 seconds to melt.,
While the lipstick is melting, open your container of clear fluid lip gloss and remove the applicator so the mouth of the container is open and not blocked by anything.

,
As soon as the lipstick is done, transfer it all to the tube with the applicator.,
Mix it thoroughly with the applicator until the colour is smooth throughout the tube.,
Consider whether you need to add more lipstick.,
Try it on.",How to Colour Clear Lip Gloss," If you have under half a container of it left (unless the container is big) it is not worth colouring it when it won't last for long anyway.;
, This method creates a more muted shade than the source of the colour, so you may wish to go a shade brighter than you normally would.

, This may be your favourite lipstick or one that you rarely use, whatever you want. As long as it is lipstick rather than gloss or gel, it will work.

, Remember the more you use, the stronger the colour of the lip gloss.

, If you desire, you may want to crush or break up the lipstick first so it melts evenly.

,, This can be done by rolling the applicator bud in the melted lipstick or using it to scrape it into the mouth of the container.

, This should only take 10 - 20 seconds as the lipstick is fluid and will mix easily with the lip gloss to form a compound just as most other fluids would.

,


Is the lip gloss one colour throughout? Is the colour bold enough that it is visible when on, but not so strong that you look like a clown? If not, add more melted lipstick and try again.
Alternatively, is the colour too strong? If so, melt about 1/4 teaspoon of petroleum jelly and add it, essentially diluting the mix.

, It may look good in the container, but not so great on. Make sure to try the product on before you put it away.

Cut the top off of a plastic bottle.,
Clean and smooth the plastic.,
Choose to use a piece of plastic for the base.,
Choose to make a base out of another cap.,
Pour in lip balm and let set.",How to Make a Lip Balm Container1," Use scissors or an Exacto knife to cut a plastic bottle below the base of the cap. Cut right where the plastic begins to flare out and get wider.


Use any bottle you like for this project, whether it’s from water, soda, juice, milk, or any other beverage. You may select a bottle based on what color the cap is or how big it is, depending on what you want your lip balm container to look like.Use caution when cutting plastic with scissors or a blade. The plastic can be slippery and difficult to work with.;
, Make sure the inside of the cap and piece of the plastic bottle is clean and dry. If you want to, you can smooth down the cut edge of the plastic with sandpaper.You can also use a nail file to smooth the plastic edge in place of sandpaper.
Note that if you use a cap for the base in the next step, you may need to adjust by cutting more plastic away, so don’t sand down the edge until you are sure of your plastic size.

, Make the base for your lip balm container by using a piece of plastic. Cut and glue the plastic to your top, then cut it to size when dry.


Cut away a piece of plastic from a bottle. It can be the bottle you cut from originally, or any bottle with a flat plastic section (milk bottles work well).
Glue your top piece with the cap to the piece of bottle plastic using super glue or craft glue. Once it has dried, cut the plastic base so that it is the same size and shape as the rest of the container., Opt to make the base for your lip balm container out of a second bottle cap. Fit the plastic on your top piece into another cap to complete the base.


Make sure you use a cap for your base that’s of the same size as the first. Then push your plastic end into it until it fits snugly. You may need to adjust by cutting away more plastic or sanding down edges further until it fits evenly.
Apply super glue or craft glue to the plastic or inside of the base cap to secure them to one another., Pour homemade lip balm into your new container while it is still warm. Or take a portion of whatever item you want to store in a smaller size and fill the container up to the lip.


Allow homemade lip balm to set after you pour it in warm by placing it in the fridge undisturbed so it creates a smooth, even surface. Don’t use the balm or screw on the cap of your container until the balm is solidified.
If you are using another premade product rather than homemade, soft material that you can scoop, like petroleum jelly or lip gloss, works best for transferring to a new container. While you can attempt to melt down existing lip balm for pouring, the process will likely be messy and difficult.
Make sure you fill your new container just up to the lip of the plastic, where you would usually drink from if the bottle was intact. Overfilling it will not allow the cap to screw on smoothly.

Set up a make-shift double-boiler.,
Place 3½ tablespoons (52.5 milliliters) of a carrier oil into the bowl.,
Add ½ tablespoon (7.5 milliliters) of another type of oil.,
Add 1 tablespoon (15 grams) of beeswax.,
Add 1 tablespoon of solid butter.,
Melt the ingredients.,
Remove the bowl from the saucepan.,
Stir in 5 to 10 drops of essential oil, if desired.,
Pour the lip balm into small, clean, lip balm containers.,
Wait for the lip balm to set.",How to Make Lip Balm2," Fill a saucepan with 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) of water. Place a heat-safe glass bowl on top of the saucepan. If you don't have such a bowl, you can set a glass canning jar into the water instead. Don't turn the stove on just yet!








, A carrier oil is a liquid, food-grade oil. It serves as the base of your lip balm and both nourishing and moisturizing. You can use all one type, or a combination of different types. Great carrier oils and their uses include:








Coconut oil smells and tastes great. It's solid at room temperature, but it melts quickly.
Olive oil is a great, easy-to-find oil. You likely have it at home!
Sunflower oil helps heal damaged skin.
Sweet almond oil is great for making lips silky-soft.

, You can use the same type of oil as before (coconut, olive oil, etc) for a simple recipe. You can also use this opportunity to add a richer oil, such as:








Apricot kernel oil is great for sensitive and/or mature skin.
Avocado oil is very rich and ideal for moisturizing dry lips.
Castor oil helps add a glossy shine to the lip balm.
Hemp seed oil helps condition lips.
Jojoba oil is great for softening and nourishing dry, chapped lips.
Pomegranate seed oil is another rich oil. It helps nourish dry, dull lips.

, Try to use shaved beeswax or beeswax pellets; they will be easier to melt. If you are a strict vegan, use ½ tablespoon (7.5 grams) of candelilla wax instead.







, No, this is not the butter that you put on your toast. Solid butters are any type of oil that is solid at room temperature. You can leave them out if you want to, but they help make the lip balm more creamy. Great solid butters to use in lip balm include:








Mango butter
Shea butter
Cocoa butter with little bit more of your carrier oil. Note that this butter can be drying.
Kokum butter with a little bit more of your carrier oil.

, Turn the stove on and set the heat to medium-low. Wait for the water heat up and for the ingredients to melt.








, Set it down onto a heat-safe surface and stir the ingredients together until the color is consistent. You do not want any streaks or swirls.








, You can skip this step if you want to, but the essential oils will give your lip balm a nice fragrance and flavor. Not all types of essential oils are safe to use on skin, but the following types are:








Vanilla absolute is sweet and delicious, like a pastry.
Peppermint or spearmint are cool and refreshing. You can use up to 16 drops.
Mandarin, orange (sweet), or tangerine are sweet and tangy.
Lemon or lime are safe as long as they are distilled and not cold-pressed.
Lavender and rose have a wonderful scent, but not everyone likes their flavor.
Clove, as long as it's used sparingly (1 to 2 drops)
Camphor or tea tree oil are great for cold sores, but must be used sparingly—only 1 to 2 drops.

, You can buy them online from stores specializing in soap-making supplies. You can also find them in supermarkets, right alongside the other travel-sized items. Some container stores may also sell them. Look for something that is around 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) wide.









Make sure that the containers are clean.

, Place the jar down, cap off, some place where it won't be disturbed. Let it set and harden. This should take less than an hour. Depending on the size of your container, it may even take 10 to 15 minutes. If you are in a hurry, however, you can pop the jar into the fridge or freezer for a few minutes.

Find a small metal, glass, or plastic container.,
Use jewelry to hold your lip balm.,
Wash and dry the container thoroughly.,
Fill your container with lip balm.",How to Make a Lip Balm Container2," Repurpose an old container for use as a cute new lip balm container. Think of tins for candy or mints, small glass jars, or old plastic makeup compacts. Make sure your container has a cap or lid that fits securely.


Try using a mini size Altoids container, or another small tin left over from mints or candy.
Use an old container from makeup or another beauty product you don’t use anymore or that’s used up. You can even cut apart a contact lens case to use one of the circular containers.

, Create a container you can wear by using jewelry as a way to hold your lip balm. Try a locket or ring that closes to protect the lip balm.


Look for jewelry items that have a small recess to put lip balm into, and a little door or cover that will protect it.
Note that you may want to find an inexpensive piece of jewelry that’s old or not worn anymore for this project, as it may be difficult to remove and clean out lip balm once it is put into metal crevices.

, Make sure to wash any container previously used for another purpose. Then dry it thoroughly before pouring lip balm into it.


Try cleaning out a container with medical or rubbing alcohol to be sure it’s free of contaminants. Alcohol will also evaporate quickly, so you won’t leave any residue of moisture, which can damage the quality of whatever lip balm you put in.You may need to clean containers several times if they have a pervasive scent left over from the previous contents, as with Altoids or other mints. Try using a strongly scented cleaner, like rubbing alcohol, vinegar, or lemon juice.

, Pour in homemade lip balm while it is still warm to allow it to set in your new repurposed container. Or, transfer an existing product to the container to keep as a small travel size.


Let homemade lip balm set in the fridge undisturbed until it solidifies before using it or putting a cap or lid on.
Note that it’s easiest to transfer an existing product to a new container if it’s soft and scoopable, like a petroleum jelly or lip gloss. Melting down an existing lip balm (not homemade) may be too difficult and messy.
Make sure that if your container has a clasp or hinged lid, as in a metal tin or piece of jewelry, you do not fill it with lip balm or other product to the point that it impedes it from closing smoothly.

Sculpt clay around your bottle cap container.,
Attach paper and beads.,
Label your container with the lip balm.",How to Make a Lip Balm Container3," Make your bottle cap container look more decorative or a fun shape by using clay. Mold the clay to the cap and base in whatever shape you like.


Use colorful modeling clay like Sculpey clay or a similar brand to make your shapes. You can use tools like a plastic knife or toothpick to create designs or texture.
Mold your clay around your container so you know it will fit on after baking. Then pop the clay off and bake it according to the instructions for your specific variety of modeling clay.When the clay is hardened from the oven, let it cool. Then pop it back onto your container. Secure the clay pieces with glue if they don't stay on the container on their own.

, Glue on colorful paper, beads, glitter, or any other material you like to decorate your repurposed container or bottle cap container. Use Mod Podge or a similar craft material to add shine over your decorations.You can also use paint or pens to color directly on your container to make it a different color.
Try decorating your container with the same color as your lip balm, or an image of the lip balm’s flavor, scent, or other ingredients.

, Remember at a glance what kind of lip balm is in your container by creating a label for it. Write directly on the container with a pen or marker, or attach a piece of paper with the label.


Try printing out text from the computer for a typed label. Just make sure to measure your container first to create text that is the right size to attach to it.
Coat your label with Mod Podge or another shellac to make it shiny and look more seamless on a shiny container.

The ones you didn't pick as a favorite will be for days when you want something either more bold, more sheer, more matte, more bold, red, nudes, pink, mauves, etc.,

Okay, so now is the important part; how to remember to re-apply it!,

The most crucial thing, though, is that you must learn how to apply it, staying inside your lip-line without smearing outside the edges, without a mirror.",How to Be a Lip Gloss Addict," You'll need at least 10 tubes, with at least 2 nudes, 3 reds, and lots of pink/purple-ish shades.

Scoop petroleum jelly into a microwave safe container.,
Add tint with an old lipstick if desired.,
Microwave the mixture and stir.",How to Make Mint Lip Balm in the Microwave1," Place petroleum jelly (such as Vaseline) and your mint extract or oil into a glass dish or jar. Ensure that the container is microwave safe and will allow you to mix the ingredients in it easily.


Use pure peppermint extract or pure peppermint essential oil, or another type of mint like spearmint if you prefer. Add this in a few drops at a time, as you will only need a small amount to scent and flavor the lip balm, and too much can create a burning sensation.Determine the quantity of ingredients to use based on the size of your container or the amount you’re going to make. If you’re only filling one small lip balm pot or tube, you may only need about a tablespoon.;
, Add a little color to your lips while also hydrating them by adding tint to your lip balm. Scrape off the top of a lipstick you don’t use and add it to your petroleum jelly and mint extract or oil.


You can also scrape a small amount of eyeshadow, blush, or another pigmented beauty product into your lip balm to create color.Food coloring or another edible dye will also work to color the lip balm, but note that even one drop will be a very concentrated color if you’re only making a small quantity of lip balm.

, Place your glass container with the petroleum jelly, mint extract/oil, and tint (if using) into a microwave. Heat for about two minutes, or until completely melted, then stir.Microwaves vary, so use your best judgment when heating your ingredients. It may take more or less time to melt the lip balm, but you want it to be fully liquid so it’s easy to pour.
Stir with a wooden chopstick, stir stick, or another utensil that will not melt in the hot liquid and that you can easily dispose of or clean afterwards.
Use oven mitts to remove the container from the microwave, and be very careful with the hot contents. Children should have an adult complete this step.

Put beeswax and carrier oil into microwave safe glass.,
Microwave your ingredients.,
Add in mint essential oil and stir.",How to Make Mint Lip Balm in the Microwave2," Use pure beeswax pellets or shavings into a microwave safe glass jar or dish. Add almond or coconut oil as a “carrier oil” to help balance out the mint and make the lip balm smooth.


Use pure almond oil or coconut oil based on preference and availability. You can find these in grocery stores and natural beauty suppliers.
You can purchase beeswax online or in some health food or beauty supply stores, either as a block or in small pellets. Add pellets directly to your glass container, or shave off small pieces of a block with a knife or grater before adding.
Add more beeswax if you prefer a firmer, longer-lasting lip balm, or less if you like your lip balm softer and smoother., Put the glass container with your ingredients into the microwave. Heat for about one minute or until melted.


Microwave heat and settings vary, so you may use more or less time to melt the ingredients to a liquid so you can pour the mixture later. You can microwave in 10 second intervals and stir in between to help ensure that the beeswax melts into the oil.Use oven mitts to remove the glass container from the microwave, and use caution with the hot dish and its contents. Children should have help from an adult for this step.

, Start with just a few drops of peppermint or other mint essential oil that’s of a pure, food grade quality. Then stir and add more drops of essential oil to preference.


A small amount of peppermint essential oil can go a long way to create a scent and tingly flavor. However, too much can actually create a burning sensation on your lips, so add it carefully, especially if you are only making a small batch of lip balm.
If you need to test the consistency or amount of mint in the balm, you can transfer a small amount to a piece of wax paper and let it set in the refrigerator. Test it once solidified, and if you need to make adjustments to your main batch, just reheat it before adding anything.At this point, you can also add powder from eyeshadow or blush if you’d like your lip balm to contain a tint of color. Stir it in until combined evenly.

Ready a container for the lip balm.,
Pour the balm while it is still liquid.,
Let the balm sit and harden before use.",How to Make Mint Lip Balm in the Microwave3," Buy, reuse, or make a container to hold your new lip balm. Make sure whatever you use is fully cleaned and dried before pouring your heated lip balm into it.


Reuse an old lip balm tub or stick, or buy new ones from beauty supply stores. You can also make your own containers using bottle caps or repurposed mint tins, jewelry, etc.
Make sure the container you use is free of moisture that could contaminate the balm. Use rubbing alcohol to help clean and dry the surfaces., Transfer your lip balm to a container while it is still warm and liquified from the microwave. Use a funnel or another pouring mechanism to help get the balm into a small container.


For easiest pouring into most containers, use a Pyrex measuring cup with a pour spout. This is ideal, as it is microwave safe so you can use it throughout the process to add, microwave, mix, and pour your ingredients.
For very small containers like a lip balm tube, you can also use a glass dropper (note that beeswax is very hard to clean out of this once hardened), a disposable plastic pipette, or a very small funnel to help transfer the liquid.
If your ingredients have cooled slightly and separated or hardened into anything other than fully liquid, simply reheat in the microwave for a short time before pouring.

, Leave the lip balm in its new container undisturbed with the lid off. You can allow it to harden in room temperature, or speed up the process by placing it in the fridge or freezer.


If in room temperature, allow the balm to sit for several hours or overnight. If in the fridge, about an hour will do, or less in the freezer. When in doubt, leave it undisturbed for longer to ensure a smooth, solid balm.
After cooling and hardening, you can place the cap or lid onto your container. Use the balm like you normally would, applying to lips with a finger or directly from the container.

",How to Apply Lip Gloss," Everyone makes mistakes. The problem with this is that lip gloss is intended to bring out the features of your lips, making them look vibrant and plump.Mistakes you make with your lip gloss application can be fairly obvious, so including your gloss, you should make sure you have:


Facial tissue
Lip gloss
Lip liner (for greater contrast/pop)
Lip moisturizer (petroleum jelly, lip balm, etc.)
Lip pencil
Lipstick (optional)
Mirror or compact
Q-tips/cotton swabs;
, Exfoliation is a process where the outer, dead layer of your skin is removed to give it a fresh look. Rough, cracked, or chapped lips can look less than appealing when you apply your lip gloss. To do this simply you can:


Buy a lip scrub from a local cosmetics store or the cosmetics section of your local drug store.

Make your own lip scrub.
Apply a small amount of petroleum jelly to your lips and then gently scrub with a soft bristle toothbrush., Exfoliation can leave your lips feeling irritated. You should apply a moisturizer, like petroleum jelly or lip balm, to soothe any discomfort you feel. Applying lip gloss to dry, un-moisturized lips can cause the color to cling to dry patches, making your lip gloss look uneven.

, You'll want something that matches your skin tone, but you should also consider about other makeup you will be wearing.If you have several shades available, you should pick a best option and one or two backup colors.


This way, when you apply your lip gloss, if it doesn't work with the rest of your makeup, you can wipe it off before it's too late and use a different shade.
Generally, the following skin tones match with the following shades of gloss:Fair-skinned - light shades, pink, and beigeMedium-toned - rose, mauve, and berryDark-skinned - plum, chocolate, and red, If you're trying to add some edge to your look, you might try using darker, sensual colors, like deep reds. A more innocent look might be achieved with lighter, gentler shades, like pinks and skin tones. Playful color, like oranges, blues, and metallic tones, might be perfect for a fun day out with friends.

, There are three main ways of applying lip gloss, and you can determine the application with a quick look at the lip gloss you plan on using. Take off the cap, and:


If you notice there's a dip-stick with a wand-type applicator on the end, you are using liquid lip gloss. This type can be applied best by dipping the stick in and drag/rubbing it along your lips.If there is a solid stick-type applicator, it's a roll-on variety of lip gloss. For best application, rub on the lip gloss gently in circular motions.
Tube lip gloss should be squeezed out a little bit at a time onto your finger, lip brush, or sponge applicator, then spread gently onto your lips.

, Lip gloss can be a difficult customer, and the last thing you want is for a sticky, clumpy application of gloss to overpower your look. By finishing all of your other makeup beforehand, you'll be able to clearly see if less is more, or if a heavier application is better after all.

, By applying a small amount of petroleum jelly or lip balm to your lips evenly, you can extend the life of your lip gloss. Simply take your finger or an applicator and rub a small amount on your lips, removing any unnecessarily thick or clumpy parts with tissue or Q-tips.

, To make this look appear natural, you'll have to gently blend in the lip pencil when applying your lip gloss.


To bring out your mouth shape with a lip pencil, trace your pencil from the middle part of your top lip and follow its border until you reach the corner. Repeat this for both sides for both top and bottom lip.

, Lipstick can be given extra pop with a clear lip gloss. This kind of application has the added benefit of protecting your lipstick from coming off. If you are afraid of your lipstick smearing or rubbing off, lip gloss is a great option!


You can also blend different colors of lipstick and gloss. You'll likely want to stick with similar shades, but you never know the effect you might end up with.

, Likely you'll have some kind of applicator, be it a wand, roll-on tube, or sponge. Administer your lip gloss onto its applicator, and then, while looking in a wall mirror or compact, put the gloss on the part of your lip that protrudes the most from your face. For most this is the middle of the bottom lip. Then:


Spread your lip gloss lightly toward the edges of the same lip.
Press your bottom and top lips together to spread the gloss from one lip to the other.
Observe the cleanness of your application and use Q-tips and tissues to correct any mistakes.

This process can be a bit tricky, and it’s not uncommon to burn the paste, which is a nightmare to get off the pan.For safe measure, use a pan that you could stand to lose.


As you heat your mixture it will boil and bubble up, so make sure your saucepan is big enough that it doesn’t overflow.;
, This is the simple white sugar that you probably have around the house, or can find at any grocery store. It’s important to use white sugar for this recipe. Color changes are the main indicator used to determine if your paste is finished, so white sugar should be the base of your paste.If you want to make a smaller recipe, simply halve all of the ingredients. However, body sugaring paste can easily be put into a container and saved, so don’t worry if you create way more than you need for one session.

, You can squeeze the juice from fresh lemons or buy lemon juice from the store, as long as you get a full fourth of a cup. Pour it into the cane sugar, and then add a quarter cup of water. Using a spatula or large spoon, mix the three ingredients together until thoroughly blended., It is important that your mixture gets to a boil, but try to raise the temperature slowly and carefully so that the paste doesn’t burn. Don’t step away from the stove, especially if this is your first time making body sugaring paste. It can be tricky to get it hot enough without it burning, so you need to be vigilant.It will be obvious if it starts burning, because it will turn a very dark, almost black color.

, Don’t turn the heat on and leave your pot unattended. Keep stirring it over and over again, making sure that it never sticks to the pot.As your mixture reaches a boil, it will begin to thin out. When you see it start to bubble it’s almost there, but make sure you allow it to get to a full-fledged boil.If you own a candy thermometer, use it here. Your mixture should reach 250 degrees Fahrenheit, which is the ""hardball"" candy stage., You can use a plate, a napkin, a piece of paper, or anything. This will allow you to examine the color. Your finished product should be a golden color. When your mixture has reached a boil and is that color, turn your heat off. Make sure you’re still stirring.

, Instead of the ingredients outlined previously, you will be using one cup of sugar, 1/4 a cup of honey, and juice from half of a lemon (about two tablespoons). Combine these ingredients in a microwave-safe bowl and stir until everything is blended. Then, heat your mixture in the microwave for two minutes.Don't go anywhere as it heats. You need to stir your mixture every 20 to 30 seconds.
After two minutes are up, let it cool off a bit to use or store.

, This is especially important if you are going to use some of it right now for hair removal. You want it to be warm, but not hot, or else you can seriously burn yourself.You can learn how to use your finished body sugaring paste here. Even if you aren’t going to use it immediately, let it cool off before you transfer it into a container.

, It’s important that the container can be heated, because you will want to give your paste a quick reheat before using it in the future. Store your body sugaring paste at room temperature. This will keep it from thickening, and make reheating an easier process.If you don’t have a microwave to use, you can always run your container under hot water to heat the paste.

, If it thickens up a bit, add a few drops of water before placing it in the microwave. Heat your paste so that it’s warm, not hot. Again, it is easy to burn yourself with this so take extra precautions. When you reheat the paste, it will thicken a bit."

Use body scrubs containing abrasive exfoliates, such as sugar, on tough, calloused areas. If you use an abrasive scrub, then you may have to moisturize your skin afterwards with lotion or body butter.
Use body scrubs containing moisturizing exfoliants, such as sugar, on the rest of the body.
If you want to use your scrub on your face or lips, then avoid abrasive exfoliants. Use essential oils and colorants with caution to avoid irritation.;
, You will need 2 parts of exfoliant to 1 part carrier oil. There are many different types of exfoliant you can use in your body scrub, and each one has its own benefits and drawbacks.


Epsom salts are great for detoxifying and moisturizing the skin. They are not very abrasive and can be used on the rest of the body.
Ground coffee helps tighten the blood vessels and may help varicose veins go away for a little bit. It is also good for making the skin appear brighter.Oatmeal is gentle and moisturizing. It also helps your skin feel softer.
Salt is harsher and more abrasive than other exfoliants, which makes it perfect for tough, calloused areas like elbows, knees, and heels. Sea salt is particularly good for detoxifying the skin and unblocking pores.Sugar is the most common exfoliant found in body scrubs. It's gentler than some other exfoliants, such as salt, and good for reintroducing moisture into the skin.You can use white sugar or brown sugar.

, You will need 1 part carrier oil to 2 parts of exfoliant. There are many different types of oil you can use, so long as they are intended for cooking purposes. Each oil has different properties, such as scent and consistency, and some might help reduce skin problems, such as dryness.


Avocado oil is rich, thick, and moisturizing. It is good for dry and sensitive skin types.Coconut oil is thick, luxurious, and moisturizing. You will need to melt it first either in a saucepan over the stove or in a microwave.

, If you do not wish to use a carrier oil, you can use something else instead. You can also combine your carrier oil with another liquid ingredient. For example:


Honey can be used instead of a carrier oil, or it can be combined with a carrier oil. It is a great cleanser and moisturizer. It can also be used in lip scrubs.
Milk soothes and moisturizes the skin. It will also create a thinner body scrub. It can be added to the oil, or used in place of it. If you add milk to your scrub, use it within a few days.Yogurt is great for moisturizing and brightening the skin. Like honey, it can be substituted for the carrier oil, or it can be used in combination with the carrier oil. If you choose to use yogurt in your scrub, use it within a few days., Essential oils can not only add fragrance to your scrub, but they can also help remedy skin problems, such as acne and excessive dryness. Some essential oils are also used in aromatherapy and can help lighten your mood.

It can help moisturize dry skin as well.Tea tree oil is good for all skin types, especially oily skin, and can help remedy acne.Ylang ylang essential oil is good for oily skin. It is also a home remedy for acne. Consider using this in a facial scrub., Do you want your scrub to just exfoliate your skin, or do you want it to have additional properties?


Activated charcoal is great for facial scrubs. It can be mixed in with other exfoliants, such as sugar, or used in place of one. It is great for detoxifying skin and clearing out blackheads.
Baking soda is also great for facial scrubs, and is often used as a home remedy for acne. It can be added to other exfoliants, or used on its own.
Cocoa butter and shea butter can make your scrub luxurious and moisturizing. You may have to soften or melt your butter in the microwave first, before adding it to your scrub.
Herbal teas can be added to your scrub. There are different types of teas that help remedy different types of skin problems. Chamomile and green teas are great for all skin types. Peppermint, sage, and thyme are great for oily skin, while calendula, lavender, and rose are beneficial for dry skin.Lemon and grapefruit juice can help freshen and brighten the skin. It can also add some aroma to your scrub.

, You can leave your body scrub plain, as it is, or you can choose to add some color and shimmer.


Mica powders, purchased from soap-making shops, will make your body scrub shimmery.
Soap colorants can add color to your scrub. They come either in liquid form, in dye blocks, or as powders.
Food coloring can also add color to your scrub.
Fruit can add some color and scent to your body scrub. Consider crushing some berries or squeeze juice from a citrus and adding that to your scrub. If you choose to do this, however, use your scrub within a few days.

, You can start out with 1 cup of exfoliant, or use 2 parts exfoliant to 1 part carrier oil.

, You can start out with ¼ to ½ cup of carrier oil. The less oil you use, the more abrasive your scrub will be, and the more oil you use, the more moisturizing it will be. You can also use 1 part carrier oil to 2 parts exfoliant.


Consider substituting your carrier oil with honey, milk, or yogurt.
If your carrier oil is particularly thick, like coconut oil, you will need to melt it in a saucepan over a stove, or in a heat-resistant cup in the microwave.

, Use a large wooden spoon or a spatula to mix your ingredients together. The exfoliant will not completely dissolve, which is what you want. You will end up with a grainy texture. If you want your scrub to be more abrasive, then add more of your exfoliant. If you want your scrub to be smoother and gentler, then add more of your carrier oil.


At this point, you can put your scrub into a jar, or you can continue adding other ingredients.

, If you choose to use essential oil in your scrub, you can add it now. Use anywhere between 5 to 10 drops. If you are using a small amount of exfoliant and carrier oil, then you may have to use less essential oil.

, If you are adding additional ingredients, such as honey, fruit juices, or colorants, do so now.


For liquid dyes and food coloring, start with a few drops. Do not add too much, or else you risk coloring your skin. You want the color to the subtle and pale.
For powder colorants and mica powders, start with a pinch or too. As with the liquid colorants, you do not want to add too much, or else you will risk staining your skin.
For other ingredients, such as butters, herbal teas, honey, juices, and yogurt, start with 1 tablespoon, and continue adding more to your taste. If you are making a smaller batch, then start with a smaller amount, such as a teaspoon.
If your scrub is starting to get too runny and lose its grainy texture, the exfoliant might just be settling. Give it a stir. If that does not help, you have added too many additives. Remedy this by adding in more of your exfoliant.

, Once you have finished adding your optional ingredients, such as essential oils, additives, and dyes, you will need to stir your scrub again to mix everything together.

, Once you have finished combining all of your ingredients, transfer your scrub into a container and store it in the refrigerator. You can use any container you want, as long as it has a lid. The best containers have a lid that either screws on, or closes with a latch.

, Because you made your body scrub at home, it does not have the preservatives that many commercial scrubs do. Keep the container sealed and store it in the fridge when you are not using it.

, You can rub the scrub over your skin while you are taking a bath or shower. Be sure to rinse it off.


If you are using a lip scrub, simply rub it over your lips, and either wash it off or lick it off.

, Instead, treat yourself to your body scrub once or twice a week. Using it too much may over-exfoliate your skin and irritate it.

, Body scrubs can make great, customizable gifts for birthdays, bridesmaids, Mother's Day, and other occasions. Put your body scrub into a glass jar and give it away as a gift. You can customize your jar as well:


Design and print a colorful label. You can put this label on the jar itself, or on the lid.
Paint the lid of the jar a color that compliments the color of the scrub.
Use chalkboard paint to paint a patch on the jar, then use chalk to write a message on the ""label"" once the paint dries.
Tie twine or ribbon around the jar.

, Homemade beauty products are popular, and you can even start your own business selling them. Consider opening a shop online, or selling your products at farmers' markets or art and wine festivals.


If you are selling your products online, do not make them in advance. Body scrubs are perishable, and you do not want to sell your customer an expired product, or a product that will expire before he or she can enjoy it.

Store your oils in bottles made from dark, semi-opaque glass, the size of a small perfume bottle. The small size lets you work with quantities that you can use up before they break down, while minimizing headspace (air inside the bottle) that speeds up decay.Use bottles with a tight cap or cork.;
, You can make a simple body oil with one essential oil and one carrier oil. However, many people prefer to make their own customized mixes. To start with, decide on a ""top note"" for your perfumed body oil. This is a bright or sharp aroma that will grab your attention when you first smell the mixture, but it will not last long.


Examples include peppermint, basil, and most citrus oils.(Be careful: many citrus oils can cause severe burns if applied to skin and exposed to sunlight.)
If you need more ideas, smell the oils at a brick-and-mortar essential oils store, or the herbs at a plant nursery or grocery store., Also called the heart note, this oil usually has a full-bodied, complex scent. It lasts one or two hours on a perfume testing strip. You can choose a middle note to serve as the main theme of the scent. Alternatively, pick one that shares elements of the top and base notes, to help the bottle harmonize.Good choices include chamomile, ginger, rose, and many other herbal and flowery scents., For a classic three-note mix, the last essential oil you'll need is the base note. This should last at least a few hours, as its main purpose is to give the blend staying power. Many oils used as base notes are also fixatives, which slow down the rate of evaporation of the other scents.Try deep, strong scents such as vanilla or sandalwood.
Once you've made your three choices, put a couple drops of each on a cotton round and waft the scent toward you for a rough test. If you're not a fan, change on of your choices., You must dilute essential oils with a carrier oil before applying them to your skin. Unless you plan to use the body oil quickly, choose one with a long shelf life, such as fractionated coconut oil or canola oil. Also consider whether you prefer a thin or thick oil, and the scent of the oil. Beginners may wish to choose a carrier oil with little to no scent, such as sweet almond oil, so they can focus on combining the three essential oils.


You can use oil from a grocery store, or you may prefer to buy a product specifically intended for aromatherapy, and free from additives.
These are often referred to as ""base oils."" Don't confuse them with ""base notes.""

, If you haven't applied one or more of your chosen essential oils to your skin before, conduct a patch test. This is especially important if you are taking medication or if you have known allergies. Use this procedure:Dilute a couple drops of essential oil in carrier oil, to twice the concentration you plan to use (see below for details).
Wet the inside of a bandage with the mixture and place on your inner arm.
Remove the bandage after 48 hours. If there is any redness or itchiness, do not use that oil.

, Fill your bottle (or bottles) with water nearly to the top, then pour it into a measuring cup. Write down the number of milliliters the bottle holds. Multiply this number by 20 to get an estimate of the number of drops that fit in the bottle.If you don't have a milliliter measure, 1 US fluid ounce is close to 30 mL.
For example, if you plan to make a large batch of 50 mL, your bottle holds 50 mL x 20 drops/mL = 1,000 drops.

, Adults who plan to use the body oil across a large area of their body should dilute the essential oil to 1%. If you plan to use it as a perfume or for a small area, you can safely try 3 or 5%.For a 1% dilution, multiply the number of drops your bottle holds by 0.01.


For example, if you have a 1,000-drop bottle and plan to dilute to 1%, you'll need 1000 x 0.01 = 10 total drops of essential oil.
Expensive essential oils are often sold in diluted form to make them affordable. If the label says it's already 5% diluted, multiply the number of drops by 20 (since 100% ÷ 5% = 20).

, As a starting point, try 2 parts base note, 1 part middle note, and 2 parts top note.If you're not sure how to calculate that in terms of drops, follow this example:


This ratio uses 5 ""parts"" total (2 + 1 + 2). There are 10 total drops of essential oil, so to divide it into five parts calculate 10 ÷ 5 = 2 drops per part.
2 parts base note x 2 drops/part = 4 drops base note.
1 part middle note x 2 drops/part = 2 drops middle note.
2 parts top note x 2 drops/part = 4 drops top note.
Sometimes the math doesn't work out neatly, and you can't get a perfect ratio. Just get as close as you can.
This isn't the only recipe you can use. If you want your middle note to be the centerpiece, you can go as high as a 1:3:1 ratio., Count out the drops of each essential oil according to the calculations you just did. Add these all to a glass bottle, and swirl it around so they mix together.

, Since all that math was based on the size of the bottle, you don't need to count out the drops. Just fill the bottle up with carrier oil as full as you can. Close the lid tightly and shake for a minute or two to make sure the oils are spread evenly throughout.


If you planned to fill multiple bottles, fill them all with carrier oil and pour them into one larger bottle. Shake to combine, then distribute it among each of the smaller bottles.
At this stage you can smell the oil and mix in another drop or two of essential oil to change the characteristics. Remember that adding too much can increase the concentration to levels that irritate the skin.

, Seal the bottle tightly and place it in a box or on a shelf away from direct sunlight. Essential oils can last up to 2 years, but some citrus essential oils and many carrier oils have a shorter shelf life. To maximize the shelf life, transfer the oil into smaller bottles as you use it so there is never much air trapped in the bottle.Keep it out of reach of children.


Discard the oil if it smells very different than it did fresh, if it thickens, or if it turns cloudy.
Refrigerating the oil can help, but it's usually not necessary, and many carrier oils solidify in the fridge. If you do store it here, let the oil warm up to room temperature before using.

, Cut the tallow into small pieces and melt the tallow over a low flame on the stove in a pot. Stir as needed.

, Pour the lye into the water slowly. The addition of lye to the water will generate heat, so handle the containers carefully. Stir the solution gently.

, When the tallow has been rendered, remove the tallow from heat and stir.

, The tallow and the lye solution should both be about 95 degrees F (35 degrees C) for proper mixing.

, Pour the lye solution slowly into the tallow and stir vigorously.

, Pour salt into the completed mixture and continue stirring. Add salt until the thick syrup formed floats to the surface with a pool of fluid formed beneath it. Stop stirring.

, When the mixture has cooled to a consistency that can be scooped out of the pot with a large straining spoon, do so. What remains in the pot will be a liquid with some impurities and salt mixed in. The liquid is glycerin.


Decide how to use the syrup. The syrup is actually hard soap. The syrup can be remelted and poured into molds to make bars of soap. Alternatively, the syrup may be discarded in any manner as it is not hazardous.

, After the glycerin has cooled, pour the glycerin through a fine strainer to filter out most of the impurities. This will not remove all of the dissolved salt. The glycerin must be distilled to remove the diluted salt. The result is a finished quantity of glycerin.

Take the pot out of the ice water and use the pasteurized milk.",How to Make Goat Milk Lotion," If you don't keep all your pots, bowls, spoons, and containers clean, you might introduce bacteria into your lotion. This can lead to rashes and infections.Everything you use must be kept clean and dry. Rinsing with tap water is not enough, as tap water often contains bacteria that might contaminate your equipment and lotion.;
, Once you are done sanitizing your equipment, be sure to dry everything with clean paper towels. You can sanitize your equipment in two ways:


Spray your equipment down with rubbing alcohol. Then, wipe everything dry with clean paper towels.
Soak your equipment in a solution of bleach and water. Use 1 ounce (29.6 milliliters) bleach for every gallon (3.8 liters) of water., Fill a bowl with water and a few pumps of dish soap. Add a splash of bleach. Beat the water with the blender for a few minutes. Stop the blender and rinse it out. Dry it off with some clean paper towels and pour out the soapy bleach water., Any trace of water, especially tap water, gives bacteria a chance to develop and breed.

, Set the pot on the stove and keep an eye on it at all times. Be sure to stir it from time to time so that the milk does not scorch. Use your thermometer to check the temperature.


The goat's milk must be pasteurized. If your bottle says ""raw"" or ""non-pasteurized,"" you will need to pasteurize it. Click here to learn how to do this.

, Fill the bottom pot with 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) of water. Place the larger pot on top and move everything to the stove. If you do not have a double boiler, you can make your own by filling a large pot with 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) of water, and placing another pot or glass bowl on top of it. The bottom of the upper pot or bowl should not be touching the water.

, Argan, avocado, coconut, jojoba, or sweet almond oil are all great options. You can use just one oil, or a combination, so long as you end up with 2.7 ounces (79.85 milliliters). For example, you can use 1.7 ounce (50.28) sweet almond oil and 1 ounce (29.57 milliliters) avocado oil.You can also use avocado butter or cocoa butter instead of shea butter., This will make it easier to mix the rest of the ingredients into them. Be sure to stir the oils and butters from time to time so that they melt evenly.

, Stearic acid is used by soap makers to help thicken lotions. If you want a thicker lotion, add the stearic acid.


You can purchase both ingredients online at a soap making supply shop.

, You will need to blend for about two to five minutes., Each preservative has a different temperature requirement. Make sure that the temperature of the lotion falls within the recommended parameters of the preservative.

, Preservatives are not absolutely necessary, but they will make your lotion last longer. You will also be able to keep your lotion on the shelf. If you do not add preservatives, you will need to store your lotion in the fridge and use it within two weeks.The most common preservatives used by soap and lotion markers are: Germall Powder, Optiphen, and Phenonip. You can purchase them online from soap making supply shops.
You can find soap making fragrances in arts and crafts stores.
You can find essential oils in all-natural food stores. You may also find them in arts and crafts stores.
You can use any scent you want for your lotion. Lavender, rose, rosemary, or almond would work well in a goat's milk lotion.

,, You can use a spoon or spatula to do this. Try to use a glass bottle instead of plastic, as glass is less likely to harbor bacteria.Glass also does not leach out chemicals like plastic does.


Consider adding a pretty label. You can draw your own label on a piece of pretty paper or print one out. Attach the label to the front of the jar with a wide piece of clear packaging tape. You can also decoupage it on using glossy Mod Podge.

, This will lessen the chances of you touching the lotion that is still inside the bottle. If you use a jar, you will be constantly touching the lotion inside. This will increase the chances of bacteria getting inside the jar and breeding. With a pump dispenser, you won't actually be touching the lotion while it is inside the container. This will lessen the chances of it becoming contaminated.

, The preservatives will extend the shelf life of the goat's milk, but only by a little bit. They will not be enough to make the lotion last forever.

, If you do not do this, the lotion will spoil and become dangerous to use.

, Goat's milk contains lactic acid. This helps get rid of dead skin cells that lead to dryness, flakiness, and other skin irritations.The high fat content of goat's milk is also super moisturizing, making it perfect for those with dry skin.

, Goat's milk has plenty of Vitamin A, which is important to repairing damaged skin and keeping skin healthy. Some find that Goat's milk also gives psoriasis relief., Not all goat's milk comes pasteurized. This means that it contains both good and bad bacteria. You need to pasteurize it, or the bad bacteria will breed and grow and cause your lotion to spoil.


If the milk carton says that the milk has been pasteurized, you won't need to pasteurize it.

, Add enough cold water into your sink so that the pot you will be using to pasteurize your milk will not be completely submerged. The water level should not go past more than two-thirds past the side of the pot. Add a lot of ice into the water; you need the water to be very cold. You will be using this for the ice bath later on.

, Make sure that you have a thermometer on hand and ready. The next few steps will go by very quickly.

,, Do not allow the water to enter the pot.You are simply using the ice water to cool down the milk.

, Once the milk has cooled down, take the pot out of the water and set it aside. Drain the ice water from the sink. Your milk is now bacteria free and safe to use in lotion.

This is a beeswax-based moisturizer, so it is best to use it on the body and not on the face.

, Chop up the beeswax into smaller pieces first, then place it into the bowl. Turn the heat to medium, and wait until the wax starts to melt. Stir it occasionally with a spoon to help it melt faster. This will create the base for your moisturizer.

, Keep stirring until the coconut oil melts and gets evenly mixed into the melted beeswax. Coconut oil is naturally moisturizing, but some people find that it clogs pores. If you tend to get a lot of blackheads or acne, you may wish to omit it or replace it with shea butter.

, Keep stirring these until they melt and combine with the beeswax mixture. All three are wonderful for the skin. They are not completely necessary, but they can take your moisturizer to the next level.

, Carefully lift the bowl off of the saucepan and set it down on your counter. Stir in the sweet almond oil. If you can't find any sweet almond oil, try any of the following:


Apricot seed
Avocado
Jojoba

Place the lotion in a jar or storage container.",How to Make Homemade Lotions2," Add 1 cup (227 g) of pure aloe vera gel, 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of vitamin E oil, and 15 drops of your favorite essential oils to a medium bowl. Use a spoon to carefully blend all of the ingredients together. Set aside for the moment.You can substitute distilled water or herbal tea for the aloe vera gel if you prefer.
The essential oils are mainly to scent the lotion, so you can use any combination that you prefer. Lavender, eucalyptus, lemon, grapefruit, patchouli, rose, and jasmine are good options to consider.
The aloe vera gel mixture needs to come to room temperature. You may want to place the bowl in a larger pot with some warm water. That will help raise the temperature of the mixture so it will be closer to the temperature of the beeswax mixture that you’ll eventually add it to so it will blend easier.

, Place ½ cup (114 g) of grated beeswax and ½ cup (109 g) of sweet almond oil in a glass measuring cup, jar, or bowl. Set the glass container in a small pot with water, and bring the water to a boil over medium-high heat until the beeswax melts completely, which should take 10 to 15 minutes. Remove the beeswax mixture from the heat.Stir the beeswax occasionally as it’s melting to ensure that it heats evenly.
You can usually purchase beeswax at local farmers' markets, health food stores, and organic grocery stores. It's also available at a wide range of online retailers.

, Pour the beeswax mixture into the pitcher of a blender, and allow it to cool for 5 to 7 minutes. Next, turn the blender on low to gently blend the mixture., With the blender still on low, pour the aloe vera gel mixture into the beeswax mixture in a slow, steady stream. Continue blending the mixture until it has creamy, whipped consistency, which should take approximately 15 seconds.You may need to stop the blender periodically as you’re blending the lotion to scrape down the sides of the pitcher with a spatula so all of the ingredients are incorporated.
If liquid pools at the top of the lotion mixture, stop the blender and push it into the cream with the spatula before blending again.

, Once the lotion has reached the proper consistency, stop the blender. Use a spatula to carefully transfer the lotion to storage jar or container with a lid. The lotion should stay fresh for 2 to 3 months.If you don’t plan to use the lotion within 2 to 3 months, store it in the refrigerator. That can help prolong its life for another 2 to 3 months.

Let sit for 15-20 minutes.",How to Make Lotion1," Every lotion is a bit different (that's part of the reason there are so many varieties available in stores) and there is no wrong way to go about making it. For this basic concoction, you'll need:









2-3 tbsp (30-45 g) distilled water (or substitute aloe vera gel)
1/2 cup (4 oz) grapeseed oil (or coconut, jojoba, etc.)
2 tbsp (30 g) beeswax
Vitamin E oil or capsule
Essential oil(s) (a few drops ought to do it);
, Do this slowly -- you don't want to scorch your materials. Patience will result in a better product.









Some schools of thought suggest using a double boiler -- if you have the means, this is a good, safe method of melting.

, Place the mixture into a large glass bowl. Don't wait to do this -- if your mixture overcooks, it may not form.









Your pan will clean with soap and water; don't worry. Soak it now to go easy on your scrubbing elbows (or dishwasher).

, For a thicker, more butter-like consistency, add less water. Mix with a hand mixer until your scented potion becomes thick.









Rose water is also a good alternative to distilled water, if that matches the scent you are aiming to produce. It's easy to find in grocery stores, too.

, It needs time to thicken up and congeal. It does not have to be covered or moved to a cool area -- simply leave it on the counter and walk away.









When adequate time has passed and your lotion has formed, scoop 'er into a glass jar or other lotion-worthy container. Throw a tag on it and wrap it up for a personal, thoughtful gift!

22 oz distilled water or aloe vera gel
1/2 tsp (pinch) cinnamon
1/2 tsp (pinch) citric acid
1/2 tsp potassium sorbate (if available)
1 tsp (5 g) each of selected herbs
1 teabag of your choice
5 oz scented oil
5 tbsps (75 g) emulsifying wax or shredded beeswax
1 tbsp (15 g) stearic acid
1 tsp (5 g) honey
1/8 teaspoon (dash) vitamin E oil or rosemary extract

, Once bubbling adequately, reduce the heat to medium. Add the cinnamon, citric acid and potassium sorbate (if you have it -- it's not imperative that you do).









Once dissolved, add 1 teaspoon (5 g) each of the herbs you picked and one teabag of your choice. After everything has simmered for 10 minutes on medium, reduce heat to low and continue simmering for another 30 minutes.

, In a small pot or pan, add 5 oz of your chosen oil combined with 5 tablespoons (75 g) emulsifying wax or shredded beeswax (6 if you don't have stearic acid), 1 tablespoon (15 g) stearic acid (2 if you like it really thick), 1 teaspoon (5 g) honey and approximately 1/8 teaspoon vitamin E oil or rosemary extract.









Don't worry about mixing it yet; that'll come. You have more things to do right now!

, Alternatively, use the bottom of your double boiler. Strain the herb mixture into a large mixing bowl, squeezing all the good juice out of the herbs and teabag.









You'll be adding all the ingredients into this bowl, so make sure it can contain everything!

, Not a second more! The last thing you want is for it to overcook. Stir it often and don't let the oil get too hot -- that's the point of the double boiler. Remove from heat immediately when it reaches this point.









Though it may take time and feel like you're watching paint dry, keep an eye on this bowl. You'll want to be there to keep stirring and making sure nothing goes awry.

, Be careful; this stuff can burn! It's fine to let the mixtures cool down a little, but they do have to be hot to mix. Blend on medium for two minutes.









This can be done in a blender, but it's possible your blender won't be the same afterward, so if you're attached to yours, don't use it.

, Add up to 1 drop of essential or fragrance oil per two ounces of total mixture. Mixture will be watery until it cools and sets, so don't be alarmed if it seems runny.









Wait one or two hours before pouring mixture into the bottles. You don't want it too hot or it will melt the plastic and it will still have many air bubbles. Use a funnel or turkey baster for easy pouring.

, This recipe will last up to 3 months out of the refrigerator under normal conditions. Don't leave it in the hot sun or direct sunlight. That's a recipe for lotion 911.

Combine the sugar and oil.,
Mix in the essential oil.,
Transfer the scrub to a jar with a lid.",How to Make a Homemade Hand Scrub1," Add ⅔ cup (150 g) of sugar and ¼ cup (52 g) of fractionated coconut oil or olive oil to a medium size bowl. Use a spoon to mix the ingredients together so they’re fully combined.If you don’t have fractionated coconut oil, you can melt solid coconut oil in the microwave.
The sugar and oil mixture should have the texture of semi-dry sand. Adjust the amounts of each ingredient accordingly if you find that the mixture is too thick or too thin.;
, When the sugar and oil mixture has reached the proper consistency, add 15 drops of lemon essential oil to the bowl. Stir well to incorporate the essential oil throughout the scrub.If you don’t have lemon essential oil, you can substitute 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of fresh lemon juice.
You can also mix some lemon zest into the scrub to increase the lemon scent.

, When the scrub is completely mixed, carefully spoon it into a glass jar. Make sure that the container has a lid so the scrub will be airtight. Leave it next to your kitchen or bathroom sink, and scoop out a small amount to massage over your hands when they get rough.After massaging the scrub over your hands, rinse it off with warm water and pat your hands dry with a clean towel.

Add the sugar to a container.,
Pour the dish soap in a little at a time.,
Mix in the essential oil.",How to Make a Homemade Hand Scrub2," Add 2 parts of sugar to the glass container that you plan to store your scrub in. The jar or container should be approximately ⅔ full with the sugar. It’s important to leave space at the top to add the dish soap.You can make as large or as small batches of the scrub as you’d like by adjusting how much sugar you use. The scrub makes an ideal gift, so you can make a large batch, divide it between several jars, and give it out during the holiday season.

, When the sugar is in place, slowly begin to pour 1 part of a moisturizing liquid dish soap into the container. Stop after adding a small amount to mix it with the sugar for a thick paste-like consistency, and repeat the process until you’ve added all of the soap.You can find moisturizing liquid dish soap at the grocery store. It usually contains skin care ingredients that make more soothing and hydrating than other dish soaps.
If the consistency of your scrub isn’t right, simply add more sugar to make it thicker or mix in more soap to thin it out.
It’s usually easier to use a fork to mix the sugar and soap rather than a spoon.

, Once the scrub has reached the right consistency, add 3 to 5 drops of peppermint essential oil. Mix the oil in well with a fork to ensure that the scent is distributed throughout the scrub.If you prefer, you can use another essential oil. Lime, lemon, and lavender are all nice options.

, Once the salt and coconut oil are fully combined, mix in 5 to 7 drops of grapefruit essential oil. Stir the scrub well to distribute the fragrance throughout the mixture.You can use other citrus essential oils if you prefer, such as lemon, lime, or orange.

Look for something that is wide enough for your to reach into. The jar should be able to hold at least 10 ounces (295.74 milliliters).;
, Foot scrubs are meant to scrub away the dead skin cells, leaving your feet feeling refreshed and silky soft, so you will need 1 cup of Epsom salt, sea salt, or sugar. Here are the benefits of each exfoliant:


Epsom salt contains magnesium sulfide. It not only scrubs away dead skin cells, but it also soothes muscles, reduces inflammation, and makes skin feel soft. It is perfect for tired feet.Sea salt has coarse grains, which makes it great at exfoliating away dead skin cells and buffing calluses. It is also rich in minerals and helps remove toxins from the skin.Sugar smells sweet, so it won't leave your feet feeling as refreshed, but it also has the smoothest grains, which makes it more suitable for those with tender skin., Without oil, the scrub will be dry and harsh. You can make it moisturizing by adding ¼ cup (56.25 milliliters) of sweet almond oil, coconut oil, or olive oil. Slowly stir the oil into your salt or sugar until you get a wet, grainy consistency. If your scrub is too wet, add more salt or sugar. If you exfoliant is too dry, add more oil. Here are the benefits of each type of oil:Sweet almond oil helps clear dead skin cells. You might want to pass on this oil if you are allergic to nuts, however.
Coconut oil is extra moisturizing. It comes in solid form, so you will need to soften it by heating it in the microwave for a few seconds.
Olive oil is the most readily-available oil. You might even have it in your kitchen. Full of beneficial vitamins, it is also moisturizing, which makes it perfect for those with dry skin.

, How much essential oil you add will depend on how fragrant you want your scrub to be. The best types of essential oils for foot scrubs are those with clean, refreshing smells, such as eucalyptus, lavender, lemon, mint, orange, and peppermint. You can even combine essential oils to create new and unique fragrances. Here are some ideas:Cinnamon powder and peppermint essential oil will remind you of Christmas, and are best paired with sugar and olive oil. Avoid using peppermint oil if you're pregnant, however.Lavender and vanilla would work especially well in a sugar-based scrub.
Citrus and mint smell refreshing, and would work especially well when paired with coconut oil. This will give you more of a tropical feel.
Lemon and rosemary smell refreshing, and would work best in salt-based scrubs.

, Your foot scrub will be either white or a pale-golden color (depending on the oil you use). You can make it more interesting by adding a few drops of food coloring. Keep in mind that the food coloring will only add color to the scrub, so if your scrub has a golden tint to it and you add purple food coloring, you will get brown instead. Try matching the color of the scrub to the scent. Here are some ideas:


If you have a lemon-scented scrub, either leave it white or use a few drops of yellow food coloring.
If you have a eucalyptus, mint, or peppermint-scented scrub, leave it white or add a few drops of green food coloring. If you do not have green food coloring, then use yellow and blue food coloring instead.
If you used lavender essential oil in your scrub, then tint it with some purple food coloring. If you do not have purple food coloring, then use red and blue food coloring instead.

, Stir everything with a spoon until everything is combined. The scrub will be wet and grainy.

, If you mixed everything in a bowl, transfer your scrub into a sealable container. Make sure that you can put the lid on tightly so that your scrub does not dry out.


Consider decorating your container with a homemade label and some twine tied around the lid.

, You can use your bathtub, or you can use a small plastic basin that is large enough to comfortably fit both of your feet. For a more pampering effect, you can purchase a footbath; these foot baths are just the right size for feet and often include a massaging jet stream.

, Use a temperature that is comfortable for you. The water should come up just past your ankles.

, If you are using your foot scrub in the bathtub, you can just sit down in the tub or on the ledge. If you are using a basin, then you can sit down in a comfortable chair and place the tub on the floor in front of the chair.

, Soak your feet for a few minutes. If you are wearing long pants, be sure to roll the cuffs up so that they don't get wet.

, You will need a small handful—enough to cover your entire foot. If you use too little, the scrub won't be thick enough. A thinly-spread scrub will not be very effective., Gently rub the scrub over your feet using circular motions. Do this for about five minutes.If you wish, you can also use a pedicure brush or pumice stone to buff away calluses.

, Gently lower your feet back into the water, and massage them with your hands to get the scrub off. If your water became dirty, then you will need to rinse your feet off in the bathtub using fresh water. There may be some oily residue left on your feet from the scrub, which is normal.

, Once your feet are clean, take them out of the water and gently pat them dry with a soft, clean towel. Apply some moisturizer to help keep your feet feeling soft and smooth.

, You can use this scrub 2 to 3 times a week. Keep in mind that this scrub is abrasive, so if you use it too often, it may begin to irritate the skin on your feet.

, This recipe makes just enough scrub for one treatment. With ingredients such as sugar, honey, and vanilla extract, this sweet-smelling scrub smells almost good enough to eat. Here is what you will need to make this delicious-smelling scrub:1 tablespoon sugar

A gentle natural oil will clean and moisturize your skin without stripping it like soap can.“Non-comedogenic” means that the oil will not clog your pores and cause acne. (You should also look for the “non-comedogenic” label on cosmetics and anything else you put on your skin.) Choose a pure, organic oil that is cold-pressed for best results.
The American Academy of Dermatology uses a ranking from 0-5 to determine how likely a substance is to clog pores. 0 will almost never clog pores, and 5 will very likely clog pores.Hemp seed oil (0) is rated a 0 out of 5. It is a relative of the cannabis plant and contains sterols, antioxidants, and essential fatty acids, but very low levels of THC (the “active” compound in cannabis).Shea butter (0) needs to be gently heated before using and is usually sold as a wax. It is high in vitamin E, an antioxidant.Sunflower oil (0) contains polyunsaturated fatty acids and vitamin E.Argan oil (0) is rich in vitamin E, carotenes, and essential fatty acids. It is also used to treat skin infections.Castor oil (1) can treat inflammation. It contains essential fatty acids and a natural anti-microbial acid. It may be drying to some people’s skin.Calendula oil (1) may help reduce the appearance of acne scars.Almond (2), hazelnut (2), and olive oil (2) are non-comedogenic for most people.
Experiment with a few base oils. Your skin may react differently than others’.;
, There are several herbal essential oils that contain natural antibacterial or antiseptic qualities. These can help kill the P. acnes bacteria on your skin that causes inflammation. You can find these oils at most natural or health food stores.


Always rub a very small amount of the oil onto the inside of your elbow and wait for a few minutes to determine whether you have a sensitivity to it before using any essential oil on your face.
Do not consume any essential oil internally. Many, such as tea tree oil, are toxic when consumed.
Oregano oil is naturally antibacterial and anti-inflammatory.Tea tree oil is naturally antibacterial and anti-fungal.Lavender oil is naturally antibacterial, and can calm and soothe as well.Rosemary oil is naturally antibacterial and is especially effective against P. acnes.Frankincense oil is naturally antibacterial and anti-inflammatory., Pour 1-3 fluid ounces of your base oil, such as sunflower oil, into a small bowl. Use an eyedropper to add 3-5 drops of essential oil per fluid ounce of base oil. Stir well to combine.


Do not make too much moisturizer at once, as oils can become rancid (spoiled) over time. Make a fresh batch as you need it.
Store your moisturizing oil away from light in a dark brown or blue bottle. Keeping the oil away from light will help it stay fresh.

, If you cannot use oils or you can’t find any of the suggested oils, you can use glycerin and aloe vera gel as a substitute for your base. Mix equal parts of glycerin and aloe vera gel together, then add 3-5 drops of herbal essential oil per ounce of the base.


Mix thoroughly and store away from the light in a dark brown or blue bottle.
You may need to shake the glycerin mixture before each use.
You can also mix together equal parts of glycerin, aloe vera gel, and rosewater for the base. Rosewater contains vitamins A, C, E, and B3 and antioxidants, and also has anti-inflammatory properties., Do not scrub your face. Scrubbing your skin can cause irritation, redness, even scarring.


Washing your face up to twice daily can help reduce acne.Doctors do not recommend washing your face more than twice a day.Use a mild soap, such as Dove, Cetaphil, or Aveeno., “Exfoliating” often pulls off skin that is not yet ready to fall off on its own, rather like pulling off a scab before it’s ready. It can cause irritation, scarring, and actually increase acne. Avoid using harsh scrubbing brushes or products with “exfoliators” such as micro-beads.Chemical exfoliants, such as salicylic acid and alpha hydroxy acid may help reduce acne, but be careful when applying them as they can also dry out skin., Do not rub or scrub your face dry with a towel. Gently pat your skin dry. This will help avoid skin irritation.

, Many skin products, including cleansers, astringents, toners, and exfoliants, contain alcohol. Alcohol dries out your skin and can make acne worse., Use your fingertips to massage the oil into your face for two minutes using small, circular motions.


Allow the oil to stay on your skin for about 20 seconds.
You can use a cotton-tipped swab to apply this moisturizer to “problem areas” or blemishes. Allow this to stay on all day until your next facial cleanse.

, After you have massaged your oil moisturizer into your skin and allowed it to sit for 20 seconds, use a clean, dry washcloth to pat off any oil that hasn’t soaked into your skin.


Don’t rub vigorously or scrub with the washcloth. Gently pat your skin until the excess oil is absorbed.

, Moisturize after you wash your face, once in the morning and once at night.


At night, you can leave the extra oil on your skin overnight for extra moisturizing. Don’t use the washcloth to wipe off extra oil before bedtime.
You can also apply this moisturizer to other areas of your body where you may have acne.

, If you have used this moisturizer and a gentle cleanser for one to two weeks and your acne shows no signs of improvement, see your doctor. You may also need to get a referral to see a dermatologist, who specializes in skin care.


Mild acne is usually considered to be fewer than 20 non-inflamed blackheads or whiteheads, or some mildly inflamed or irritated pimples.Mild acne is often treated with topical products such as benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid.If you have moderate (more than 20-100 pimples, with about 15-50 inflamed or infected) to severe (more than 100 comedones, pimples, pustules, nodules) acne, see your doctor before using any at-home treatment for acne. You may only inflame your current condition with at-home treatments.Many health insurance providers in the US require you to get a referral from your general physician before you can see a specialist such as a dermatologist. Check with your health insurance provider to avoid any surprise costs.

, If natural remedies are not working for you, then your doctor may recommend a benzoyl peroxide product to start. However, if this does not cure your acne, then your doctor may offer you a prescription treatment, such as a topical retinoid medicine, an oral antibiotic, or an oral contraceptive (for women).Oral antibiotics are usually prescribed along with a topical medication to help treat and control infections caused by inflammatory acne. Take the antibiotic exactly as instructed by your doctor.
Discuss all of your treatment options with your doctor. Along with retinoids, other medication options include topical adapalene, tretinoin, and dapsone 5% gel. Topical adapalene and tretinoin are approved for preadolescent children, while dapsone 5% gel is designed to treat inflammatory acne in adults.
Make sure that you use the medicine your doctor prescribes exactly as instructed and tell your doctor about any side effects.

, If the treatment that your doctor recommends or prescribes is not working for you, then follow up and let your doctor know. There are many different treatment options for acne, so you can always try something different if you are not noticing good results within a few weeks of using an acne medicine.


For example, if retinoids are not helpful for your acne, then your doctor may switch you to dapsone 5% gel instead or suggest an oral contraceptive if you are a woman. Isotretinoin is also an effective medicine for moderate to severe acne. However, this medicine can cause some severe side effects, so those who take it must be closely monitored., Acne happens when dead skin cells and sebum (an oil naturally produced by your body) build up in pores, causing them to clog.These clogged pores, called comedones, are what are commonly called “whiteheads” and “blackheads.”A whitehead is a “closed” comedone. The dead skin cells and sebum in the pore are not exposed to the air.A blackhead is an “open” comedone. The dead skin cells and sebum are exposed to the air, causing them to oxygenate and turn black. They are not dirt and cannot be washed away.A type of bacteria that lives on your skin, Propionibacterium acnes, can also get inside pores. This bacteria causes redness and inflammation in the pore. Pimples, cysts, and nodules can result from inflamed pores that fill with pus., There are many causes for acne. Hormonal changes in your body, your skin care regimen, products you use, and stress can all affect acne.A change in hormones, particularly testosterone, can stimulate the glands to produce more oil, causing a greater likelihood of developing acne (hence why it’s often an issue for teens).Acne may also get worse for women who are on their period or pregnant.Some cosmetics and skin-care products, such as lotions, can clog pores and cause acne breakouts. Alcohol-based cleansers and other harsh skin products can cause skin irritation that can lead to acne.
Excessive sweating and tight clothing can cause your pores to clog and lead to acne.Genetics may play a role in who develops acne.
Some sunscreens may irritate your skin and cause acne-like bumps. Choose a sunscreen such as zinc dioxide or titanium dioxide instead., There are many myths about acne. Knowing what does not cause acne can help you make wise, healthy choices and not feel bad about yourself.


A common myth is that acne is caused by diet. No food directly causes acne.However, low-glycemic index (GI) foods, such as whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and yogurt, may reduce the severity of acne.Acne is not caused by poor hygiene. Some evidence suggests that washing your face twice a day is more effective than washing just once for adolescents, but in general, you don’t develop acne because you’re “dirty.”"

Allow the alcohol to evaporate.",How to Extract Oil from Orange Peels1," In order to extract orange oil in a jar, you will need a mason jar, a zester and some grain alcohol. Because it is largely tasteless, vodka works best for creating orange oil. It will not dilute or overwhelm the orange scent in the finished oil.
, The essential oil in oranges, limonene, is largely found in the peel. Because of this, you will want to remove the peels from oranges before making your oil.You can either cut the peel from the orange with a knife or grind off the peel with a zester.For best results, avoid cutting off any of the pith. This part of the orange has very little limonene and will make your mixture bitter.
If you do not have a zester, you can also use a Microplane, a vegetable peeler, or a paring knife.
The amount of oranges used can vary. It depends on how many oranges you have or how much essential oil you want to make.

, Once you have removed the peels, you will need to let them dry. Place them on a paper towel and leave them in direct sunlight until they are completely dry. Depending on the humidity in your area, this can take a couple of days. To accelerate the process, try chopping the orange peels into small pieces (1 in or 2.5 cm)., After the peels have dried, place them in a food processor. Grind them until they are a coarse consistency. Avoid overriding your peels. This can cause them to lose some of their limonene.If you used a Microplane or a zester, you will not need to grind the peels further.

, Fill a bowl with warm tap water. It should be warm but not overly hot (around 90 degrees Fahrenheit or 32 degrees Celsius). Place the bottle of grain alcohol in the warm water and let it soak for about 20 minutes.Vodka works well for this process.
You can use cold alcohol. However, warm alcohol will help you get more oil., Place the zested or ground orange peel in a mason jar. Pour in enough alcohol to completely cover the orange peels. Once you have covered the grinds, secure the lid and vigorously shake the jar for several minutes., During that time, you may also want to shake the mixture two or three times a day. You may also consider letting sit longer than a few days. The more you shake it and the longer you let it sit, the more oil you will get from your mixture., Using a coffee filter or a cheese cloth, strain the mixture into a shallow dish. Be sure to squeeze all of the liquid into the bowl., Cover the bowl with a cloth or paper towel and let it sit for a few days. This will allow the remaining alcohol in the mixture to evaporate. Once the alcohol has evaporated, you will be left with orange oil.Do not let the towel fall into the mixture. It will suck up the oil.
Once the alcohol has evaporated, put the remaining oil in a container with a lid.

Look for gentle creams if you have sensitive skin.",How to Apply Face Cream2," Your skin might change as the seasons go by. For example, it might be more dry in the winter and more oily during the summer. As such, the face cream that you use in the winter might not be suitable during the summer. It might be a good idea to switch your face creams out with the seasons.

, If you have oily skin or acne, you might still want to use some sort of face cream or moisturizer. If your skin becomes too dry, it will produce even more oil. A face cream will keep this from happening. Here are some things you should look for:


Look for face creams that say they are meant for oily skin (or acne) on the label.
Opt for a light-weight, moisturizing gel instead.
Consider getting a matte-finish cream. It will help reduce shine and make your skin appear less oily.

, If you can't find any, then look for labels that say ""hydrating"" or ""moisturizing.""

, Read the labels carefully, and avoid buying anything that has too many chemicals; many of these chemicals can be problematic for sensitive skin types. Consider instead creams that have soothing ingredients, such as aloe or calendula.
