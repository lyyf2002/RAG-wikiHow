Consider adding some 99% isopropyl alcohol and leaving it to dry overnight if you want pressed powder foundation.",How to Make Mineral Makeup1," These will create the base color for your foundation. Here is what you will need:8 teaspoons titanium dioxide
1 tablespoon sericite mica
4 teaspoons zinc oxide
1 teaspoon magnesium stearate;
, There are two undertones for skin: warm and cool. Adding oxides to your base will give you just that: warm and cool undertones. Don't worry if this doesn't match your skin tone just yet, however; you will be adjusting it further later on. Here's what you should start with:¾ to 1 teaspoon yellow iron oxide
⅛ teaspoon brown iron oxide
1 small pinch red iron oxide

, Place a fine sieve over a clean bowl, and pour the powder through it. Use the back of a metal spoon to help press the powder through the sieve. Next, place the sieve back over your original bowl, and pour the powder through it again. Do this 2 to 3 more times.

, The foundation you have just made would give you a basic skin color, but it there are hundreds of different skin tones, and each one is unique. Adjust the foundation using the suggestions below:If you need it to be lighter, add more titanium dioxide.
If you need it to be darker, add more brown iron oxide.
If you need it to be more pink, add more red oxide.
If you need it to be more yellow, add more yellow oxide.
If the foundation is too sheer, add more zinc oxide. Be careful, however; too much zinc oxide will make your foundation look dull.

, These will help hold your foundation together as well as make it more nourishing for your skin., This will ensure that the oils are evenly mixed into the powder. It will also help break up any clumps.

, At this point, your loose powder foundation is done. If you want it to be pressed, like compact makeup, you will need to add some 99% isopropyl alcohol . Here's what you need to do:Stir in enough 99% isopropyl alcohol to make a paste.
Smooth the paste down into a clean, empty compact.
Press it down with a coin wrapped in clean, cotton fabric.
Leave the compact open overnight, or until the powder dries.

½ tablespoon titanium dioxide
1 teaspoon red iron oxide
⅛ teaspoon white mica powder

, This will help break up any lumps and clumps. Place a fine sieve over a clean bowl, and pour your powders through the sieve. Use the back of a small spoon to scrape the powders against the sieve. Next, place the sieve back over your first bowl, and repeat. Do this about 2 more times.

, The blush may already be pink enough for you. If it isn't, stir in a pink-toned mica powder, such as hot pink.Be sure to pass the powder through your sieve a few times to ensure that everything is evenly incorporated.

, A sifter jar is what companies use to store loose powder makeup. It's a basic jar, with a lid-like insert that has holes in it. This will help you pick up just the right amount of blush with your brush when you go to use it.

Start with ¼ teaspoon sericite in a small, clean bowl..,
Add your mica powders.,
Mix the powders well until there are no clumps left.,
Add ½ teaspoon of 99% isopropyl alcohol.,
Scoop the paste into mini jars or a clean makeup compact.,
Leave the container open overnight.",How to Make Mineral Makeup3," This will be your base, and will help make your eyeshadow smoother., You will need about 2 teaspoons worth of mica powder. You can use all one color, or a combination of different colors. At this point, you can also add more sericite if you'd like a lighter color. Many mica powders also come with measuring scoops as well. Here are some color combination ideas to get you started:


Light brown: ⅛ teaspoon honeyed beige mica, 1 mini scoop patina sheen mica, 1 mini scoop cappuccino mica, and 3 mini scoops pearly white mica.Dark brown: ⅛ teaspoon honeyed beige mica, 1 mini scoop patina sheen mica, 7 mini scoops cappuccino mica, and 4 mini scoops luster black mica.Pearly-white: 1 ¾ teaspoon sericite and ½ teaspoon pearly white mica.Golden-pink: 2 teaspoons rose-gold mica.Shimmering green: ¾ teaspoon sericite and ½ teaspoon shamrock green mica., Because mica powders are so fine, sifting them through a sieve won't work very well. Simply stir them with a small spoon or stir stick until they are evenly mixed together.

, The alcohol will help clump all of the ingredients together. It will eventually evaporate, leaving behind a compact eyeshadow., If you'd like a more professional finish, press the paste flat with a coin wrapped in cotton fabric. This will create that nice texture that many store-bought eyeshadows have.

, Once the alcohol evaporates and the powder dries, your eyeshadow is ready to use. Keep in mind that the eyeshadow will still be fragile, and won't hold up to being kept in a purse or bag, where it is knocked around."

,
Set out a container.,
Put the ingredients in a microwave-safe bowl and microwave them in 15-30 second increments.,
Stir in the oil of your choice.,
Wait for the mixture to harden before applying.",How to Make Your Own Lip Makeup1," Crayons are easy to find in the art section of large stores and art and craft stores. You don't need to buy very expensive art crayons, just make sure you have the colors you want in them and that they are non toxic.


If the crayons are non-toxic, it should say so on the box. A reliable brand of crayons for this project is Crayola.
If you are sensitive to smells, smell the box first to make sure that the scent isn't too strong for you.;
, You can just choose one, or you can blend two together. You should need just one crayon.

,, You can use old lip balm containers, plastic jewelry boxes, pretty much anything that is clean, food-safe and easy to store.

, Stir well. You can also use a double boiler, melt the crayon/crayons. To use a double boiler, fill the bottom with water and place it over heat to boil it. Place the crayon in the top part of the double boiler.


To make your own double boiler, take a large saucepan and fill it with water, and place a smaller saucepan or heat proof bowl to put your crayon(s) in. It can be hard to get the crayon off, so don't use any pan that is super expensive––a thrift store one is just fine.

, It can be coconut oil, olive oil, almond oil, jojoba oil, or even Vaseline. Mix the crayon and oil together until they are combined.

, The oil will help it stay soft, so you can reuse it. Make sure the container you put it in has a lid, so it doesn't completely dry out.

Make sure to cover all of the herbs with the oil. Leave half of an inch at the top of the jar. Cover the jar tightly.Pickling or preserving jars work very well for making your own herbal oil.
Dried herbs work best because they do not contain water that can cause mold. If you don’t use dried herbs, let them wilt for about 12 hours, then crush them with a mortar and pestle before putting in the oil.;
, Place the jar on a shelf where it gets plenty of sunlight during the day. Let the mixture sit for two weeks, mixing it by turning it upside down and then right side up twice a day. After two weeks, add one tablespoon of apple cider vinegar to the oil and mix.Let it sit on the sunny shelf for two more days. Mix it by inversion twice a day.

, After it has set for 16 days, the mixture is ready to pour out and use. Don’t use the oil straight from the jar. You need to filter it first. Pour the oil through a cheesecloth into a new clean glass, lidded jar. This catches all of the herbs, leaving you with just herbs.Store the jar in a cool, dry, and dark place.
If you want a stronger oil, add new herb to the already-infused oil and repeat the process once more.

Make sure to use a high-quality, and preferably organic, oil.You can use virgin olive oil, safflower oil, castor oil, argan oil, or coconut oil. These can be found at local health stores, grocery stores, or online.

, When making your herbal oil, you have to decide which herb or herbs you want to use to make oil. Each batch will be a bit different because it depends on the season and the area from which the herbs have been gathered, the conditions around the time of harvest, and they type of herb you are using. You can use any of the herbs listed below, or any others that you grow or find.

A new or used lipstick or chap stick container
A glass dropper
Beeswax
Shea butter or cocoa butter
Coconut oil
For color:

Beet root powder
Cocoa powder
Ground turmeric
Ground cinnamon

;
, Lipstick base is made from beeswax, which keeps the lipstick stiff; shea or cocoa butter, which makes it spreadable; and coconut oil, which moisturizes your lips. Place equal amounts of beeswax, shea or cocoa butter, and coconut oil in a small glass dish. Place the dish in a shallow pan filled with an inch or so of water, making sure the water surface is well below the rim of the glass dish. Place the pan on the stove and turn the burner to medium-high, allowing the water to heat the mixture until it melts.









Use a wooden stick or a spoon to stir the mixture until the ingredients are combined and completely melted.
If you want to make several tubes of lipstick, use two tablespoons of each ingredient. If you just want one stick to start, use one teaspoon of each ingredient.

, Remove the mixture from heat. Add powders and spices to the base in 1/8 teaspoon increments, stirring well with a wooden stick or spoon to fully incorporate them into the base. Continue until the mixture has reached the hue you want.









Add beet root powder if you want the lipstick to be red, using less for a pink color and more for a deeper rouge. If you can't find beet root powder, a natural red food coloring dye also works.
Add cocoa powder for a brown hue.
Ground turmeric and cinnamon produce coppery tones.
If you want a nontraditional color, like purple, blue, green or yellow, add a few drops of natural food coloring.

, The easiest way to fill small lipstick or chap stick tubes is to use a glass dropper, such as the droppers that come with bottles of essential oil, to move the lipstick while it's still in its liquid state. Use a dropper to fill the container to the top with lipstick.









If you don't have a dropper, use a small funnel to transfer the liquid. Place the funnel over the opening of the lipstick tube and pour the liquid from the bowl into the funnel.
If you don't have a lipstick or chap stick tube, you can use a small glass or plastic lipstick pot instead, and plan to apply the lipstick with a lipstick brush.
Be sure to transfer the liquid quickly, since it will begin to harden as it cools.

, Allow the lipstick to completely cool and harden in its container. When it has set, apply it directly to your lips or use a lipstick brush for a more precise job.

Buy a selection of mica powders.,
Make a loose powder eyeshadow.,
Make a pressed powder eyeshadow.,
Make a cream eyeshadow.",How to Make Eyeshadow at Home1," Cosmetic mica powder is a fine mineral powder that is available online, in beauty supply stores and even in some specific super stores.


Mica powder come in a huge variety of colors, with or without shimmer and in diverse quantity sizes. Although you can use a single color of mica powder to make your eyeshadow, you can make more unique and unusual shades by blending a number of different mica powders together.
Be sure to purchase only mica powder that is for cosmetic use and safe to use near your eyes.;
, To make a simple loose powder eyeshadow, you simply need to blend a selection of mica powders until you get your preferred shade.









For example, if you wanted to make a warm autumn-themed shade you could mix light brown, dark brown, gold, cream and orange mica powders. If you wanted a shimmering, aquamarine color, you could mix blue, green and silver mica powders.
To get a consistent color, you will need to measure out equal amounts of each mica powder. To do this, you can use the .15cc pigment scoop that is often provided with the mica powders, or even a small measuring spoon. It doesn't matter what quantity of each powder you use, as long as you use equal amounts.
Place the powders in an empty lip balm container (you can wash out an old one or buy online) and mix well to combine. Some people like to use a small herb or coffee grinder to do this, but you can also just use a spoon. Make sure to screw the lid on tightly when you're done, you don't want the powder to spill!

, To make a pressed powder eyeshadow (like the ones in an eyeshadow palette) you will need to follow the same process as described for the loose powder eyeshadow, before completing a few extra steps:









Once you have mixed your mica powders to create your chosen shade, you will need to add a powder binder -- these usually come in spray or liquid form and can be purchased online.
Add the powder binder to the mica mixture drop by drop (or spray by spray) and mix well until it achieves the consistency of wet sand.
Transfer the wet powder to an empty lip balm container, then place a piece of paper towel directly over the shadow and place a coin on top (it can be any coin, but try to match it to the size of the container).
Slowly press down on the coin so the shadow under it becomes compacted. Do this until the entire top of the shadow has been pressed. Leave the shadow out on a counter, covered with a sheet of paper towel, until the powder is entirely dry. Once it's dry, your pressed eyeshadow is ready to use!, Making a cream shadow using mica powders is a slightly more complicated process, which requires several additional ingredients. However, you can achieve a more intense color using this method.









To make this cream eyeshadow, you will need: 8 white beeswax pastilles, 1 teaspoon of refined shea butter, 24 drops of refined jojoba oil, 120 drops vegetable glycerin, 12 drops of vitamin E oil and 2 1/4 teaspoons of mica powder (a single color or a combination).
Add the shea butter and beeswax to a small bowl and microwave for a minute or two until melted. Using a separate 3ml plastic pipette for each ingredient, add the drops of jojoba oil, vegetable glycerin, and vitamin E oil to the bowl.
Add the mica powder to the bowl and mix well to combine all of the ingredients until you achieve a uniform consistency. Transfer the creamy mixture to an empty lip balm container, tightly replace the lid and wait 24 hours before using."

Buy an eye shadow slightly darker than your skin.,
Choose between either cream or powder shadow.,
Test it in the store.",How to Make Foundation With Eyeshadow1," The eye shadow will provide color to your foundation. Select a shade that matches your skin.


Try selecting a color that is slightly darker than your skin so that, when it is mixed with lighter colored ingredients during the foundation-making process, it will lighten to the perfect shade.
While most people argue that mid-range to expensive foundations are better quality products, the benefit to using eye shadow for homemade foundations is that it is less expensive to buy than ready-made foundations. With yearly individual costs on makeup ringing in at a minimum of $100, those of us with a tighter budget may prefer trying something a little cheaper.;
, Either type will work when making foundation. Choose the one that best matches your skin tone.

, You want to be sure to select the right shade, so it is important to test the eye shadow in the store before you purchase it.


Use your finger to rub a small amount of the eye shadow onto your face or hand and blend it in. A matching color will disappear on your skin. Select an eye shadow that is one shade darker than a direct match. Also, when testing, remember that your hands may be tanned darker than your face."

1 teaspoon vanilla extract will give your scrub a heavenly aroma.
½ teaspoon (2.5 grams) of ground pumpkin pie spice or cinnamon will give your scrub a warm scent.

, Let the mixture cool down a little. Be careful when handling the cup; use an oven mitt or potholder to handle it.

, Once the mixture has cooled a little, start adding the essential oil. You don't want to add the oil too soon, or the heat will cause the fragrance to burn off. You can use a single scent, or a combination of two or more scents. Here are some suggestions to get you started:Basil and lemon
Cinnamon and clove
Lavender and lemon
Orange and vanilla

, Make sure that the mixture is cool before you add the sugar, or the sugar will melt. Keep stirring until everything is evenly combined. There should be no streaks, swirls, lumps, or clumps.

, You can also use a soap-making mold, if you'd like a larger bar.

, This will take 1 to 2 hours.Once it hardens, it will become opaque and solid, sort of like a sugar cube or textured soap bar. If you notice that the bar is still damp, wait until it dries completely before you use it.

Purchase plain, unscented moisturizer.,
Blend 3/4 teaspoon eye shadow with 1 teaspoon moisturizer.,
Reduce the moisturizer amount for cream eye shadow foundation.,
Stir well.,
Use a spoon to check the consistency.",How to Make Foundation With Eyeshadow2," Buy a moisturizing agent that can act as the “cream” ingredient to your foundation.


Facial moisturizer that is made specifically for sensitive face skin works best, but plain, mild body lotion can be used too.
Body lotion is a cheaper choice of moisturizer, but it may also irritate or dry out your skin., Use a small makeup brush to carefully mix your eye shadow and moisturizer in a bowl.


If it is your first time making homemade foundation, you may choose to make a smaller amount until your recipe is perfected. Try halving the amounts.
This is the amount recommended for powdered eye shadow. Cream shadow foundation suggests other amounts.

, Blend 3/4 teaspoon of cream eye shadow with only 3/4 teaspoon of moisturizer.


A moisturizer reduction is necessary with cream eye shadow to prevent the foundation from being runny. This is because the eye shadow itself is already creamy.

, Mix the foundation in a bowl with a makeup brush until thoroughly blended.

, See how quickly the foundation runs off of a spoon. This will determine if it is too thick, too thin, or just right.


Scoop a small amount of foundation with a spoon. Tilt the spoon so it is mostly upright. If the foundation runs off the end quickly, it is too thin and needs more eye shadow added to the mixture. If the foundation sits on the spoon and barely moves, add more moisturizer. If the foundation slides from the spoon at an easy, slow-to-medium pace, it is a perfect consistency.

Test your new foundation.,
Modify if needed.,
Store your foundation in an airtight container.",How to Make Foundation With Eyeshadow3," Apply some foundation to half of your face and use a mirror to test the color blend against the natural half of your face.Dip the tip of a foundation brush into the foundation and gently apply it to your skin.

If you are satisfied, apply foundation to the other half of your face for a completed, even look.

, If you are not satisfied that the color of your foundation matches your skin, modify the mixture.


If it is too light, add eye shadow to darken it. If it is too dark, add moisturizer to lighten the mixture, or start again and use less eye shadow. Every skin type and color is different. No specific, given amount is perfect for everyone. Use the suggested amounts here as a loose guide.

DIY cosmetics are a kind of experimentation. You may have to play around with amounts and ingredients until you have a personalized foundation that you are happy with., When you are happy with the foundation, store it properly in an airtight container to prevent drying.


A small Tupperware container will work very well for storage. Simply pour your foundation from the mixing bowl into the storage container. Be careful not to spill when pouring, as the foundation may stain surfaces.
Be storage-conscious. Store your foundation in a dry place away from direct sunlight. Do not store your makeup in the bathroom as humidity from the shower can cause bacteria growth. Air, sun, and humidity will all cause your cosmetic to go bad quickly.

Keep clean inside as well as out.",How to Deep Clean Your Body," Getting really clean involves first understanding what we are dealing with. There are all kinds of solvents, soaps, cleaning agents, scrubs, etc. for almost any kind of substance you might get on your body, but once that special circumstance is cleared, it's back to basics. There are three basic things we need to clean when we wash. Each part requires a different method of cleaning.


First is the dirt and grunge that seems to stick to us from who knows where. Even sitting in a clean room still gets us dirty.
Second is the dead skin cells that are constantly flaking off our skin.
Third is the body oils under the skin, not just those on the surface.;
, Dirt, grunge, filth, etc. that are on the surface of the skin tend to stick to us for two reasons. They generally have some cohesive power of their own and/or they mix with oils in our skin, which are always being secreted for protection from the environment. That's why even dust getting on our skin will eventually seem like greasy mud.


We have two types of body secretions - oil and water (sweat). Those and the things that mix with them are best cleaned with a compound that breaks down the oils, makes them more soluble and allows them to be washed off easily. This is what soap is.
Regardless of the additives for scent, cream, color, etc. the goal is to get the oils broken down and off the body. This is all there is to washing in most people's minds, but they're wrong. Read on!

, How often do you really need to take a bath or shower? No more than 3-4 times per week. While recent studies reveal that almost 60 percent of people shower every day, there's some evidence that showering less can help your body improve its natural self-cleaning mechanisms more thoroughly.The more effectively your body cleans itself, the healthier and cleaner you are, inside and out.


The more you shampoo your hair, the more you strip it of natural oils, and the more often your body will have to produce those natural oils to make up for it. If you give yourself a shower break, you might find that you're actually less greasy, oily, or smelly in the in-between periods.
Some people will need to shower more regularly than others. If you sweat regularly, or have excessively oily skin, for example, you may need to shower as many as two times a day, and use proper moisturizer. Everyone's body is different.

, What kind of soap? When you pick a soap, there are basically three things to look for. A good soap should remove dirt, cut through oil and grease, and rinse away without leaving a film behind. Many different soaps may be appropriate for this purpose, from basic Dove or Ivory bar soap to handmade organic soaps.


Some soaps leave more or less residue behind. A simple test is to take a clear glass pane, drinking glass, goblet, dish, etc (must be clear) and swipe a small amount of cold grease (bacon, fat, oil, etc.) across an area. Rinse with cool water. Use the soap bar/liquid soap to firmly rub a section of the grease smear off. Rinse with clean water without scrubbing, or drying. Let air dry. Look through the glass and compare the unwashed grease with the soap cleaned section. A poor soap will leave a cloudy finish next to the grease. A good soap will leave a clear finish. What's left on the glass after the soap is left on your skin.
Medicated shampoos and soaps are sometimes recommended for people with dry or flaky skin, while others may opt for natural or organic ingredients for optimum health.

, Dead skin is the cause of most odors. Regardless of the advertising for antibacterial agents to kill odors, it's a rare case where good clean hygiene doesn't work wonders. Think about your high school gym. Remember the distinct aroma as you walked in? It came from the fermenting, decaying, skin and oils on the clothes left in the lockers. A moist environment with dead matter (skin cells) is a beautiful medium for bacterial growth and decay.


Consider using an exfoliant scrub or loofah. Exfoliant products usually have things like walnut shell, sugar, or other grainy ingredients that can be used to remove the dead skin from your body. They're commonly available in body wash form, or in bar soap form. Loofah scrubs are like textured wash cloths that can be used to scrub your body and remove dead skin cells. They're also bacteria traps, so it's important to rinse them out thoroughly and change them regularly if you try to use one.
You can also learn to make up your own exfoliant scrubs or a basic sugar scrub. There are lots of different kinds of recipes, but a basic version involves mixing two tablespoons of sugar with enough olive oil and honey to get the consistency of toothpaste.

, For a deep clean, prefer a really hot shower or bath, since taking a cold bath or shower won't touch the oil under the skin. You need to get your pores open and ejecting (secreting) their contents to clean them out. Bacteria can breed in your pores. Accumulation of oils can cause everything from acne to death by skin eating diseases. The easiest way to open your pores is heat. Exercise can do it because it will affect both sweat glands and the oil pores, but heat by itself is also effective. Taking a nice hot bath is excellent, but a quick hot shower is fine too. Make sure it gets you sweating and opens your pores, allowing them to secret their contents.


Be aware of going too hot, especially if you have dry skin. The best temperature to take a shower? It might be slightly lower than you think.Excessively hot water, in excess of 120 degrees F (49 C) will dry out your skin and can cause long-term skin problems. Instead, try showering in water no hotter than your body temperature.
Consider ending your shower with a quick spritz of cold water from the faucet. This helps to tighten up the skin and close the pores back up, which will keep them from trapping dirt and other grim you've washed off in the shower.

, Scrub your skin with a rough sponge or cloth that will help take off all the dead and dying skin cells. Be sure and rub everywhere twice, once while cleaning with soap and a second time when washing off during the final rinse. Target your underarms, the areas behind your ears, under your jaw line and your chin, and behind your knees and the gaps in between your feet. The largest cultures of odor-causing bacteria breed in these areas. This is because of the sweat that gets trapped in the layers of the skin. Make sure to wash these areas each time you bathe.


Rinse your buttocks and your groin as well, then make sure you rinse properly. Soap trapped in these areas can cause irritation.
Another consideration is to dry completely to the point where you are no longer secreting (sweating) from the hot cleaning before you dress. If you've done a good thorough cleaning, the dampness that your clothes will absorb will dry with no or minimal odor. You are constantly sloughing off dead skin cells, but if you've just finished cleaning, there will be far less ending up in your clothes to begin to decay and embarrass you.

, Some people like to do detoxifying steams, and take very hot showers for this reason. This can be an excellent way of opening up your pores and getting the sweat flowing out of your body. Treat it as a separate ritual, however, from bathing.


Start your shower routine by steaming your face with a hot towel and a drop or two of some peppermint or tea-tree essential oil. This can be an excellent way of opening your pores and releasing toxins, without damaging your skin in the shower.

, Wet your hair thoroughly and apply about a quarter-sized amount of shampoo into your palm. Rub your hands through your hair, lathering the shampoo and massaging it into your scalp for 1-2 minutes. Make sure to work the shampoo in the hair behind the ears as that causes most oil to form. Then make sure you lather it up at the back of the head and then pull in the tips of your hair.


Rinse the shampoo out until your hair thoroughly, running your fingers through the stands as you go. If your hair is still slippery then the shampoo isn't out and will get greasy over the next 24 hours. Repeat this process with conditioner, to strengthen your hair. Rinse it out completely.

, After your shower, make sure you dry your body with a clean, dry towel. Water that remains on your skin can cause irritation and chafing. Try to dry yourself as soon as possible after you're done bathing.

, What about that towel you use every time you bathe? How many times does it get used before it begins to stink? It accumulates the dead cells and oils that were left over after a poor cleaning. Dealing with this takes a good scrubbing with a course sponge, washcloth, brush, or similar item. The key is to get as much of the loose and dying and dead skin cells along with the oils off before you use the towel.


To keep your body as clean as possible, it's important to wash your towel regularly and store it properly so it dries appropriately. Wash your towel after 2-3 uses.
Never just let a wet towel lay on the floor of the bathroom, or it will get mildewy and dirty quickly. It's important to hang it up properly and allow it to dry completely.

, Organic rock salt deodorant kills the bacteria that causes odor, and also helps cleanse your lymph nodes. When you first start using a mineral deodorant, you might have strong odor for 1 or 2 weeks, but don't give up, because this means it is detoxing all the bacteria that has built up from using regular deodorant.


To keep the odor under control while your body flushes the toxins, get some therapeutic-grade essential oils (Young Living or Doterra), such as lavender, rose, lemon, or purification blend, among many others to put directly on your armpits to reduce odor.
Stay away from antiperspirant. Although our society has created a trend that sweat is gross and unattractive, causing your armpits not to sweat is purposefully clogging the lymph in your body. Our body has lymph nodes throughout our entire system and it helps in a number of ways, including keeping our immune system strong, flushing out toxins, and even odor.

, After every bath or shower, you may want to apply moisturizer to your skin to help keep it healthy. Even if you have oily skin, moisturizer needs to be used regularly to help to keep your skin hydrated. Commercial moisturizers usually contain some combination of natural lipids and other compounds that your body generates naturally. Look for water-based moisturizers.


Identify problem areas, like the heels of your feet, your elbows, and your knees, and apply moisturizer to those areas every night before bed. This can help to soften skin and improve its overall health.

, Facial treatments like packs or masks can be used regularly throughout the week to clean and tighten the skin on your face. There are a variety of natural remedies and ingredients that can be used for a good face pack. Try the following:


Use plain honey, lemon, milk, besan flour, green tea, and fresh fruits like papaya mango oranges sweet lime.
You can also buy a face pack or mixture from the store. Read the ingredients to find out what's used so you can mix one up yourself.

, Body wash, shampoo, conditioner, facial cleanser, deodorant, and even makeup and hairspray can help promote a healthier body. When you put products on yourself that are full of toxins and harsh chemicals, it effects your health and your body's ability to self-regulate.


Avoid shampoos, conditioners, or body washes with propylene glycol, sodium laurel (or laureth) sulfate. These compounds can actually cause hair loss, dry hair, build up, itchiness, dry skin, and sometimes allergic reactions.
Consider using home alternatives. For some people, deep cleaning means avoiding commercial products all together and focusing on cleaning your body with gentler home remedies. Instead of shampoo, you can use baking soda, apple cider vinegar, and warm water. If you're interested in learning more home remedies, check out the following articles:

For a dark pink blush, use 5 to 6 drops of red food coloring.

, You leave your blush a traditional pink, of you can add other colors to get the shade you want.

Pay your premium.",How to Insure Your Cosmetics Line," Insurance protects you from risk, but as a producer of cosmetics your risks may vary depending on where and how you produce your cosmetics and how you market and distribute them.You need general liability insurance if you have a storefront where you sell your cosmetics. This insurance protects your business if, for example, someone slips and falls in your store and sues you for negligence.
Product liability insurance is the big one for a cosmetics line. This insurance protects you and your business in the event one of your customers is harmed by your products.
In the context of cosmetics, this includes, for example, someone having an allergic reaction to one of your ingredients. Something like that can happen even if you're using all-natural ingredients.
You may need premises liability insurance if you have employees helping you make your cosmetics. Professional liability insurance also may help you if you run a blog in conjunction with your cosmetic line through which you dispense beauty or makeup advice.
If you think you need several types of insurance, you might consider buying a business owner's policy. These policies bundle several types of insurance commonly needed by small business owners together, which can lower your premium.;
, If you're having trouble figuring out exactly what risks you need to protect your business against, an insurance agent can help you analyze your business and identify the types of insurance you need.You aren't obligated to buy any policies at this stage – you're trying to figure out what you need.
Be skeptical of agents who seem to be more motivated to sell you something than to answer your questions.
You might want to find an agent through your local small business association, or through a trade association.
You also can look for further information and advice on the internet. The website of the federal government's Small Business Association (SBA) has lots of resources on business insurance.

, If you want to manufacture and sell your own cosmetic line, you typically must get a business license in the state where your business will be based. Some states require certain minimum levels of insurance as a condition of maintaining a license in good standing.The SBA has a list of all state licensing requirements on its website. Just search for ""state licenses and permits"" to find the page. On the licensing page, click on the name of the state where you live to find what you need.
Keep in mind that if you don't meet your state's licensing requirements, the regulatory agency can shut down your business, and you may end up paying substantial fines or penalties.
The requirements of distributors or retail establishments where you plan to sell your cosmetics are just as important as your state's licensing requirements. Many distributors require product manufacturers to provide proof of a certain amount of product liability insurance coverage.

, Experts in the cosmetics industry typically recommend that you have between $1 million and $2 million in product liability insurance. You also may want additional commercial liability or premises liability insurance.If you plan to make your cosmetics in your own home, check your homeowner's or renter's insurance.
Many owners of home-based businesses believe this insurance also covers their business, but often business activities are explicitly exempted from coverage.
If you're considering a business owner's policy, you still need to make sure you're covered for the appropriate levels under each type of insurance bundled in the policy.
For example, it does you no good to have $5 million of general liability insurance if you only have $1 million in product liability coverage and the distributor you want to carry your cosmetic line requires you to have $2 million in product liability coverage.

, You'll be purchasing coverage for at least a year, and you can't predict what will happen to your business during that time. For this reason, it's typically better for you to have too much coverage than to wind up having too little.Particularly with product liability insurance, you typically are required to pay your entire annual premium upfront. This can make it difficult to change your coverage in the middle of the year if you discover you need more to adequately accomplish your business's goals.
If you know others in the industry, you may want to ask them for advice. For example, someone who has had a home-based cosmetic line for five years may be able to provide insight on things they wish they'd done when they were just starting out.

, You typically can search online for insurance companies that offer commercial liability or product liability insurance. Focus on companies that provide insurance specifically for cosmetics manufacturers, as they will have a better understanding of the needs of your business.Doing a general internet search for ""cosmetics product liability insurance"" will get you some possibilities.
You also want to ask anyone you know who is currently in the industry. If you don't know anyone personally, consider talking to someone in an industry or trade organization near you.
Contact other people you see who have home-based cosmetic lines and ask them which insurance company they use. Small business owners frequently are more than willing to help others who express an interest in their fields.
Many people who've established their own cosmetic lines also have blogs where they discuss various aspects of the industry.
Look beyond cosmetics as well, to related industries such as homemade soaps or haircare products – these industries have many of the same insurance needs as cosmetics.

, Typically you must complete a basic application to get a quote for coverage. You will need to provide the insurance company with a little information about your business and the cosmetics you make.Insurance companies will vary in the amount of information they want about your business and your products before they can issue a quote.
If you're looking for product liability insurance in particular, keep in mind that any quote you receive is only as accurate as the amount of information you give.
Different ingredients have different risks associated with them. However, you typically are under no obligation to disclose every ingredient in your cosmetics.
Some insurance companies won't cover certain ingredients at all due to the tremendous risk involved. This is a particular concern in the herbal supplements industry, but may impact you if you're including similar herbal ingredients in your cosmetics, such as kava or magnolia.

, If you have any questions about the quotes or what is covered, you should be able to talk to an agent with the company. They can explain more about the quote and may be able to adjust it based on the information you provide.The most important thing you need to know about each quote is whether the insurance quoted will provide the coverage you need for your cosmetics line.
Read any information that comes with the quote carefully, including disclaimers or disclosures.
Keep in mind that your premium may increase after you complete the full application for insurance coverage, based on a number of factors including your business background and credit history.

, Industry associations and trade organizations may have arrangements or affiliations with particular insurance companies. Going through one of these organizations may save you a lot of money compared to getting a policy on your own.On the other hand, going through a business network or trade organization may limit your choices. There may only be specific policies available through a single insurance company.
If you're not going to get the amount of coverage you need through a network plan, the money you'd save is irrelevant.
If you already have insurance policies through an insurance company, it can't hurt to see if they offer the insurance you need for your cosmetic line. Many insurance companies provide discounts to customers who have more than one policy with them.

, Once you've gotten quotes from several insurance companies, take some time to compare what they're offering. You also want to look at other aspects of the company, such as location and customer service.Generally, you want to find the most coverage at the least cost to you. When assessing the cost, take into account your deductible in addition to the premium you must pay.
Typically you'll pay a higher premium for the same amount of coverage with a lower deductible.
Make sure the deductible is an amount you can afford to pay if something happens. An extremely low premium payment won't be of much benefit to you if you have to pay thousands of dollars you can't afford on a claim.

, Before you start your coverage, you should arrange to meet with an agent or broker who works for the insurance company that will be writing your policy. This agent or broker will be able to explain the policy to you and answer any questions you might have.Many insurance companies give you the opportunity to get a quote and purchase your policy online, rather than coming into an office in person.
This can be a benefit to you because it gives you access to many different insurance carriers. However, it may make it more difficult to talk to someone if you have questions, or get personal attention to your policy.
If you're buying a policy online, look for a customer service phone number or email so you can contact them with any questions.
Get any explanations or promises from the agent or broker in writing, so you have proof of them if a problem comes up later.

, Have the agent or broker explain all the terms and conditions of your policy, including the amounts of coverage and the types of incidents or risks that are covered by your policy.Depending on the coverage you've chosen, your policy could be 20 or 30 pages long. You probably don't feel you have time to read that, or that you wouldn't understand it even if you did read it.
This is where talking to an agent or broker is important. These professionals have training and experience in breaking down the legalese of an insurance policy into language anyone can understand.
If you don't understand your insurance policy, the coverage it offers, or what you should do if you need to file a claim – don't sign it.

, Typically you must sign a number of documents to purchase your policy. In most cases your policy is effective the date you sign these forms, although you may be allowed to choose a specific effective date.Make sure you have complete copies of your policy and all forms you've signed for your records.
Keep your copies in a safe place, preferably in the same place where you keep your business licenses, permits, and other legal documents related to your cosmetic line.

, While a few insurance companies allow small business owners to pay commercial or product liability premiums in installments, typically you must pay the entire annual premium up front.Your agent or broker should let you know if an installment plan is available for your premium.
Keep in mind that if you pay in installments, you may end up paying more total than you would if you paid your entire annual premium up front.
The other thing to keep in mind with installments is that missing a single payment could result in cancellation of your policy, leaving you vulnerable.
On the other hand, paying your entire annual premium up front means you don't have to worry about it for the rest of the year.

Get lipstick base supplies.,
Choose a lipstick color.,
Melt the base ingredients together.,
Mix in the color.,
Pour the mixture into containers.",How to Make Lipstick1," The lipstick base makes up the majority of the substance, and you customize it by adding pigments. The ingredients you use to make your lipstick base can be tweaked to make the lipstick more glossy, matte, or balm-like. Here's what you need:1 teaspoon (5 ml) beeswax or beeswax beads. You can find beeswax at craft supply stores.
1 teaspoon (5 ml) shea butter, mango butter, almond butter, or avocado butter. This helps the lipstick roll on smoothly!
1 teaspoon (5 ml) oil, such as almond oil, extra virgin olive oil, or jojoba oil.;
, Now that you've got your base supplies, the next step is to pick out a color. There are many natural substances that can be used to create a variety of red, pink, brown, and orange hues. Remember that this lipstick recipe is natural, so the colors you'll look subtle and earth-toned.Consider these options:


For a bright red lipstick, use beetroot powder or crushed beet chips.
Cinnamon can be used to achieve a reddish-brown color.
Turmeric can be mixed with other powders to make the shade more coppery.
Cocoa powder gives lipstick a deep brown hue.

, Put the lipstick base ingredients in a microwave-safe bowl. Place it in the microwave and heat the ingredients in 30-second increments until they are melted. Stir the ingredients well to make sure they are thoroughly incorporated.









Note that you can also melt the ingredients in a double-boiler. Heat roughly 2 inches (5 cm) of water in a large saucepan over medium-high heat, then add the ingredients to a smaller pan sitting inside the first. Stir and heat until everything melts and blends together.

, Now comes the fun part: add 1







, You can use an old lipstick or chapstick tube, a small cosmetics pot, or any container with a lid as a container for your new lipstick. Let the lipstick harden at room temperature or in the refrigerator before you use it.

Get the eyeshadow ready.,
Mix the eyeshadow powder with petroleum jelly.,
Pour the mixture into containers.",How to Make Lipstick2," Find an old eyeshadow (or buy a cheap one) in the form of either loose or compacted powder, rather than a gel form. Scoop the eyeshadow into a bowl and use the back of a spoon to mash it up until you've got a fine, lump-free powder.


To give the lipstick some shimmer, try adding a little shimmering eyeshadow to the main color you have chosen.
Using eyeshadow is a great way to experiment with interesting lipstick colors. Eyeshadows are like color pigments so that's why we use it. Go for green, blue, black, and other colors that are difficult to find in lipstick shades.
Note that some eyeshadows are not safe for use on your lips, however. Check the ingredients. If the eyeshadow includes ultramarines, ferric ferrocyanide, and/or chromium oxides, do not use it. Only use eyeshadows that contain safe iron oxides., Place about 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of petroleum jelly in a microwave-safe bowl. Add 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of eyeshadow powder. Place the bowl in the microwave and heat it until it melts and becomes runny, then stir it up to distribute the color throughout the jelly.








Add more powder if you want the eyeshadow to have a more saturated hue. (Darker/Opaque)
Add less powder for a tinted lipgloss look. (Lighter/Translucent)
Instead of petroleum jelly, you can substitute clear chapstick.

, Use an old lipstick or chapstick tube, a cosmetics pot, or any other container with a lid. Let the mixture harden before you use it.

Get a box of crayons.,
Melt the crayon in a double boiler.,
Stir in some oil.,
Add fragrance.,
Pour the mixture into containers.",How to Make Lipstick3," The beauty of this method is that you can make beautiful, brightly colored lipstick in just about any shade of the rainbow. Use broken crayons you already have lying around or buy a brand new box just for the purpose of making lipstick. You'll need one crayon per tube.


Choose a crayon brand that is known to make crayons that are safe to ingest in small quantities. Since kids often put crayons in their mouths, many brands are tested to ensure they aren't toxic. Choose a box of crayons that is labeled as such. Do not use oil pastels or other professional art supplies, since these are not regulated in the same way as children's crayons.Sniff the crayons before you buy the box. You're going to be putting this on your lips, after all, so you want to make sure you get crayons that don't have a strong smell.

, If you try to heat the crayon without using a double boiler, it will burn. Unwrap the paper label and discard it. Place the crayon in the top section of the double boiler and heat it over medium heat until it has melted.








You can make your own double boiler with two saucepans, a large one and a smaller one. Place a few inches of water in the large saucepan and set the smaller pan inside, so that it's floating on the water. Put the crayon in the smaller saucepan, then place the contraption over medium heat and let the crayon melt.
You might want to use an old pan to melt the crayon, since it can be difficult to clean off.

, You can use olive oil, almond oil, jojoba oil, or coconut oil. Stir in a little less than 1 tsp (5 ml) with the melted wax until the ingredients are completely combined.








, A few drops of essential oil help mask the smell of the crayon. Try rose, peppermint, lavender, or another type of essential oil. Make sure the essential oil is safe to use on or around your lips.







, Use an old lipstick or chapstick tube, a small cosmetics pot, or any other container with a lid. After carefully pouring the hot liquid into the containers, put them in the refrigerator to let the lipstick harden.

Combine several old lipsticks on a microwave-safe bowl.,
Microwave the lipsticks.,
Pour the mixture into containers.",How to Make Lipstick4," This method is a good one to use if you have several old lipsticks you'd like to repurpose into a new color. You can use lipsticks of the same shade, or create a new color by choosing several different shades.









Make sure that any lipstick you use has not expired. If it's older than two years, it's too old to use and should be discarded.

, Put the lipsticks in the microwave for 5 seconds on high. Allow them to melt, then mix them together with a plastic spoon or stirring rod to blend the colors.








Continue microwaving in 5-second intervals until blended.
Alternatively, you can melt the lipsticks together in a double-boiler instead of a microwave. Consider adding about 1 tsp (5 ml) of beeswax or petroleum jelly for every 4 inches (10 cm) of lipstick used, as doing so will add a moisturizing effect to the lipstick. Stir well until blended., When ready, pour the new shade of lipstick into a small cosmetic pot or tin. Allow the lipstick to cool and harden before use.









Apply the new lipstick using your finger or an applicator brush.

Pour the liquid into a measuring cup.,
Pour the chapstick mixture into tubes or tins.,
Let the balm harden for twenty minutes.,
Put on the caps.",How to Make Chapstick," Measure out one tablespoon of unbleached beeswax and drop it inside a small saucepan. Add in two tablespoons of almond, sunflower, castor or jojoba oil to the pot, as well as one tablespoon of shea butter.Beeswax is often sold in blocks or in little pellets called pastilles. Try to buy beeswax in pastilles, because it is easier to measure and weigh small amounts of the beeswax when it’s in pellet form.
For a vegan recipe, use combine 3 tablespoon of carrier oil, ½ teaspoon of candelilla wax, and 1 tablespoon of shea butter in the saucepan.;
, Take a large saucepan and fill it with about one inch of water. Then put the smaller saucepan that you filled with the beeswax, oil and shea butter inside the large saucepan. You effectively created a double broiler., Place the double broiler you made on the stovetop. Turn the heat up to medium low and heat the ingredients, constantly stirring until the beeswax and shea butter have melted. When they have completely melted, take the saucepans off the stove., Drop in one teaspoon of honey as well as 5-10 drops of your choice of essential oils. Then stir to combine the ingredients into the mixture.You can skip this step if you prefer plain chapstick.
Good essential oils to use are peppermint, vanilla and lavender.
Peppermint adds a tingly feeling to the chapstick when you apply it.

, Many people enjoy a chapstick that tastes slightly sweet. If you want some extra flavor and sweetness to your chapstick, drop in a pinch of stevia.Don’t add stevia if you prefer a more traditional, unsweetened chapstick.

, If you want to give your chapstick a pink or red tinge, drop in a teaspoon of beet or alkanet root powder. These powders are an all-natural way to color the chapstick. Stir the powder in gradually until the mixture reaches your desired shade.You can also use food coloring if you don’t have access to the root powders.
The color that the root powder or food coloring makes is enough to color the wax, but it won’t tint or color your lips.

, After you have finished mixing the ingredients, pour the chapstick mixture into a measuring cup or another container with a spout.<https:


Make sure that you pour the chapstick mixture right away, because if you don’t, the mixture will harden and become cemented in the saucepan.

, After you have poured the chapstick into a spouted container, pour the mixture immediately into chapstick tubes or tins. There should be enough chapstick for around 8 tubes. You can buy chapstick tubes and tins online, or simply re-use empty chapsticks you may have around the house.Again, don’t delay before pouring the chapstick into containers.
If you wait to pour the chapstick and it ends up hardening inside the measuring cup, melt the chapstick in the same way that you melted the beeswax and other ingredients by creating a double broiler and submerging the Pyrex measuring cup in a pot that contains an inch of hot water.
If you didn’t use a measuring cup, you can melt the hardened chapstick in the microwave, checking every five or ten seconds until the mixture has melted.
If you used a container that can’t be microwaved, scrape the chapstick out with a spoon and put it into a container that can be heated, then microwave.

, After you pour the chapstick into tubes or tins, let it sit and harden for at least twenty minutes with the tops off to give the chapstick time to get firm., After you have waited around twenty minutes, or until the chapstick has cooled, place the caps on the tubes or tins of chapstick. This will stop anything from sticking to the your new chapstick. Your chapstick is now ready for use!"

Decide if turmeric will work for your skin tone.,
Mix a small amount in at first.,
Use a makeup brush to blend the turmeric in well.,
Test the blended makeup on your skin.",How to Add Turmeric to Your Makeup3," Adding turmeric to your foundation will result in a yellow tone, which is useful if you find your makeup too pink. However, if you have very pale skin, then adding turmeric to your makeup might not work for you.

Talk to your doctor about treating chronic dry skin.",How to Make Aloe Moisturizer," To start, you will melt your oils together. Add your almond oil, jojoba oil, and beeswax to the top portion of your double boiler.A double boiler has two pans: a larger, deeper pan and a smaller, more shallow pan. You should add your oils to the smaller pan and add a few inches of water to the larger pan. Then, fit the smaller pan over the larger pan and melt the oils over heat.If you do not have a double boiler, place your oil in a glass or stainless steel bowl. Then, place this bowl in a pot filled with a few inches of water.;
, Place your double boiler or double boiler substitute over the stove and turn on the heat to medium or medium-high. Allow the oils to melt until they're completely mixed together. This should take about two to five minutes.You do not need to stir the oil. It should combine on its own.

, Use a mixing bowl big enough to hold the oils with a little headspace on top. You will be adding more ingredients. Pour your oils into the bowl., Before you proceed, you should let your oils cool to room temperature. Set the mixing bowl aside for about an hour to cool your oils.You can use a thermometer to check the oil temperature.
It may be easier to simply stick your finger in and see if the oils feel about the same temperature as the room. You should wait about an hour to do this, as the oil could be very hot. You may want to hover your hand above the oil for a moment. If the temperature is very hot, wait a bit longer before checking.

, Add 10 drops of essential oils to the aloe vera gel. You can use one type of oil or combine different oils. Use a spoon to mix the oils into the aloe vera gel.Essential oils that are good for dry skin include rose oil, frankincense oil, and neroli oil. A combination of these oils may work great in a moisturizer., Take your aloe vera gel mixture. Pour it into the mixing bowl. You should use a hand mixer to combine., Use the hand mixer to slowly whisk the oils together. There are no strict for how long to mix. It depends on the precise consistency you prefer. You should keep mixing your oils until you reach that consistency.When you're done, your moisturizer is ready to use. You can store it in an airtight container between uses.

, If you take prescription medication or have certain health concerns, you should consult a healthcare professional before using aloe vera gel. Aloe vera gel could potentially interfere with medications. You should also ask your doctor about aloe vera gel if you have existing allergies, are pregnant, or are trying to become pregnant., Aloe vera gel, or the essential oils used in it, can sometimes cause a bad reaction. If you notice redness, itchiness, or hives after you begin using the gel, aloe vera gel may not be safe for your skin. Cease using your moisturizer and consult your doctor if your symptoms do not go away on their own in a few days.If you have an allergy to garlic, onions, or tulips, a bad reaction may be more likely.

, Aloe vera gel should never be swallowed. If you're using your moisturizer on your face, be very careful to keep it away from your mouth.If you or a household member accidentally ingests aloe vera gel, see a doctor as soon as possible.

, If you have itchy, dry skin that you moisturize regularly, be careful when using aloe vera gel. The long term effects of aloe vera gel, and many essential oils, are unknown. If your dry, itchy skin is a chronic problem, ask your doctor about treatment options. It is better to go with a verified treatment plan, as attempting to treat your skin on your own may have adverse long term effects."

Trim your facial hair.",How to Care for Your Face (Males)," A good cleanser will help deep clean and remove debris in the pores that can lead to blemishes. Don't just use a bar of body soap, which can dry out your face and cause it to flake or create irritation. Look for a cleanser made with natural cleansing substances that is geared toward your skin type, whether it's dry, oily, or in between.


The oil cleansing method is a great natural way to cleanse your skin. It sounds counterintuitive, but using a combination of natural oils clean your skin will get rid of the dirt without irritating your face.This is an excellent choice for people with any skin type, especially if you have acne.
If you'd prefer to buy a cleanser with ingredients specifically geared toward treating acne, look for a cleanser that contains salicylic acid, glycolic acid, or benzyl peroxide. These have antibacterial qualities and are said to be effective in treating acne.;
, Washing it more often than once a day can dry out your skin. Decide to cleanse your skin every morning or every night, but not both. If you want to freshen up in between cleanses, splash cool or lukewarm water on your face without using cleanser.


Don't use hot water. Hot water dries out your skin, so use cool or lukewarm water instead.
Pat your face dry instead of scrubbing it with a towel. Handling your facial skin roughly will cause it to loosen over time.

, If you slathered on sunscreen during the day, it's best to wash your face before bed. The sunscreen you use may have ingredients that can cause breakouts if left on the skin overnight.On the other hand, if you didn't sweat or use sunscreen during the day, it's fine to give your skin a rest and skip a day of cleansing.

, Using a facial scrub or facial exfoliating brush every few days will get rid of dead skin and dirt that doesn't come off with your daily wash. Exfoliating leaves skin brighter and healthier. It also helps prepare your face for shaving by softening the hairs and skin, making for a smoother, closer shave with fewer nicks and less irritation.


When you exfoliate with a scrub, rub the scrub into your face using a gentle circular motion, then rinse.
A dry facial brush is another very effective way to exfoliate. Purchase a brush made specifically for use on the face. Before you cleanse, use the brush to remove dead skin. Make sure your skin is dry when you use the brush, as it won't work as well on wet skin.

, Whether you use a cream, a light oil, or another product, it's a good idea to moisturize your skin every day after washing. Doing so will help your skin retain its elasticity and keep it from feeling uncomfortably itchy or getting too flaky. Choose a good moisturizer that's right for your skin type.


If your skin is on the dry side, choose a moisturizer with ingredients like olive oil, argan oil, shea butter, and lanolin.
If your skin is oily, choose a moisturizer with lighter ingredients that won't sit on your skin all day.

, If you don't moisturize any other part of your face, at least rub some cream around your eyes. The skin there is more apt to start sagging over time, and using cream will keep it looking fresh.Moisturizing in this area is especially important for older men, but it's never too early to start incorporating this into your routine.


You don't have to go out and buy an expensive cream. Use some of your regular moisturizer or dab some coconut oil around your eyes.

, The skin on our lips doesn't have as many oil glands as the rest of the face, so lips are prone to getting dry and cracked very easily. Use lip balm or a swipe of coconut oil to keep your lips in good shape. You may need to use balm more often in the winter.

, Facial skin can get easily damaged by sun exposure, so it's important to use sunscreen every time you go out. You can kill two birds with one stone by using a moisturizer with an spf over 15 in the winter and 30 in the summer. Don't forget to protect your lips from the sun, too.


Wearing sunglasses in the summer also helps to protect the tender skin around your eyes.

, Whether you like to be completely clean-shaven or you wear a mustache or a beard, you'll need to shave parts of your face every few days. Get a sharp, high-quality razor to do the job, rather than getting the cheapest kind you can find. Your skin will feel and look better if you use a razor designed for a close, even shave.


If you use disposable razors, be sure to choose a brand that makes razors with double blades. These are more efficient and create a cleaner shave than a single blade.
You can get an electric razor if you don't need a very close cut. These razors should be used on dry skin.
A straight razor will create a close, precise shave. If you decide to purchase a straight razor, it will take some practice to develop the skill to shave without nicking yourself.

, The warmth of the water will soften your skin and hairs, making it easier to shave. It's also important to cleanse your skin to get rid of dirt and bacteria on its surface in case you accidentally nick yourself shaving.

, This will lubricate your face so that the razor glides smoothly over its surface. Don't shave your face dry or without cream unless you're using an electric razor.


Try to find a shaving cream or gel without a lot of chemicals, which can dry out or irritate your face.
Let the shaving cream sit on your face for a few minutes to further soften your skin and hair before shaving.

, It's not necessary to apply pressure to the razor when you draw it across your face. If the blade is sharp enough, the razor will do the job for you. Make sure you're shaving with the grain of your hairs, rather than against it, for a safe and effective shave.


If you're shaving off stubble that has had several weeks to grow out, trim it using beard clippers first. Get it as short as possible before shaving.
Dip your razor in warm water to unclog it every few minutes while you shave.
Pull your skin taught as you shave to get the closest possible cut.

, Use cold water to soothe your face and reduce bleeding from any nicks you might have gotten. Pat it dry with a towel - don't scrub.

, Use a moisturizing product that will soothe irritation from the shave. Be sure to use a product that doesn't contain ingredients that could sting your face after shaving.

, Use a sharp beard trimmer or scissors to trim your remaining facial hair into shape to keep it looking neat.

Look for 10 percent zinc oxide or titanium dioxide.,
Pick an SPF between 30 and 50.,
Choose a broad spectrum sunscreen.,
Avoid synthetic active ingredients for sensitive skin.,
Skip sunscreen-bug repellent combos.,
Check for other ingredients you may be allergic to.",How to Choose a Natural Sunscreen1," Natural sunscreens often use ingredients that physically, rather than chemically, block the sun. Because these don't offer a high SPF on their own, you need to make sure they have a high enough concentration in the sunscreen to actually block light. Choose a sunscreen that has a 10 percent or higher concentration of zinc oxide or titanium dioxide.These two ingredients are the only FDA-approved ingredients for blocking the sun that are often used in natural sunscreens.;
, You may think going for the highest SPF is the best plan. While that won't cause any harm, higher SPFs actually don't provide a significant improvement in protection. Plus, they'll take a larger chunk out of your pocketbook.An SPF of 30 will block 97 percent of the sun's rays. Moving up to SPF 60 will only block 1 percent more, 98 percent. If you're are very fair-skinned, you may find SPF 50 helps some on vulnerable areas, such as the nose and ears.
Try not to go below 30 SPF, though, particularly if you're light-skinned. 15 SPF only blocks 93% of the sun, and you'll get a lot less protection the lower you go., Even if you're using a natural sunscreen, you still want it to protect you from all the sun's rays. Look for ""broad spectrum"" or ""full spectrum"" on the label, which means it protects you from both UVA and UVB rays., While most natural sunblocks won't use these ingredients, it's still a good idea to check for them if you have sensitive skin. The ingredients include dioxybenzone, oxybenzone, para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), and sulisobenzone., For sunscreen to be effective, you need to reapply it frequently. However, bug repellent usually doesn't need to be applied as often. Therefore, it's a good idea to keep your sunscreen and bug spray separate., Natural sunscreens may still have ingredients that could irritate your skin, as it all depends on what your skin can take. Some will add essential oils, which you can have a reaction to. If you know you react to certain ingredients, check the label before buying.

If you're traveling by plane and not checking a bag, you may need travel sized containers of your normal skin products. Airlines require that you carry on 3.4 ounces of any given liquid, and it must be stored in a plastic bag.;
, If you're going on a vacation, you will need a little extra moisturizer and should not neglect sunscreen. You'll likely be out and about more on your trip, and your skin needs protection from the sun even on overcast days. Your skin also may dry out easier in a new environment. Even if you don't habitually use them, pack sunscreen and moisturizer.When selecting moisturizers, aim for anti-inflammatory products. They should be rich in vitamins like C and E.
For optimal protection from the sun's rays, aim for a sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30., Certain products should not be part of your skin care routine when you're traveling. You do not want to use anything that will be too harsh on your skin, as your skin will be adversely affected by travel. Make sure to read product labels carefully before selecting a product.Soap-based cleansers can be hard on your skin. Look for cleansers that are soap free.
If you use anti-aging products, opt for products that do not contain retinol or Retin-A.

, When packing skin care products for travel, prepare for accidents. If a bag is knocked around, or if it falls, liquids could leak. Pack to protect this. You do not want to get to your destination to find you cannot use certain skin care products as they've spilled.Place every item in a Ziploc bag and separate them by category. For example, moisturizers should go in one bag, acne treatments in another, and so on.
In addition to a Ziploc, go for nylon travel bags. In the event of a leak, a nylon bag will keep things contained.

Hydrate.,
Protect your skin.,
Eat a healthy diet.",How to Care for the Face in Winter1," Healthy, moisturized, and supple facial skin is impossible during any month of the year without proper body hydration. By taking care of your skin's hydration needs throughout the year, you will enter winter with your skin at its optimal condition.


Hydration begins from the inside out. Our bodies are comprised mostly of water, and we need to take in a large quantity of water each day to replenish what we lose through sweat, waste, and energy.
You can calculate your water needs by taking your weight in pounds and dividing it by two. That number, in ounces, is how much water you need for a day when you are working indoors and mostly sedentary. For example, if you weigh 120 pounds, you need 60 ounces of fluids (this includes the water found in foods and other drinks). Increase the amount of water if you will be doing strenuous work or exercise, or if it is hot enough to make you sweat.;
, Using sunscreen every day throughout the year, particularly in the sunniest months, helps to protect your skin from sun damage, which in turn gives you the best chance at healthy skin going into winter.


On days when you don't plan to spend much time outdoors, use an SPF 15 or 30sunscreen as part of your daily skincare routine, especially on your face. Use an SPF 50 if you will be outdoors for more than an hour.If you're not sure what level of SPF to use, remember that SPF numbers tell you how many minutes you can be in direct sun without burning. Basically, if no sunscreen means you can be outdoors one minute without sun damage, an SPF of 15 means you have 15 minutes before you would have sun damage.Some makeup products like foundation or tinted moisturizer contain sunscreen, but the thin layer that is typically applied does not provide enough coverage on its own. Be sure you apply sunscreen before applying makeup. In order to avoid a greasy or caked appearance, let the sunscreen soak in for a few minutes before adding the makeup., Your skin's health depends on a variety of factors, one of which is the diet that you consume. Eating the right balance of nutrients throughout the year can help keep your skin at its healthiest as you head into winter.


Be sure that your diet is high in omega-3s and DHA, which you can get from eating oily fish like tuna or salmon. If you don't eat a lot of fish, supplement with DHA capsules.
Eat foods containing other healthy oils, like nuts, olive oil, coconuts and coconut oil, and butter. Avoid fried foods, saturated fats, and foods containing high amounts of sugar, which can wreak havoc on your skin's health and appearance.
Eat foods containing selenium. Selenium is a mineral, and research suggests it protects your skin from sun damage caused by free radicals. Some foods that are high in selenium include Brazil nuts, shrimp, lamb, and button mushrooms.You can also take a selenium supplement, available at most pharmacies and health food stores.
Be sure your diet contains antioxidants, which can also reduce damage to the skin. Colorful fruits and vegetables like berries, peppers, and beets are high in antioxidants."

Adjust your face washing technique.,
Find the right moisturizer.,
Consider a heavier moisturizer for nighttime use.,
Avoid excessive facial treatments.,
Don't forget about your lips.",How to Care for the Face in Winter2," It may take some trial and error to learn what works best for your skin type, but in general, you should never use a harsh soap on your facial skin, especially not in winter.


Choose a mild cleanser that is alcohol-free and does not contain sulfates (an ingredient that strips the lipids from your skin, reducing its protective barrier). In winter when skin is at its most vulnerable, it's a good idea to use a formula for sensitive skin, even if you don't normally consider your skin sensitive.If the facial soap you choose leaves your skin feeling tight, dry, or with a ""squeaky clean"" feeling, find a different one. Those are signs that your skin is being stripped of its protective layer of naturally occurring oils and lipids.The best mild soaps apply more like a thin moisturizer (without foaming and in a creamy layer).Try Cetaphil, Olay face wash for sensitive skin, or Burt's Bees Sensitive Facial Cleanser.If you do not have acne or other skin issues, using a small bit of coconut oil is enough to cleanse the skin. It is very mild and has the additional benefit of moisturizing your skin. To use, take a small amount of coconut oil in your fingers (coconut oil is solid at temperatures below 72°F or 22°C, but will melt on contact with your skin). Rub into your facial skin and gently remove with a warm, moist washcloth or tissue. Do not rub vigorously, as that can irritate your skin. Coconut oil has the added benefit of being an excellent way to remove makeup.
In the mornings, unless you have very oily skin or acne that needs to be treated, consider using nothing but water to wash the face. Soaps remove natural protective oils which leaves your skin vulnerable to chapping, and morning skin is not really dirty since you've been sleeping on a clean pillow all night with no make-up on., This will vary depending on your skin type, but in general, heavier creams are best for the dry, cold winter months.


Your warm weather moisturizer is unlikely to be effective in the winter months. Many people who use a light moisturizer in the spring and summer need a heavier cream or ointment for the winter.
Don't be afraid to use oils on your face. Years ago, many people believed that oils in face products would cause acne, but new products containing oils such as jojoba, sweet almond, primrose, avocado, argan, or coconut oil have flipped this logic on its head. Look for an ointment or cream that is ""oil-based"" rather than ""water-based"" for the best winter moisturization.If you have sensitive skin, look for products that are marked ""fragrance free,"" as fragrance can cause irritation, itchiness, and dry patches.

, The nighttime is a great time to allow your skin to rest and absorb extra moisture to prepare for the coming day. Additionally, indoor heaters can cause a lot of dryness on the face overnight, so a heavier moisturizer can ward that off.


Consider an oil treatment such as pure argan oil, or a nighttime facial moisturizing mask, which is essentially a heavy cream.
While most nighttime facial creams will not damage your pillowcase, those that are oil-based might leave a stain, so consider sleeping with a towel wrapped around your pillowcase or using a pillowcase that you don't mind staining.

, While you may enjoy spa treatments the rest of the year, less is often more during the winter, when the skin is more sensitive to chemicals and abrasion.


Peels, masks, and scrubs used in the winter months can simply irritate already-compromised winter skin. Use them minimally, or not at all.Scrubs in particular can be damaging to the surface of the skin. Avoid those that contain jagged particles (like those made from walnut shells) as well as those that contain plastic microbeads, which do not decompose and pose a threat to wildlife as they wash down the drain.If you do use a scrub, use a gentle one that contains exfoliating particles made of sodium bicarbonate (that is, baking soda), which will dissolve as you wash it down the drain. Olay's Pro-X brand is one you can try.Be sure if you use a toner that it is alcohol-free, as alcohol is very drying to the skin., The lips are more delicate and tend to become chapped due to dehydration, harsh winter winds, and dry air. Prevent these problems with the right precautions.


Use lip balm every day to prevent chapping, particularly those formulated with Vitamin E and beeswax. If you will be outdoors at all, especially during the hours of 10 am–3 pm in the Western hemisphere (when the sun is at its peak) or when there is snow on the ground, be sure to use a lip balm with SPF 15 or higher.At night, use a thicker lip treatment. A homemade mixture of shea butter and coconut oil (melted together in the microwave) is affordable and effective. Mix it with a little sweet orange essential oil, and you have a great homemade holiday gift as well!
Avoid ""matte"" lipsticks as they tend to dry out the skin (as well as accentuating every dry flake and wrinkle). Generally, glossy or shiny lipsticks tend to be the most hydrating, although you may have to try a few brands to find one that works well for you. If you do want to try the matte lipstick trend, be sure to gently exfoliate and moisturize your lips first (a soft toothbrush with a bit of coconut oil on it works great for this).Most important: Don't lick your lips. Although many people do it, it increases irritation by drying your lips further as your saliva evaporates. Use lip balm if you feel the urge to lick your lips."
"
Avoid hot showers and baths.,
Adapt your climate control settings in your home.,
Avoid environmental hazards.",How to Care for the Face in Winter3," While it may be tempting to indulge in a hot shower or bath in the cold winter months, doing so will strip your entire body's skin of moisture and leave it vulnerable to dryness and chapping.Warm showers will save energy and preserve the natural moisture on your face and body.
In addition to watching the temperature, keep your shower or bath quick. The longer you are in water of any temperature, the more of your natural oils you will wash away.

, Dry, cold winter air requires changes to your living space in order to protect your skin from damage.


Keep the thermostat down. Using central heating is particularly bad for the skin, as it can cause it to dehydrate which results in itchiness and dry patches. If you have a radiator heating system, use it instead.
Turn on the humidifier. Dry winter air causes dry winter skin, so hook up the humidifier to add moisture back to the air, which will be absorbed by your skin., In addition to adjusting the way you live in your own home, avoiding other hazards can help protect your facial skin through the winter months.


Winter air tends to trap chemical air pollution close to the ground, making smog more of a problem in the cold months. Smog pollution in the air turns to free radicals, which researchers believe can damage the outer layer of the skin and cause premature aging.Try to minimize time you spend outdoors in commuter cities and other areas with high levels of air pollution.Watch out for winter sunburn. Many people forget to apply their sunscreen in the winter months, but sun damage and sunburn is just as much a concern during the cold months as during the hot months. During the winter, you are likely to cover your entire body to stay warm, but your neck and face remain exposed most of the time. This can lead to increased risk of skin cancer if you don't remember to apply your sunscreen daily."
"
Increase your moisturization levels.,
Treat severely chapped lips.,
See a dermatologist or aesthetician.",How to Care for the Face in Winter4," Even if you have already increased the thickness of your typical moisturizer for the winter months, you may find partway through the season that even a thick cream is not enough to prevent your skin from feeling tight or itchy. That is a good indication that you need to increase the heaviness or thickness of the cream.


The marketing terms used on facial moisturizers can give you a clue as to the level of hydration they provide. While there are no industry-wide regulations on the use of the terms, products labeled ""serum,"" ""lotion,"" ""cream,"" or ""oil,"" tend to contain increasing amounts of oil. That is to say, a serum is mostly water based, a lotion contains mostly water with some oil, a cream contains more oil, and a face oil tends to be mostly oil, although it often contains other ingredients as well.You can use more than one product for extra moisturization; just be sure to start with the product that is more water-based first, so it can absorb into your skin before applying the next product.

, Even if you have been diligent in applying lip balm all winter, extreme environmental conditions like winter sun and wind and dry indoor air might still result in flaky, peeling, or even cracked and bleeding lips. Treating them properly can keep the problem from escalating, and prevent future problems.


Try a medicated lip balm such as Carmex or Blistex. These medicated balms contain ingredients like camphor as an analgesic, dimethicone to treat dryness, and a sunscreen to prevent further issues.
If your lips continue to be irritated despite using lip balm regularly, consider that you might be allergic to the balm itself. Many people experience irritation using natural and plant-based oils in their lip products (like beeswax and shea butter). Try using a petroleum-based moisturizer, like Vaseline or Aquaphor, which will provide a protective layer to your skin., These specialists will be able to diagnose your skin care needs and provide a personalized plan for treatment through the winter months, taking your area's weather into account.


If you have severe winter skin issues like eczema or psoriasis, you might need a steroid prescription, which is only available from a doctor.
A sore, dry, or irritated patch on your face or lip that will not heal despite continued treatment can be an indication of an underlying problem, including skin cancer. Be sure to visit a dermatologist and have any such issues assessed to rule out the risk of cancer."

Put on sunscreen.,
Make sure that right after the treatment you apply cream or ice or something to keep the area cool and numb to minimize discomfort even though the person in charge will definitely make sure of this.

,
Even though this is extremely rare, there are chances of having something like a boil which may leave a mark.,
Scrub a week after your treatment.",How to Care for the Skin After Laser Hair Removal," All the areas treated by the laser hair removal must be covered with plenty of sunscreen because this skin may be sensitive to darkening, especially for those who have skin that is already sensitive or are dark skinned.;
,, In that case, contact your doctor immediately and they will tell you what to apply on that area and send them pictures of the mark(s) if you cannot visit them in person.

, This will not only make the hair fall out faster, but keep your skin smooth. However DO NOT scrub if your skin burns, itches or hurts.

Experiment with phototherapy.",How to Care for Itchy and Irritated Skin," Regardless of the cause, itchy and irritated skin is never helped by scratching it — it may feel good initially, but it almost always makes the condition worse. As such, refrain from scratching your itchy skin and try some of the remedies mentioned below, which can help relieve the urge to scratch. If the urge is too irresistible, cover the itchy area of your skin with breathable clothes or light bandages.Keep your nails cut short, even, and smooth to avoid causing more damage to your skin when you do scratch it. Scratching can draw blood, break blisters and lead to infections.
Consider wearing thin cotton gloves, latex gloves or socks over your hands to prevent from scratching irritated skin.
Try patting or tapping the itchy area of your skin, rather than scratching it.;
, In addition to covering your irritated skin from the sun and making it more difficult to scratch, loose cotton (or silk) clothing is more comfortable, softer on the skin and more breathable than artificial fibers.So stick with cotton and silk clothing and avoid wearing itchy wool and man-made fabrics such as polyester that don't breath and lead to perspiration and more irritation.


Consider wearing loose cotton or silk robes with roomy sleeves while in your house. Then switch to light and loose bedclothes at night — flannel works well in winter months.
During warmer months, stick with your thin cotton or silk pajamas, and just use a sheet for covering so you don't over-heat.
Avoid tight fitting or clingy clothes if you have itchy and irritated skin. The more room for your skin to breathe and evaporate sweat, the better.

, A variety of additives in soap, shampoo and laundry detergents can further irritate itchy and irritated skin, and in some cases, be the direct cause of your condition. As such, avoid using perfumed soap, shower gel, shampoos or deodorants — look for natural alternatives with minimal ingredients (the fewer chemicals listed in the ingredients the better) or ones that claim they are hypoallergenic.Rinse all the soap completely off your body so no residue remains. After washing, apply an unscented moisturizer to protect and soothe your skin.
Use a mild, unscented laundry detergent when washing your clothes, towels and bedding. Use the extra-rinse cycle on your washing machine to get as much detergent as possible from your clothes and bedding.
Dry your clothes and bedding with natural, unscented dryer sheets to help prevent skin irritation.

, Changing your bathing habits can also help trigger itchy and irritated skin, or soothe it if you've already developed it. In general, don't bathe too often (no more than once daily or your skin will dry out) and don't use water that's too hot or too cold — extreme temperatures can further irritate skin.Hot water, in particular, can scold skin, dissolve away natural oils within skin and lead to dehydration and flakiness. Instead, bathe with lukewarm or cool water and keep your showers and baths to less than 20 minutes at the most — 10 minutes or less is ideal.


Adding natural oils, moisturizers or baking soda to your bath water can soothe skin and reduce itchiness.
Consider adding uncooked oatmeal or colloidal oatmeal (a finely ground oatmeal that's made for bathing) to your bath water for its soothing and anti-inflammatory effects.Buy a shower filter that filters out chemicals that can irritate your skin, such as chlorine and nitrites.
Once you're finished washing, dab or pat your skin dry, rather than rubbing it. Use soft, freshly washed towels and not older ones that have gotten a little crusty.

, Concerns about your finances, employment, school, relationships and social life often lead to stress, which can contribute to a variety of itchy skin conditions.The chemicals and hormones released within your body during times of stress can lead to rashes, blemishes and irritated skin. Reducing or managing your daily stressors promotes healthier skin and well-being. Don't be afraid to make significant life changes to avoid stressful situations.


Be realistic about your obligations and responsibilities. People often get stressed because they are over-committed or over-scheduled.
Think about reducing contact with people who bring lots of stress to your life.Manage your time better. If always being late causes you stress, leave for work or school a little early. Plan ahead and be realistic.
Use exercise to handle stress. Be active and go exercise when stressed out.
Talk to friends and family members about your stressful issues. Venting about your issues can help. If no one is around, write your feelings down in a journal.

, Cold compresses can help relieve the itching and irritation caused by a variety of skin conditions, including psoriasis and eczema.Cold therapy can also reduce inflammation by causing the small surface blood vessels beneath the skin to constrict. Soak a clean, soft cloth in cold water and put it in the fridge for a few hours before wrapping it around your itchy and inflamed skin.


Wrap your irritated skin with the cold compress for up to 15 minutes, two to three times daily or as needed for temporary relief.
To make the cold compress last longer, place some crushed ice in a small plastic bag and wrap it with a soft cloth before applying it to your itchy skin.
Avoid soaking your irritated skin in ice — it may give you some initial relief, but it can cause shock to your blood vessels and lead to frostbite.

, Aloe vera gel is a popular herbal remedy for inflamed skin regardless of cause, but it's particularly effective for sunburn. It has a strong ability to soothe irritated itchy skin, reduce tenderness and significantly speed up the healing process.Aloe vera also has antimicrobial properties, which is helpful if your skin condition is caused by a fungal or bacterial infection. Apply aloe vera gel or lotion to your itchy skin multiple times per day, especially during the first few days after you notice irritation on your skin.


Aloe vera contains polysaccharides that help to hydrate your skin and keep it moisturized. It also triggers collagen production, which gives skin its elasticity.
If you have an aloe plant in your garden, cut off a leaf and apply the thick inner gel-like juice directly to your irritated skin.
Alternatively, buy a bottle of pure aloe gel from your local pharmacy. For best results, place the aloe gel in the fridge and apply it once it gets cold.

, Not only is coconut oil a good moisturizer for the skin, but it also contains fatty acids (caprylic, capric & lauric acids) that are strong fungicides, which means they kill fungi, such as Candida and other species.Thus, if your itchy and irritated skin is due to a fungal or yeast infection, apply some organic coconut oil three to five times daily for a week and see how it works.


The fatty acids within coconut oil kill yeast and fungus by destroying their cell walls, so it's very effective, but safe for your skin.
Coconut oil is also effective against bacterial skin infections and other causes of itchiness, such as eczema and psoriasis.
A good quality coconut oil is likely to be a solid at room temperature instead of a liquid.

, Heavy ointments such as petroleum jelly (Vaseline), mineral oil, butter or vegetable shortening are recommended for badly irritated skin (such as eczema) because they hold moisture in the skin and provides a layer of protection from irritants.Creams such as Eucerin and Lubriderm are thicker than most lotions and may also be helpful, but you'll have to apply them more often because they get absorbed quicker. Moisturize your skin throughout the day, particularly after bathing, so the moisture gets sealed in and the likelihood of dryness or cracking is reduced.


If your skin is particularly itchy and irritated, consider applying some hydrocortisone cream. Over-the-counter types (less than 1% cortisone) are helpful for quickly reducing irritation.
If your skin is not too badly irritated, consider lighter natural moisturizers that contain vitamins C and E, MSM, aloe vera, cucumber extract, camphor, calamine and/or calendula — all help to soothe or help repair damaged skin.
Take the time to massage cream or ointment into your itchy skin, especially if it's around your fingers and toes.

, In addition to applying creams and ointments to keep moisture in your skin, drinking lots of water will also keep your skin hydrated and less likely to become itchy and irritated.Focus on drinking purified water, natural juice and/or uncaffeinated sports drinks so your body and skin can rehydrate and quickly repair itself. Start with at least eight 8-oz glasses daily.


Avoid beverages with caffeine because it's a diuretic that stimulates urination and can lead to dehydration.
Caffeine-rich drinks include coffee, black and green teas, most soda pop (especially colas) and the majority of energy drinks.

, Over-the-counter antihistamines such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl) or loratadine (Claritin, Alavert, and others) can help relieve itchy and inflamed skin that's characteristic of allergic reactions, psoriasis and eczema.Antihistamines block the action of histamine, which is over-produced during allergic reactions and leads to swelling, redness and itchiness of the skin.


Reducing the amount of histamine prevents small blood vessels beneath the skin from expanding, which reduces redness and the itchy sensation.
Some antihistamines can cause drowsiness, dizziness, blurred vision and confusion — so don't drive your car or operate heavy machinery while taking them., See your doctor or dermatologist (skin specialist) and get a proper diagnosis of your skin condition. If the above-mentioned remedies don't help much, ask your doctor about prescription corticosteroid creams. Cortisone, prednisone and other corticosteroids are strong anti-inflammatories and decrease reddening of the skin, which can reduce itchiness.Prednisone is stronger than cortisone and often a good choice for severe sunburn, psoriasis and allergies — it decreases inflammation by reversing the size of capillaries beneath the skin and suppresses the immune system's response.
After applying corticosteroid cream to your itchy skin, wrap the affected area in plastic wrap because it can improve absorption and help any blisters disappear quicker.Side effects of corticosteroid therapy include thinning of the skin, edema (water retention), pigment changes, spider veins, stretch marks, and reduced immune system function. Chronic use can cause skin to become dry and scaly.

, Instead of using strong corticosteroid creams for your itchy skin, other prescription medications may be recommended due to less risk of side effects. For example, drugs called calcineurin inhibitors can be as effective as corticosteroid creams in some cases, especially if the itchy area isn't very large.Calcineurin inhibitors come in creams and pills.


Examples of calcineurin inhibitors include tacrolimus 0.03% and 0.1% (Protopic) and pimecrolimus 1% (Elidel).
Other prescription drugs that can reduce skin itching are antidepressants, such as mirtazapine (Remeron). Side effects may include drowsiness, dry mouth, constipation, weight gain, and changes in vision.For unknown reasons, selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors, such as fluoxetine (Prozac) and sertraline (Zoloft), can help reduce various types of skin itching in most people., If all other treatments aren't effective for your itchy and irritated skin, your doctor may recommend a special therapy that combines exposure to certain wavelengths of ultraviolet (UV) light with certain drugs that help make your skin more receptive to the UV radiation.Phototherapy appears to work for many skin conditions, especially eczema, by increasing vitamin D production in skin and killing any microorganisms on the skin — the effects are reduced inflammation, less itchiness and faster healing.For treating most skin conditions, narrow band ultraviolet B (UVB) light is the most common type of phototherapy recommended by dermatologists.
Broadband UVB phototherapy, PUVA (Psoralen and UVA) and UVA1 are other forms of phototherapy that are sometimes used for treating eczema and other skin conditions.
Phototherapy avoids the UVA portion of light, which is damaging to skin and can accelerate aging and increase the risk of skin cancers.
Multiple sessions are usually scheduled until the itching is under control.

Opt for scent-free products.,
Skip products containing dyes.,
Avoid acidic products.,
Stay away from alcohols.,
Protect your skin from other chemical products.,
Use natural cleaners and household products.,
Use moisturizer with soothing ingredients.,
Choose hypoallergenic products.",How to Care for Sensitive Skin1," Many perfumes in products like lotion and soap can be irritating to sensitive skin. Opt for products that say “perfume free,” or “unscented” on the label. Laundry detergent frequently has perfumes in it, and choosing unscented detergent to wash your clothes can really help your skin problems.Detergents that claim to be “deodorant” or “antibacterial” can also be irritating. It’s best to avoid these.You may want to try plant-based detergents.;
, Ever wonder how your pink soap got its color? Many body care products — including lotion, soap, shampoo, and laundry detergent — contain harsh dyes to make them look more appealing. Whenever possible, choose products stating they are dye-free or colorless, or when given the choice, pick the plain looking items over those with bright or unnatural colors.Dye will be labeled as “FD&C” or “D&C” then a color and number., Acid found in products can cause flare ups in skin prone to outbreaks and sensitivity. Many facial cleansers contain acid because they can help to fight breakouts. Check the ingredients list and avoid products that list acid.Some ingredients to look for are alpha-hydroxy acids, beta-hydroxy acids, ascorbic acid, and kojic acid.Borax, or boric acid, is also present in many soaps and cleaners and should be avoided., Products containing alcohol can cause skin irritation or allergic reaction on sensitive skin. Many cosmetics, cleaning products, and even medications contain ethanol (or “ethyl alcohol”).Alcohol can have a drying effect on skin, which can lead to irritation. Check the ingredients list and avoid these whenever possible.


Cetyl, stearyl, lanolin, and cetearyl alcohols are known as “fatty alcohols” are not as rough on sensitive skin — though note for yourself if you react to a product containing these.Limit your alcohol consumptions to improve skin quality, as well. Drinking alcohol can worsen preexisting conditions such as rosacea and psoriasis and dehydrates your body., Acetate is present in nail polish remover and hair dye, among other products.Sulfates may be found in shampoo and household products. Hydroquinone is a chemical used for bleaching or skin lightening and may be in lotions or cosmetics.These ingredients aren’t inherently unhealthy, but may be irritating to sensitive skin.


When contacting these chemicals, wear gloves.
Note if you react to products containing these ingredients. Recognizing your skin allergies can involves some sleuthing — learn for yourself what to avoid.

, Most commercial cleansers contain harsh chemicals. Unfortunately, what’s bad for germs is also tough on sensitive skin. Try plant-based cleaning products or those that are labeled as “hypoallergenic” or “for sensitive skin.” Wear rubber gloves whenever you're cleaning for added protection.

, If your skin is prone to itching and redness, use a moisturizer with ingredients like aloe, jojoba, or chamomile. These are especially soothing to sensitive skin.Use heavier, thicker creams or ointments in the winter, and lighter moisturizing creams in the summer.If your skin is very dry, or seems to react to almost any lotion you use, try a petroleum-based products like Vaseline or Eucerin. These can feel oily, but are very hydrating and are unlikely to cause skin irritation.

, If your skin problems are due to allergic-type reactions — frequently causing redness and itching — then look for products labeled “hypoallergenic.” These contain fewer ingredients that are common causes of allergic reactions in skin.


Many products that are hypoallergenic are also free of dyes and perfumes, but not always. Even if something is listed as hypoallergenic, check the ingredients list and go for dye, perfume, alcohol, and acid-free options.
If you go through numerous hypoallergenic products to no avail, try using the mildest products on the market — baby products. Baby shampoo, soap, and lotion are formulated for delicate skin, and may be gentle enough to nourish your skin without irritating it.

Cover up!,
Use a moisturizer.,
Wear lip balm.,
Stay dry.,
Don't forget sunscreen on clear, cold days.",How to Care for Skin During Winter1," The cause-and-effect relationship between winter weather and dry, damaged skin is easy to understand — cold, dry outdoor air (or, worse, hot, dry air from your heating system) sucks the natural moisture away from your skin, leaving it arid and cracked like parched desert earth. One of the best ways to keep this from happening is simply to keep the air from touching your skin. If you can, try wearing long sleeves, long pants, and any other skin-covering accessories to keep your skin protected.


Gloves are an especially smart choice — since your hands are often exposed throughout the day, covering them when you can goes a long way towards protecting their skin. Try slipping on a pair of mittens or driving gloves early in the day before you head to work or begin your commute, slipping them off only when you need to type, write, or otherwise use your hands.;
, Lotions and other ""moisturizers"" essentially work by supplying moisture directly to the skin and holding this moisture in with a layer of oil or grease — this is why heavy balms, like vaseline, work excellently as moisturizers, but produce an unpleasant ""greasy"" feeling. If you're suffering from dried out skin in the winter, try giving yourself a quick rub with your preferred lotion to stay moisturized. This should help ease any skin that's already dried out and protect your skin from future damage for at least an hour or two.


If your skin is already irritated, try to use an unscented lotion or balm. Some fragrances are known to cause inflammation or rash when applied to already-irritated skin (especially if you're allergic to the fragrance).There are few lotions that flat-out won't protect your skin's moisture at least somewhat — nearly all will work basically the same way. As a very general rule, however, thicker ""creams"" and ""balms"" will give a greater moisturizing effect than thinner, liquid-y lotions., Even if the skin on your face and hands goes unscathed during the winter, there's a decent chance that the delicate skin on your lips may become dry, cracked, or flaky. To fight this, try using lip balm (or similar alternatives like chap stick, lip gloss, etc.), which works according to the same basic principle as ordinary lotions and balms for your skin. In a pinch, you can even use most high-quality thicker skin balms (like Vaseline or products containing beeswax or shea butter) on your lips to get the same effect, though the taste may be unpleasant.


Don't believe myths that claim that lip balm is addictive or contains ground glass — these have been proven to be false., Ironically, getting wet when you're out in cold weather can cause it to become dry and irritated later on. Wet clothes (especially gloves and socks) can cause irritation when they rub against the skin, leaving it chapped, sore, and vulnerable to further irritation. For this reason, try not to spend much time in wet clothes when it's cold outside. Heading inside for a fresh set of clothes is definitely worth it if it keeps your skin safe in the long run.


If you're outdoors for a long time in cold weather (for instance, if you're on a wilderness hike), try to pace any exercise you do so that you don't sweat heavily. Not only can this cause chapped, irritated skin, but, in extreme conditions can also lead to frostbite and hypothermia by making it difficult for the body to keep itself warm., Many people assume that because it's cold outside in the winter, they won't need sunscreen. In fact, the skin is extra-vulnerable to sun damage in the winter. The earth is actually closer to the sun in the winter than it is in summer, and, in addition, the ozone layer (which absorbs some of the sun's harmful UV rays) is typically at its thinnest in the winter.On top of this, snow and ice can actually reflect up to 85% of the sun's rays, allowing the rays to hit your skin both from above and below.For these reasons, it's important to remember to apply sunscreen during the winter when you intend to spend lots of time out in the sun.


Note that this need for sunscreen is especially urgent at high altitudes — the higher you go, the greater your exposure to the sun's UV rays.Keep this in mind as you pack for your winter skiing trip!

Cleanse your face twice per day.As skin ages, it becomes more sensitive and loses elasticity.,
Apply toner a few minutes after cleansing.Washing your face alters the skin’s natural pH levels.,
Apply moisturizer with sunscreen.Moisturizing regularly is crucial for aging skin.,
Wear less makeup.It’s tempting to apply more makeup to correct the skin imperfections that come with aging, but doing this unfortunately tends to add years to your face.",How to Care for Your Skin over 401," Because of this, extra care must be taken with your daily skincare regimen. Wash your face with lukewarm water once in the morning and once in the evening before bed. Use a mild, gentle cleanser with a creamy consistency, which won’t strip your skin of its natural moisture.


Before cleansing, always wash your hands thoroughly to avoid transferring bacteria to your face.
After cleansing, dry your face gently by patting it with soft washcloth. Never use scrubbing motions to dry your skin.
If you have oily or acne-prone skin, try cleansers with salicylic acid or sulfur.Unless you have visible acne lesions, avoid products that contain benzoyl peroxide. This chemical is too harsh for mature skin.;
, Toner restores that pH balance. When pH balance is restored, you will experience less inflammation and your skin will be more resilient to bacteria. Wait a few minutes after cleansing, then gently swipe a toner-soaked cotton pad all over your face. Do not rinse the toner off.


Avoid applying toner to the sensitive skin around your eyes.
Use a toner that is alcohol-free for best results.

, After cleansing and toning, apply a thin layer of deeply hydrating moisturizer to your skin. This will plump it and minimize the look of fine lines and wrinkles. Make sure the one you choose has a minimum of SPF 30 sunscreen in it if you’re planning to go outside. Wearing sunscreen is one of the easiest and most effective ways to prevent premature aging, sun damage and wrinkles.If you struggle with oily skin, select a moisturizer that is oil-free. Gel formulas tend to be the lightest moisturizers.
If you have dry or sensitive skin, use a cream formula. These tend to be thicker and heavier.

, Makeup sinks into the fine lines and wrinkles, drawing unwanted attention to them. For mature skin, less is more. Look for hydrating and sheer formulas. Tinted moisturizers that provide light coverage are a great option, too.


When purchasing makeup, look for mineral formulas. These protect the skin and act as a natural sunscreen.Mineral makeup doesn’t settle into fine line and wrinkles as much as some of the other formulas do. It also doesn’t clog pores.
Always remove makeup before you go to sleep. Sleeping with it on can cause chronic inflammation, irritation and damage for aging skin."

Continue caring for your skin after you’re healed. Always wear moisturizer with SPF. Continue wearing sunscreen, a hat and sunglasses when you’re in direct sunlight.;
, Resume your regular routine, but avoid doing a lot of exercise the day after your microdermabrasion. Give your body this time to heal. Also avoid swimming in chlorinated pools for a few days after your treatment because the chlorine is very drying., Wait at least a week before waxing any areas that were treated. Check the ingredients in your skincare products for Retin-A, glycolic acids, fragrances, and/or a high alcohol content. Don’t use products with any of those ingredients for at least two days following your procedure., Keep your hands away from your sensitive, treated skin so it doesn’t become more irritated by the oils and bacteria on your hands. Wash your hands well before applying moisturizer or sunscreen to minimize those oils and bacteria. Also avoid scratching and picking at your skin.

, Give your skin time to recover after your treatment. Go ahead and schedule multiple treatments, but keep them at least a week apart. After your first few treatments, you might change to a less frequent regimen."

Wear sunscreen daily.,
Wear clothing made of natural materials.,
Wear metal with caution.,
Cover your skin in extreme weather.,
See your doctor if you have severe or persistent skin problems.",How to Care for Sensitive Skin2," The easiest way to protect your skin from sun damage is to use a daily moisturizer that has an SPF of 15 or higher.You can even use higher SPF, like 30 or 45, on your face. If your moisturizer does not contain SPF, then be sure to apply sunscreen to your face, arms, and other uncovered skin in the morning before leaving the house. Remember, you should wear sunscreen even on cloudy days.If your sunscreen causes skin irritation, get sunscreen that is hypoallergenic and free of fragrances and dyes.


The sun is strongest between 10am and 2pm, so avoid being out in the sunlight during this interval, if possible.When out in the sun, reapply sunscreen every two to three hours.Never use tanning beds., Synthetic fibers like rayon and spandex are more likely to irritate skin than natural material. Try to wear clothes made of cotton, silk, or other soft natural cloth.Despite being natural, wool is scratchy and is best avoided if you have sensitive skin.

, Nickel is the metal most commonly responsible for causing allergic reactions, and is present in many pieces of jewelry.If you wear nickel earrings and your earlobes get red, puffy, or itchy, that’s an allergy. Avoid nickel by ensuring you buy jewelry that is stainless steel or silver. Copper can also cause skin reactions like itching and redness, as well as turn some skin a greenish color temporarily. Unfortunately, gold is also becoming more of a common allergy.


Nickel and other metals might also be present in small amounts on clothing, such as buttons or snaps of jeans.

, Very cold air can dry out skin, as can being in very hot climates. When going outside in the winter, cover up as much skin as you can with hats, gloves, and scarves. If you’ll be out in hot, dry temperatures all day, wear sunscreen, hats, and sunglasses, and cover your skin with as much light-colored, loose clothing as possible., Sometimes your best efforts and careful attention aren’t enough to figure out what is irritating your skin, or how to avoid it. If you have a rash that won’t go away, skin irritation that causes you discomfort that interferes with daily activities or is getting worse over time, see your doctor. They can do a patch test to figure out what, if anything, you’re allergic to.There are also prescription medications available if your skin problems are severe.


Ask questions like, “Why does my skin get so itchy and flaky in the winter?” and, “What medicine is available if the problem doesn’t go away?”
If your family doctor can’t help, they can refer you to a dermatologist — a skin specialist.

Take shorter baths and showers.,
Don't scrub your skin harshly.,
Shave with care.,
Air dry or pat dry.,
Moisturize your hands often throughout the day.,
Put a humidifier in your bedroom.,
Keep a skin care journal.",How to Care for Sensitive Skin3," Soaking in hot water will dry out your skin because it washes away protective oils. Take warm, rather than super hot, baths and showers. Limit how long you soak in the water. Generally, try to keep it to 5-10 minutes., Avoid exfoliating with harsh scrubs with “pits” in them, which can cause flaking and irritation. Rather, use a cream cleanser with “beads.” Stay away from rough washcloths, and instead use a soft sponge or puff. Just use your fingertips when washing your face. Softly clean your skin in gentle concentric circles., When shaving your legs, face, or anywhere on your body, always use shaving cream or lotion. Never dry shave or shave with just soap. Shave in the direction of hair growth, not against it. Replace your razor blade weekly — shaving with dull blades can irritate the skin.Don’t use hair removing creams or depilatories, which can be very irritating., After your shower or bath, avoid rubbing your skin dry with a towel. If you have time to air dry, do that by staying nude until moisture naturally evaporates from your skin. If you can’t air dry, pat your skin dry with a soft, clean towel.To best hydrate your skin, apply moisturizer while your skin is still a little damp. This traps moisture in your skin., Your hands get the most wear and tear, and are exposed to the most irritation, throughout the day.Carry a small bottle of unscented, moisture-rich lotion in your purse, backpack or briefcase. Moisturize your hands multiple times throughout the day, especially rubbing lotion onto the backs of your hands and over your knuckles where the most chapping happens.


If you’re in a profession where you have to wash your hands often, or live in a particularly cold, dry climate, your hands may take a beating. Moisturize every time you wash your hands, or at least hourly.

, Dry air irritates skin by drying it out, causing chapping, itching, and flaking. This is worse in the winter, when windows are closed at the heater is on. Get a portable humidifier and put it in your bedroom, or whichever room of the house you use most often, to keep your skin moisturized during winter months.Clean your humidifier often so it doesn’t grow fungus or bacteria., Your skin may react poorly to specific ingredients or products, and if you don’t pay careful attention it may be difficult to recognize the problem. Keep a journal, and whenever you experience skin irritation write down everything you used that day – include soap, lotion, detergent, cleaning products, and even what jewelry you were wearing. Note where the irritation occurred – sometimes you can tell the reason for red or itchy skin because it’s right underneath a certain piece of clothing or jewelry.


Take this journal with you if you see a doctor about your skin so they have as much information as possible about your problem.

Treat dry skin with a mild lotion or cream.,
Use a humidifier.,
Use gentle cleaning products.,
Consider using natural oils.,
For serious skin problems, consult a dermatologist.",How to Care for Skin During Winter2," If the dry winter air (or the dry air from your heating system) has already caused your skin to become dry or cracked, it's important to take proper care of it until it's able to heal naturally. Moisturizers are your first line of defense against further damage. Apply a moisturizing lotion, balm, or cream to any irritated areas at least daily until the skin shows signs of improvement — at this point, you may gently taper off your moisturizer use and start relying on other methods of protection (though some moisturizer use may be necessary for the entire winter.)


Be sure to clean and bandage any major cracks or splits in the skin as you would with normal cuts and scrapes. Though unlikely, cracks in the skin can be infected if exposed to bacteria, leading to further pain and irritation, so basic prevention measures are important.

, As hinted at above, one of the least obvious (but most dangerous) places for skin irritation during the winter is inside your warm, cozy home! The warm air that comes out of most home heating systems is usually quite dry and can have a dehydrating effect on the skin similar to what you might experience in dry conditions outdoors.To avoid this, try running a humidifier in whichever room you spend the most time in at home. These handy devices vaporize water and release it into the air, increasing the humidity level in the surrounding area.


Ideally, for this purpose, you'll want to use an evaporative or steam humidifier. So-called ""cool mist"" humidifiers can sometimes release allergy-causing aerosols., The soap, shampoo, and other cleaning products you use on yourself during the winter can all have an effect on your skin's health. Harsh cleaning products, especially those containing alcohol or astringents, can strip away your skin's natural protective oils, making it extra-vulnerable to drying out.To prevent this, use the gentlest cleaning products available. Below is a very brief guide to making smart cleaning product purchases:


Soaps: Use mild, unscented varieties, as well as those advertised as ""moisturizing"" or ""for sensitive skin."" Moisturizing liquid body washes make a great alternative to ordinary soap. Avoid alcohol-based soaps or sanitizers and standard bar soaps, which can be too harsh for winter use.
Shampoos/hair products: Use shampoos labeled ""moisturizing"" or ""for reviving dry hair."" Condition after using shampoo.
Facial products: Use mild, foaming cleansers. Tend towards oil-based or ""moisturizing"" face rubs. Avoid alcohol or salicylic acid-based cleansers.

, You don't necessarily have to use a commercial lotion or balm to treat your dry skin. In some cases, a natural home remedy may do the trick. The problem with home remedies, however, is that they're usually unverified — that is, they're not backed up by serious scientific evidence. If you do plan on trying to treat your dry skin with a home remedy, try tending towards safe, mild natural oils, which should trap moisture near the skin like ordinary lotions. Just a few natural oils that are claimed to work as skin moisturizers are:Olive oil
Coconut oil
Avocado oil
Jojoba oil
Sweet almond oil
Grapeseed oil

, For most people, skin irritation during the winter is an annoying, but ultimately temporary problem. However, in extreme cases, dry skin can be a serious, lasting source of irritation. If your skin's dryness and irritation doesn't go away within a few weeks or starts to seriously affect your ability to live a happy, productive life, don't hesitate to see a dermatologist — if you don't know one, your general practitioner can refer you to one. In addition to helping with everyday dry and irritated skin, dermatologists can diagnose skin problems like eczema and psoriasis and prescribe treatments for them.


Note that, while quite rare, severe itching can sometimes be a sign of liver disease or cancer, so if you're experiencing itching that's interfering with your daily routine, you'll want to see a dermatologist right away to rule these serious conditions out."
"
Avoid abrasive clothing-on-skin contact.,
Resist itching.,
Don't take long, hot showers.,
Reduce alcohol-based perfume and aftershave use.",How to Care for Skin During Winter3," While it's always a good idea to cover up when you're in dry winter air, the way you cover up can affect how well you're able to protect your skin. For instance, you'll want to avoid any clothing that rubs against your skin in a way that leaves it chapped or irritated. Raw skin is vulnerable to further dehydration and irritation, so be sure to wear properly-fitted clothes and comfortable fabrics to prevent this.


Rough fabrics like wool are especially harmful — though wool is great for keeping you warm, it's also great for rubbing your skin red. If you're wearing wool, wear something under it to keep it from coming in contact directly with your skin. For instance, wool gloves are perfectly manageable if you wear thin, soft cotton gloves underneath them.

, Though it's sometimes quite tempting, itching almost always makes irritated skin worse, so try as hard as you can to avoid it. In addition to further irritating your skin, itching is a great way to cause infections by transferring bacteria from your hands to sore spots on the skin. If you do itch your skin (which isn't recommended), clean hands are a must to lessen (but not prevent) the risk of infection.


If you're suffering from itching, consider carrying some anti-itch cream (like hydrocortisone) for frequent applications to stave off the urge.

, Steaming hot water can feel great during the cold months of winter, but it can be murder on the skin if you aren't careful. Hot water strips the skin of its protective natural oils, making it much more likely to dry out, especially if the ambient air is dry as well. To avoid this, use warm (not hot) water, and try to limit your showers to about 10 minutes or less. Taking cooler, shorter showers will go a long way towards keeping your skin healthy during the winter (in addition to helping with flaky skin conditions like dandruff).

, Just like harsh soaps and cleaning solutions, some fragrances and perfumes (especially alcohol-based ones) can strip the skin's natural moisturizing oils away. In addition, the chemicals in many common fragrances can cause rashes or allergic reactions if applied to already-irritated skin. The solution is simple: use mild, weaker scents and try to limit use only to the parts of the body where odor is strongest, like the underarms, groin, and feet.

Identify your skin type.It’s important to buy products that match your skin type.,
Select gentle products.Avoid products with harsh chemicals and added fragrances.,
Consider using an AHA or retinoid product.Alpha hydroxyl acids (AHAs) and retinoids can reduce the signs of aging on your skin by encouraging rapid cell turnover.Both can be mildly irritating to the skin, so start out slowly.,
Exfoliate gently once per week.Exfoliant products help whisk away dry patches and scaly skin, which tend to emphasize the look of wrinkles and pores.",How to Care for Your Skin over 402," Not doing this can lead to ineffective skin care and may even contribute to aggravated skin issues. Five major skin types are generally recognized — normal, dry, oily, combination and sensitive. When purchasing products, check their labels to find out the skin types for which they are best suited. Additionally, conditions like acne, rosacea and inflammation should be addressed when choosing products.


Normal skin features an occasional blemish, but most of the time it feels smooth, supple and firm. There are no areas that are obviously oily or dry and flaky. Pores appear to be small or medium sized.
Dry skin feels tight and uncomfortable. Some areas will appear visibly red and flaky or bumpy.
Oily skin looks slick and shiny. If you touch it, it will feel damp. Pores are usually larger and breakouts more frequent.
Combination skin features oil around the nose, chin and forehead. The cheek area tends to be dry and flaky. Other areas are normal.
Sensitive skin shows inflammation and irritation when in contact with chemicals from cosmetics and products. The sensation is usually a burning one, and the skin turns red. Sensitive skin can react to changes in weather and even to different foods, depending on the person.

, Opt for cleansers and toners that are alcohol-free. Check product labels for terms like “mild” and “unscented.” If you’re acne-prone, look for skin-care products that won’t clog pores — these will have labels like “non-comedogenic” and “oil-free.”


As skin ages, it grows more sensitive. You can minimize unnecessary skin irritation by selecting gentle skin-care products.
Since skin loses its elasticity over time, be sure to apply skin-care products gently, as well. Avoid aggressive rubbing, pulling and stretching, which can damage it., Apply a retinoid product every third day for two weeks until your skin gets used to it. Eventually work your way up to a nightly application. Retinoid products can be obtained by prescription through a dermatologist and also over-the-counter.


OTC products contain smaller amounts of retinol — look for one that contains 1%, which is the highest OTC amount available.
Once your skin has adjusted to a nightly retinoid application, substitute an AHA product twice per week, which will increase anti-aging benefits., Choose a gentle formula — your skin should not be red or painful to touch after exfoliating. You should exfoliate after cleansing, or use a cleanser that has exfoliating properties. Toner and moisturizer should be applied after exfoliating.


Exfoliation also helps the skin absorb products better.
Limit exfoliation to once per week. Too much exfoliation can be damaging to mature skin.
If you have sensitive skin, consult a dermatologist before beginning an exfoliation regimen.

Get plenty of rest.Your skin faces trauma, toxins and environmental damage every day.,
Avoid touching your face and squeezing blemishes.Touching your face will transfer bacteria and oil residue to your skin, which can cause breakouts and other pore-clogging issues.,
Stay hydrated.,
Protect your skin from the sun.Sun protection is crucial for mature skin.,
Avoid smoking cigarettes.Cigarette smoke contains harmful chemicals and toxins that damage the skin, regardless of your age; however, these damages become more significant over time.,
Visit a board-certified dermatologist.If you’re concerned about your skin, or if you’re seeking other solutions, make an appointment to see a dermatologist.",How to Care for Your Skin over 403," During sleep, the skin repairs that damage. Because of this, the amount of sleep you get has a direct and visible effect on the appearance of your skin. It’s recommended that healthy adults should get between seven and nine hours of sleep every night. Aim to get a minimum of seven hours daily.Getting enough sleep can help slow down the appearance of aging skin.
It also reduces stress levels, which can contribute to premature aging of the skin.
Sleep deprivation can make mature skin look dull and lifeless. It may also exacerbate other skin conditions, such as acne and rosacea., When you must touch your face, such as when you’re washing it or applying skin-care products, thoroughly wash your hands with soap and warm water first.


Never squeeze or pinch at acne blemishes and avoid picking at your skin.
Both of these habits can unfortunately result in permanent scarring, especially for mature skin.

, As skin ages, oil production diminishes.This can leave it looking dry and dull. Combat this by keeping yourself well-hydrated every day. The daily recommended amount of fluid for healthy adults is approximately 13 cups (3 liters) for men and 9 cups (2.2 liters) for women. Try to get a large amount of your hydration from water, but beverages fruit juices, sports drinks and tea and foods that contain water (like watermelon) can also keep you hydrated.


Take in an additional 1.5 to 2.5 cups (400 to 600 milliliters) of fluids on days when you exercise or sweat more than usual., Ultraviolet (UV) rays from the sun have been proven to accelerate the aging of skin and a large amount of visible aging is directly caused by sun damage. Use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with a minimum of SPF 30 on your face and neck every day — rain or shine. If you’re planning to spend time in the sun, apply sunscreen all over your body and reapply it every couple of hours.


Whenever possible, wear sun-protective clothing, a wide-brimmed hat and sunglasses for additional defense.
Try to stay out of direct sunlight for significant periods of time — look for shady areas.

, Smoking will make your skin dry and your complexion dull. It contributes to premature aging, most significantly around the mouth, and causes skin to become less supple.


If you’re a smoker, talk to your doctor about smoking cessation options.
If you’re not a smoker, do your best to avoid second-hand smoke.

, Everyone’s skin is different, and a dermatologist can evaluate yours and offer customized suggestions and solutions. If you’ve tried OTC retinoid products and are unsatisfied with the results, a dermatologist can recommend different products or prescribe stronger retinol formulas.

Apply your SPF moisturizer often.,
Cool your skin down.,
Ask your dermatologist about painkillers and anti-inflammatory creams.",How to Care for Skin After Microdermabrasion2," Use it at least morning and night. Moisturize well before applying any makeup after your treatment so the moisturizer can buffer the makeup. Ask your doctor if you aren’t sure which moisturizer will be best for your skin after the treatment.Drink plenty of water. Like moisturizer, drinking water will also keep your skin hydrated.

, After the treatment, your face might feel like it has sunburn or windburn. Splash your face with cold water to make it feel better. Also try applying an ice pack or rubbing an ice cube on your face. Use the cold water and/or ice as often as you need to soothe your face., Only use these products if your doctor okays them. Follow the dosing directions closely for both especially so they don’t cause extra redness or little red bumps (petechiae). Wash your face with a very gentle cleanser before applying anti-inflammatory cream."
"
Contact your doctor if you have any bleeding.,
Monitor your recovery.,
Consult your doctor if you’re experiencing pain.",How to Care for Skin After Microdermabrasion3," Look out for petechiae (little red bumps), which can indicate bleeding under the surface of your skin. Check for purpura (purplish discolored spots that don’t turn white when you press on them), which are hemorrhages under your skin. Call your doctor if you have petechiae or purpura.Avoid taking aspirin to help with your discomfort. Aspirin can cause petechiae or purpura or make them worse.

, Note any changes to your skin, like redness or swelling. Keep track of how long the redness or swelling lasts. Call your doctor if they last longer than three days.


Also call if the redness or swelling start two or three days after your procedure, when you should be almost fully recovered.

, Ask your doctor about any long-lasting or extreme pain. Also call if you’re continuing to experience unusual irritation after three days. Be ready to describe your symptoms and any activities that might have caused the pain or irritation. This way your doctor can best advise you."

Shampoo your hair, it's an important first step.,
Ask a stylist about which shampoo to use.,
Squeeze any excess water from your hair.,
Condition your hair to provide moisture and detangle it.,
Use the appropriate amount of conditioner.,
Work in the conditioner correctly.,
Flatten or boil your beer.,
Pour the beer slowly through your hair.,
Ensure all your hair is fully saturated.,
Rinse your hair thoroughly.,
Brew some fresh chamomile tea and let it cool.,
Pour the tea slowly through clean, damp hair.,
Rinse out the tea with cool water.",How to Condition Your Hair with Beer and Chamomile," Shampoo is used to get everything clean before conditioner. Be sure to scrub your scalp and not just your hair., In general, however, there are a few types of hair to work with and specific shampoos that are most beneficial.


Fine hair is naturally thin, and needs volume. Conveniently, the shampoo for this type of hair is calling a volumizing shampoo.
Curly hair is, by nature, generally drier. Because of that, it's often recommended to use shampoo specifically tailored for that dryness.Natural oils, like coconut, are great for dry hair. Several other oils, such as grapeseed oil, help replenish the moisture.
Hair that produces oil in abundance (i.e. oily hair) does not need extra moisturizing products. Look for shampoo specifically designed for oily hair, which will also treat dandruff conditions.

, Water, in and of itself, works on the cuticles. Selecting cold or warm water is inconsequential as long as the shampoo is fully removed.Because moisture is still required for whatever type of conditioner you use, be sure not to get all water from the hair.

, Conditioner works on a molecular level by binding the dead cells of the cuticles together, at which point they are lying more closely and look less ragged.It's important to use conditioner since shampoo strips the hair. Some recommend conditioning each time you shampoo, but conditioning too much could make your hair listless and slick., Depending on your hair type, you may have to use trial and error to determine the amount. If your hair remains oily afterwards, too much conditioner was used. Too dry? Too little was used. Ultimately, the ideal amount used is about the size of a quarter., Believe it or not, there is a right and wrong way to condition your hair. Using conditioner incorrectly could have detrimental effects.The conditioner needs approximately one-to-two minutes in hair before being rinsed out.
Start where hair is at its worst. Hair is the driest, most damaged, and oldest (naturally) at the bottom. Starting at the top may lead to an oily scalp.
Continue application of the conditioner until about two-to-three inches away from the scalp.
Be sure to thoroughly rinse hair so as to unclog hair follicles and keep hair shiny.

, Pour the beer into a container and let it sit, or put it in a pot and boil it. Either method not only gets rid alcohol that can strip hair of its natural oils, but it also removes carbonation that, when combined with with water, can create a high mineral content environment - also known as ""hard water"" - that hinders the effects of shampoo.The type of beer you use is based on personal preference, so try experimenting with different brews to see which works best for your hair.
Try an organic beer to narrow down chemicals and other unknowns put into typical highly processed, commercial beers.Cut down on the beer smell by adding some apple cider vinegar, jojoba oil, some essential oils, or even a small amount of common conditioner., The beer has proteins and vitamins that help make hair healthy, and the malt and hops strengthen the cuticles, helping to repair hair damaged from blow-drying, coloring, and curling., Start from the bottom and work your way towards the scalp. Be sure to let the beer sit in the hair at least a couple of minutes., At this point, your hair is ready to be dried and styled, or you can condition further with a chamomile rinse.

, Other than the impact on hair, using chamomile tea has several additional benefits.Hair thinning and hair loss can be combated with chamomile tea.
Dandruff and itchy scalp may be helped because of the anti-irritant and anti-microbial abilities.
Chamomile has long been known as a calming agent. Not only will you get a fuller, healthier head of hair, but you'll also likely mellow some.
Eczema, a skin condition that causes very itchy skin, may be treated in some regard by chamomile.

, Wring out the extra water from your hair before applying the tea to allow the chamomile to better permeate the strands. Let the tea sit for a few minutes.


Applying the chamomile after the beer rinse will help disguise any remaining scent from the beer.
With repeated use, chamomile tea can lighten your hair, adding highlights or making blonde hair appear more vibrant.
Be patient. Seeing results when using chamomile tea may take a few weeks in order to really be effective., Dry and style your hair as usual.

This means using the same products 1-2 times a day for at least a month to let your skin get used to the regimen.Clean your face once or twice daily with a cleanser.
Exfoliate sparingly, sometimes only once a week.Finish with a moisturizer once in the morning and once in the evening.;
, With this skin type, you will need to focus on treating two skin types. You will need to moisturize the dry areas of your face and reduce excess oil on the oily areas of your face.Often, the oily area of your face will be your T-zone (your forehead, nose, above your mouth, and chin).

Be upfront about how much time you have for a daily styling routine.,
Show, don’t tell.,
Use stylist talk.,

Adjust your approach to get the cut you want.",How to Talk to Your Hair Stylist," Remember that the perfect windswept look of a celebrity likely took hours to style. So look for styles in magazines or online that you feel would complement your face shape and have a certain cut or color you like. Focus on images of the style that show the front, back, and sides so you can show your stylist the complete look.Be prepared for your stylist to suggest adjustments or alternatives to the looks you’ve chosen. A good stylist will look at the styles you’ve chosen and make sure they fit your face shape and your level of maintenance before they start cutting or coloring.;
, This will give you an opportunity to show your stylist what worked for you in the past, and what didn’t.Most stylists work best with a show, don’t tell approach. Bringing photos of your hair in the past will give your stylist visual representation of your past hair styles.

, One of the best ways to make sure your stylist is a good one? Google her name, read her bio on the salon’s website, check out her Instagram feed of previous clients (if available), and check to see if she has positive reviews online.If you have friends who have gone to certain stylist for years and give rave reviews, consider making an appointment with that stylist. One of the best ways to find a good stylist is through a referral from a friend.
When you make the appointment with the stylist, note if they have a very open schedule or if they are booked up weeks in advance. The fact that the stylist is busy shows she has a loyal client base that is happy with her work.

, Though it may be tempting to pile your unkempt hair in a bun and throw on some sweats, make the effort to dress in your personal, everyday style for the appointment. A good stylist will take into account your personal style and find a hairstyle that fits with your everyday look.You should also do your hair as you normally would, even if it’s full of split ends or looks a little rough. This will give the stylist a sense of how you usually wear your hair and how much maintenance you put into it on a daily basis.

, Maybe you tend to have busy mornings and only 5-10 minutes to do your hair before you head out the door. Or maybe you’re willing to commit to a 30 minute style routine, complete with blow drying and styling products. The best way to get the cut you want is to tell your stylist how much time you can set aside to do your hair every day.Your stylist can then look over the images you brought with you and determine which style will work with your desired look and your daily routine.
It’s also important to talk to your stylist about your work environment. Is it more formal or more laid back? You may end up going with a low maintenance look to match your easy going work environment.

, It can be difficult to explain a certain look and not resort to vague descriptors like “cool”, “effortless”, “rock n roll” and “edgy”. Rather than try to find the words, use the images you brought in to show the stylist. Note how a certain actress’s hair is cut, or point to a highlights you like on a certain model.Be specific when you talk to your stylist about length. Use your hands to mark the length on your hair you’re looking for. Avoid vague instructions like “I just want to cut the ends” or “A couple of inches off, please.” The more specific you are about the look you want, the more likely the stylist can achieve that look.
Notice if your stylist uses your hair to give you a rough idea of a certain look, such as bangs or a shorter cut. She should be willing to get right into touching your hair and helping you visualize your options.

, If you do want to use your words, use stylist terms so your stylist is clear about what you want. These include:Layering: Layers are different lengths of hair, geometrically cut into a shape to create movement and decrease volume. Layers should blend into themselves by laying on top of one another, with the shortest layer resting on top of all the other longer layers, creating a nice weight line. Layering is great if you’re looking for a simple style that moves well and isn’t too thick or heavy.
Using the razor tool: This is a tool used to remove weight from your hair, increase movement and volume, and add choppiness to a style. Razor cuts are great for thick or thin hair, but they not recommended for coarse or curly hair. If you want your hair to lay smooth or have less volume, a razor cut may not be for you.
Texturizing: This means adding different lengths to your cut to give it more volume or to make it lighter. There are many different texturizing tools and techniques available for stylists. As long as the stylist knows what she’s doing when she says she’s going to texturize your hair, it can make your great haircut look even better.
Disconnecting your hair: this is when two pieces of hair purposely do not blend together. This is often used in high fashion cuts. If you are looking to accentuate a certain part of your style, like a longer piece of hair on one side, your stylist may use disconnection.
An asymmetrical cut: This is when a cut, or part of the cut, is purposely left longer on one side. This is often done in bobs, bangs, and cropped styles, where one side might be tucked behind your ear or left long to give it an edgy look.
An inverted cut: This is when your hair is cut shorter in the back and kept longer in the front, also called an A-Line cut. If you want to go bold, you can do an inverted asymmetrical cut with disconnection and layers. But make sure your stylist explains to you exactly how that looks before you commit and that she can explain the look back to you. This will ensure you don’t end up with a lawnmower look, which is exactly as bad as it sounds.

, Ask her specific questions about what she plans to do with your length, what tools she might use (like a razor), and how your hair will look overall when she’s done. Make sure you are comfortable with the agreed style before she starts cutting. This is especially important if you’ve never been to this stylist before and are nervous about your cut., Hair styling is a craft like any other. It can be distracting for the stylist if she is trying to keep a conversation going with you while also trying to give you a great cut. It’s fine to make small talk and be friendly, but its important to also let your stylist relax and give into a groove.Avoid asking technical questions or micro managing your stylist. Once you confirmed the style with the stylist and she starts cutting, place your trust in her ability and try to relax.

, Rather than dive into the latest celebrity gossip in People Magazine, simply watch what your stylist is doing to your hair.


Speak up if you feel uneasy about a certain snip. A good hair stylist will respond positively to your participation in the cut, and try to adjust their approach if you express concern.
At the same time, its important to try to trust the judgement and artistry of your stylist. If your conversation with the stylist before the cut went well and you feel comfortable in her chair, you are likely in for a great cut.

, It’s easy to write off salon products your stylist recommends as a way to up-sell you at the end of your appointment. But using the right styling product can make a visible difference, especially if your new cut has layers.


Ask your stylist what products they would recommend to upkeep your new look and why. Then, go home and do some research online. You might find a better price on a product or you may discover the salon brand is worth the extra cash.Don’t be afraid to ask your stylist for styling tips as well. She should be able to suggest some tips and tricks to make your style easier to maintain and keep looking as good as it did in the salon. Ask about specific techniques, like blow drying or straightening. Or ask her what products and tools she might suggest for styling the cut for a night out.

, Let your new cut settle in for a few days and then give it a good look in the mirror. Maybe you’ve found the right cut for you, or maybe you can’t believe how bad it is. Pick up the phone and contact the salon. Explain your issues with the cut, and your disappointment in the stylist’s work. Try to be honest and upfront, without being rude. If the salon is professional, they will understand it’s not personal, it’s just hair, and they have an obligation to keep their clients happy.A good stylist will be willing to correct the haircut free of charge until you feel better about the cut. But if the cut is really awful, it may be better to cut your losses and let it grow out for a bit or pay for a better stylist to fix it., If you end up with a haircut you don’t love, learn from the experience. Maybe you will look for a different stylist who has better online reviews or who specializes in a certain style. Or maybe you might experiment with a very different look you’ve never tried before.Remember that at the end of the day, it’s just hair! It will grow out and create a blank slate for you to try again with a new stylist, and hopefully better results.

Dry your hair.",How to Wash Micro Braids,"


As micro braids are quite delicate, you will need to arrange them properly to prevent possible breakage or damage while washing. Before entering the shower or bath, braid your hair into 4 to 6 larger braids. Keep the braids relatively loose to allow the water, shampoo, and conditioner to permeate all strands of hair. Secure the end of each braid with a rubber band or other type of hair tie.;
,


Use warm water to completely soak your hair. Dampening hair that is formed into braids can take longer than dampening hair which is free flowing, as all sections of each strand may not be completely or quickly exposed to the water.

,


Liberally apply shampoo to your braids. Gently rub the shampoo into your braids, as well as into your scalp. Avoid rubbing the braids excessively, as this can cause them to become frizzy. Rinse the shampoo out of the braids using warm water. Continue rinsing until all shampoo residue has been removed.

,


Liquid conditioner more completely hydrates micro braids than cream conditioner does, as it has an easier time penetrating the braids. For best results, liquid conditioner should be kept on your hair for at least 15 minutes. Use warm water to remove the conditioner after the appropriate amount of time have passed.

,


Air drying is effective when it comes to removing moisture from micro braids. After the completion of your shower or bath, use a large, clean, dry towel to gently squeeze all of the excess moisture from your hair. Remove the rubber bands which held your larger braids in place, and allow your hair to flow free. Depending on the length of your hair, total drying time can take up to several hours to complete.

Some products such as Shea Moisture African Black Soap Deep Cleansing shampoo and Giovanni Tea Triple Treat shampoo are made specifically for dry scalps and thick hair., Gently massage every inch of the scalp, paying close attention to itchy areas.


If desired, use a basic (or fancy) spray bottle to dilute the shampoo and allow for easier application. In addition to water and shampoo, moisturizer can be added to the bottle if needed., Try not to rub the braids too much, as this can cause frizzing. Instead focus on massaging the scalp., Only this time, after massaging the scalp to rinse it, squeeze the braids to remove deeply-embedded dirt. Rinse once more, gently squeezing the braids to remove excess water., Use fingers to work conditioner into the braids before covering with a shower cap. Let conditioner sit for about 15 minutes before removing the shower cap and rinsing thoroughly., Make sure all of the braids are tucked in, and leave the towel on for ten minutes. After ten minutes, remove the towel and let your hair air dry before applying moisturizer.

Cut and style your weave.",How to Weave Hair," You should always prepare your hair for cornrows/weave prior to executing the style. Wash your hair as you normally do, and give it a good conditioning treatment as well. Make sure that your hair is totally dry before starting the cornrow process.;
, To create the base to sew your weave onto, you have to braid your head in a series of cornrows. To do this, you’ll need a wide tooth comb, a fine tooth comb, and a hair pick. You will also need 2-3 large hair clips to hold your hair away from your face, and a detangle spray of some sort (3 parts water mixed with 1 part oil in a spray bottle works well).

, When you add your weave, you’ll place it in layers around a part in your natural hair. Your part is the exposed area of the scalp, and is typically located down the center of your head or slightly off-center. Choose the location of the part, and separate out ½-inch sections of hair on either side of it. Pin the rest of your hair back using the clips.


Your part only needs to go about halfway back on your head.

, To show your part, you will braid two rows of hair on either side of the part, away from each other. Start with one of the ½ inch sections of hair, and separate a small piece about ¼ of an inch thick on one of the ends. Braid this in a french braid towards the ear on the same side of the part. Braid this strand about ⅔ of the way down, leaving the ends loose (they will be incorporated into a larger braid later on).








, Work down both sides of the part, braiding small french braids ¼-inch wide. Remember that the braids should always go towards the ear on the side of the part they are on; this will expose the straight part down the center. Because you won’t be able to french braid each strand all the way, the ends should stick out after you’ve braided all the hair near the scalp. Each of the strands that are sticking out will be the start of a row of braids going all the way around your head.








, The first braid you will complete is a small braid that wraps around the outer edge of your face, head, and to the nape of your neck. The perimeter braid will have two starts - on either side of the part - but you will combine the ends of the braids together at the nape of your neck. Take your hair out of the hair clips, and section off a strand of hair ¼-½ inch thick all the way around the outer edge of your head. Starting with the edge-braid from your part, braid as far as you can around the edge of your head. Then, do the same on the other side.









You might combine the perimeter braids off to the side rather than directly in the center on the nape of your neck, if your part is off-center.
Keep the braid as tight as you can, and as close to your scalp as you’re able.

, Each of the braids you began on either side of your part will continue on to form full braids that wrap around your head. This means that from a birds-eye-view of your completed head, there will be concentric circles formed around your part. Follow the pattern of the perimeter braid, by sectioning off thin pieces of hair around the outer edge and working in. Go to the next braid closest to your hairline, and braid on either side of your part towards the back of your head.


Continue spraying your hair with the oil/water mixture or your detangler spray to make braiding easier.
Your braids should be very tight and may hurt while braiding, but shouldn’t be painful when completed.
The braids will likely become quite thick about halfway through, because of all the hair you gather. Don’t be worried if because of this your braids are uneven.

, Work inwards on your braids, away from your part. Each of the small braids you started on either side of your part should serve as the start for each new braid. If you run out of part-braids though, you can create more near the part on the back of your head. Tie off all the ends and tuck them into/under the finished braids so as to hide the tails.

, For your weave, you’ll at need at least two packages of wefts of human hair in a color coordinating your natural hue. You’ll also need curved sewing needles, weave thread that matches the hair color, a wig cap, and a pick or fine tooth comb for separating sections of hair. When you finish weaving in a weft of hair, you’ll cut the excess with a pair of shears, so have those on hand as well.

, Get your special weave-thread out, and cut a piece that is 2–3 feet (0.6–0.9 m) long. Thread one end of the string through your needle, and pull it so that both ends are even. Then, wrap the ends of the thread around the tip of your finger, and tie them together in a knot. This will form a loop on which your needle is strung. Cut the excess thread off that is left over from tying your knot; try to cut it as close to the knot as you are able, so as to make it as discreet as possible when woven into your hair.









Don’t cut too much thread to start, as the longer your thread, the more tangles and knots that are likely to be formed.
You’ll probably run out of thread often, so you’ll have to repeat the aforementioned process each time that happens.

, Pull your wig cap out and stretch it out, sliding it over your head. Cover your entire hairline all the way around; the wig cap should go over your ears, forehead, and the nape of your neck as bit so as to make sure your braids are completely covered.








, Start at the beginning of your perimeter braid near the part, and pull the needle under the braid and through the other side, pulling the thread taut against the knot. Then, pull the end of the knot out just a bit and pull the two strings apart to expose the loop. Wrap the needle around one edge of the loop twice, and pull it through the center of the loop to create the base knot.








, Measure about 1-inch down the perimeter braid from the first knot you made, and repeat the process. Hook the needle under the braid, pull it through the other side, and tug to pull the loose thread tight. Before the thread between the two knots has been tightened all the way though, wrap the needle around it twice near where you inserted it, and pull tight. This will give you your second knot. Repeat this same process all the way around the perimeter braid.


Each knot should be about 1 inch (2.5 cm) apart from each other.
Make sure that your knots and thread are pulled tight, so that your cap is firmly attached to your braids.

, When you’ve sewn the wig cap around the perimeter braid, you’ll complete the ‘loop’ by sewing around the outside of your part. Starting from your last knot on the perimeter braid, skip up to the next row of braids on your head. Repeat the knot-tying process, and then go up to the next row. By the time you’ve sewn around the part, you should have a large ‘U’ shape of knots. Make sure that each knot is at least 1-inch away from the center part. Finish off by tying two knots at the base of your sewing, where you started on the perimeter braid.


The finishing knots should be the same as the other knots you’ve been sewing the whole time.
Cut the extra string off as close to the knot as you are able, without cutting the knot.

, Take your shears and cut up along your part to split the wig cap. You’ll be removing all the excess fabric around the edge of your sewing (the part that went over your forehead, ears, nape of your neck, and the covers your part). Once you’ve cut up your part, cut all the extra fabric off as close to the edge of your thread as possible, without getting close enough to cut the knots.









If you accidentally cut the thread or a knot, you’ll have to remove what work you’ve done and start over with a new wig cap.

, The first extension that you will measure and apply is the piece that goes around the perimeter. Take your extensions out of the package, and open one weft so that all the hair is exposed. Starting at the beginning of your perimeter braid, hold the extension in place, and wrap it around your head. Hold it to the perimeter braid the entire time to make sure it is the right length. When you get to the end of the perimeter braid on the other side, measure a little extra hair, and then trim it to fit.


Place this piece of perimeter-extension off to the side, so that you don’t misplace it or confuse it for another section of hair.

, The second major section of hair you need to measure is the piece that will go around the ‘U’ shape of your part. Hold the end of the extension over the beginning of the ‘U’ shaped part near your forehead, and wrap it around where you have already knotted. When you get to the end on the other side (back to your forehead), add a little extra length to your measurement, and then cut the piece of extension.









Keep track of this extension, and make sure you don’t confuse it with the perimeter extension.

, You’re going to be working with a long strip of extension, but you won’t be able to use all the necessary thread in a single shot. Cut a piece of your weave thread that is 5–6 feet (1.5–1.8 m) long, and use the same process as you did for your wig cap by threading it through the needle, matching the ends, and tying them together in a knot. Cut off any excess string.

, Every time you section out a new piece of extension to sew on, you’ll have to create a knot to secure it. The extension is made up of two primary parts: the strands of hair, and the weft which holds them together. Stick your needle through the weft at the very beginning of the extension to secure it. To tie your first knot, you’ll wrap the needle around, pull it through the weft a second time, wrap the loop that is formed around the needle twice, and pull the needle through.









The knotting process involved is the same as you used to sew your wig cap to your cornrows.
You should have plenty of excess thread when you’re finished tying your not; don’t cut this, as you will be using it to weave your extension to your head.

, Start at the very beginning of your perimeter braid near your part, and insert the needle through the wig cap, under the perimeter braid, and up through the other side. Pull it tight to bring your extension piece close to your head. Then, make your first knot by wrapping the needle/thread around the weft (not through it) and repeating the same knotting process as you used for sewing your cap. Repeat your knot twice to secure the extension.









You’ll only double-knot the extension at the very beginning.

, Using the exact same process as you did to sew on the wig cap, work around your head sewing on the extensions that attach to the perimeter braid. Make each knot about 1-inch apart, and hold the extensions taut so that they are securely attached to your head. Do this all the way around your perimeter braid until you’ve made it to the very end, on the opposite side of your part.









Be careful not to tie strands of hair into the knot.
Trim off any excess that you might have once you have completed sewing on the perimeter extension.

, To finish off the ‘border’ of your hair, you’ll have to sew your extension piece around the edge of the ‘U’ shape that your wig cap forms around your part. Start by preparing a new piece of thread and attaching it to the end of the weft. Then use the exact same process as explained above to sew the extension to the braids/wig cap around your part.









Trim off any extra that you might have at the end.

, Starting at the second row of braids (the second to the perimeter braids) you should begin filling in the space on your head with the rest of your extensions. Continue the same process as above, except that when you get to the end of your row (on the opposite side of the perimeter braid), you should use the ‘fold over’ method to begin an additional row. This means that instead of cutting off the excess extension when you reach the end of a row, you fold it back on itself and begin sewing the new row directly above it.









Always sew a knot directly over a fold when you fold over a section, in order to make it lay flat. It is helpful to do this twice, to make sure it is 100% secure.
Don’t measure and cut your pieces prior to sewing additional rows, because the fold-over method will make it easier to continue working with the same weft for a large portion of your head.

, Work around your head, using the exact same process of sewing your weave to your cap/braids as you have been. Remember to always double knot over a fold or the beginning of a weft, to properly secure it. When you have finished filling in your head, trim off any excess that might hang over the front., If you’ve done all of your sewing correctly so far, you should be left with about 1-inch of exposed braids all the way around your part. Sewing your weave onto this section is similar to when you originally braided it, as you will be working with small sections away from the part. Measure the exposed braid, and cut off the same amount of your weave. Sew each small section (about 1-inch wide) onto the exposed braid. This means that you will have many small pieces to sew, and each should run somewhat parallel to your forehead. Use the exact same process, making sure to double-knot both the beginning and end of each thread.









It might be helpful to have several needles with thread prepared before starting this, because you’ll be working with so many small pieces of weave which may be difficult to do with a single long piece of thread.
As the layers build, your part should look more and more natural, and the weft of each piece of extension should begin to be covered up.

, When you’ve sewn on extensions to all the small braids along your part, you should be left with a space in the back that is still open. To fill this in, you’ll have to prepare a special piece of your weave. Measure the space that you have to fill, and cut a piece of your weave that is twice that length. Start with your regular double knot at the end, and then roll the weave in to create a small circle. Create an additional knot by looping around the two layered sections of weft, and pulling it tight. Continue rolling and knotting the extension until you have finished the whole piece.


When you tie the last knot, pull the needle through all of the layered wefts to secure them together.
Cut the excess string off when you’re finished tying it.

, Turn your closure piece upside down so that the weft is facing the ground, and the hair is upwards. Begin flattening the hair so that it falls down over the top of the rolled up weft. Because of the roll that you created, the hair should fall evenly around it, hiding the weft and your sewing. It may be helpful to use a flat iron on the hair to get it to cooperate with what you’re trying to get it to do.


Secure the ends of the hair with a small elastic to making sewing it to your scalp much easier.

, Turn your closure piece back over so that the weft is exposed, and insert your needle and thread through it to tie your regular double knot. Bring your closure to your scalp, and place it where you want it to go. Insert your needle through a braid or a piece of weft from another extension nearby on your scalp, and pull it tight to create your regular knot. Continue doing this in a circular movement around your closure piece, until you’ve gotten back to the beginning.


Cut off the excess string, remove the elastic from your hair, and you’re done!
Adjust the strands of your closure piece to cover up any weft that may be visible.

, Attaching your weave to your head is now completed, so you have the option of cutting and styling it to your personal preference. Keep in mind that your cut is permanent since your hair isn’t going to grow in, so be very careful about cutting your hair. Maintain your weave regularly, but avoid washing it too often as this may loosen up the ties and your wig cap.

Tie both ponytails together.",How to Samurai Braid," Your hair needs to be long enough to braid. If you can pull the hair at your crown into a short, stubby ponytail, it is long enough.

If you already have a fade or undercut, you can skip this section; click here to continue.
Set yourself up in front of a 3-way mirror. This will allow you to see everything that you are doing.;
, Use the handle of a rat-tail comb to create two deep side parts just above your eyebrows. They should be aligned with your temples. Connect the parts at the back-crown of your head. Gather your hair into a bun and secure it with a clip of hair tie.

Do not include the first ¼ to ½ inch (0.64 to 1.27 centimeters) of hair at your front hair line; leave it out of the bun.
Make the parts as neat as possible.

, If your hair is the same length all over, you will need to trim down anything not gathered into the bun. Don't worry about making it perfect; you will be fading it in a moment. Plan on getting the rest of your hair down to ½ to 1 inch (1.27 to 2.54 centimeters) long., Start the guideline at eyebrow level on one side of your head, and continue it along the side of your head and towards the back. Stop when you are about 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) above your nape. Repeat this step for the other side; make the guidelines as even as possible.Hold the clippers horizontally against your head so that you get a neat, thin line.
Tap the clippers lightly. If you tap them too hard, you'll have a harder time evening out the fade.

, Open the clippers and switch to a #1½ guard. Shave upwards from your guideline, towards the deep side parts you made earlier. Next, remove the guard (but keep the clippers open), and shave up from the guideline by about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters). Close the clippers partway, then finish cleaning things up.Keep the blade flat against your head, then lift it away.

, Close the clippers the rest of the way. Shave upwards along the guideline using short to erase it. Open the clippers partway and switch to a #1/16 guard. Continue to work your way up. Keep the clippers flat as you work on taking out the guideline., Switch to a #1 guard and keep the clippers open part-way. Go over your fade using short, upward strokes. Take your time and check in the mirror often. Make sure that the sides and back match up., By now, you should have everything faded, except for your hair in the bun and the ¼ to ½ -inch (0.64 to 1.27 centimeters) at your hairline. Close your clippers and switch to a #1½ guard. Clean up the hair at your front hairline until it matches the top part of the fade., All that shaving and buzzing will have lefts lots of tiny, itchy hairs along your neck and shoulders. Take a quick shower to rinse all of that off. You can leave your hair damp, or you can dry it.

Some people find it easier to braid damp hair than dry hair.

, Use a hair pick or a wide-toothed comb to do this. Start from the ends of your hair first, and work your way to the top., You can do this with a misting bottle filled with water. You can also use a moisturizing spray meant for cornrowing hair., Choose something intended for braiding cornrows, or something that contains the following ingredients: flax seed, shea butter, coconut oil. This will help prevent your hair from drying out while it is in the Samurai style., Slide the handle of a rat-tail comb through your hair, from your hairline to the back. Brush the left side to the left, and the right side to the right. Clip the right side out of the way., Go to the hair on the left side of the part. Grab the long hair from the hairline and split it into three smaller sections., Cross the left strand under the middle one, then cross the right strand under the middle one. It is very important that you cross the left and right strands under the middle one and not over, otherwise your braid won't turn out right., Use your thumb to scoop some hair from your hairline. Add it to the left strand, then cross the now-thicker left strand under the middle one., This time, take the hair from the part. Add it to the right strand to make it thicker, then cross the right strand under the middle one., Keep adding hair to the left and right strands before crossing them under the middle one. Keep the braid centered between the two parts (side and center) and the stitches tight. When you reach the middle, begin to angle it towards the center-back of your crown., When you reach the crown of your head and you have no more hair left to gather, stop. Tie the braid off into a ponytail with a clear hair elastic.

If you have ethnic/textured hair, finish off with a regular braid. This will keep you hair from poofing out., Again, keep the stitches neat and tight, and the braid centered. When you reach the middle of your head, angle the braid towards the back so that it touches the other braid.

If you have ethnic hair, finish this off with a braid as well. You are done at this point., Instead of tying the second braid off into another ponytail, add it to the first one. Gather all your hair together, then tie it off into a single ponytail. Use a clear hair elastic or a small hair tie that matches your hair color.

You can remove the hair tie from the first ponytail for this, or you can leave it on.
If you want a bun instead, pull the ponytail half-way through the hair elastic. This is ideal for those with longer hair.

Finish at the front of the head.,
Dry the dreads of product, if necessary.",How to Retwist Dreads1," If you have to retwist an entire head's worth of dreads, you should start at the nape of the neck. Pin away the upper dreads with clips to leave an inch (2.54 cm) thick row of dreads across the base of the neck.If you are only retwisting to firm up the locks of a certain section of hair, you may not need to pin hair out of the way.;
, Apply a little dread wax or gel to your fingers, then take a single dreadlock, and gather any loose hair at its base between your forefinger and thumb. Twist this hair between your fingers so that it entangles with the main lock of already twisted hair.


While twisting, you should pull the hair away from the scalp toward the already twisted/formed end of the lock. Use firm, steady pressure. This may cause some discomfort.
If you feel hair snap while twisting, this is a completely natural part of the retwisting process. By matting, breaking, and entangling the hair together, you'll reform the dread.
Dreads that have come out of their ropes/locks and are mostly untwisted might require you to re-dread your hair from scratch., After the lock has been finger rolled, it's ready to be palm rolled. Apply a little dreadlock wax or gel to your palms, then gather the finger twisted hair between your palms. Firmly roll the hair between your palms, sliding down the lock as you do.









For the firmest, tightest retwisted dreads, you may need to palm roll each lock several times.
Loose hair in locks can be stubborn. In some cases, you may need to roll with extra firm pressure, but be careful not to hurt the person whose hair you're retwisting.
Dreadlocks that have been palm rolled can be pinned out of the way to keep finished locks from mixing in with those that are unfinished., Now that the base layer of dreads at the nape of the neck have been retwisted, you can remove your pins to release the next layer of hair you'll be retwisting. The hair above this layer that's hanging in the way can be pinned off to the side.


Retwist the dreads one at a time with your fingers and palms until all dreads have been retwisted.
You should work methodically, at about an inch (2.54 cm) of scalp per row/layer to ensure no locks are missed., Continue to retwist your dreads in this fashion in inch (2.54 cm) thick rows until you reach the front of the scalp. When you reach the front of the head, you won't need to pin any hair out of the way, and can simply retwist the final dreads.







, Some waxes or dreadlock gels become set in place with the application of light to moderate heat after retwisting. In most cases, the dreads will be dry in 20 to 30 minutes or less. If a hair dryer is inaccessible, you can also allow your hair to air dry after it is retwisted.If any of the products you used on your dreadlocks are heat activated, you should consider using a gentle heat to help activate this feature."
"
Identify dreads in need of retwisting.,
Collect your supplies.,
Position the locks for comfort while working.",How to Retwist Dreads2," As time passes, your hair will grow at the base of your scalp, creating loose hair at the base of your dreads. In other cases, your locks may have become loose or messy. If your dreads have any of these features, it's likely time to get a retwist.You may need to retwist the base of all the dreadlocks you are working on, or you may only need to work on one side or section.
When working on only a specific section of dreads, pin hair that is finished or doesn't need retwisting out of your way to prevent unintentional retwisting.

, To retwist your dreads most effectively, you should use products while working the hair to freshen and strengthen it. At minimum, you'll want some dreadlock friendly gel or wax while retwisting.


Some dreadlock gel is specially formulated to help lock the hair of your dreads into ropes of hair. You might want to consider using this kind of product to help maintain your dreads.
Some dreadlock wearers suffer from a dry scalp. If this is your situation, you may want to use a scalp cleansing serum before retwisting., If you're retwisting an entire head of dreadlocks, it can take quite some time before you complete your job. To ensure the best retwisting, choose a work environment that positions the dreadlocks at a level that is easy for you to work at.Depending on your height and body type, the ideal work height can vary. Generally, you'll want the head you are working on to be at roughly chest level."
"
Wash your hair.,
Rinse out shampoo and add conditioner, if desired.,
Prevent grease drips with a towel.,
Dry the dreadlocks completely.",How to Retwist Dreads3," You may want to use a shampoo specially formulated for dreadlocks, but a regular shampoo will also work. Use your fingers to massage the shampoo into the scalp with water. After the dreads have been thoroughly soaped, you're ready to rinse.


You should avoid shampooing your dreads for a minimum of two weeks after having them done to keep the locks firm and secure.
The shampoo you choose should be low lather and should suit the needs of your scalp. Many people with dreads suffer from dry scalps. If you do too, you should use a shampoo formulated for dry scalps.
You may want to use a clean nylon to contain your dreads when washing. This can help keep your locks from coming apart while being washed., You don't have to use conditioner on your hair, but doing so can improve your hair's strength, softness, and luster. Take your hair conditioner in your hands and massage it into the scalp and dreadlocks until all locks are moisturized and loose.Follow the label recommendations of your conditioner for best results. Generally, you should let the conditioner set in the locks for a few minutes.
After you have finished conditioning, you should rinse the conditioner from your hair, turning off the shower and wringing out excess moisture from the locks as you do.
Some dreadlock wearers choose to skip conditioning, as it can loosen the tightness of your locks., Your dreadlocks can pick up a lot of buildup throughout daily life, and this can drip unpleasantly down the neck if you're not careful. After rinsing out the conditioner, keep the washed head bent so drips fall onto the shower floor and not down the body. Then:


Gather a towel around the base of the neck. Blot the dreads there to absorb moisture, then hold the towel firmly in place with your hands.
Straighten the head. Excess moisture will trickle down the head and get caught in the towel you are holding at the base of the neck.
After the hair has mostly stopped dripping, use dry portions of the towel to blot/wring excess moisture from the dreads., Failing to dry your dreads completely can leave your cool hairdo smelling like a wet dog. For this reason, you may want to use a hair dryer to make certain your dreads are dry. However, you can also allow your hair to air dry before retwisting, though this might take some time to fully dry.


Hair that is wet stretches more than hair that is dry. Due to this, you may have the best and most consistent results if you wait until the dreadlocks are completely dry before retwisting.
Due to the thickness of most dreads, moisture deep inside a lock can sometimes be missed while drying. For this reason, you may want to dry for 10 minutes more than you think necessary."

, Deep conditioning your braids the day before you remove them will moisturize, soften, and strengthen your natural hair. Squeeze a generous amount of product into your hands and run the deep conditioner down the length of your braids.


As you apply a generous amount of deep conditioner to your braids, don’t forget to coat the edges of your hair., The deep conditioner needs to penetrate through the braid to reach your natural hair. Place the coated braids between the palms of your hands. Quickly twist or roll the braids between your palms to spread the product throughout the braid.


This twisting or rolling motion will ensure that the deep conditioner reaches your natural hair.

, Gather your braids into a twist atop your head and place a shower cap over your head. Allow the product to sit for ten to twenty minutes. Step into a shower or place your head under a faucet and rinse your hair thoroughly.

Repeat the process until all of the braids are removed.",How to Remove Braids from Hair2," Treating your braid with the detangling product of your choice will help to separate, or loosen, the braid from your natural hair. Coat each braid from the root to the tip of your natural hair with a generous amount of detangler.This product will also make it easier to detangle your hair once the braid is removed.
Search for a product that contains marshmallow root. In addition to providing slip, marshmallow root also moisturizes hair., Use a sharp pair of scissors to cut the braid below the ends of your natural hair. Cutting out the extension will save you time—there will be much less hair for you to unbraid.


This step is optional.

, Insert the tail of a comb into the braid approximately ¼ from the tip. Slowly pull the tail down through the braid to separate the ends. Continue this process up the length of the braid until you reach the roots. Apply additional detangler as needed.


Once you have separated the ends, you may use your hands to unravel the braid.

, Once the braid is removed, coat the ends of your locks with detangler. Gently comb through the ends with a wide toothed comb, pick, or your fingers. Gradually work your way up the length of your hair to the roots.

Distribute your hair over the bun maker to hide the spongy material
Pull a hair tie over the bun, cinching the hair underneath it.
Wrap and the loose hairs around and under the base of the bun.
Secure everything with bobby pins.

, This is especially important if you did a bun. Remember to mist the upside down braid as well."

Gather the hair from the outside (thinner area) of the part, and clip it out of the way. Repeat this step for the right side., Gather the hair from your hairline (between the two side parts) and split it into three sections. Cross the left section over the middle one, then cross the right section over the middle one., Gather some hair from the part, and add it to the left section.

Synthetic hair is also great for dreadlocks because it tangles easily, creating dreadlocks more quickly. However, you can’t use heat products on synthetic extensions or they will melt.Additionally, you can’t dye or perm synthetic hair extensions.


Purchase pre-dreaded single-ended extensions online or buy synthetic clip-in extensions to dread yourself.
Synthetic dreadlocks and extensions can be bought online or at specialty beauty supply stores.;
, If you like using heat products or dyeing your hair, purchase natural extensions. These extensions can be treated like your natural hair.However, keep in mind that these extensions will be much more expensive than synthetic extensions.


Natural dreadlocks and extensions can be found online and at many beauty supply stores.

, These extensions look like long dreadlocks with an un-dreaded section in the middle. Double-ended dreadlock extensions are an excellent choice for people who want more volume in their dreadlocks. However, if they’re installed too tightly, the weight of the extensions will pull on your scalp and lead to hair loss.If you want these extensions, have them installed professionally.
Instead of choosing double-ended extensions, purchase single-ended extensions or regular extensions that you can dread yourself.

, Do the needle test by pushing a needle through a thick section of a dreadlock. If the needle slides though, you can install your own extensions. If it doesn’t, you need to have your extensions professionally installed using dreadlock adhesives.Do an online search to find salons that service dreadlocks in your area.

, If you purchased regular clip-in extensions, you will need to dread them yourself. First, ask a friend to hold the clip end of the extension. Hold the tail end of the extension tightly in one hand. Next, use a fine-toothed comb to brush the hair against the grain, starting at the clip and working in small sections. This will create small knots in the hair, dreading it.


After you’ve combed the entire extension, pull it down with your hand to smooth it out and repeat the process.
Continue combing and smoothing the extension until it’s tightly dreaded., Your hair should already be dreaded before you put in any extensions. If you have blunted ends on your dreadlocks, cut off the tips and brush them out. You should have one to two inches (2.5-5 centimeters) of loose hair at the ends of your dreadlocks.Use a fine-toothed comb or small brush to loosen the ends of your dreadlocks.
You can loosen all of the ends at once or do it as you apply the extensions.

, If your extension came with a clip on the end, cut this section off. Next, brush out the end so that there are two to three inches (5-7.5 centimeters) of loose hair at the top.


Cut and loosen each extension as you need it. Otherwise, you may unravel unused extensions.

, Thread a sewing needle with about 12-14 inches (30-35 centimeters) of thread. Next, sew a few small stitches into the base of the loose section of the dreadlock, close to the dreaded section. Make sure these stitches are as tight as you can make them.


Leave two to three inches (5-7.5 centimeters) of loose thread at the beginning of the stitches so that you can tie them off later.
Purchase sturdy thread that closely matches your hair color.

, Place the loose, stitched part of your extension against the loose end of your natural dreadlock. Center the extension so that an inch of your loose hair is against the tightly dreaded section of the extension. Sew the center of the extension against the center of your dreadlock using small, tight stitches., Press the extension into your dreadlock, wrapping the sides around the extension like a tube. Add a few tight stitches to secure these hairs into place. Keep adjusting the dreadlock until the top of the extension is completely covered by your natural hair.


Wrapping will help blend the extension into your hair. The better the top of the extension is covered, the better it will blend.

, Find the loose end of the thread inside the extension. Tie both ends of the thread tightly together, knotting it several times. Use sharp sewing scissors to cut off the tails of the knot, leaving about an inch (2.5 centimeters).


Tuck the ends of the thread into the center of your dreadlock to hide them.

, Insert a .5 mm crochet hook through the center of your dreadlock. Gather some loose hair into the hook and gently pull it back through the extension. Repeat this process until all of the loose hair has been incorporated into the dreadlock, including the loose hair of the extension.


Once the loose hair is incorporated, rub the dreadlock between your palms to rough up the extension connection.
Avoid using larger crochet hooks as they can damage your hair.A small .5 mm crochet hook can be found online or at sewing supply stores.

, If you wash your hair too often, your dreadlocks will become loose and frizzy. However, if you don’t wash them enough, they’ll start to smell bad. While washing, focus on massaging your scalp and gently massaging the base of your dreadlocks. Avoid using conditioner or any detanglers.To avoid shampoo buildup in your dreadlocks, use a residue-free shampoo. If you dye your hair or you’re using color-treated extensions, use a color safe, residue-free shampoo., If your dreadlocks stay wet for too long, mildew will grow on the inside. After showering, squeeze as much water as you can out of your dreadlocks and into the shower. Next, wrap your hair in a fluffy towel for 10-20 minutes. Last, allow your hair to air dry before putting it up or wearing a hat. If your dreadlocks still haven’t air-dried within an hour, use a hair dryer to speed up the process.
Be careful not to melt any synthetic extensions with the hairdryer.

, When you sleep with dreadlocks, the friction of your head against the pillow can loosen or tangle your extensions. Avoid this problem by wearing a silk hair covering while you sleep. Alternatively, you can use a silk pillow or braid your hair to keep it all in one place.Never sleep with wet dreadlocks as they won’t dry properly.

Pick a dreadlock.,
Push the end into the center of the shell.,
Wrap the dread around once more.,
Weave the dreadlock through the center again.,
Repeat as desired.",How to Put Cowrie Shells on Dreads1," The width of the dreadlock needs to be small enough to fit into the front opening of the cowrie shell. Do not choose a dreadlock that is significantly smaller than the cowrie shell, though, since the shell could end up weighing down the hair and weakening the dread.


It will also be much easier to use a dreadlock with a tight end rather than one with a loose, fraying end.;
, Place the end of the dread over the front opening of the cowrie. Apply pressure to the front of the dread, forcing it into the opening and out through the back of the shell.


You can use your fingernail to apply pressure, but if this proves too difficult, use a long toothpick or pen to shove the entire tip of the dread through the hole in the shell.
Continue pushing the dreadlock through the hole in the shell until roughly 2 inches (5 cm) stick out through the back.

, Use your fingers to drape the dreadlock over the top of the shell and back down over the front of the shell.


The tip of the dreadlock should once more be positioned over the front opening of the shell in the same manner and placement as before. Essentially, the tip of the dread will form a full circle around the top of the cowrie.

, As before, push the hair into the opening of the shell and out through the shell's back.


Since you'll also need to maneuver the hair over the previous layer you already inserted, the use of a long toothpick or pen will probably be needed.
Make sure that the wrapped portion of dreadlock is wound tightly around the cowrie shell so that it stays secure.

, One cowrie shell is successfully attached to one dread. You can repeat this same process to put on as many cowrie shells as desired.


Since the cowrie shells are attached to the bottom of the dread, you will only be able to attach one shell to each dread.
This method is probably the simplest to perform, but it is also the most temporary.

"
"
Look for a solid bud.,
Wedge the dread into a bobby pin.,
Twist the pin.,
Insert the pin into the shell.,
Secure the hair with a small rubber band.,
Repeat as desired.",How to Put Cowrie Shells on Dreads2," Use a dreadlock that has a solid bud at the end of it. In simpler terms, the dread should have a tight, secure end. Do not use a dread that is fraying at its end.


Match the thickness of the dread to the size of the cowrie shell, too. The dreadlock should be thin enough to fit into the opening of the shell, but if the dread is too thin, it may not be able to adequately support the weight of the shell. This method works best when used with fairly thin dreadlocks, though.

, Slip the bobby pin over the dreadlock, sliding it along until the dread hits the bend of the pin.


Roughly 1 inch (2.5 cm) of the dreadlock end should stick out from one side of the bobby pin.

, Twist the bobby pin in between your thumb and index fingers three or four times. The hair should wrap around the pin during this process.


The dreadlock should twist into itself, and these twists should actually begin to “climb” or extend onto the pin.

, Stick the pin into the front opening of the cowrie shell. Continue pushing it through until the entire pin pops out through the back side.


Make sure that you pull enough hair—1 to 1.5 inches (2.5 to 3.75 cm)—through to the back of the shell.

, Fold the tip of the dreadlock over the top of the shell, lining it up with the primary body of the dread. Twist a small hair rubber band over the end and this adjacent portion of dread, wrapping it around tightly enough to hold the two sections in place.


A small rubber band will be easier to work with since it will require less twisting, but it also needs to be large enough to fit over the cowrie shell at the end of the lock.

, You have successfully put one cowrie shell on one dread. Repeat this same process to attach cowrie shells to more dreads until you are satisfied with the end result.


Note that you can only attach one cowrie shell to one dreadlock.
This is another simple method. Depending on how tightly you wound the hair ties, it can either be more or less permanent than the method relying on tension.

"
"
Thread a sewing needle.,
Select a dreadlock.,
Push the dread through the shell.,
Tie a knot.,
Insert the threaded needle into the hair.,
Knot the thread.,
Repeat as desired.",How to Put Cowrie Shells on Dreads3," Thread a standard sewing needle with thread that roughly matches the color of your hair.


You should only need a tail of thread approximately 6 inches (15 cm) long.
Tie a fairly large knot at the end of the tail. This knot will need to prevent the thread from slipping through the dreadlock later on.

, You should choose a dreadlock based on the quality of the lock, the thickness of the lock in comparison to the size of the shell, and the placement of the dread.


Choose a dreadlock that is visible from the front. The exact location will be a matter of personal preference.
The lock should be thick enough to support the weight of the shell but thin enough to fit through the shell's opening.
For best results, use a dreadlock with a tight end and stay away from locks with loose, partially unraveled ends.

, Place the end of the dread on top of the front opening of the cowrie shell, then push it through that opening using your fingernail. Grab onto the dread from the back of the shell and pull it through until at least 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) sticks out from the back.


You might be able to do this using only your fingernail, but if you find it difficult, you can press the dread into the hole of the shell using a long toothpick, pen, bobby pin, or bent paperclip.

, Tie the end of the dread into a loose, simple knot over the portion of dreadlock sticking out just above the top of the cowrie.


The knot doesn't need to be anything fancy. Just tie a simple overhand knot over the main body of the lock, directly above the top of the shell.

, Weave the thread into both portions of dreadlock (the tip and the main body), looping it around several times to stitch the hair securely in place.


Insert the needle into the front of the double layer dread and out through the back.
Wrap the needle and thread around one side of the dread before inserting it back into the dread at the same point as before. This completes a full stitch.
Repeat this action several times until the stitching feels secure.

, Once the cowrie shell and dreadlock end are secured, knot the thread. Cut the thread tail just above this knot to separate the thread in your hair from the sewing needle.


As before, a simple overhand knot should suffice.
Trim the thread tail as close to the knot as possible to prevent any excess from showing.

, One cowrie shell has successfully been placed on one dread. You can use this same process to place shells on other dreadlocks, too.


You can only put one cowrie shell on each dreadlock.
This method is the most involved, but the results tend to last longer than those produced from simpler methods.

Measure out the length of thread.,
Select and separate the section of hair you want to wrap.,
Secure the selected hair.,
Gather the colorful threads and fold them in half.,
Choose your starting thread color.,
Have fun creating your hair wrap - be patient and be creative!",How to Make Hair Wraps1," Cut the thread or embroidery floss to your desired length. A good rule to follow is measuring the thread against the chosen strand of hair and make the thread 2-3 times longer than your hair or the extension you are wrapping. Measure out as many colors as you want to add to the first wrap and lay them out together.






;
, Choose a section of hair that is no thicker than a pencil. Most who wrap their hair go for a subtle location at the base of their hairline (by their neck) to create a for a pop of color. If you want to go all out, pick a section at the crown (top) of your head. Separate the chosen hair section and wrap a ponytail holder around your remaining hair.








, Braid the section chosen as tight and clean as possible, with minimal fly aways and unwanted bumps. Separate the small section of hair into three pieces. Braid the hair down as far down to the end as possible. Secure with a small elastic.

You can chose to straighten the strand of hair but your don't have too.













To smooth out the little frizzy pieces of hair that might be sticking out, lightly wet your fingers and slick down the entire braided strand.
It is also helpful to secure a tissue with bobbie pins at the root of the braid to help prevent hair from getting into the wrap when you start., From the center point, tie the floss onto the base of the braid as close to the scalp as you can with a basic double knot (making a number 4 and sliding the end of the thread through the 4).Make sure the knot is tight and secure. Secure the thread again (or thread bundle of several colors) with another double knot. Cut off the excess thread at the top of the knot, leaving only a small knot and your colorful embroidery thread below.








, Choose one string color to wrap around the braid for the several colors you have in the bundle. This means separating one color strand of thread and holding the rest of the colored strands smooth with the braid.








, Once you try these basic designs, you can try new ways to create different unique patterns on your own braids. Most commonly, people choose to wrap just one braid but don't be afraid to wrap several braid strands or even do your whole head! You can keep your hair wrap in for a couple days or an entire month.









Most people decide it is time to remove the wrap when it starts to smell or feel funny.
To remove the hair wrap, carefully snip the knot off. Be careful to avoid cutting your own hair.

Start wrapping the braid with a simple wrap.,
Change thread colors.,
Next repeat the switch.,
Alternate and knot each color.,
Remove hair elastic and tie the wrap at the end.",How to Make Hair Wraps2," Pull the first piece of colored thread clockwise tightly around the braid until you are ready to switch colors., Wrap with the first color thread until you have gone about an inch or so down the braid. To switch to a new thread color, tie a knot around the wrap with the first color, then lay it down with the other strands and pull out another color. This will secure the wrap at the color change.

The tightness of the first color will hold down the next color so you don't have to worry about it becoming loose. You can wrap down about an inch again or vary the length to create a alternating design pattern of colors.

, Keep wrapping until you use up all the colors in your original bundle. You can get more creative by using two colors of thread and wrapping them at the same time to get alternating colors.

To get even more creative, you can use three colors of thread wrapping them in together (which creates a alternating color scheme).

, Wrap one color using your knot choice down approximately one inch but instead of tying it off with a final knot you will loop the thread through itself and secure. Then take the additional two strings from the top of that one inch section, and make criss-crosses over the top of the one inch section you just created with the first color of the three. Secure all three strings at the bottom with a double knot.









HINT: This is often a great place to add a decorative charm or bead. Use clear fishing line to tie the charm or bead into the thread bundle.

, To finish the wrap, pull the current thread through the loop of the final wrap to make a knot. Double it with the other threads to make the knot extra secure. Trim any excess thread from the bottom.

Tie each wrap with a forward knot.,
Start to alternate colors.,
Remove hair elastic and tie the wrap at the end.",How to Make Hair Wraps3," Do this by wrapping the thread around the hair, then taking the string on the left and crossing it over the string on the right and make a 4. Then tuck the end under and through 4 - pulling the end through the loop created (example at right). Pull the knot tight. This creates a half forward knot. Repeat to create a full forward knot. Continue repeating to create a series of knots that will work all the way down the hair wrap. This method will make a very secure wrap.








, To switch the thread color, lay it flat with the braid and pick a new color. Begin tying more forward knots with one color until you are about a inch down and then switch to another color. Repeat this all the way down the braid until you have used up all the colors and reached the end of the braid.









If you run out of string, just tie another piece onto the end of the last string / thread with a secure knot. Clip off excess thread.

If your hair is frizzy, you may also want to apply an anti-frizz cream or serum before your start styling.Make sure your styling product is evenly distributed throughout your hair before you move on to the next step.;
, This hairstyle looks best with a perfectly straight center part all the way from your forehead to the nape of your neck. Use the pointy end of a rat-tail comb to trace your part and separate the strands.If you don't have a rat-tail comb, you can also use a pencil or a pair of blunt scissors to separate your part.
Double check that you have the same amount of hair on both sides.

, This hairstyle can be done in two different ways: you can braid all of your hair or you can leave a small amount of hair outside of the braids in the front to frame your face. The choice is entirely up to you.Braiding all of your hair will result is a sleeker, more polished look, while leaving some strands out will result in a looser, flowier look.
If you have short bangs, you will probably need to leave them outside of your braids.

, Once your hair is parted, you will have to decide if you want to use elastic ties at the base of your braids. If you do use them, they will be visible in the finished hairstyle, so use small ties that are either clear or the same color as your hair.Using elastic ties will make it easier to braid your hair, so you may want to try it if you're new to braiding.
If you don't want to use elastic ties at the base of your braids, you may still wish to secure one side of your hair with a tie while you work on braiding the other side. This will keep it out of the way so you don't accidentally mess up your perfect center part.

, No matter which type of braid you decide to use for this hairstyle, you can choose to make your braid either very tight or a little looser. If you want your finished hairstyle to look very polished, try to make your braids tight, but if you want it to be a little messier and more casual, make them looser.You can always loosen you braids up a little later on, but you can't make them tighter without redoing them.

, You can use any kind of braid you want with this hairstyle, but a classic three-strand braid is the most popular. This is also one of the easiest braids to create.


Start your classic braid by dividing the piece of hair that you want to braid into three equal sections. Use your fingers to keep these sections separated as you work.Cross the left-most section of hair over the center section so that it is now between the two other sections. Then cross the right-most section over the center section. Each time you cross a section over, it will become the center section.
Continue following this pattern until you reach the bottom of the braid. Then use an elastic hair tie to secure the braid in place and move on to your next braid.

, For an interesting twist to this look, you can braid each section of your hair into fishtail braids instead of classic three-strand braids. These braids may look complicated, but they're really quite easy.To start your fishtail braid, divide the portion of hair that you want to braid into two halves. Use one of your index fingers to keep the two halves divided.
Next begin braiding by taking a very small section from the outside of one half and crossing it over to join the other half. Alternate back and forth, taking a small section from the outside of each half, until you reach the bottom of your braid.
Secure the end with a small elastic hair tie to keep the braid in place, and then move on to your second braid.

, Another simple way to change up the look of this style is to use a rope braid. This is a simple braid that actually involves more twisting than braiding.Get started by diving the section of hair that you want to braid into two equal halves. Hold each half in one hand.
Next start twisting both of the strands individually. This will be easier to do if you are holding each section at the very bottom.
Once each piece is twisted, started twisting them around each other by wrapping one section on top of the other, then underneath and around. Continue doing this until you reach the end of the hair, and then secure with an elastic band. When you're done, move on to your second braid.

, Once you've finished both braids, take one and place it across the top of your head, securing it behind your opposite ear with bobby pins. Then do the same with the opposite braid, placing it just behind the first one and securing it behind the opposite ear.You can experiment with how close to your forehead you want the braids.
Once your braids are secured on top of your head, you may decide that you want them a little looser. If so, simply use your fingers to pull the braids apart a bit until you have the look you want. There's no need to take the braid off of the top of your head to do this.

, When securing your braids, do your best to hide the elastic bands and the ends of your hair that aren't braided. You can do this by gently tucking each end under the opposite braid.You may want to use a few extra bobby pins to keep the ends in place.

, If you chose to leave a few strands of hair outside of your braids, you can style them however you like.Loose waves look excellent with this kind of look. You can achieve this by gently wrapping your hair around a curling iron or straightening iron and then spraying it with hairspray.

, To keep your hairstyle in place and prevent flyaways, spray on a bit of hairspray when you're done styling. Now you'll have a stylish braided look that will look amazing all day long."

Pick out a base and accent colour (optional) for your falls.,
Choose a material(s) the same colour(s) as the yarn.

,
Cut the material to the desired length you want the falls to be.,
Begin by taking a strand of whatever material you are using and secure it to the edge of a table top.,
Leaving 1/2 to 1 cm (1/4 to 1/2 in.),
Start wrapping the yarn very tightly around the material.,
Continue doing this until you have the desired number of strands for your falls.,
Sew your dreads to another material so that they are bunched together and can be installed.,
Put your hair up in either a high ponytail or two high pigtails.

,
Flip your head upside down and wrap the ribbon of dreads around your existing ponytail or pigtail from the underside, now facing up.",How to Make Inexpensive Yarn Dread Falls,";
,, If you chose a thinner material, bunch it before you cut it width-way as the width of the material will get thinner as you wrap the yarn around it.

,


Tape is a good way to secure the yarn to the table.

, from the top, attach yarn to the material you chose by tying a knot.

, Be sure that it is tight enough that you don't see any gaps and that gaps won't form due to handling the falls over time. When you have wrapped the dread to the bottom, cut the yarn leaving a couple centimeters (about 1 in.) of excess, so you can tie off the loose end.


You can estimate how much yarn you'll need for a strand, but it uses more than you'll think so leave it attached to the bundle until you're done with the strand.

, Bunch the strands in your hand to make sure you have enough before you secure them to an elastic or ribbon.


For dreads the size of a sharpie marker 30 to 40 strands is recommended.

, Some people do this with elastics, the downside of this method is that the elastics can stretch over time. Try cutting out some funky patterned material and using that as your ribbon. Or you could just use actual ribbon.


Once you have sewn all of your dreads into the material of your choice, you're ready to install them.

,, Flip your head back up and tie a bow with the ribbon. You should now have your dread falls installed.


If your hair is thicker, try straightening it so that its less poofy and obvious under the falls. Sometimes this gives it lift, and sometimes it just looks weird. If your hair is naturally thin, don't worry about hiding your hair cause the falls will do it.

Continue the braid.,
Finish the braid.",How to Make a Rope Braid1," You need to start off this braid with tangle free hair. Brush out the length of your hair. This braid will not work if you have snags in your hair as you move through the steps., You need to decide how thick you want your French rope braid to be. If your beginning section is larger, then each section of the French braid portion of your braid will be thicker. Gather a small section of hair at the crown of your head.You can do this as a side braid as well. Just pick a section of hair on the side of you head that you want to braid. The braid follows the same path as the middle braid., Like with the traditional rope braid, you will only need two sections of hair for this braid. Divide the section in your hand in two down the middle. Twist the two strands counterclockwise around your fingers. Make sure you keep the twists tight as you twirl them. Cross the twisted strands clockwise over each other, holding the strands lightly so they don't unravel.









For a French rope, you'll twist the hair as you go, so don't worry if you only have the base of the strand twisted for now. That is the part that is incorporated into the braid, so as long as that portion is twisted, your braid will look great.If you want a less twisty French braided portion, you can leave the strands untwist and just cross them over one another., Once you have crossed the two initial strands, grab the section of hair directly beside the right section. It should incorporate all the hair from the side of your head to where your twisted strand sits. Incorporate the new hair into the strand, twisting it into the other hair. Repeat on the left side. Both strands should have an equal amount of new hair incorporated into the strand so the braid will stay even.








If you want a smaller, tighter french braid, make sure you grab smaller sections as you move down your hair. This will take a little longer but will give you a closer weave to the braid., Cross the now thicker sections of hair clockwise over one another, just as you did with your first two pieces of hair. Incorporate more hair into the strands, twisting as you did before. Repeat until you have run out of hair at the sides of your head.








If you want a half French rope braid, you can choose at what length that you want the braid stop. Once you've decided a length, tie the two strands together with an elastic band., Once you get to the nape of your neck, you need to start a traditional rope braid. Keep the sections of your hair twisted, crossing them clockwise as you finish the lower area of your braid. If they are not as tight of twists as you would like, twist them a little more before you finish the braid. Close off the end with an elastic band.








You can make this into a bun at the bottom as well. Once you have braided the ends, twist the braid into a bun. Secure it with bobby pins."

Finish the braid.",How to Make a Rope Braid2," To do this braid neatly, you need to have well-combed hair. You don't want your hair to get caught in a tangled mess as you are making your braid. You can also dampen your hair, which will help it twist into cleaner sections.








You can also spray your hair with a leave-in conditioner or smoother. This can help with fly away strands of hair and keep the braid looking tighter., If you want to make a tight, structured braid, start with your hair in a ponytail. Grab your hair, pulling it up to the height you want your ponytail. Secure it with an elastic band.









You can do a side ponytail instead of a traditional center ponytail. It just depends on what style you are going for. To make a side ponytail, just brush your hair to the side and secure it with an elastic band.It you want a messier look, then skip to this step and simply start the braid at the nape of your neck., Separate your ponytail into 2 equal sections. Taking one strand in each hand, twist each section around your fingers in a counterclockwise direction. Make sure to keep your fingers tight on the twists. If you let them go, they will unravel and you will have to start over.








If your hair is too long to twist all at once, you can pinch the top of the section, twist the hair, and then move down an inch to twist the next section of hair. Continue this for the entirety of each section.

, Holding one section in each hand, cross the pieces over one another in a clockwise motion. The twisted strands should switch hands. You should be crossing them in the opposite direction from the way you twisted your hair. If you twist and cross in the same direction, you braid will unravel.







, Twist your braid, crossing the sections over one another until you reach the end of your hair. If you find that your hair is unraveling as you are braiding it, just twist it tight again before you continue your braid.








, Once you've reached the end of your hair, you need to tie it off with an elastic band. If you want your hair to look fuller, you can gently fluff out the ropes in your braid to give it width. You can also add a barrette over the elastic or use a decorative band instead to add a little flourish to your braid.








You can dress this braid up or dress it down. It is very versatile. Add a beanie if it's cold outside, or add a ribbon or flower to the base of your ponytail to make it softer and more feminine."

Condition your hair with your favorite conditioner, and after you rinse it out, towel dry your hair and let it air dry.
If you're in a rush and need to blow dry your hair, apply a heat-protecting product beforehand.;
, Like a regular braid, you can make a snake braid from a section of hair anywhere on your head, and you can also make it any size. If you're going to be creating a specific style with the braid, use that to guide you regarding where and how large to make the braid.


To practice a basic snake braid, part your hair normally. On one side of your part, grab a small to medium section of hair from the center of your head, and use this to make your braid., To make a snake braid, you first make a regular braid. Comb the section with a wide-toothed comb to remove knots, and then divide the section of hair into three equal parts., To make a basic braid, hold the left section of hair in your left hand, hold the middle section of hair with the thumb and index finger of your right hand, and hold the right section of hair with the remaining fingers on your right hand.


Twist the right and middle sections of hair so the right section comes over top and becomes the middle section. Then, twist the left and middle sections so the left section comes over top and becomes the middle.
As you weave the hair, be sure to shift the sections back and forth between your hands as they alternate between being the left, middle, and right sections.Continue alternating the twists with the right–middle and left–middle sections so that the three sections become woven into one another.
Stop when you reach the end of the sections and only have about one inch of unbraided hair left.

, Pinch the ends of the braid with the thumb and index finger of your left hand so the sections don’t unravel. With your right hand, separate the unbraided ends of the three sections and pinch the middle section.As you hold the end of the middle section, continue pinching the end of the braid with your left hand.

, Hold down the center section of the braid and gently slide the other two sections up the shaft of the braid with your other hand.


If the snake gets caught, move to the top of the braid and gently slide the top portion of the braid up. Then move to the center and slide the braid upward from there, and then go back to the bottom and continue sliding the braid from the bottom., After you slide the braid up the center section, the snake braid will be all bunched up, and you'll have to loosen it and reposition it to give it the true snake form.Starting from the top of the braid, gently work the two side sections back down the center section of the braid, spreading the loops downward as you go. Work your way down the braid until you have loosened the entire length of the braid.
The finished product should look like a snake wrapped around the center section of hair.

, You can either tie the ends of the braid with a clear elastic and let it hang, or you can position the braid on your head the way you like and fasten the braid in place with a bobby pin.


For instance, you can wrap the braid around to the back of your head and pin it in place there.
After you pin the braid, you can cover the pin with another section of hair if you want to hide it., If you're going to be creating specific hairstyles with your snake braid, you want to ensure the braid is going in the right direction, otherwise it will create a funny bump.


For instance, if you want a braid near your temple to wrap around to the back of your head, comb the hair toward the back of your head and weave the braid in that direction when you start the first couple weaves of the braid., A braid halo wraps around the top of your head from ear to ear, and it’s a unique and attractive way to keep hair back and out of your face. You do, however, have to have pretty long hair to make this work. To create a snake braid halo:Make one small snake braid on either side of your head using the hair from right behind each ear. For the moment, fasten each braid with an elastic.
Comb back the rest of your hair so it’s away from your face. Take the snake braid from behind your left ear, wrap it around the top of your head (over your combed back hair), and use a bobby pin to secure the end of the braid behind your right ear.
Do the same with the right braid, lining it up beside the other braid, and pinning it behind your left ear.
Use your loose hair to cover the pins. You can either leave most of your hair back behind your shoulders, or you can bring it forward to sit in front.

, Part your hair to one side, and use the hair at the very front of the heavy part to make a large snake braid. Tuck any excess hair from the heavy side of your part behind the ear on the same side.


When you're finished the braid, tuck the end of the braid behind your ear with the rest of your hair, and pin it in place with a bobby pin.
Bring some hair forward to cover the pin and the end of the braid., Make a small or medium snake braid using hair at the front of your head. You can make the braid anywhere, but to start, try from your temple or at the top of your part. When it’s finished, wrap it around to the back of your head and pin it in place with a bobby pin.Cover the pin with a section of hair.


For the best results, don’t pull the braid too tight, and instead let it hang slack so there's a slight droop in the braid.
For a braid headband wraparound, make a similar braid on either side of your head and pin them both back at the same spot at the back of your head.
To create an even more interesting and intricate style, make two small snake braids on each side of your head. Try making one just above and behind each ear, and make the second set of braids near your temples. Making sure all the braids have some slack, pin the ends of all four braids behind your head."

The goal of conditioner is to add moisture to your hair, make it smoother, and can make your hair look healthier. Find a conditioner that matches your hair needs (dry, color-treated, curly, etc).If you have synthetic braids, choose a conditioner with a protein in it. This can strengthen your natural hair.;
, You can quickly mix up a lightweight moisturizer using ingredients that you probably already have on hand. Use whatever conditioner you usually use on your hair. This mixture will be easy to spray onto your hair every day. You'll need:Spray bottle
A tablespoon
A 1/2 cup measuring cup
Conditioner
Water
Glycerin

, Measure 1/2 cup of conditioner into the spray bottle. Add 3 tablespoons of water and screw the nozzle onto the top. Shake this mixture till the water is completely combined with the moisturizer.The water helps thin the conditioner out so that you can easily spray it onto your braids.

, Unscrew the spray bottle nozzle and add 2 tablespoons of 100% pure glycerin to the diluted conditioner. Screw the bottle nozzle back into place and shake the mixture till the glycerin is mixed in.








Glycerin is added to reduce frizz in your hair and keep it moisturized.

, Bring the braids from the back of your head to the sides of your face. Take a spray bottle filled with your slightly diluted leave-in moisturizer and spray the braids nearest to your face.








You should mainly be spraying close to your scalp if you have synthetic braids. If you have natural braids, you'll eventually need to spray the entire braid.

, Grab a handful of braids near your scalp using one hand. While loosely gripping the braids, run your hand down the entire length. At the same time, use your other hand to alternate running the moisturizer down the braids. Run your hands through the braids till you can't see the moisturizer anymore.








Never rub the moisturizer up through your braids or you'll create frizz and can damage your hair.

, Working in chunks, continue to spray and rub down your braids with moisturizer. Remember to get the hard-to-reach braids at the back of your head.








Make sure your edges are well-moisturized since these can easily dry out. Moisturizing your edges will make the braids last longer.

, Once you've sprayed near the scalp and top of your braids, spray near the middle of your braids. Run your hands down the length of the braids so that the ends of the braids are completely moisturized.









It's especially important to spray the ends of your braids if your braids are natural.Your hair is more likely to split or frizz if it's not moisturized.

, Squirt a natural oil (like coconut or almond oil) into the palm of your hand. Rub your hands together and loosely grab a section of braids near your scalp. While loosely gripping the braids, run your hand down the entire length. At the same time, use your other hand to alternate running the moisturizer down the braids.Continue to add more oil and work through all of your braids. You shouldn't see any frizz once you've sealed the braids.
Moisturize and seal your braids at least once or twice a week.

, Look for a light oil like coconut, jojoba,castor or almond oil. Select an oil that hasn't been mixed with cheaper oils (like mineral oil). A lighter oil can be easily absorbed by your scalp and your hair.Avoid using a thick or heavy conditioner that will just sit on your hair. Repeated use of a thick conditioner will cause product buildup on your braids.

, Keep the oil in a squeeze bottle so you can easily squeeze the oil directly onto your scalp. This way, you can easily massage the oil into your scalp and your edges. If you're worried that you'll squirt too much oil onto your braids, you can always squeeze a small amount into the palm of your hand, rub your hands together, and massage the oil onto your scalp.








Try to deep condition your braids about once a week if your hair is frizzy or every other week.
Remember to rub oil onto the tips of your braids too.

, Put your braids into a protective hairstyle. You can twist your braids into a bun and secure them to the top of your head. If your braids are short, try to tie them back or to the sides of your head. Place a plastic cap completely over your scalp so that your braids are contained.If you don't have a plastic cap, you can also try securing your braids with plastic wrap. This trick will probably work better if your braids are shorter.

, Sit under a dryer for about 20 minutes to allow your hair to soak up the oil more effectively. Let the braids air dry for another 10 minutes. To let the oil absorb even more, you can leave your hair in the cap for up to an hour after applying the heat.Avoid heating your hair for more than 30 minutes, since your hair will stop absorbing oil after this point.

, Take the cap off and let your braids down. Lightly spray your braids and scalp with your daily leave-in conditioner. This will seal in the moisture from your deep conditioning treatment. Rinse your braids and your scalp with clean water. Let your braids completely air dry.It's okay to leave a little conditioner in your hair after rinsing. This will just give your braids a little extra moisture.

You can use a moisturizing cream to smooth your hair out if it is not complying.You can also dampen your hair with water to make it easier to put back in a ponytail and braid.;
, Grab any accessories that you think you will need while braiding your hair. You will need at least two hair ties to create the braid—one for the ponytail and one for the bottom of the braid. It will also be helpful to have a few bobby pins around to secure loose hair or bumps.You may also want to keep a spray bottle of water around if your hair is difficult to tame.

, You will start creating this style by putting your hair back into a ponytail. Brush it straight back at the crown of your head, gather your hair, and use a hair tie to secure the ponytail. You can also choose to do a middle part or lower ponytail if you prefer.








, Each section will need to be twisted individually before you twist them together. Take each section and twist your hair until you nearly reach the bottom of your ponytail. You will probably not be able to twist the ends of your hair. Twist both sections a half-turn clockwise or counterclockwise—the choice is up to you. 







, Wrap the right section around the left section one time. In other words, put the right section over the left section. Make sure you pass it in front of the left section--not behind it.

The first step to growing your own free form / neglect dreadlocks is to stop brushing, combing or finger combing your hair.,
Clean hair dreads faster.,
Sections should vary in size.,
Separate any sections that are trying to join on to each other.,
Your hair will shrink as it matures to become the thickness of where the section meets the scalp.,
It can take one to two years for free form dreads to mature, depending on the length of hair to start.,
Did you want to do the twist and rip method as a started method?,
First, let your hair section naturally for a couple of weeks, Let your hair tell you where it wants to be and who it wants to buddy up with.,
The next step takes time, and gives you sore arms, so if you have a buddy to help you then all the better.,
You will start to twist & rip one section at a time.,
Grab a section and start to pull strands apart doing that in little sections, this is the ripping part.,
Now after you have done 3 or 4 rips, you will divide that section in half and twist it, move one side over to the other side.,Repeat step 11

,Repeat step 12

,
Repeat step 11 & 12 for the entire length of that section.,
When you finish the length of your section, you can temporarily put on the black elastic bands.,
The black bands should only be put on the bottom tips of the T&R sections, never ever up at the root / scalp area or you will cause weak points in the hair up there, breaking or damaging the strands which may cause your dreads to break off at those weak points as they grow and get heavier.,
Do your entire head and then give yourself a pat on the back, have a partner massage your arms for you.,
These sections need to start the journey of maturing, which is the shrinking and looping stage, again, to become the thickness of where the section meets the scalp.,
Wash your hair in 2 or 3 days and do it every 2 or 3 days using the dread friendly shampoo.,
The T&R method is only a starter method.,
You will need to separate any sections that area trying to join onto each other or you will get congos forming.,
This method will take 1-2 years to mature, it depends on your hair length.,
Don't get discouraged when you get the frizzies at about 3 months, that happens with T&R, it will pass in about 3 weeks time.,
The free form and T&R method teaches you something while they are maturing.",How to Grow Dreadlocks Free Form or Twist & Rip," When you do this, over time knots will form, this is how dreadlocks grow. When you stop brushing, your hair will start to separate into sections all on its own. This takes only a couple of weeks to section.;
, Wash your hair 2-3 times a week during the first few months. By the one year mark, you only need to wash once a week. Use a dread friendly shampoo or dread bar. Regular shampoos will leave behind a residue build up or over condition the hair causing any knotting process to slip out

, If any are larger than one inch, it is best to divide that into 2 or 3 sections. Anything larger than one inch will produce Congos / fat dreads. The area of where the section of hair meets the scalp will be the thickness of your mature dreadlocks, so that is where you check the size.

, Do this by holding both sections and slowly pulling them apart up starting from the bottom and going up towards the scalp. Leave a little bit of webbing right at the scalp, this protects the scalp from the sun.

, The longer the hair, the more shrinkage you will have. Don't worry, in 3 years you will have your length back.

, Longer hair takes time to mature. Why is that? In order for dreads to lock up, they will shrink and as they shrink they will loop and zig and zag. This process takes patience some days, but the end result is the healthiest dreadlocks you could have, ones that will last you a lifetime.

, It is explained below. This is the second best method to free form dreads that causes no or little damage if done properly.

, During this time you are still keeping your hair clean, washing it 2-3 times a weeks with residue free shampoo. Now go back and read step #3...then go to step #9

, If you don't have a buddy, get a big mirror, plunk yourself on the floor in front of the television and do as many sections as you can before your arms get tired. You can do them over a matter of days if needed, don't rush yourself.

, You can use a hair clip or whatever to keep other sections out of the way while you work on an area. Start at the top of your head, that way when you have completed a section, use the clip to put it up out of the way and start on the next one.

, You should ripping them close to the scalp area, about just an inch away from it. So, grab a few hairs in that section & rip, do it again to a few more hairs in that section and rip, now do it again

, Don't always divide it perfectly in half to do this, pic random spots each time you twist.

,,, So as you do that section, you don't want a braided look, so you will go Rip Rip Rip, Twist, Rip Rip Rip Rip, Twist etc. Do 3 or 4 Rips to every Twist. Don't do them tightly and don't do them completely to the scalp

, Never use rubber as they pull out the hairs and also melt into your hair, leaving behind sticky goo. 

, Many people tell you to put them at the top and bottom,but that could not be further from the truth. If you want them for years or a lifetime, I can't stress enough not to put elastic bands at the roots

, You deserve it, especially if your hair was long

, To do this, the elastic bands need to come out or the hairs can't move. Don't leave them in for more than a week, you can take them out right away which is best or even take them out for your first wash. You can even use embroidery thread at the bottoms for the first while, as the thread will not melt in your sections, and it also allows the strands of hairs to move and do their thing.

,  Knowing your water type is important because many dread shampoos & bars do not work properly with hard water, they will slowly leave behind a residue build up. If you have soft water you can use just about any dread shampoo or bar on the market. 

, These sections will slowly loosen up and some may even fall out. That should happen. They need to loosen in order to loop and knot. Don't retwist any that fall out, that will just slow down your journey. Let them do what they want to do from here on in.

, Read step #4.  The area that joins together the most is on the part of the head that you sleep on, It may create matting, so make sure to separate them. If that area needs it daily, then do it daily. Most areas will only need separating done once a week, for some it is only every two weeks.

, It seems like a long time, but this will give you the healthy dreadlocks that will last you a lifetime or many years to come

, As they shrink to mature, they will do many crazy shapes and look messy at times. Embrace the wildness, just part of the journey. On the really bad days put on a loose tam when going out. Not looking in a mirror on the messy days helps, if you need to look in one, don't concentrate on your hair, just don't look at it

, Your inner soul will change, you will learn all about patience and you will lose some of the vanity you may have had. It really does make you into a better person.

Get your materials.,
Cut your crin.,
Seal the ends to prevent fraying.,
Cut the elastic into two pieces, long enough to be tied around your hair in a bun.,
Take several pieces of crin and pinch them in the middle, laying them on top of each other.,
Take your needle and sew the crin to the elastic.,
Do this again with the remaining half.

,
Accent your falls, if you would like.,
Wear them!

",How to Make Cyberlock Falls (Cyberlox)," Most can be found in craft stores, except for the main part: tubular crin. These are the stretchy tubes that work like finger traps. They can be found online. I Kick Shins is a great place to buy them. There are many kinds to choose from: metallic, UV reactive, mini, full size, etc. You will need about 10 yards (9.1 m). You will also need scissors, elastic, a needle, and thread. Ribbons, rexlace, craft foam are optional.;
, Be careful as they stretch easily and you'll end up with something much shorter than you wanted, so try not to pull too hard. Cut them in half first, then divide them depending on how long and full you want them. Remember to keep them twice as long as you want your falls.

, The simplest and best looking way involves folding the end inside itself.

, Also, thread your needle at this point to make it easier later.


Another way you can do it is fold the cut crin in half (to the length you want). Then do the same to a second one. Then make an X with the two pieces at the middle and tied them together. Then tie it around a hair elastic. Then just keep on doing it. This one may be an easier method.

, The more you use in a single section makes them more full, but you will need more sections for better coverage.

, Make sure you go through all the crin, then over them. Repeat until you used half your crin.

,,


For foam, cut it in strips, and punch a hole in one end. Eyelets keep them from tearing. Paint or draw on them, put stickers on them, punch out shapes, do whatever you like. Attach them with yarn through the eyelets.
Ribbon can just be tied on, with or without a bow.
Just tie on re-lace. You can also bead it.

Tuck in loose dread hairs.,

Keep the dreads from getting flat.",How to Grow Dreads," It's important to start dreads with clean, dry hair. Use a clarifying shampoo to strip the oils and conditioners from your hair, since these can leave it slippery and make it difficult for your hair to dread.


Don't use conditioner or any styling products after shampooing your hair.
Be sure your hair is completely dry before you start the dreading process.;
, Each small section of hair will become an individual dread. Making sure they are all the same size will create a neater appearance when your dreads are finished; it's difficult to change the size once your hair has ""locked.""


Use a comb to part your hair and create square-shaped sections. Fasten each section with a small rubber band to hold it apart from the others.
The size of the squares is up to you. If you want medium sized dreads, go for 1"" by 1"" squares. 1/2"" by 1/2"" dreads are smaller and quite elegant, but they take longer to create and the maintenance is more involved.
You'll be able to see your scalp between the individual dreads. Some people like the patterned appearance of rows, but if you'd prefer a less rigid look, create a brick lay or zig-zag pattern instead.

, Take a section of hair out of its rubber band, and hold it out from your scalp. Insert your comb into the section of hair about an inch from your scalp, and comb the hair toward your scalp so that it begins to pack around the roots. Once the first section is packed, move the comb down the section of hair an inch and do the same thing. Continue backcombing until the whole section of hair has been packed, then secure the end with a rubber band. Finish the remaining sections.


As you backcomb a section of hair with one hand, use your other hand to twist it. This helps keep the section of hair in a uniform shape.
This process can take a very long time, especially if you have thick hair and are creating small dreads. Have a friend help out to save time.
Take the same amount of time with each section of hair, carefully backcombing and twisting. If you rush through a few sections, they won't dread up the same as the rest of your hair, and you might not be happy with the results.

, Each section of hair should have a rubber band securing the end, but you want to place another small rubber band around the top of each section, right against the scalp. The two rubber bands will keep the hair from unraveling as the dreads mature.

, Some people advocate for applying wax to the sections of hair while you're waiting for them to dread. It can protect the hair and help it stay in place. Others contend that waxing is actually counter productive, and that it prevents hair from locking up properly. Here are a few factors to keep in mind:


Dread wax may help if your hair is naturally fine, and you're worried the sections aren't going to stay in place. If your hair is coarse and won't have a problem dreading, you can skip it.
If you're going to use dread wax, use an all-natural brand with no chemicals. Certain chemicals and oils will cause your hair to smell bad, so be sure you go with a trusted company.
Go with plain aloe vera in place of dread gel if you'd like. Just make sure it has no other added ingredients.

, Use residue-free shampoo with no added conditioners or perfumes. Washing your hair often helps the sections of hair stay backcombed and begin the process of getting tight and smooth, or locking. The whole locking process takes at least 3 months.


You can buy a special dread bar to use to wash your hair, or simply use a shampoo with no perfumes or conditioners.
Smooth the bar or shampoo over your scalp, rub it in slightly, and rinse it out. Don't handle the actual hair more than you have to.
Don't blow dry or vigorously towel dry the hair, or the dreads may fray.
Wash your hair in the morning so it has time to dry before you go to sleep. You don't want mildew and mold growing in your hair.

, It's necessary to moisturize your dreads every few days to keep them from getting dried out and frayed. Spray them with a mixture of water and a few drops of tea tree or lavender oil. Don't use too much oil, since you don't want the dreads to look greasy.


Avoid using vegetable oil, almond oil, or other food-based oils. These will go rancid in your hair.
You can buy dread moisturizer products online.

, To keep your dreads looking neat, it will be necessary to tuck in the hairs that come loose throughout the day. You can use a crochet hook or a pair of tweezers to tuck the hairs back into the dreads, so they can knot back up.

, It's a matter of personal preference, but some people like to roll the dreads and blunt the ends to give them a rounded shape. Roll them gently between your hands for a few seconds each every few days. Make rounded ends by smashing the tips of the dreads against your palm and rolling them around. The hairs will roll up into the dread.


Be gentle when you handle the dreads, or you could cause them to unravel.
Don't pull on the dreads; you might cause the hairs to break at the scalp.

, After a few months, when your dreads are locked, you can free them from the rubber bands that have been holding them in place. Carefully remove the bands from the roots and tips of the dreads. You may need to cut them off with a pair of scissors.

, As the dreads begin to grow out, the new growth coming from your scalp will need to be incorporated into them. Rub the new straight hair between your fingers, rolling it against the dreads.


You don't need to rub the dreads often, since the new growth will naturally start knotting up into the dreads an inch or so from your scalp.
Don't work the hair at the roots too much; overhandling the roots can cause the dreads to fall out, especially once they start getting mature and heavy.

, Try to position your dreads so that they aren't flat under your head against your pillow at night. Don't wear heavy hats that will flatten them out. When you can't avoid flattening them, take the time to roll the dreads gently between your hands to help them regain their rounded shape.

Make sure your hair is 3 times as long as you want it.,
Braid the hair you want to dreadlock very tightly into large braids; each of the three strands used in the braid should be roughly the size you want your dreadlocks to be, so, for example, if you want 1-inch in diameter dreadlocks, braid together three 1-inch strands.,
During this two week period, wash your hair often, but do NOT condition it.,
After two weeks of training your hair through washing it and forcing it into tight curls, the braids should be removed.

,
Using a metal comb, ""back-comb"" each strand towards the scalp until it is teased up into a fluffy ball, then pull the hair away from the scalp with your fingers and back-comb it again.,
Do this to each and every braid strand until all the hair you want is dreadlocked.

,
After this, have someone give you a scalp massage, as your hair follicles will definitely be hurting after all the back-combing.

This is different for everyone. It may end up making your hair half its length, so have some length to spare.:);
, Leave it in for 1-2 weeks.

, How often you wash will depend on your skin type. If you have an oily scalp, wash your hair every other day or so. Rinse it as often as you like. Just DON'T over dry your scalp through excessive washing, that is unhealthy for your hair.

,, You should end up with a compacted, tight dreadlock with a little bit of 'undreaded' hair at the tip.

,,, You can alternatively (and without the headache of learning this technique) just leave your tips be and cut them off when your dreadlocks have matured.

, That is the only certain key to having quickly maturing dreadlocks; cleanliness of one's scalp. Keep in mind that dreadlocks should be periodically kept apart from each other and palm-rolled. Not doing this will result in one big mass of hair and flat dreads.

Start with clean hair.,
Section your hair into squares.,
Backcomb the hair sections.,
Secure the dreads.,
Wax the dreads.",How to Give Yourself Dreadlocks1," Making sure your hair is clean and residue-free makes the process go faster. The natural oils that build up in your hair make it slippery, so it's better to start with hair that has been freshly shampooed.


Don't add conditioner or any other products to your hair after shampooing.
Be sure your hair is completely dry before you start.;
, Each square of hair will become a dreadlock. It's up to you to decide how large or small you want the dreadlocks to be. For a neater overall appearance, plan to make each dread the same size.


Use a wide-toothed comb to part your hair and delineate the squares. Hold the squares apart from each other by using small rubber bands.
One by one-inch squares create standard medium sized-locks. 1/2-inch squares create small, elegant locks. Keep in mind that the more squares you create, the longer it will take to dread your hair.
The sections and rows in between the squares may be visible in the finished dreads. To avoid a patterned appearance, fashion the squares in a zig-zag or brick lay format so that the finished look is more natural.

, Hold a section of hair straight up from your scalp. Starting about one inch from your scalp, place a fine-toothed comb in the section of hair and tease it down toward the scalp. Repeat this ""backcombing"" technique several times on the same section of hair until it begins to puff and pack up at the roots. Continue backcombing the same section of hair in one-inch increments until the entire section has been backcombed toward the scalp. Secure the end with a rubber band.


As you backcomb with one hand, use the other hand to gently twist the section you're working on. This keeps it in shape and assists with the backcombing process.
Continue backcombing each section of hair using the same technique until all of your hair has been backcombed. Having a friend help out speeds the process along.
Use the same patience and care with each dread. If you rush through the last part of your hair, you'll end up with uneven-looking dreads.

, Each dread should have a small rubber band securing the end. Place a second rubber band on each dread right next to the scalp. The two rubber bands will hold the dread in place as it matures.

, Use a natural dread wax or tightening gel to keep your dreads from fraying or frizzing. Apply the wax or gel to the entire length of the dread, taking care to cover the whole strand but remember less is better. If you choose to wax it need only be done every 2-4 weeks.


Many people with dreads do not use a dread wax or gel because they believe it obstructs the dreading process. Use at your own discretion.

Wash your hair with residue-free shampoo.,
Moisturize the dreads.,
Tuck in the loose hairs.,
Roll the dreads and blunt the ends.",How to Give Yourself Dreadlocks2," Washing your hair regularly will help the dreads continue to get tight and smooth, a ""locking"" process that takes at least 3 months to complete. Use a dread bar or another shampoo that doesn't contain perfumes and conditioners, which can build up in your dreads and cause them to smell.


When you wash your hair, concentrate on your scalp. Don't over handle the dreads themselves, since you don't want them to start to fray.
Wash your hair in the morning so that your dreads have time to dry. If you go to bed with wet hair, mildew and mold can grow there.

, Use a mixture of oil and water to spray your dreads every few days to keep them from drying out and fraying. Use an essential oil like tea tree or lavender. Don't add too much oil, or your dreads could look greasy; a spritz every few days is sufficient.


Don't use vegetable oil, olive oil, or other food-based oils on your dreads. They'll get absorbed into your hair and turn rancid.
Special dread moisturizer is available online.

, Going about your daily routine will inevitably cause some of your hairs to become loose from the dreads. Use a crochet hook or a tweezers to tuck the stray hairs back into the dreads.

, To maintain the smooth shape of the dreads, you can roll them between your hands periodically. Make the ends look rounded by smashing them against the palm of your hand to encourage the hairs to roll up into the dread.


If you like having wispy ends, there's no need to blunt the ends.
Don't overdo the rolling, or the dreads will be more likely to unravel.

Remove the rubber bands.,
Rub the roots.,
Keep shampooing.,
For natural and cheap cleansing use about 1/4 cup of baking soda on your very wet scalp.Massage your scalp very gently.To remove build-up and dirt from the dreads themselves rinse or submerge your dreads in a 3:1 ratio of water and apple cider vinegar.When done rinse your scalp and dreads very very well.",How to Give Yourself Dreadlocks3," As your dreads completely lock, you no longer need to hold them in place with rubber bands. Remove the rubber bands from the roots and the tips of the dreads after about 3 months.

, As your dreads mature, the individual hairs begin naturally knotting onto one another. The new growth that comes in will be straight and unknotted, so you'll have to do a little work to incorporate it into the dreads. Use your fingers to rub the new growth, section by section, to encourage it to knot up with the rest of the dreads.


It's not necessary to rub the dreads too often; as your dreads mature, the new growth will naturally knot up about an inch from your scalp.
Be careful not to overwork the hair at your roots, since you may cause it to start falling out.

, Oils and residues built up on the scalp keep the hair straight, preventing it from knotting up with the rest of the dread. Keep the new growth clean and dry so it naturally becomes part of the rest of the dread.

, You don't want anything left behind or it can cause odor.

Start with clean, dry hair.,
Separate your hair into squares.,
Backcomb the hair sections.,
Secure the dreads.,
Gel the dreads.,
Maintain the dreads.",How to Dread Hair1," Use a clarifying shampoo and don't follow it with conditioner in the weeks leading up to your dreading session. Forego products that are designed to moisturize your hair or make it sleek and shiny, since these make it harder for your hair to stay knotted during the dreading process.;
, Use a comb to separate your hair into even sections, and then keep them separated with small rubber bands. Each section will become a dread, so make them or small or as large as you want according to the finished look you have in mind.


One-inch squares create medium-sized dreads. Go a little larger for big dreads, or smaller for many little dreads. The smaller the dreads, the more time it takes to create them.
If you don't want it to look like you have even rows of dreadlocks, created a zig-zag or brick lay pattern of squares instead. When the dreads form, these patterns will look more natural than even checkerboard rows.

, Take a section of hair and place a dread comb or another fine tooth comb about an inch above your scalp. Comb the hair down toward your scalp, teasing it until some hairs get packed around the roots. Continue until the hair is tightly packed, then insert the comb an inch higher, and backcomb again. Keep doing this until the entire section of hair has been backcombed.


Use your free hand to twist the section of hair as you backcomb it.
Continue backcombing each section until your entire head of hair has been backcombed. Have a friend help if you get tired.

, Place a small rubber band at the root and the end of each individual dread. Make sure the rubber bands are tightly secured, since they will need to stay in place until the dreads have ""matured,"" which takes about 3 months.

, Use a gel containing a natural ingredient like aloe to tame frizz and loose strands of hair. Smooth it onto each section of hair until all your hair has been covered.

, Over the course of three months, the dreads will begin to lock into place. Aid the process in the following ways:


Shampoo regularly. Use a clarifying shampoo and forego the conditioner.
Moisturize your hair with essential oil, such as lavender. Don't use food-based oils, which can cause your hair to smell.
Tuck in the loose hairs. Use a crochet hook or tweezers to keep your dreads looking neat.

Stretch the rubber band into a thin line and wrap it around the thinned hair. Feed one looped end of the rubber band through the other looped end. Pull the loop through until the rubber band is wrapped tightly around the hairpiece.

This creates a small loop in the center of the hairpiece, which you will use to secure your braid to your hair.Some hairpieces are sold with a loop already in place, in which case you can skip this step.;
, Place a small amount of shea butter in the palm of your hand. Use your hands to work the butter through your hair evenly. Seek to smooth out the edges of your hair so it's easy to brush.Most hair will benefit from shea butter being applied before the hair piece. However, if your hair is already oily, skip this step.

, With one hand, use a brush to brush your hair in an upward direction. With the other hand, gradually gather your hair as you brush it out. Once all your hair is brushed out and gathered in one hand, secure this ponytail with a rubber band.Your ponytail should rest near the top of your head.

, Take the hairpiece from earlier. Using the loop sticking out from the rubber band, attach the hairpiece to your ponytail. Wrap the rubber band around your ponytail twice to securely attach the hairpiece., Once the rubber band is attached, use your fingers to push your natural hair under your hairpiece. Keep pushing your hair under the braiding hair strand by strand until it's no longer visible. When you're done, you should only be able to see the hairpiece poking out from your ponytail., Once the hairpiece is in place, you can begin the process of braiding it. To start, use your fingers to separate the hairpiece into three roughly even strands. Try to get the strands as even as possible, as this will make your braid look uniform when you're finished., Start the braid at the base of your ponytail. As you weave your braid together, incorporate your natural hair. Each time you grab a strand of the braid, incorporate about an inch of your natural hair with that strand. Keep incorporating your natural hair in small amounts until it is all woven into the hairpiece., After incorporating your natural hair, continue braiding. Braid your hair until you reach the end of your hairpiece. Only a small amount of hair should be left unbraided at the end of the piece., You can use either use clear or black rubber bands to secure the braid. If you have lighter hair, clear rubber bands work best. Black rubber bands work better for dark or black hair., You do not have to stick to your natural hair color when jumbo braiding. If you want to add some color, find jumbo braid hairpieces in exciting shades. You can go for a light natural shade, like blond, or something unusual like pink or blue., If you want to add a pretty feminine flare to your braids, try clipping in hair charms. Hair charms can be secured at various points on your jumbo braid. You can also put charms in the hair surrounding the braid.Coordinate hair charms with your outfit. If you're wearing pink, for example, style your hair with pink hair charms.

, Try tying a hair tie around each groove in your braid. This will create a fun, striped appearance that will make your jumbo braid pop. Use brightly colored hair ties, especially if your jumbo braid is a darker shade, so they stand out."

Change the way you wash your hair.,
Stop straightening your hair.,
Stop combing your hair.,
Separate your hair into sections.,
Roll the sections.,
Maintain the dreads.",How to Dread Hair2," Using a clarifying shampoo and skipping the conditioner creates the right conditions for dreads to begin forming. If your hair has too much oil or conditioning present, it won't begin to knot, or lock, into dreads.


Avoid shampoo that is marketed as ""moisturizing,"" since this shampoo usually contains conditioning agents that remain in the hair after rinsing.
Stop using conditioner for at least a few weeks before you want to start dreading your hair.

, If you use chemical straighteners or another straightening technique, it will be much harder for your hair to start dreading. Let your hair be as natural as possible so your hair has the ability to knot. 

, Dreaded hair is simply hair that has knotted together into clumps. Every time you comb your hair, you prevent this from occurring by detangling it. When you're ready to dread your hair, put aside combs brushes and other implements you use to untangle your hair.

, You can facilitate the formation of neater dreads by separating your hair into even sections as your hair reaches the point where dreads will begin to form. The sections don't have to be completely even, since the beauty of the natural neglect method is that it requires little effort.

, If you want to help your dreads along, roll them between your palms so they stay together. Rolling a few times a week will help create neater, more uniform dreads - but again, this step isn't necessary if your goal is to go completely natural.

, Once the dreads have formed, continue shampooing your hair regularly to keep them in good shape. If you plan to go camping or participate in an activity that could get the dreads dirty, wear a hat to keep them clean.

Divide your hair into sections.,
Twist a section and split it.,

Maintain the dreads.",How to Dread Hair3," Create a small section for each dread you want. The size of the section will determine the size of the dread. Use a small rubber band to keep the sections apart.

, Lift a section from your head and twist it, then use both hands to divide the end into two. Grasp one end in each hand and pull them in opposite directions. This action causes hair to ride up the shaft and get tangled and knotted.


As you pull the hair apart, the knots will move toward the roots and begin to pack there. Continue twisting the section, dividing it, pulling it, and twisting it again until the entire section of hair has become tangled and knotted.
Repeat until all sections of your hair have undergone the twisting, splitting and pulling from tip to root.

, Place a rubber band at the root and the end of each dread. Keep these rubber bands in place for a few months while the dreads mature. After 3 months, remove the rubber bands; the dreads should be tight and smooth, and will no longer need to be kept secure.

, Use clarifying shampoo and an essential oil spray to keep your dreads in healthy shape. If you plan to spend time outside or in an area where your dreads could get dirty, wear a hat to keep them clean.

Combine the two sections.",How to Do Twist Braids1," Wash, condition, and dry your hair. Comb it thoroughly to get any knots out, and tie it back securely in a high ponytail at the crown of your head.If you have curly hair, you will probably need to straighten it in order to achieve a polished looking rope braid.


If your hair is layered you may have trouble twisting it into a rope braid. Depending on how dramatically layered your hair is, you may still be able to achieve this look if you twist it tightly enough, but it may not turn out as neatly.
This kind of braid can be done on smaller sections of hair rather than one big ponytail at the back of your head, but if you are just learning how to do it, this is the easiest way to start off. Doing smaller rope braids uses the exact same process, it’s just more fiddly because you’re using smaller sections of hair.;
, Divide the ponytail into two equal halves. Twist the first half in whichever direction is easiest for you, until it tightens into a rope and you can’t twist any further. Without letting it untwist, pin it gently to the side of your head., Repeat the same process with the rest of your hair, making sure to twist the second section in the same direction as the first. Instead of pinning it to your head when you are finished, unpin the first section, and hold one securely in each hand to keep them from untwisting.

, This time, you will need to twist in the opposite direction as before. Twist the two sections of your hair around each other, so they look like a fancy rope. Tie the rope braid off at the bottom, and you’re done."

Layered hair can make doing a twist crown braid a difficult proposition. It’s worth a shot, but you may find you have trouble getting your hair to stay put., If you want the braid to go left, take a section of hair starting at the left of your part, and vice versa. Split this section in two, so that you have one section on your hairline, and the other just behind it.

, Hold the back section of hair still. Bring the front section behind it, and then back around to the front. Keep the back section taut, and grip both firmly.

, Separate another bit of hair from the hairline, and make it part of the front section. Keep a good grip on it to make sure the two sections stay together.The section of hair you separate from your hairline should be about the same size as the section you’re incorporating it into.

, Loop the back section behind the front section, and twist it around to hang in front. Separate the next bit of hair from your hairline, and incorporate it into this section.


Make sure always to twist each section in the same direction.

, Incorporate a new piece of hair from your hairline into the section currently hanging in front, then twist the back section around it to hang in front. Add more hair to this new front section, and repeat the twisting motion. Continue to follow your hairline until the twist crown braid reaches your desired length, and then use a bobby pin to secure it in place.You can pin the braid at your temple, or continue all the way down to the nape of your neck for a more regal look.

Don't worry about making a part if you have bangs., If you want the braid to go left, take a section of hair starting at the left of your part, and vice versa. Split this section in two, so that you have one section on your hairline, and the other just behind it.


If you have bangs, separate a section of hair just behind them, about an inch up from your ear.

, Rotate them around each other so that they switch places. The section whose roots are closest to your face should now be laying across the section whose roots are closest to the back of your head., While holding the two twisted sections with one hand, use the other hand to pick up another small section of hair from the top of your head. Lay it between the two twisted sections, and let it hang there.

, This should twist them around the strand you just inserted between them, holding it in place. This is the basic step you will need to repeat to achieve this braid.

Begin the French braid.,
Continue braiding.,
Secure the hair.,
Repeat on the other side.",How to Do Two French Braids1," Begin by brushing the hair and then parting it in the middle. Make sure the part goes from the hairline all the way to the nape. Pull the two sections of hair over your shoulders, as if you are about to tie your hair into pigtails.


The part in your hair does not have to be a severe straight line. You can have a messy, uneven part for a chic bohemian style. A zig-zag part can add a bit of funk to your style.;
, Choose a side to begin with. Take a 2-inch triangular section of hair from the hairline to the crown. Separate this section from the rest of the hair with your fingers.Divide this section into three strands. Make the foundation braid by starting a standard braid. Take the right strand and cross over the middle strand. Then cross the left strand over the middle.


You may want to secure the other, loose side with a hair band. This will help keep it from accidentally getting combined with the side you are braiding.
This foundation braid will be on the side of the head. Since you are making French braid pigtails, you should be braiding down each side of your head. The braids will sit just between the ears and the part.

, Add a small section of loose hair to the right strand. Cross the right strand over the middle strand while pulling the middle strand to the right. Add a small section of loose hair to the left strand. Cross the left strand over the middle strand while pulling the middle strand to the left.









Keep your hands close to the head so the braid will remain tight.Make sure to add an even amount of hair each time you add hair to the strands. This will keep the braids neat and uniform, instead of uneven.

, As you move down the side of the head, continue french braiding the hair. You will pull hair from around the hairline in the front, and from along the part in the back. Each time you need a new layer, separate the hair you are adding in a horizontal line.








When you run out of hair to add to the braid, continue braiding in a traditional braid.
Make sure to keep the braid tight as you braid. This can be achieved by pulling the sections away from each other., When you reach the desired length of your braid, tie it with hair ties. You can add hair clips, ribbon, or other accessories.








, On the other side of the head, repeat steps 2-5 on the hair. The braids should look identical. Make sure to stop them at the same place and try to use matching hair ties on each side.









If you would like an alternate style for French braid pigtails, instead of braiding all the way to the ends of your hair, stop at the nape of your neck. Secure the French braid with a hair tie. The hair hanging over your shoulders will be loose, so you can straighten or curl these strands.Another alternate style for two French braid pigtails is a bun. After finishing one of the French braids, pin the tail of the braid into a bun at the back of your head by wrapping the tail around. Secure with bobby pins. Repeat with the other side, pinning the other braid on top of the bun. Use as many bobby pins as necessary to hold the bun in place."

Style as desired.",How to Do Two French Braids2," After brushing the hair, part it in the middle. The part only needs to go from the hairline to the crown of your head., Choose a side to begin. Take a small section of hair near the face and separate it from the rest of your hair. Divide this into three equal strands. Make the foundation braid with a traditional braid - cross the right strand over the middle, and then cross the left strand over the middle.









These braids will be small strands that curve around the back of the head to meet in the middle. You are not trying to braid all of your hair into the strands.
An alternate way to do this same style is to create two larger braids. This will give a slightly different look to the style. Follow the same steps, but add more hair. The larger braids will angle downwards more than the smaller braids, which means they will meet just underneath the crown instead of in the middle of the head.When you start the braid, angle the braid away from the face, towards the back of the head. Don't angle it down.

, Add a small section of hair to the right strand, then cross the now larger strand over the middle. Add a small section of hair to the left strand, then cross the now larger strand over the middle. Continue this along the curve of the head.









Stop the braid once you get to the middle of the head. Secure with a clip or a hair tie.

, Repeat steps 2 and 3 on the other side of the hair. The two strands should meet in the middle of the back of your head. They should be approximately the same size.









The braids are forming a braided half-ponytail. Most of your hair will be loose.

, Take the clips or hair ties from the two sides of the half ponytail. Add these two strands together.







, With the two French braids along your head, you can now style as you wish. You can secure the half ponytail with a clip or hair tie for a stylish half-up do. You can also pull the hair into a ponytail. If you want to add a bit of sophisticated style, wrap the ponytail into a bun and secure with bobby pins.

Secure one side of the hair with a hair tie. This will keep it out of the way until you are ready to use it.
An alternate style is to leave the hair unparted. If you leave the hair unparted, follow the same steps. Your hair may get combined, so use a hair clip to keep the hair separated and neat.

, Gather the hair at the base of the neck. Divide the hair into three sections. Cross the right strand under the middle, then cross the left strand under the middle. This makes the anchor braid.








, Add a section of hair to the right strand, then cross under the middle strand. Add a section of hair to the left strand, then cross under the middle strand. You should be braiding upwards along your head.









A Dutch braid is also called an inverted French braid or a reverse French braid. The hair is braided under instead of over like in a standard French braid.This braid will be done from the bottom of the head up instead of from the top of the head down.
You may want to comb the hair in an upward direction before you begin so the hair is already in the right direction.

, Since this is a crown braid, the braid should follow along the curve of the head. Continue Dutch braiding by adding hair to the outer strands and crossing under.









Make sure that the amount of hair added to the strands is equal each time. This keeps the braid uniform instead of uneven.

, When the braid is finished, secure with a hair tie. Since this style works best on long hair, the braid probably will end somewhere around the forehead. Leave the braid as is.







, Unlike the first side, you will begin this braid at the top of the head. Starting at the part, repeat steps 2-5 as you Dutch braid down the side of the head. Just like the other side, this braid is curving along the head.









If you don't have a part, start the braid in the middle of the forehead.

, Once you have reverse French braided both sides, wrap the two braids around the head. Secure the braids with bobby pins. Tuck the hair bands and the hair below the hair bands beneath the braids. Secure with bobby pins.

If you want someone to give you tree braids, offer to do a trade with them. Suggest that you can give them braids if they do them to you as well. This way you both get practice and a new hairstyle.;
, In addition to a comb and some clips to hold back the hair that's not being braided, you will need to acquire hair extensions to complete your tree braids. The extension hair should be loose, also called bulk, but can have any other properties you like.There are a wide variety of extensions out there, with a ton of different colors, lengths, textures, and types of hair, from real to synthetic, available. These choices are up to you! Remember, however, that the length you choose with need to be twice the finished length you want, as each extension will be folded in half when applied.
Ask a hair care professional or employee at the beauty supply store you buy your extensions at how much hair you will need. There may also be suggestions of how much to buy listed on the packaging of the extensions you choose.
After your braids are completed, you will need a sleeping cap to protect them while you sleep and you will also need a combo conditioner and detangler to keep your extensions healthy and shiny.

, You don't want to dry your hair completely after washing. Creating tree braids with wet hair is easier and provides better results. You don't want to have your hair dripping wet but you do want it to be pretty damp.

, Make sure there are no knots or tangles in your hair. Tangles will cause problems when you are dividing your hair into rows and when your are actually making your braids.

, It might be a good idea to divide them into small sections that are just thicker than a piece of yarn.


You can also have the person who is getting their hair done divide the extension hair up as you go. As they sit there they can have pieces ready for you to attach. This will make the braiding process go much quicker.

, The first section should be taken from the hair closest to one of your ears. Work from the front to the back of your head, using the front point of your comb to separate a strip of your hair.


Use a ponytail holder or duckbill clip to secure the other hair in place away from the section you just made.

, These pieces should be the same size as you would use for a normal cornrow braid.

, The extension should effectively be folded in half, with the middle point being the point of attachment to the scalp.

, Braid the extension piece in with the piece of your natural hair that you separated. Combine the natural hair with the extensions, maintaining the three equal pieces.


Do one full rotation of braiding, in other words fold all three pieces over the top, before pausing.

, You will only be pulling out one side of the extension, the other side will get pulled out on the next cycle. Pulling pieces out will repeat like this, with one half of a piece getting pulled out in one cycle and the other half getting pulled out in the next. This way the hair extensions all come out relatively the same length.


It's great if you can hook the length of the extension your pulled out onto the hair you have pulled away with your clip.This will keep it out of further braiding, as it will be the first piece of extension that will form the body of your hair.
Make sure you are only pulling out the extension hair, not your natural hair.

, This will insure that your braids do not get too thick and that the previous extension is locked in place.

, Place it directly in front of where your braid currently stops, folding it around the outside and underneath before incorporating it into the next braid cycle.

, Ideally, you should continue braiding like this until you are past the endpoint of your natural hair and are working only with hair extensions.

, Using the outer two sections of hair, secure the braid with a knot. Allow the middle section of hair to fall through the braid. Use these two sections of hair to tie another knot, further securing the braid in place.


It is important to avoid tying off the braid until you have reached the end of the natural hair. Tying a knot in your real hair can be very damaging to the hair. In addition, the security of knots tied with natural hair versus extensions is unsatisfactory.

, It is a good idea to go halfway up one side of the head and then switch to the other side, working your way up the same amount. This way you will be able to more easily assess that your tree braids are symmetrical on both sides.

, Once the extensions are in, the hair can be cut to give you layers and body. Simply cut your hair as usual, except that you need to keep your comb away from the completed braids at the scalp.

, Put your hair up into several buns or braids, or simply put it into a ponytail. Then cover it with a cap or head scarf. This will minimize the risk of pulling out your extensions or creating frizziness., This will help your extensions to remain clean and shiny, as well as avoiding large tangles.


You can also shampoo your hair, but do it gently. This works best if you are using synthetic extensions, but natural hair can also be gently washed as well., This will help your scalp health, aiding your natural hair growth. It will also help you avoid a dry, itchy scalp., Vigorous brushing or combing can pull the extensions out of your hair.In order to avoid this, keep your hair detangled by protecting it at night and applying a detangled. If at all possible, simply comb through your hair with your fingers, not a comb or brush.

, If one of your rows is loose or out of shape, but the rest of your braids look great, take it out and rebraid it.


If you had a professional do your braids, they may do a re-tightening free of charge.

, By this point the braids will have loosened and your hair will probably become frizzy.


If you don't want to have your braids redone, simply remove them. Begin at the ends of the braids at the back of your head, undoing the braids and removing the extensions as you go. This process should be easy and painless, although it might take awhile.

Choose whatever type of synthetic braiding hair suits your liking. Some popular brands for micro braiding are Wet and Wavy and Milky Way Que.
, Rat tail combs are perfect, but any comb with a sectioning tool at the end will work. If you don’t have this kind of comb, you can buy one from a hair care store, or you can use a regular comb and the end of a pen or a bobby pin to part and section your hair., You will use these scissors to trim the loose pieces of hair from the ends of the braids. If you do not have hair cutting scissors, you can use regular scissors as well., You will use the spray bottle to wet the roots of your hair so that you can part your hair into clean sections. If you do not have a spray bottle, you can wet the section of hair with your fingers and water., Any plain hair gel will work.

Section your hair with a comb.,
Section off a piece of hair about ⅛ inch thick.,
Separate your hair into 3 equal sections, and do a weave braid.,
Tie your braid off.",How to Do Micro Braids2," Start by sectioning off a ¼ inch section of hair at the nape of your neck for braiding first. Use your sectioning tool to create the layer at the nape of your neck. Clip the rest of your hair up so that it stays out of your way while you braid. You will put braids in this section of your hair first, and then you will section off another ¼ inch above the layer at nape of your neck and braid that section next. You’ll repeat the process by section until your whole head is braided.This section method will help ensure that the hair for each of your braids is about the same length. This will also help make your braids more even.

, Start at the far left or right side of the section at the nape of your neck, and with the tip of your comb, section off that piece of hair. You can also use the end of a bobby pin or a pen with cap to make a neat section about ¼ inch wide by a ¼ inch tall.

Try to find a section of hair that is mostly even at the tips.

, Braid your hair by braiding the left strand over the center strand and then right strand over center strand all the way down the hair. Pull your hair horizontally as you go to ensure the braids are secure and to keep the hair from slipping. But do not pull so tight that it strains at your scalp. Your head should not be in pain from the braids.

If you have long nails, it may be helpful to clip them, or have someone else with shorter fingernails braid the hair for you. Because braiding these tiny braids with long fingernails can be difficult.
Towards the end of the braid, hair may be in short supply, and strands will often become very thin. Depending on your preferences, you may stop braiding when there is not enough hair for you to braid, or you can move some hair from a larger strand to the thinning strand.

, At the end of your braid, use a small elastic hair tie to tie it off. Elastic hair ties that are slightly smaller in circumference than a dime and are made of a rubbery substance work best. Wrap the tie around the end of the braid several times until it is snug and secure on the end of the braid.

You can leave your braids in during showers and swimming.
Be careful, if you use heat on your hair, do not heat the band and accidentally melt it on the end of your braid.

Clean up the braids with your scissors.,
Continue sectioning and braiding using a brick pattern.",How to Do Micro Braids3," You should start with the hair in front/above your ear on the right side of your head. Spraying water on your roots will make it easier for you to part your hair into clean sections. You don’t have to spray water on the strand of hair, just at the root., Once again, start with the hair in front/above your ear on your right side. Use your sectioning tool at the end of your comb or a bobby pin to make a square that is even on both sides., Use the front part of your comb to gently detangle your hair so that it smooth and ready to be braided. Put a small amount of hair gel on the midsection and tips of your hair. The gel is going to help keep your hair smooth inside of the braid. , Pick off a piece and divide the piece of synthetic hair into two pieces. You should make one piece a third of the thickness of the strand and the other piece should then be two thirds of the thickness of the strand., Then bring the the ⅓ piece around together so that you have three equal parts of synthetic hair that are the same length and thickness.

To make your micro-braids longer, take the two strands of hair, the ⅓ and ⅔ strands, and hold them both at the ⅓ mark, instead of at the half, so that the hair will hang down longer. Then wrap the ⅓ thickness strand of synthetic hair around the ⅔ strand of hair at the same ⅓ point on both strands. This will make your strands longer.

, You should have three strands of hair, and you should put your left index finger in between the two strands of hair that was the ⅔ piece, and make a fist with that hand. A V of the synthetic hair should be between your index finger and the point where the two strands are wrapped around each other. Then with your three fingers, thumb, forefinger, and middle fingers, of your right hand, hold the remaining strand of hair that was wrapped around the ⅔ strand so that it is secure., Twirl your right hand so that your hand is under the V. Going underneath the V, you should put your right index finger into the space where your left index finger is. With your right hand, pinch the strand of hair farthest from you in the V with your thumb and forefinger. Your left hand is now free.

Keep the hair strands that are now correctly positioned in your right hand secure.

, Put your right hand holding the synthetic hair up as close to the root of your head as you can. With your left hand, pull the real hair for the section you are braiding so that it is taught but not tense. Then with your right hand, pinch the real hair with your index finger and thumb, and add it to the synthetic strand., This position will help you work with both of your hands at the root of your braid., With your left hand, take the strand of the hair extension on the outside of your hand, and move it over your right hand so that it is close to the side of you head. Then rotate your right hand with your two strands of hair so that they cross and create a V. At the tip of the V, with your left hand, grab the bottom strand, and add it to your left hand, but keep the pieces separate.

If you are braiding your hair and it hurts, loosen your grip. If you braid your hair too tight it can cause hair damage and hair loss., Every time you have two pieces of hair in one hand, you will rotate your hand in the direction of the hand they are in (right hand rotates right and left rotates left), crossing the hair so that it creates the V. Then you will insert your index finger of your other hand in the middle of the V and grab the bottom piece.

Once you have braided the hair enough times in this way and your braid is secure, you can move your left arm from behind your head. Keep braiding you hair normally all the way down to the bottom of your hair.
To braid it normally, move the right strand over center then left over center all the way down the hair to the end.
When passing the strands between your hands, make sure to keep the strands separate unless you are adding hair to make one strand thicker.

, If you notice you are coming to the end of the braid and one strand of the braid becomes shorter than the others, pinch off a few pieces of hair from another strand, and add it to the short strand. Keep braiding it all the way down., If you want to secure the end of your hair, you can make a slipknot. When you get to the end of your braid, make sure you have a good hold on the end of the hair with the index and thumb of your right hand.

Grab a few of the synthetic hairs with your left hand to make a tie out of. Get enough to make a thin tie but not so few hairs that they could easily break.
Loop the tiny strand over the inside of your right index finger that is holding the braid secure on the right side of the braid so that it comes all away around the finger. Then put your thumb inside the loop with your index finger.
Bring the hair around the other side of the braid so that it wraps around the braid like a tie, and pinch the small section hair with your thumb and index finger, and bring the piece of hair through the inside of the loop to secure it in a knot.
Repeat this process with that strand of hair 3-4 times. Then you can take half of the tiny strand that makes the knot, and make the slipknot 1-2 more times using the same process so that the braid is secure. If the braid becomes less straight due to tying the knot, gently pull down on the braid to straighten it out.

, Snip off the remaining hairs that are sticking out of the braid at the sides. Use your scissors and clean up the edges of the braid where there are stray pieces of hair sticking out.

If you still have hairs sticking out, you can use hair gel to the ends of the braids to make the hairs slick to the braids.

, While you are sectioning your hair, make a pattern so that after your first row you stagger the sections like bricks. So that above each parted section of hair there are two parted sections above/below on either side. This will help your hair look more full because you won’t be able to see as much of your scalp when the braids are laying flat on your head. Make braids around your whole head using the brick pattern. This process could take several hours if you are new to micro braiding.Ask someone to help you with the braids at the back of your head.
Practice makes perfect. These braids can be difficult to get the hang of at first, but be persistent because the experience and effort will pay off if you keep practicing.

Comb hair and part.,
Create a side french braid.,
Braid all the way down.,
Repeat this process on the other side.,
Fold french braid under.,
Secure any loose pieces.",How to Do Different Braids1," This braid updo is perfect for short hair, which is often difficult to braid. Before you begin braiding you'll want to comb your hair out and part on the usual side.;
, If your part is on the right side, take a small portion of hair on the right side of your part and begin doing a french braid (do the opposite if your part is on the left side).

To french braid, begin by braiding your hair as usual, separating it into three equal parts, but as you go along, add strands to your previous three strands. Once you have started your traditional braid, pull a strand of hair from the right of the outside of the braid and add it to the right strand in the braid, and continue to do this with the left and right strands of hair around the braid to create a french braid.

, You'll continue to french braid the hair on the side of your part until you get to the bottom of your hair. You should have a french braid that is about half of your hair. Tie this with an elastic., You'll create the same type of side french braid again, but this time on the opposite side of your part. After you have braided down to the end of your hair, secure with an elastic. You should have two, relatively equal side french braids, creating two pigtails., Take the end of one french braid and fold it underneath your braid on the back of your head, so that you can't see the elastic. Use a bobby pin or two to secure it to your head. Then, repeat on the other side.This look would be difficult to do with long hair, as there will be too much leftover braid to pin under the french braids along your head.

, After you have pinned your hair up, you'll want to bobby pin any parts of your braid that are sticking up or are loose on your head. This helps create a clean look. If you are going for a messier look you can loosen the braids or leave any stray pieces unattended."

French braid as you continue to gather more hair.,
Divide the top left strand in half as you go.,
Continue to braid along your hair.,
Unpin front hair.",How to Do Different Braids2," The waterfall braid is a whimsical braid that creates a waterfall look along your hair. To begin creating this braid, comb and part your hair as usual and then separate a front section of hair on each side of your part and pin it away from the rest of your hair. This hair will not be part of the waterfall braid.

If you want all of your hair around your face to be part of your braid, disregard the previous step. Leaving hair out of the braid is helpful if you have bangs or if you want some pieces of your hair to fall around your face.

, Take a good portion of hair on the side of your part with the most hair and separate it into three sections. Then, begin braiding hair as you would in a traditional braid, making one or two stitches., Once you have begun a traditional braid, you'll then turn the braid into a french braid by adding strands of hair to the right section of your braid and braiding it as such, moving in a horizontal direction across your head., This is where the french braid becomes a little different than normal. Usually in a french braid you will gather extra hair from the left side of your braid and combine it with the left section of the hair going into your braid as you do with the right side. With this braid, though, as you braid the left strand of hair into the braid, you will split it in half and only braid half of it into your hair.So basically, begin french braiding your hair, and as you go, gather extra hair on the right side of the braid to add to the braid. As you are about to braid the left section of hair into your braid, split it in half and leave one half of the hair down, and then braid the other half into the braid. As you go along, your hair will have long strands that stand out from the rest of your hair, which is what creates the waterfall look.
Be careful when doing this step that you don't forget to split the left strand. It can be easy to methodically french braid your hair, so make sure you remember to leave half of the left strand out as this is key to the waterfall look.

, You'll continue to braid your hair this way, angling your braid in a down diagonal (it should naturally angle this way) until you reach the opposite side of your head. Once you get to this point, braid your hair as a traditional braid, leaving some strands out to create a messier look. Then, secure with an elastic at the end of your hair., After you have finished braiding your hair, you will unpin the front of your hair to create a finished look. This type of braid looks good if it is somewhat messy, so you might consider pulling some hair out from your braid to create a looser look."

After you have brushed your hair forward, gather a portion of your hair at the crown of your head and start a french braid, braiding towards the right side of your head.Make sure you gather hair just on top of your head. You don't want to gather hair at the front of your face, or too much hair at the back of your head, as you'll need this hair as you begin to spiral the braid.

, Take the portion of hair you have begun braiding and continue braiding towards the front of your hairline, gathering the hair at the front of your head and pulling it into your braid. This creates a halo look at the front of your face., As you braid across your head, you should end up on the left side of your head. From there you will continue to french braid around your head, gathering the rest of your hair that is down into the braid. Continue to do this until you have braided all of your hair and secure with a clear elastic., As you finished braiding, you should have ended up with a loose braid on the right side of your head. Take this braid and loop it up towards the top of your head, combining it with the halo at the front of your face. Pin with a few bobby pins to secure it to your other braid., Your final step in creating a spiral braid is to tuck the end of your loose braid into the braid along your hairline. Try to hide the elastic and the ends of your hair in the existing braid, and secure with a bobby pin. Then, admire your look!"

To begin this fun look, you'll want to part your hair from your hairline down the center to the nape of your neck. Then, separate the two sides of the part., Start at the nape of your neck on the left side, and french braid upwards (which is an inverted braid), around your hairline, next to your ear, using all of your hair on the left side of your head., You'll continue to french braid along your hair line, reaching the hairline at the front of your head, and then french braiding along the right side of your head until you have reached the nape of your neck. Then, braid the rest of your hair into a regular braid and secure with an elastic., Taking the braid you just finished, loop it around your head and secure a few parts of the braid to the halo braid on your head.

To start this braid off you'll need to flip your hair over, and brush out your hair., Next, start with a small, middle section of hair at the nape of your neck and begin to french braid up your hair, creating a somewhat thin french braid along the back of your head until you reach the crown of your head.You want this french braid to be somewhat small, because you want it to blend in somewhat with the rest of your hair. A very thick french braid will stick out from the rest of your head and could look weird from the side.

, Once you have reached the crown of your head, stop braiding, and secure the end of your braid with an elastic. You'll then have a large portion of hair left that is not braided., Taking the hair leftover from your braid and the rest of your hair on your head, pull it to the top of your head and wrap around the elastic you previously used, creating a bun. Secure with bobby pins or another elastic., After you've secured your hair, flip your head back over and you should have a nice french braid on the back of your head with a neat bun to top it off. If you find your hair bun is too tight, you can always loosen it up by pulling hair loosely on the sides of your head."

Finish the last bow.",How to Do Different Braids6," This braid is a fun, youthful hairstyle that is somewhat advanced and so it may require more time to create a nice look. First, begin by creating a specific part in your hair. Starting at the end of your right eyebrow, draw a line up to your hairline, and begin parting hair along a diagonal across the top of your head. Then, when you are about an inch away from your other ear, draw a straight line above your ear to the end of your other eyebrow., After you've created this part, you will gather the hair that was sectioned off from the part into a bun at the top of your head to separate it from the rest of your hair. This will be the part of your braid that creates the bows., Starting at the top of your right ear, french braid hair from the right side of your head, along the back of your head, until you reach your left ear. You'll french braid all of your hair, so once you are done you should end with a regular french braid that is just sloped at a diagonal. Secure the end of your braid with an elastic., Next, you'll take the hair you previously secured from your part and remove the elastic from it, letting it fall down. Then, spritz hair with water to dampen it, or you can use a little bit of hair gel so that it is easily workable. Brush hair out afterwards to smooth it out., Take a loose bobby pin (one that is not completely closed together but creates more of a V shape) and stick it under the first stitch that you made in your french braid. Make sure the loop of the bobby pin is on the left side of the stitch, and the open ends are on the right side., With the loose hair on the left side of your head, take a small strand and create a loop. Then, slide it through the top of the hair pin and grab the loop on the other side of the pin with your fingers., Gently pull the bobby pin you used through the stitch in your braid, holding the loop in your hair loosely in your fingers. As you slide the bobby pin out of the stitch, the loop in your hair should pull through the stitch, creating another loop on the other side. This should create the bow look.

Once you have created the bow, you will have a loose end of the strand of hair sticking out of the braid, and that is okay. This loose end will be covered up by the next bow that you create.

, Using the same bobby pin, you'll once again pull it through the first stitch, and then loop a strand of hair through the bobby pin. Then, you'll again pull the bobby pin out creating a bow with each side of the bow on each side of the stitch.Make sure as you go along that you are taking the right amount of hair to use as a bow. You want to have as much hair as you need to create bows all along your hair, so as you go along, just make sure you are using an adequate amount of hair.
You may want to spritz hair as you go so that it is smooth and easy to work with.

, Your last bow should slide into the last stitch of your braid that actually rests on your head. You won't have any bows going down the part of your braid that is the traditional braid (the ""tail"" of the french braid). After you have finished, applaud yourself for doing an advanced hairstyle!"

You can also use any other cream you'd normally use for making corn rows.;
, Purchase some braiding hair or Marley hair. Select a thick strand, find the center, then place it behind the section of natural hair. You will have three strands of hair: a left synthetic strand, a center natural strand, and a right synthetic strand.Make sure that the hair you are using is synthetic.

, Cross the left strand over the middle one, then cross the right strand over the middle one. Keep braiding, making the stitches nice and right, until you run out of natural hair to braid. You will be left with two strands of synthetic braiding hair., Twist each strand of synthetic hair clockwise form two ropes. Next, twist the two ropes together counterclockwise to form a thicker rope. Do this for a few stitches, then stop.If the hair is very slippery and does not have a lot of texture to it, it may unravel during the next step. Secure it with a small hair elastic.

, Hold the first 1½ inches (1.91 centimeters) of the synthetic strand against your braid. Make sure that the tip of the synthetic hair is pointing down towards the end of the braid, and not up towards your scalp.Secure the strand with a small hair elastic, if needed.

, Hold the 1½-inch (1.91-centimeter) tip of the synthetic strand against your braid with one hand. Use your other hand to wrap the rest of the strand around braid and tip tightly. Start at your root, and continue downwards until you run out of hair to wrap.Overlap the hair slightly as you wrap so that you have no gaps.

, Hold the first 1½ inches (1.91 centimeters) of the new strand against the rest of your hair section. Secure it with a small hair elastic, if needed, then wrap the rest of the strand downward.

Trim the excess hair from the bottom of the core with a pair of scissors. Do not cut the hair you were wrapping with just yet.

, Wrap the synthetic hair downwards until it covers the core hair completely. Trim it off using a razor comb, then wrap it back upwards until you have nothing left to wrap with.You don't have to use a razor comb, but it will give you a nicer finish.

, Turn on a lighter and pass it up and down the length of your faux loc. If using fire around your faux hair makes you nervous, use a drop of nail glue instead., This process can take a while, so it would be a good idea to get some help or take lots of breaks.

, Buy some braiding hair that has a water wave texture. Select a thin strand, find the middle, then hold it behind your first braid, about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) above the root., You should have three strands: a left synthetic strand, your natural braid, then a right synthetic strand. Braid these strands together until you reach the end of your natural braid., Split the synthetic hair into three sections, then braid them together for about 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters). You can also simply twist the two strands into a rope braid instead., Buy a package of pre-made faux locs. Slide a crochet hook or a latch hook through the base of your braid, close to the root.

, Give the loop a slight twist first, then slide the hook under the braid. Use the hook to catch the rest of the faux loc. Hold the loop with your fingers, then slide the faux loc through the loop.

Wash your hair with clarifying shampoo.Hair loaded down with heavy residue and debris can be hard to braid smoothly and even harder to un-braid when the time comes.,
Apply a detangler or conditioner.,
Dry your hair.,
Gently detangle your hair.,
Divide your hair into four sections.,
Take a pinch of hair from the first section.,
Secure synthetic hair to this pinch, if desired.,
Braid the first pinch.,
Decide whether or not to tie your braids off.,
Repeat for the rest of your hair.,
Cover your braids with a silk or satin scarf at night.,
Wipe your braids down with witch hazel astringent.Box braids can feel incredibly heavy when wet, so a simpler way to keep the braids looking clean is to wipe them down a couple of times each week with a cloth soaked in witch hazel.,
Wash the scalp with a concoction of regular shampoo and water.,
Massage natural oils into your scalp.,
Take the braids out within two months.,
Unwind the braids with your fingers.",How to Do Box Braids," A clarifying shampoo is more effective at stripping away excess residue than most standard shampoos.


This is especially important if your hair is coated in impurities like waxes, thick oils, and chlorine. Build-up of these substances can make your hair feel brittle, like straw, and may make it difficult for you to condition your hair.
If your hair is especially dry, however, and you worry about drying your hair out further with a clarifying shampoo, you can still use a standard shampoo.;
, You need to lock as much moisture into your hair as possible, so a conditioner is a good idea. A detangling conditioner or a moisturizing detangling spray is even better, though, since it also makes your hair smoother and easier to braid without knotting.


If you want to reduce the pH of your detangler and stretch it out further, you can dilute it with distilled water, aloe vera juice, apple cider vinegar, almond oil, or castor oil. A water-based substance, including juice and vinegar, should be mixed in a one to one ratio with your detangler. And oil should be mixed one part oil to three parts detangler.

, Before you can put box braids into your hair, you should make sure your hair is relatively dry. You can use a hair dryer or you can air dry your hair, depending on your preferred method.

, Use a wide-toothed comb to brush all knots out of your hair, making it as smooth as possible. Hair that is smooth with thoroughly separated strands will be easier to braid.


Your hair absolutely must be detangled from root to tip. Otherwise, when you try to remove your braids, your hair will only become more tangled and matted. When tangles and mats occur, you increase the risk of breakage and splitting.

, You should create four box-like sections: at the front left, the front right, the back left, and the back right. Leave the first section you plan to work on undone, but use a three large hair clips to keep the remaining three sections out of the way.


The sections do not need to be “box-like,” per se, but they need to be evenly divided sections with clearly defined edges.
If you cannot divide your hair into sections using only your fingers, use a wide-toothed comb to help you. Avoid fine-tooth combs, though, since these are more likely to cause knots and mats.

, Traditional box braids are pretty small, so all you need to do in order to get enough hair for the braid is to pinch a small section between your index finger and thumb.


Most people find it easiest to start at the front section on your non-dominant side, but the choice is up to you. Similarly, it's recommended that you start with a pinch of hair toward the front of your chosen section for increased ease.
You will also need to make sure that all future pinches use the same amount of hair. Otherwise, your box braids will look uneven.

, You can do box braids with either real, natural hair or extensions. If you plan to use synthetic extensions, now is the time to wrap a section of synthetic hair into your actual hair.Peel away a pinch of synthetic hair from the package. You can stretch the synthetic hair to help make it longer and more natural looking, and you can also trim it to a shorter length if desired.
Bend this pinched portion of synthetic hair in half, forming a horseshoe or upside-down u-shape.
Separate your pinch of real hair into three sections. The center section should be just barely thicker than the left and right sections.
Place the bend of the extension over the center section of your real hair. The ends of the extension should overlap with the right and left sections of your real hair.
Make a single braid with your hair in this manner. Cross the left section under the center section. Then, pull the right section under the center section, completing a single braid.
The extension should be secure now. Redistribute the hair in this pinched-off portion to create three sections equal in thickness and length.

, You need to divide your first pinch of hair into exactly three sections as you braid. Doing so creates smoother, neater braids that will be vastly easier to remove afterward.


Braid or continue braiding your hair by continually bringing the left sub-section of hair under the center section, followed by bringing the right sub-section of hair under the new center section.
Braid your hair all the way down to the end of the pinched section.Add more extensions, if needed. If your first batch of synthetic extensions does not give you the length you desire, you can braid more of the extension hair into the section as soon as you feel the braid becoming thinner. Add the new portions of extension hair to the existing braid by braiding them in using the same technique you used at the start of the braid.

, These braids are tight enough to stay put on their own without the use of hair elastics, but if you want extra security, you can wrap a small hair elastic at the bottom of the braid. This can be especially helpful if your hair is fairly smooth instead of thick and kinky.


Note, however, that using hair elastics can cause split ends and damage to your hair, so you should avoid using them when possible.
You can also ""seal"" the ends of synthetic and natural hair by quickly dunking the loose ends into boiling water. Burning off the ends with a lighter or braid sealer is another way to seal the ends. Just make sure to cut above the sealed area of the braid when taking your braids out in order to unbraid them easily.

, At this point, you've completed one braid. The rest of your braids should be created in the exact same manner, so repeat this procedure until your entire head of hair has been braided.


Each pinched-off section of hair should be roughly the same length. Otherwise, your braids may look uneven by the time you finish them.
Braiding a whole head can range from 4-12 hours, according to Breanna Rutter of HowToBlackHair.com, to complete in one sitting. This time depends on your skill level/speed or that of a stylist, the number of boxes/braids you desire, the length of the braids, and whether or not you choose to braid in extensions. Other factors that may affect the time of the braiding process could be certain techniques you may want to use, such as Yolanda Renee in her Poetic Justice Braids tutorial on Youtube, or mixing in colored extensions to spice up the look of your braids.
Take your time. This process is a lengthy one, but you can make it even longer if you rush your way through the braids and have to redo them.

, This is not strictly necessary, but doing so can prevent your braids from getting frizzy or from attracting lint.


Tie the scarf around your braids at the scalp. If your braids are longer than the scarf itself, you can loosely pin the braids up before wrapping the scarf, effectively shortening them while you sleep, or leave the ends exposed.
Alternatively, you can sleep on a satin pillow to minimize frizziness in a similar manner.

,


Dampen a clean washcloth with warm water and dab the witch hazel over the cloth thoroughly.
Part your hair and wipe the scalp down in sections.
After your scalp is clean, quickly rub the washcloth over the braids individually. You do not need to scrub the braids; a quick wipe is more than enough.
This is optional, but if you decide to do this, you should cleanse your braids about once a week or so.

, This prevents creating lots of bubbles so you don't have to put a lot of water in your hair to wash them out. Wash your hair whenever it feels itchy or dry.


Focus your efforts completely on the scalp, especially if you use the witch hazel on your braids. Shampoo and water are necessary components of a clean, healthy scalp, but the astringent should take care of the braids for the most part.
Every two weeks, however, you should also try to wash the braids themselves.
Additionally, keeping water off the ends of your braids will keep the three separate section of hair separate and distinct, so it will be easier to remove the braids when the time comes.

, Keep your scalp moist and hydrated by massaging a natural, organic oil into it twice weekly. Coconut oil, almond oil, and shea butter are among the best types.


Part the braids away to reveal your scalp. Using a cotton pad or cotton ball, or clean fingers, rub a generous dab of oil over your scalp in sections. Try to cover as much of the scalp as possible without getting any oil onto the braids.

, Your braids can usually last for six to eight weeks, but even if they still look great past that point, you should still take them down to avoid causing long-term damage to your hair.


Keeping your hair braided for too long can encourage it to break away from the scalp, even causing long-term damage to the hairline.
Additionally, hair sheds on a daily basis. With your hair in braids, the loose strands coil around healthy, attached hair, creating mats.

, Undoing your braids can take as long as putting the braids in, but if you braided carefully, your hair should not be too tangled and the braids should unwind with only a little pressure from your fingertips.


Avoid using a fine-tooth comb when taking your braids down. Since the gaps between the teeth are so narrow, your hair can tangle easily, and you might accidentally end up causing knots at the ends of your hair. These knots can rip and break, creating split ends.
You can also ask friends or family to help with the unbraiding process in order to cut down the time and effort needed. It doesn't take any skill to unbraid, as long as no one damages your hair.
If you had extensions in your hair, it is very easy to remove them. Just unbraid a braid all the way up to where the extension was braided in. Unbraiding should allow it to easily come out. Make sure to throw away the extensions when you're done with them.

Drape the front sections over your shoulders and keep the back section behind your shoulders so that the sections don’t mix., Take one of the front sections of hair and divide it into three equal strands. These will be the strands that you braid together to create the Dutch braid.

Then take the strand on the other side and cross it over the middle strand as well. This is the most common type of braid that many are familiar with., Instead of repeating the same type of stitch, instead take a small portion of hair from the back section of hair and add it to the top strand of the section you are braiding. Make one stitch of a braid, incorporating the piece from the back section of hair.


The Dutch lace braid differs from the French braid because instead of adding hair to all strands of the section, you only add hair to one strand of the braid.

Make sure that the section in the back is parted straight, as the part may be visible., Flip the two side sections of hair over your shoulders and out of your way.

Then do one stitch of the braid, incorporating this hair., For the next stitch, add hair from the other section of hair into one strand of your braid. For instance, if the last time you added hair from the left section, this time add hair from the right. Create one stitch of the braid.

Use a detangling spray to help detangle knotted hair.;
, Use a fine-toothed comb to make a horizontal line from the top of one ear, across the head, to the top of the other ear. To make the braid thicker, create a part further from your forehead. To make the braid thinner, create a part closer to your forehead.

, From the part line, comb the hair forward. Use a hair clip or ponytail holder to secure the back portion of the hair. This hair will not be needed for the french braid headband. You will be braiding the hair in front of the part line., Decide which side you would like the braid to begin. It does not matter which side you begin the braid. At that end, pick up a small portion of hair and divide it into three equal sections., Using only the portion of hair in front of the part, start a regular three-strand braid. Do the first two stitches of the braid like a regular three-strand braid. Cross the right strand over the middle strand and then cross the left strand over the new middle strand., Using only the hair in front of the part line, add a small amount of hair to the front and back strands of the braid. Do not add any hair to the middle strand., Now that you have added new hair to the strands, you can continue to braid the hair by adding two more stitches to the braid.

Use the handle of a rat-tail comb to create a neat, even part.Choose a side to start with, then clip the other one out of the way.;
, Gather three thin sections from your hairline, like beginning a regular French or Dutch braid. Each section should be no thicker than ½ inch (1.27 centimeters).








Make sure that the sections are pointing towards the back of your head and not the floor.

, This is just like Dutch braiding or Reverse French braiding. Instead of crossing the strands over the middle one, you'll be crossing them under. This is very important. If you don't do this, then the boxer braids will end up too flat.








, Gather a thin strand of hair from your hair line or part (depending on which side you started on). Make sure that the strand is no thicker than ½ to ¾ inch (1.27 to 1.91 centimeters). Add the strand to the left section.







, Give the left and middle sections a gentle tug to make them as tight as comfortable. Smooth down any stray hairs with your fingers.








, Gather a ½ to ¾-inch (1.27 to 1.91-centimeter) thick strand from your hairline/part. Add it to the right section, and cross it under the middle one.








, Continue gathering thin strands of hair from your hairline/part and adding them to the left and right sections. Cross the left and right sections under the middle one. Try to keep the braid between your ear and center part, and angle it towards the center of your nape.









The tighter you braid, the better. Don't worry, you can loosen the braids up at the end.

, Once you reach the nape of your neck, you will run out of hair to gather into your left and right sections. Instead, continue doing a regular braid. Remember to cross the left and right sections under the middle one. Stop braiding when you have about 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) of hair left.







, If you have very dark hair, you can use a black elastic instead. You can also use a colored elastic for something more fun.








, Use the same technique as before. This time, begin by crossing the right strand under the middle one. Continue adding thin sections of hair to each strand when crossing it over. When you reach the nape of your neck, finish off with a regular braid.







, For a boho-chic look, gently tug on the outer loops of your braid to loosen them. If you want to, you can also muss up the hair at your temples. Set the style with a light misting of hairspray."

Continue doing this process until you’ve run out of hair.",How to Do a Pull‐Through Braid," Pull back the section of hair at the very top of your head. You can pull it straight back or leave a part if you prefer. Tie it into a ponytail. Because you will be working with multiple ponytails and it can get a bit confusing, this will be referred to as Ponytail #1.





;
, Grab the entire ponytail and bring it toward your face. It will be hanging right in front of your eyes, but don’t worry – it’s only temporary! Clip your ponytail here so that you can work with the rest of your hair without it getting in the way.







, Grab hair on either side of the first section. Bring it towards the back, securing it with a hair elastic into Ponytail #2. It should be directly below the base of Ponytail #1., Split the ponytail right down the middle so that you have a left and right section. Pull Ponytail #2 straight through the two sections of Ponytail #1 so that it’s going toward your face. Just like you did with Ponytail #1, secure Ponytail #2 toward your face with a hair clip so that it is out of the way., Section more hair from the sides, bringing it to the back of your head. This time, include all of the hair from Ponytail #1 as well. Use a hair tie to create Ponytail #3, right below the base of Ponytail #2.







, Just like you did before, divide this ponytail into two equal sections of hair. Take Ponytail #3 up through those two sections and clip it forwards again. Now, you will probably start seeing the pattern you use to create this “braid.”







, Again, gather your hair from the sides of your head and pull it to the back. Include the hair of Ponytail #2. Secure this ponytail with another clear elastic. Once that ponytail is secured, unclip Ponytail #3 from the top of your head. Split Ponytail #3 into two sections, bring Ponytail #4 up through the middle, and clip it to the top of your head.







, Once you’ve reached your neck, secure all of the hair (except the clipped up section) into a low ponytail. Let down the clipped section so that you’re left with two ponytails, which will be used to create the tail part of your braid., After you’ve “braided” to the nape of your neck and secured your hair into low ponytails, you want to go back and create the volume that makes this braid so big. Gently pull on the loops of hair you created when you split each ponytail into two sections. You want to loosen them carefully so they aren’t pulled tightly against your head.







, After you’ve pulled on the loops in order to loosen up the strands of hair, gently pull them outwards to add volume. In other words, the loops should be loosened up so that you can pull them wide. The larger your loops become, the thicker and more voluminous your hair will look in this braid.







, This step is optional. After you’ve tugged and fluffed the loops so that you’re satisfied with how they look, it can be helpful to secure them a bit with some hairspray. This will help hold your braid in place all day, and it can also help reduce flyaways.







, As you begin the tail of your braid, you should be starting with two low ponytails at the nape of your neck. You will be finishing the tail of your braid using the same method you used for the beginning of your braid. Pull the lower ponytail through the two sections of the upper ponytail, clipping it out of the way.








Clip your lower ponytail carefully so you don’t mess up the section of your braid that is already completed. You can even hold it in your mouth if that is easier than using a hair clip.

, After you’ve pulled your lower ponytail up through the two sections of the upper ponytail, bring these two sections back together. Secure them into a ponytail with yet another elastic. Unclip or let go of the clipped up ponytail, which is now on top.







, Split the top ponytail into two sections. Bring the bottom ponytail through the two sections and clip it out of the way. Secure the two sections back together into a ponytail. Secure the end with one hair elastic and examine your work. Loosen up any pieces that look tight or flat, and you’re all set!

The precise width of the strand will vary depending on factors like the thickness of your hair.

, After brushing out your hair, pull it into a ponytail again and secure it with a hair tie. If you want, you can then loop the ponytail into a bun and secure it with hair clips and/or another hair tie.Keep in mind that a ponytail is a more traditional Jedi style, but some people like to add some variation with a bun.

However, freshly washed hair can actually be more difficult to work with because it’s silky and slippery. Try creating the Dutch Mohawk braid on second or third day hair. The natural oils will make the hair easier to handle., You don’t want any sort of part in your hair. The Dutch Mohawk braid will be going straight back on your head, so use a paddle brush or a comb to brush it all back to start.Giving your hair a thorough brush is beneficial regardless, because you want your hair to be smooth and tangle-free., This braid will be going down the very center of your head like a Mohawk – hence the name. Grab a chunk of hair in the very middle of your forehead. Basically, pick up the section of hair of hair at the front of your head that runs the length of where bangs would run. Hold that in one hand., Hold the first, front section of hair firmly in one hand, and pull it forwards a bit so that you can work with the hair behind it. Carefully grab two more strands of hair directly behind the first, on either side. You will begin your braid with these three strands. Make sure that all of the strands are equal in size.If you want, you can clip up the front section with a claw clip, bobby pins, duck bill clips, or whatever else you have on hand. Then, you can grab the other two strands with ease before releasing the clipped section.

, If you’re familiar with a standard Dutch braid, this won’t be too difficult for you. Don’t worry if you’ve never done a Dutch braid before though, it’s not too difficult. The Dutch braid is very similar to a regular braid, except that the strands are always placed underneath, rather than over top, the other strands.First, cross the right strand underneath the center strand. Reposition your hands as needed so that the center strand is now the right strand, and the right strand is now in the center strand.
Do this again on the other side. Cross the left strand underneath the center strand, moving the center strand to the left.
Repeat this pattern one more time.

, Once you’ve started the braid, it’s time to begin incorporating the rest of your hair. As you pick up a left or right strand to cross it under the center strand of the braid, pick up a bit of hair on the same side. In other words, gather sections of hair on either side of that original front section that you began with, and combine them with the corresponding side strand of the braid., One of the hardest things about the Mohawk braid is braiding in the center of your head, where you can’t really see what you’re doing. With this hairstyle, practice really makes perfect. Keep going, adding sections into your braid until there are no loose pieces around your face. As you get to the ends of your hair, you can more easily see the hair you’re working with., When you get as far down your hair as you want to go, tie it off with an elastic band. If you have very light hair, you may want to use a clear band so it doesn’t distract from the braid. If you want to loosen the braid for a messier effect, you can gently pull on the loops to loosen the braid up.

If you want, you can pull out a few wisps of hair around your hairline to frame your face.

, If you have silky hair that is prone to slipping out of hairstyles, this step is crucial. Hairspray is also helpful if you have flyaways or shorter pieces of hair that tend to come loose. Give your hair a spritz anywhere that needs it, but make sure not to go overboard. You certainly don't want a completely immobile, crunchy braid! Once you're confident that everything is secured in place, you're all set!"

",How to Do a Fishtail Side Braid1," After brushing the hair, make a part on one side of the hair, and then comb the hair towards the opposite shoulder. Gather all remaining hair to the shoulder opposite of the part.


If your part is on the right side, the hair should be over the left shoulder, and vice versa.;
, Take the hair in both your hands and pull it apart into two even sections. Make sure the sections are neat and no hairs are connected between the two parts.

, Holding your hair on the side of your head with both hands, begin the fishtail braid.

A hair tie
Hairspray (optional);
, You want your hair as smooth as possible prior to separating it. Use your brush to smooth out any tangles.If you have any particularly stubborn tangles, pull the difficult hair into a semi pony tail. Then, take your brush and work out the tangles, moving from the bottom of the strand of hair to the top.
If your hair is being particularly stubborn, use a de-tangling spray or gel to help with the process.

, These sections will be braided together in a five strand braid. Grab your hair, and separate it into sections that are roughly equal in size.It can help to split your hair into two sections and then separate from there.
Your hair may not be completely equal. That's okay. As long as one strand is not obviously bigger than the others, your braid will still turn out all right.

, This can help you keep track of the braiding process when you first begin braiding. As your hair begins to weave together, the numbers will matter less, but can be helpful to start.Think of the leftmost strand as strand one. Move to the right, numbering each strand as you go.
Keep numbering until you reach the rightmost strand. This is strand five.

, Remember, strand one is the strand to the left. Strand two is just to the right of strand one, and strand three is just to the right of strand two.It's very important strand one goes over strand two and under strand three and not the other way around.
Strand one should now be nearer to strand five.

, You are more or less repeating the process on the other side. Remember, strand five is the rightmost strand. Strand four is just to the left of strand five.Strand one should be at a sideways angle, near strand five. After passing strand five over strand four, pass it under strand one. You should begin to see the roots of a braid forming.

, Strand two is now the leftmost strand. Strand five is now the second strand to left on the right side. You will repeat the same basic process with strand two that you used to begin your braid.Make sure you remember that you always pass a strand over first, and under second. Over and under is the pattern of the five strand braid.
So, make sure strand two goes over strand three, which is the middle strand, and then under strand five.

, Strand four is now the rightmost strand. It is now closest to strand one and strand two. Moving from strand one to strand two, make sure to weave strand four over and under., As you can see, there is a pattern forming. You alternate between the leftmost and rightmost strand. You always braid into the strands just to the left and just to the right of these strands. Remember the pattern - over and under.Take the leftmost strand and braid it over the first strand to the right, and then under the second strand to the right.
Take the rightmost strand and braid it over the first strand to the left, and then under the second strand to the left.
Continue this process until you have braided all your hair together.

, Hold your hair tight with one hand to prevent it from coming undone. With the other hand, take an elastic band and wrap it around the end of your hair. You have now successfully completed a five strand braid.

, Your hair may be sleeker and softer if you've recently flat ironed or have been to the salon. This type of hair can be more difficult to braid, as it slides around and comes loose easily. Try spritzing a small amount of hairspray onto your hair prior to braiding. This can help the strands become a little coarser and easier to work with., A lot of people prefer the look of a looser braid. However, the best way to achieving this is not to start off with a loose braid. Starting off loose can cause your braid to become undone.Instead, begin with a tight braid. This will make sure your braid stays tight during the braiding process.
Then, loosen the braid when you're finished. You can use your fingers to pull at the braid to create some slack until you have the desired loose effect.

, There is no magic trick to braid successfully. Braiding, especially more complicated forms, takes practice. You have to learn how to maneuver your hands properly to create a neat, tight braid. It may take awhile to successfully achieve a five strand braid."

Braid as many dreads as you want.,
Secure your braids with rubber bands.,
Dry your dreads.,
Remove the braids once your hair is dry.",How to Crinkle Dreads," Dread locks should dry with the braids in place to help the crinkles set. Start by washing your hair as you normally would. When blow drying your hair, only get it about 80% dry. Go into the process with your hair just slightly damp., Take an elastic hair tie big enough to fit around your head. Something like a sweatband or hair band works well. Pull the hair tie over your head so it rests around your neck. Then, push all of your dreads stuck under the hair tie out. Pull your hair tie upward, pushing all your dreads back as you go. When you're done, the hair tie should be loosely wrapped around your dreads, securing them away from your face.The hair tie does not need to be secured tightly. You're going to be removing three dreads from the tie at a time, so it's important it remains loose enough to easily remove your hair.

, One by one, carefully pull out three of your dreads from your hair tie. If you accidentally dislodged more than three dreads, simply push the unneeded dreads back into your hair tie., Take the three dreads you pulled out of your hair. Braid them together into a tight braid. When you're done, push the braid back under the hair tie.If you want, you can secure the braid with a hair tie.

Spritz your dreads to get them slightly damp before continuing the braiding process., The process of braiding your dreads can get lengthy, especially if you have a lot of hair. It can take as long as 35 to 40 minutes to braid all your dreads.If you're short on time, consider only partially crinkling your dreads. Keep braiding until you have as many dreads as you want crinkled., Many dreads are thick enough to stay braided on their own. However, if you notice any dreads becoming unbraided on the ends, loop a small rubber band or hair tie around the dreads. This should keep them in place., Wait until your dreads are dry to remove the braids. Times vary depending on the thickness of your hair and dreads. For very crinkly dreads, you can leave the braids in place overnight or for a few days., Remove the braids one by one. Take off any rubber bands and slowly detangle the dreads from one another. The dreads should all be crinkled slightly from drying while braided.If you want, you can mist your hair with a light layer of hairspray to keep the dreads in place.

Wet your dreadlocks.,
Portion out a small amount of shampoo.,
Work the lather into your scalp.,
Rinse the shampoo through the locks.,
Dry thoroughly.",How to Clean Dreadlocks1," Start by running some water lightly over your dreadlocks in the shower. There’s no need to completely saturate them, as the more water your locks absorb, the harder it will be for the shampoo to infiltrate them. For best results, use warm (not too hot) water.;
, Squeeze a modest amount of shampoo into your palm. It’s better to use a little shampoo at a time so you can control how much soap actually goes into your locks—you can always use more later if it’s not enough. If you’re using a solid bar shampoo, rub it between your hands until it forms a rich lather.Always use a shampoo that doesn’t leave a residue of any kind. Dreadlocks should not be maintained using gels, waxes and other additives, and a residue-forming shampoo will likewise only add to buildup rather than washing it away.
Look for natural, organic types of shampoo that are free of chemicals which help soften and style.

, Press both hands into your scalp and distribute the shampoo into the spaces between the roots of the dreadlocks. Use the tips of your fingers to give your scalp a good scrub to free dead skin and remove excess sebum.Don’t neglect to clean and care for the roots. Since this is where your dreadlocks attach, they need to be strong and healthy.

, Let the shampoo sit for 1-2 minutes. Then, tilt your head downward so that the lather runs through your locks as you rinse. Gently squeeze the shampoo lather into the dreadlocks. Make sure that there’s no shampoo residue remaining in your hair when you’re finished washing.If you want, you can use a little extra shampoo to touch up each lock individually. Just don’t overdo it, or it will be more time-consuming to rinse and cause loose hairs to frizz.

, After you get out of the shower, you’ll want to make sure that you let your dreadlocks dry completely. Squeeze each lock with a towel to press out the water absorbed into them. Allow your locks to air dry, or use a hair dryer on a low heat setting to speed the process along and ensure that they’re not left damp. If too much moisture remains in the locks, they can start to come unlocked and smell, or even grow mold.”Dread rot” is when moisture becomes trapped in the matted hair for so long that it begins to mildew.
As your dreadlocks continue to set up and tighten, you may have to start using a hair dryer more often after washing to ensure that the hair inside the locks is getting dry."

"DO NOT mix together the baking soda and vinegar--baking soda is a base and vinegar is an acid, mixing the two causes a chemical reaction which neutralizes any cleansing power the two substances have on their own (which is a lot).,
In a sink or wash basin, dissolve ¾ cup of baking soda in a few inches of warm water.,
Soak your dreadlocks for 5-10 minutes.,
Rinse with cool water.,
Have ready a large bottle of water and vinegar, mixed at a 3:1 ratio, enough to rinse over your scalp and lightly through your dreads.,
Towel or air dry.",How to Clean Dreadlocks2,", It is completely safe to use on your hair and scalp.If you like using essential oils, you can add them to the cleansing solution during this step. A tablespoon of lemon juice will help kill any odors and prevent mildew.
It is recommended that you only use this method to clean your locks once every couple of weeks, as the baking soda can make your hair dry and brittle over time. For more regular washings, use a residue-free shampoo.

, Submerge your dreadlocks into the baking soda solution up to the roots. Soak your locks for up to 10 minutes, or longer if you’re in need of a deep clean. As your dreadlocks soak, the baking soda will strip away dirt, oil, debris and other unwanted buildup.If you don’t have the time or space needed to soak your dreadlocks, you can mix up the solution and pour it directly over your head for a quick cleanse., Remove your dreadlocks from the baking soda bath and wring out the excess solution. Turn on the faucet or hop in the shower and give your locks a quick rinse to clear away any lingering traces of the baking soda solution or foreign matter. Rinse until the water runs clear. Be sure that your scalp gets some direct exposure to the water as well.The dirt, oil, dead skin and other detritus that’s been removed from your hair will be visible in the discoloration of the water. You might be surprised how much cleaner your locks will feel afterwards!

, Pour this through your locks after rinsing out the baking soda solution. This will neutralize any remaining baking soda, balance the pH of your scalp, and smooth loose hair frizz. You can leave this in (any vinegar smell will dissipate as it dries) or rinse it out., Give your dreadlocks ample time to dry. If you’re in a hurry, use a hair dryer on the ends and shafts of your locks and allow your roots to finish air drying. Your dreadlocks should be dry before you cover them with a hat, tam or scarf. Otherwise, these items will trap remaining moisture in the locks and make it harder for it to escape.Squeeze as much water out of your locks as you can before letting them air dry or trying other drying methods.
Wrapping your dreadlocks in a dry towel can help draw water out of them at a faster rate."
"
Wash your dreadlocks regularly.,
Take care of your scalp.,
Freshen your locks with essential oils.,
Avoid conditioners and similar products.",How to Clean Dreadlocks3," Contrary to popular misconceptions, dreadlocks require washing just as much as other hairstyles. You should aim to shampoo and roll your dreadlocks every three or four days when they’re new. Once they’ve fully locked up, you can get by washing them once a week, or more often depending on your hair type and the amount of oil your scalp tends to produce.Most people who wear dreadlocks wash them at least once a week. If you have particularly oily hair, or if you exercise, work outside, get dirty or sweat a lot, you may benefit from more frequent washings.You can still bathe regularly between washings without having to shampoo your locks.

, Dreadlocks put a lot of weight on the scalp as they get heavier and pull. It’s essential that you keep your scalp clean and moisturized in addition to your locks themselves. Whenever you’re cleaning your locks, take a few moments to massage your scalp vigorously with your fingertips. This promotes proper blood flow and will strengthen the follicles, meaning you won’t have to worry about your locks becoming brittle or falling out.Itching and discomfort can be a sign that your scalp or roots are in poor condition.
As your hair grows, keep your dreadlocks waxed and twisted to tighten up the new growth close to the scalp., Use a couple drops of tea tree, peppermint or rosemary oil along with your shampoo, or treat your locks with them separately. Essential oils moisturize, cut down on itchiness and irritation around the scalp and leave your hair smelling pleasant. They are far preferable to perfumes, spray-in fragrances and scented cleansers, as they won’t damage your locks or leave behind any residue.Just a hint of essential oils can combat the “dirty hair” smell that naturally accumulates on thick dreadlocks.

, Conditioners are designed to soften and detangle hair, which is the last thing you want if you have a head full of dreads. In general, there should be no reason to condition your dreadlocks. You should also be cautious about any other products that contain oils, waxes or knot-fighting agents. Regular use of these products can damage the structure of your dreadlocks and make them much harder to maintain.A good residue-free shampoo, and optionally pure aloe gel and salt-water tightening spray should be all you need to keep your dreadlocks clean and looking great. For dry scalp or dreads, very light applications of coconut oil will help moisturize without conditioning.

Waiting for an outdoor concert to begin.;
, Attempting intimacy always feels awkward when you could fit a car between the two of you, so sit close to her and get cozy. Put your arm around her. Start stroking or playing with her hair. Pay her a compliment about its texture, look, or scent. Be natural about it, so you don’t look like you're trying to force a rehearsed move on her.Keep your eyes on the TV or whatever the two of you are watching at first.
Play with her hair absentmindedly, as if you don’t even know what your hand is doing.
Then act as though whatever it is you compliment suddenly woke you up to what your hand is up to.

, If she’s worn it braided for you before, tell her how much you like it that way. If not, tell her how great you think she’d look. Or, if you know that she enjoys having other people braid her hair as a way of relaxing, simply offer to do it yourself.


If you’re confident about your skill, just offer to do it, plain and simple, to show your confidence, like: ""Hey, how about I braid this for you?""
If you’re unsure, just ask her to teach you. This way she probably won’t mind any mishaps, and you’ll still have an intimate moment together. Say something, ""Hey, why don't you show me how to braid your hair? I always wondered how you do that.""

If your hair is prone to frizz, you may want to work a smoothing serum or hair oil through it before styling.;
, When you’re creating a simple accent braid, you can place it wherever you like. The most common spot for the braid is on one side of your hair, so gather a small section that’s approximately 1- to 2-inches wide (2.5- to 5-cm) in the area where you wish to place the braid.








You can gather a small section of hair right beside your face on either side or take a section that’s a little further back.
You don’t necessarily have to choose a section of hair from the side of your head. An accent braid can look great peeking out from the lower section of your hair at the back too.
You can make your accent braid as wide or narrow as you’d like. You may want to experiment with different sized braids to see what works best with your hair type and texture.
If you want your accent braid to really stand out, consider using color to spice it up. Before you braid the hair, color it with hair chalk. You can also add a small clip-on hair extension in a bold color and braid it instead of your own hair.

, Once you’ve chosen the location and size for the section of hair, create a three-strand braid. Divide the section of hair into three smaller sections, and cross the outside pieces over the center piece, alternating sides each time. Use a hair elastic that’s similar in color to your hair to secure the braid.








If you prefer, you can create a two strand braid by dividing the section into two smaller sections and crossing them over one another until you reach the end of the hair. Give the braid extra flair by twirling the two sections before starting the braid.
A fishtail braid or five strand braid can also work well as a simple accent braid.
After you've created the braid, give it a spritz with hairspray to keep it in place all day.
If an elastic isn't strong enough to secure your braid, you can slip a bobby pin or two into the braid around the elastic to keep it in place.
You can also substitute a clip for the elastic if you prefer.

Finished.

",How to Make a French Braid Headband," This article will not cover these methods extensively.;
, If you have straight or wavy hair this will work best with dry hair. If you have curly hair that cannot be brushed when it is dry, try braiding your hair wet. However, be very gentle as the hair has a tendency to ""snap"" more easily when it is wet.








, You can part it down the middle and do a French braid on both sides.








, Begin two to three inches (5-7.5cm) back on the part, and make sure to have a nice rectangular section of hair. You're going to be braiding the larger section of hair at least (versus the other side of your part).









If you're going to put your hair up into a bun or ponytail, end about two inches (5cm) above your ear and then move forward to create a nice right corner.
If you're going to wear your hair down, end at your ear.

, Just make sure it won't get in the way while you're braiding. Use a loose ponytail if you're going to wear your hair down so that you don't create a lump or crease.








, Starting at the part section off a small rectangular piece and separate it into three pieces. Cross the rightmost over the center. Then add some hair to what used to be the rightmost strand (now center) from the right side. Cross the leftmost over the center. Then add some hair to what used to be the leftmost strand (now center) from the left side.








,









Once you're done with that braid the rest of the hair with a normal braid and secure it at the end with an elastic.

, At this point you can also choose to braid the hair on the other side of your part. Do the following depending on your hair style that day:










Ponytail: Gather your hair into a ponytail, including the braid(s). If the braid becomes bumpy when you put it up, try twisting or bobby pinning it. Secured your ponytail with an elastic and you're done! You can also turn it into a bun. Twist the tail and wrap it around the base of the ponytail. Then pin or use another elastic to hold the bun place.

Down: For a quick fix, just pin the braid(s) back from your face with a bobby pin or clip. To make it quite literally a headband, bring the ends of the braid behind your head and under your hair. Then tie them together with an elastic.

Brush your hair.,
Part your hair.,
Gather all your hair to one side.,
Split the hair into three sections.,
Braid the hair.,
Stop at the desired length.,
Secure the end.,
Tug a few shorter strands of hair out of the bunch if desired.",How to Side Braid Hair1," Begin by brushing your hair thoroughly. Knots and tangles make braiding a lot harder than it should be.;
, Since the side braid look is asymmetrical and on the side of your head, part it to one side. It does not matter if it's the right or the left. The braid is not going to be straight down the back of your head.









If you’re going for a romantic look, allow the part to be messy. If you want to go for something more fun, try a zig-zag part.

, If your part is off to one side, make sure that the hair is on the side farthest from the part. Make sure the shortest pieces aren't too short to braid.









If the part is on the right side, make sure the hair is on the left side. If the part is on the left side, make sure the hair is on the right side.
If your hair is medium length and too short for one side braid, two side braids (i.e. pigtails) might work better. Or try one of these side braids just around the hairline.

, Take the hair into your hands and divide into three even sections.


The area underneath your ear will be the anchor point for your braid, so don’t move the braid around once you get started.

, Starting underneath your ear, braid as you normally would. Grab one of the outer sections and cross it over to the middle, then grab the outer section on the opposite side and pull it to the middle.Repeat, cycling through all three strands over and over again.








, It’s best to stop before strands of your hair become so short that they begin falling out of the sides of your braid.

, When finished, place an elastic band around the end of the braid. Arrange any wisps of hair that are hanging out. Spray with hair spray if desired.


If you want a cleaner look, use spray or pins to secure wisps. If you want a messier, softer look, leave the wisps.

, Letting a few strands frame your face will soften the look, so if you have long side-swept bangs or want a few tendrils to curl out around your neck, separate out those pieces now.

Comb her hair.,
Make a basic braid.,
Be gentle.,
Build on the mood.,
Wind it down.",How to Braid a Woman's Hair on a Date2," Sit behind her with enough space between you so you have room to work. Start from the bottom of her hair and work your way up to gently loosen any tangles. Go slowly, being careful not to pull. Smooth her hair with your palms a few times once you’ve finished.


Use your fingers if there isn’t a comb handy, or if you’d just rather have a more hands-on experience.

, Your main goal here is only to have an intimate moment with your lady, so don’t worry about doing anything too complex. First, separate her hair, or a section of her hair, into three even strands. Let’s call them 1, 2, and 3, from left to right. From there, you can start with either the leftmost strand (1) or the rightmost (3), but let’s say you start with the right strand:Take the rightmost strand (3) in one hand, then cross it over the middle strand (2). Now the strands are arranged like this: 1-3-2, with the original right strand ending up in the middle.
Now cross the left strand (1) over the new middle strand (3). Now the original left strand is in between the others, so they appear as 3-1-2.
Continue crossing the strands in this pattern (right over middle, then left over middle) until you reach the end of her hair.
Always use one hand to handle the strand that you're moving, and your other hand to keep the other two strands separated from it. This way hairs from one strand won't become tangled with another’s.
This may be hard to visualize, so watch a video tutorial if needed to better see how to use your fingers and arrange each strand.
Practicing with three different colors of yarn or similar material is an easy way to master braiding.

, Remember: you’re simply trying to give your lady a pleasurable time, not rush a customer in and out so you can move on to the next. Take your time. Be careful not to pull too hard or tightly on her hair. Work slowly and methodically.


Watch her neck and shoulders to make sure she’s relaxed.
If they tense up, this might mean she’s not enjoying this, or she may be nervous.

, As long as she’s enjoying herself, follow the spirit of the moment. This is about playing around, not hairdressing, so keep it light and playful. Draw it out by taking your time, braiding several sections of hair, and/or undoing your work and starting all over.


If she’s talkative, keep chatting to show off your skill and confidence by doing two things at once.
If she’s relaxed and falls silent, let your fingers do the talking so she can focus on the sensation.

, Leave her hair braided if she wants. If not, undo it by reversing the technique. Then use your fingers to comb her hair out. To keep the physical intimacy going, try:


Moving on to a shoulder or neck massage.
Planting a kiss or two on her head, neck, or shoulders.
Stroking or grazing her fingers over her back or arms.

"
"
Ease into it.,
Start with small touches.,
Stick to neutral areas at first.,
Start early.",How to Braid a Woman's Hair on a Date3," If the two of you have already become physically intimate, this is less of a concern. But if you are on a first date or taking things slowly, respect her personal space and body. Don’t spoil the mood by rushing or forcing physical contact. Wait until the two of you have both grown comfortable with small touches before suggesting something as involved as braiding her hair.How long this takes will depend on the woman in question. She may welcome physical signs of affection right away, or she may need several dates before she feels like she can trust you.
However long it takes, don’t force the issue. Rushing physical intimacy before she’s ready is self-defeating.

, Asking her if she’d like you to braid her hair will probably come across as a weird idea if the two of you haven’t made any sort of physical contact, so set some precedent. When you’re with her, touch her “by chance” or with polite, innocent gestures. Use these moments to judge how comfortable she feels with you. For example, you could:Share an armrest with her in a movie theater so your arms rest against each other.
Tap her arm to direct her attention to something you’re pointing out.
Lightly touch her shoulder to announce your presence if she doesn’t see you coming.

, When you start off making small incidental touches, aim for parts of her body that aren’t too personal, like her hand, arm, or back. Of course, you’re not entitled to touch any part of her unless she’s okay with it, but consider these areas as an innocent place to start trying. As long as she’s fine with it, continue finding excuses to make contact there so she grows accustomed to it without feeling threatened, like:Emphasizing a point you’re making in your conversation by touching her hand.
Guiding her through doors with your hand in the small of her back.
Cupping her elbow to let her know you’re about to turn left or right as you walk together.

, Make physicality a part of your date right from the get-go. Don’t put if off, because this will only build it up into something “big” that will feel more awkward once you do start trying. Start testing the waters at the very start of your first date so touching each other feels perfectly natural.Briefly take her hand between yours as part of your greeting.
Guide her by the elbow for a moment once you start walking.
Offer your hand to help her out of the car.

Curl your hair.,
Part your hair on the side.,
Gather some hair from the side and braid.,
Pull all of your hair back into a ponytail.",How to Create Accent Braids2," When you’re creating a ponytail and accent braid combination, the style will look best if your hair has some texture. Use a curling iron, hot rollers, or your favorite method for curling your hair to add waves and texture before you style it.








Don’t worry about creating perfect curls. It’s okay if they’re a little messy as long as they add texture.
If your hair is naturally curly or wavy, you don’t need to add any texture.
If you prefer, you can leave your hair straight for a simpler look.

, After you’ve curled your hair, decide which side you want to part your hair. Next, use a comb to carefully part your hair on the chosen side, making sure that it looks as neat as possible.







, Once you’ve parted your hair, take a small section of hair from the side that you’ve parted it on. Aim for a section that’s approximately 1-inch (2.5-cm) wide, and create a simple three-strand braid with it. Secure the end of the braid with an elastic.








You can create a larger braid if you prefer. If you have thick, textured hair, a larger section can actually look best.

, After you’ve braided the section of hair, gather up all of your hair, including the braid, and pull it back into a ponytail. Use a hair elastic or clip to secure the ponytail, and spray your hair with a flexible hold hairspray to keep it in place all day.








Once your hair is pulled back into the ponytail, you can remove the elastic from the end of the braid if you’d like.

Pull the top section of your hair hair back and secure.,
Braid the pulled back section.,
Add a braid to the hair that’s left down.",How to Create Accent Braids3," For a classic half up half down style, you need to pull back the top section of your hair. Gather the hair together and secure it in a ponytail at the back of your head with an elastic.








It’s a good idea to brush out your hair before pulling it back so there aren’t any tangles or knots. If your hair is curly, use a comb to detangle so you don't wind up with frizz.
You can take a small section, such as just the hair that will fall into your face if you left it down, or a larger piece, such as the entire top section of your hair.

, For the boldest accent braid, create the braid from the pulled back section. Starting right at the elastic that's holding your hair back, make a simple 3-strand braid and secure the end with another elastic.








You can create a more elaborate braid, such as a fishtail, if you prefer.

, If you want a more subtle accent braid, gather a small section from the hair that you’ve left down instead of braiding the top section that you've pulled back. You can create a 3-strand braid on either side of your hair or put it directly in the back.








As with a simple accent braid, you can give the braid greater impact by coloring it with hair chalk so it really stands out.

Pull your hair back into a high ponytail.,
Separate a small section of hair from the ponytail.,
Curl the ponytail up into a bun without the section that you’ve removed.,
Braid the loose section of hair.,
Wrap the braid around the base of the bun and secure it.",How to Create Accent Braids4," Use a comb or brush to brush your hair back into a ponytail. For maximum impact, place the pony fairly high up on your head and secure it with an elastic.If you prefer a more subtle look, you can place the ponytail at the back of your head or even at the nape of your neck.

, After you’ve secured the ponytail with an elastic, hold the end of it in your hand. Allow one small section to fall loose on one side of the pony so you have hair that you can create a braid with.The section of hair that you separate should be fairly wide. It’s best to use a section that’s at least 1 ½-inches (4-cm) wide.

, With the section of hair that you’ve separated hanging free, curl the rest of the ponytail around the base to form a bun. Use bobby pins to secure the bun in place.







, Once the bun is secure, create a three-strand braid from the section of hair that you separated from it. Secure the end of the braid with a thin hair elastic so it’s easy to hide.








You want the braid to be as thick as possible. If you have fine hair, pull on the sides of the braid gently after it’s secured to make it appear thicker.

, When you’ve finished braiding the section of hair, curl it around the base of the bun. Use a bobby pin or two to secure the braid.








If you want your hair to stay in place all day, spray your bun and braid with a flexible hold hairspray before heading out.

Comb your hair.,
Take a section of hair from behind one ear and braid upward.,
Gather another section of hair from the area where you want the band to rest.,
Connect the new hair with one of the sections in the braid and continue braiding.,
Add a section of hair from the opposite side of the head and continue braiding.,
Work in a section of hair from behind the other ear and finish the braid.",How to Create Accent Braids5," Because you’re leaving your hair down for this style, you want it to look neat and smooth. Brush through your hair with your favorite brush or comb to remove any tangles or knots.This style looks pretty with curly or wavy hair, so you may want to use a curling iron or hot rollers before you begin braiding.

, When your hair is combed out, gather a small section of hair from behind one of your ears. Pull the hair upward and over to the center of your head, and start to create a three-strand braid.








You can make the braid a thick or thin as you’d like, depending on how prominent you want the headband to be.

, When you’ve braided the section enough to reach the center of your head, take another section of hair from along the line where you want the headband to sit. It should be a slightly thinner section than the first one.







, Once you’ve gathered a new section of hair from the center of your head, join it with one of the strands in the braid. Pull the hair tight, and continue braiding across your head.








Work slowly to ensure that the braid stays as neat as possible.

, When you reach the other side of your head, take another section of hair along the line of the headband. Connect it to one of the strands in the braid, and continue braiding.







, Once you reach the end of the braid, gather a section of hair from behind your other ear. Work it into the braid to finish it, and secure the end with a small elastic.








Spray your hair with a flexible hold hairspray to make sure that the braided headband stays in place.

Finish your hair with a normal braid.,
Complete with a hair band.",How to Side Braid Hair2," Before you begin to braid the hair, brush the hair to remove tangles and knots. Decide which shoulder you would like the braid to hang over. Then, brush the hair over that shoulder.









If you want to part your hair, the part should be on the opposite side of your head as your hair. If you hair is going to be over your right shoulder, part it on the left, and vice versa.
If you don't want to part your hair, just brush all of your hair towards the shoulder where your braid will be.

, The braid should be started underneath the ear opposite the shoulder where you’ve gathered your hair. If your braid is going to be over your left shoulder, begin the braid under your right ear. Start by separating a small section of hair from the bottom of the sweep of hair going across the back of your neck.









The goal of this braid is to wrap the side braid around the bottom of your head and over one shoulder for a more romantic, finished look.
Another option is to begin this French braid at the top of your head. This can start at the part line.To begin your braid in this way, follow the same French braiding instructions. The difference will be that you will start the braid a few inches higher on your hair.

, Make sure the sections are even, and begin braiding as usual. Grab one of the outer sections and cross it over to the middle, then grab the outer section on the opposite side and pull it to the middle. Do this only once. Don’t braid any further just yet.








, The rest of the braid will be half a french braid, and you will incorporate more hair into the upper half of the braid. Every time you go to cross one of the high strands down into the middle of the trio, add a section of loose hair from the hair sweeping over your other shoulder before you move it to the middle.









Be sure to add hair from directly above that section of braid so that your hair on the back of your head doesn’t cross all over itself and ruin the design.
Keep the braid tight, but keep the strands separated.By the time the braid reaches the opposite side of your head, it should contain all your hair,not just the little section.
If you are starting the French braid from the top of your head, you will begin by French braiding down, and then when you get around the earline, you will begin braiding in a horizontal line across your head. If your hair is super short, you can stop the side braid at your ear by fastening it with a pin or clip., When you reach the opposite ear, braid the rest of your hair in a normal braid. When you’re done, the braid will start at one shoulder and finish hanging down over the other one.

, Secure the braid with an elastic band. Arrange any wisps of hair and spray with hair spray if desired.


Tug on the braid if you want a messier look. Loosen the braid to the desired size.Tugging the braid gives the illusion of volume for thin hair.

Brush your hair to the side.,
Gather the hair.,
Begin braiding.,
Continue adding hair.,
Finish with a standard 3-strand braid.",How to Side Braid Hair3," Make sure to get out any knots or tangles. Don't part your hair. This style works better with hair swept to the side.


This style works better with longer hair with no layers. Short layers may not stay in the hair when it's swept to the other side of the head.

, You will be starting to braid over the eye opposite of the shoulder you swept the hair over. Grab about a 1-2 inch section. Split this hair into three distinct sections.


If the hair is over the right shoulder, the braid will begin over the left eye, and vice versa.

, Bring the right section under the middle, then bring the left section under the right. Add hair to the middle, which should now be the right section.








A Dutch braid is like the opposite of a French braid. Instead of adding hair and braiding over, you add hair to the strands and then cross under the braid. This places the braid on top of the hair, instead of under like a French braid.

, As you braid, keep adding hair as you cross the strands. Keep the braid close to the hairline along the side of the face. Add hair into the outside of the braid by pulling in hair from the hair sweeping across the back of the head. Do this until you've added all your hair to the braid.








, Once all the hair has been added, just continue braiding with three strands until you run out of hair. Then secure with a hair tie.

Secure with a hair elastic.",How to Side Braid Hair4," Make sure to brush or comb if necessary.









You can place a part in your hair if you wish. If you part your hair on one side of your head, make sure you sweep the hair onto the opposite shoulder.

, Then split the two sections in half so there are four distinct sections.

, This braid can be tricky, so thinking about the hair in parts might help. Number each strand 1-4, left to right. Cross 2 over 1, then cross 4 over 3. Each cross should be right over left. Then, cross 1 over 4, which will be left over right.








Repeat these steps until no more hair is left. Renumber your strands each time you start a new crossover.

, When you have reached the end of your braid, secure it.

You will need at least three inches of hair and a lot of patience. Make sure to keep your hair healthy throughout this process!;
, Thicker dreads become compact much sooner and are easier to maintain, but are harder to brush out if you decide to change your hairstyle. The diameter of a dread is typically no less than half an inch and no thicker than an inch, but it all depends on your hair type and how you'd like them to look.

, Dreading your hair yourself is quite difficult and the results will not be uniform. Get more than one friend if you have extremely long hair.

, You will want to begin with clean, dry hair. It can have been washed a couple of days before, but it should not be completely dirty. Shampoo it beforehand, but do not use conditioner.


It is a myth that dirty hair helps dreads. Grease actually lubricates and prohibits real dread formation. You also don't want to have to work on oily, dirty hair. Instead of having a full head wash, you may want to spritz on dry shampoo a few hours before.

, This may seem like the opposite of what you want to achieve, but it makes it much easier to separate and section off your hair. It also makes your hair a lot easier to work with.

However, it's helpful to have all of these things near you and ready to go as you braid, so you can secure your hair as soon as you're finished braiding.


Often, someone will start a braid only to realize they don't have a tie or pin to secure it, and then they risk messing up their hair when they have to search for something to hold their braid.
Consider keeping a hair tie on your wrist as you braid. That way, securing your braid when you're finished simply requires you to slip the tie off your wrist, rather than changing hands to pick up the hair tie and possibly letting go of the end of your braid.;
, Brush your hair with a bristle hairbrush if your hair is dry, or with a wide-tooth comb if your hair is wet. You want to remove any knots or tangles so your hair is easier to manage while braiding.

Pay special attention to remove knots from the ends of your hair. When you're braiding and collecting sections of hair, separating the sections can be more difficult if the ends are knotted together.

, A waterfall braid with a side part helps add to the cascading waterfall appearance of your braid. By parting your hair in a deep side part, and flipping the parted hair over to the other side of your head, your hair is essentially taking on the nature of a waterfall.You can still braid a cascading waterfall braid on hair that is parted down the middle, however a deep side part adds a nice touch to the braid and enhances the cascading waterfall look by having your own hair ""cascade"" on the other side of your head.

, If you aren’t going for a stylish messy look, a smoothing serum can help keep your hair smooth and manageable while braiding.If your hair is fine, has small, flyaway hairs, or is more than one length, consider applying a styling cream or smoothing serum. A smoothing serum can help tame unruly hairs, and keep stray, flyaway hairs from coming loose within the braid., Your first section of hair should be near your forehead, around the area of your bangs. Usually waterfall braids start out with a section that is about an inch in length, but this section can vary in size depending on how thick you want your braid to start out. The bigger the first section, the thicker the beginning of your braid will look.If you parted your hair with a deep side part, start your braid on the side of your head with the most hair.

, You can do this by running two fingers through the section of hair to make three same sized pieces of hair./images/thumb/2/2c/Make-a-Cascade-Waterfall-Braid-Step-6-Version-3.jpg/v4-550px-Make-a-Cascade-Waterfall-Braid-Step-6-Version-3.jpg

Hand positioning is important when braiding hair. Usually the most successful way to hold hair as you braid, is to hold two portions of hair in one hand, and the third portion of hair in the other hand.
Usually the fingers stay in a curled, tight position to hold the strands of hair as you move them to form the braid.

, Start by using the three stand braiding technique to braid this first section of hair. The three strand braiding technique is the method used to make any typical braid: Start by crossing the left portion of hair over the middle portion, and then cross the right portion of hair over the middle portion (which was the original left portion of hair)./images/thumb/9/97/Make-a-Cascade-Waterfall-Braid-Step-7-Version-3.jpg/v4-550px-Make-a-Cascade-Waterfall-Braid-Step-7-Version-3.jpg
/images/thumb/9/97/Make-a-Cascade-Waterfall-Braid-Step-7-Version-3.jpg/v4-300px-Make-a-Cascade-Waterfall-Braid-Step-7-Version-3.jpg









Once this sequence is complete, you will begin to add more hair into the braid outside of the three original portions of hair you started with.
This process of adding hair to the braid outside of the original three portions of hair is a key component of creating a french braid. The waterfall braid starts out with a typical three strand braid, but then continues on as an altered french braid.

, Once you have completed your first braiding sequence, add another portion of hair into the braid by collecting hair from the top of your head, next to the left portion of hair currently in your hand. Once the left portion of hair is combined with the new, additional left portion of hair, continue braiding:
/images/thumb/2/2f/Make-a-Cascade-Waterfall-Braid-Step-8-Version-3.jpg/v4-550px-Make-a-Cascade-Waterfall-Braid-Step-8-Version-3.jpg
/images/thumb/2/2f/Make-a-Cascade-Waterfall-Braid-Step-8-Version-3.jpg/v4-300px-Make-a-Cascade-Waterfall-Braid-Step-8-Version-3.jpg









Cross the left portion of hair (now thicker with the new portion of hair added in) over the middle portion.
Now, instead of crossing the right portion of hair over the middle portion like you would normally do to create a braid, let go of the right portion of hair so it hangs and drops down normally.This is where the waterfall effect comes into play. The dropped, right portion of hair is your first ""waterfall"" piece of hair.

, From here on out, you will be using a french braid technique to add hair to the braid from both the top and bottom areas of the braid: Once you have dropped the right portion of hair, get your next “right” portion by taking a portion of hair from the roots right behind the dropped piece. Grab a piece of hair approximately the same size as the hair portions you are already using in the braid. Cross this new “right” portion of hair over the middle portion of hair, like you would in using the normal three strand braiding technique. Then, add more hair into the current “left” portion of hair. Do this by sectioning a piece of hair from the top your head, and combine that new portion of hair with your current left portion of hair.

This is exactly the same process as when you first started adding new portions of hair to the braid. Cross this entire left portion of hair over the middle section of hair, and again, let the right portion of hair drop.Since this braid is executed horizontally on your head rather than vertically (like a French braid down the middle of the back of your head), the dropped right portion of hair horizontally across your head gives the illusion of a waterfall.

, Once you have braided around your head to about your ear (or until you want your braid to end), finish your braiding by no longer adding and dropping hair, but braiding the three portions of hair like a normal crossover braid.


You can either secure the bottom of the braid with a small elastic band, or with a bobby pin or clip.
Consider spraying your braid with a small amount of hairspray to keep strands in place.

, The Dutch Braid consists of intertwining three strands of your hair so this will be the base you start from.

If you want to retain a bit of length without too much work, cut off lock 1-2"" from the scalp. The remaining hair should be relatively easy to untangle and comb out.
If you wish to keep more than an inch or two of hair, see the method below for combing out dreadlocks.;
, If you are not planning to shave your head, you should also condition your remaining hair with a leave-in or hot oil conditioning treatment., You can either keep going and shave off the rest of your hair, or comb out what is left.

Option 2: Once the remaining hair has been thoroughly conditioned, comb out the tangles using a sturdy comb and a detangling spray, conditioner, or oil.

Many people recommend taking a long weekend, or even a few days off work to complete the process.If you cannot remove your dreadlocks in a single block of time, consider working on just one section at a time, and either braiding the loose hair, or disguising it in a ponytail. You can also cover your work-in-progress hair in a head wrap or scarf.

, There are a number of commercial products that are designed for dreadlock removal, but you can easily assemble a do-it-yourself kit at a local drugstore or salon supply store.


A strong comb for each person who will be helping. A metal rat tail comb works best. If you end up using plastic combs, have extras on hand for when they break.
Deep-cleaning shampoo. If you have ever used any kind of wax on your dreadlocks, you will need one formulated for wax-removal. Many people swear by baby shampoo as a great residue-remover.
2-4 bottles of conditioner to lubricate the hair and make it easier to untangle. Any conditioner will work, but a specialized detangler, knot removal or ""slippery"" conditioner will be more efficient. Some people also swear by children's detangler sprays, or even coconut or olive oil.A spray bottle filled with water.

, If you have not had your dreadlocks for a long time (less than 2 years) you may skip this step, but most people find it helpful to trim at least the bottom 1/2"" from each dreadlock before they begin. The more you cut off, the less combing you have to do!

, It is important that your dreadlocks be saturated with water while you comb them out. Soak your dreadlocks for 10 minutes in the warmest water you can tolerate.

, Thoroughly shampoo your dreadlocks with a deep-cleaning or wax-removal shampoo. Rinse them until there are no more suds in the rinse water. This could take 20 or 30 minutes.

, Begin at the top of each dreadlock, and work your way to the bottom, using both hand to massage conditioner into the dreads. Add a little extra conditioner to the ends.

, Choose a lock to start on. Begin 1/2"" from the bottom of the lock, and use the tail of your comb to begin picking it apart. Pick some hair loose and then use your fingers and the comb to detangle the strand, and finally comb it out smooth. Once this is done, go up another 1/2"" and repeat the process until you get to your scalp.


If you have helpers, have them work on the strands in the back, while you work on the strands up front.
A rat tail comb is not the only tool you can use. Some people like to use a regular comb, or even sewing and knitting needles to pick the knots out. Use whatever you have on hand that gets the job done.
This process takes a lot of time and patience, so plan some entertainment in the form of music and movies to keep yourself distracted.
Your arms, shoulders and scalp are likely to get very sore in this process. Use an over-the-counter pain reliever as directed to manage the discomfort.

, Have a spray bottle full of water on hand and make sure the dreadlock you are working on stays wet as you untangle it. You can also add conditioner as needed, either by massaging it in with your hands, or using a spray conditioner as you work.

, As you detangle and comb your dreadlocks, a lot of hair will pull free, but don't panic! Most of this is hair that you shed naturally a long time ago, not new hair loss.

, You will probably need a trim to even out the ends, but wait a few days for the hair to settle down before getting this done.

Bring all of your hair into the braid.,
Finish the braid.",How to French Braid1," Brush through your hair to get all the tangles out and make it soft, smooth, and ready to braid. For a single braid going down the back of your head, brush your hair backwards, away from your forehead.

You might want a braid down the side of your head instead, or maybe you're making more than one braid. In that case, part your hair and brush it into sections.
You can braid your hair when it's dry or when it's wet. But, braiding wet hair gives you soft, pretty waves when you take it out later.;
, All the hair in this section should come from the same ""hair row."" You don't want to grab strands from higher up or lower down.









If you have bangs, you can bring them into the braid at this point or leave them loose. Choose what you think looks best. To braid them, you'll need to grab hair from the very top-center of your head, right above your forehead.
The section you start with has nothing to do with how big your braid will be. You start with a small section, but the braid grows thicker as you add more hair.

, Just like traditional braids, French braids use three sections of hair to create their pattern. Separate them out by running your fingers through the chunk you are holding to create three even pieces. Make sure that none of the pieces are larger or smaller than the other two.








, First, you have to get your hand positioning right: hold two strands in one hand, and the third strand in the other. Begin in a traditional braid by crossing the “right” strand over to the center. Then, cross the “left” strand from over to the center. Repeat until you've made a few rows of a traditional braid.








, Before crossing a section over to center, grab some hair from that side of your head and include it in the cross-over.









Every time you cross over, work in another small piece of hair. How much new hair you grab each time doesn't matter, but the less hair you grab, the more intricate the braid will look.
For the best-looking French braid, pick up the hair near your face and neck. If you only pick up pieces from the center (near the main strand), they'll get covered up later with strands from the outside.

, As you work down your head, you'll start running out of free hair to bring into the braid. By the time you reach the nape of your neck, you should have incorporated all of your hair.








, When all of your hair is in the working braid, finish it off as a traditional braid. Keep going until you reach the end of your strands. Then, secure the braid with a ponytail holder.

This is particularly important if have fine, silky hair that slips through finger easily. By adding a bit of texture to your hair, you'll make the braiding process easier and ensure your braid stays in place all day. Grab your spray of choice and spritz it through your hair, running your fingers through your hair to help distribute the product.






;
, The easiest way to do this hairstyle is by creating two braided pigtails. First, part your hair straight down the middle. Then, gather your hair into two sections, one on either side of your head. Clip one pigtail out of the way as you start with the other.







, Before you begin braiding your hair, make sure you pull out any bangs or strands of hair in the front that you want to frame your face. Then, split the section of hair into two even pieces. Unlike a traditional three-strand braid, a fishtail braid is created with two strands.







, Cross it over and join it with the opposite section of hair. Do the same thing on the opposite side: grab a small section of hair from the outer edge of the other strand, cross it over, and join it with the opposite section. Between each of these movements, you will only have those two original sections of hair. Make sure you hold these tightly so that the braid remains taut.









Creating a perfect fishtail braid takes a bit longer than a traditional braid, but is not complicated. You should be good to go after a bit of practice!

, Continue crossing strands of hair and joining them with the opposite section. Before long, you will see the intricate-looking pattern forming. Hold the two sections tight and continue doing this until you have no hair left to braid.







, When you reach the end of your hair, hold the end in one hand firmly. With your other hand, gently pull apart the braid. In other words, pull on the edges of your braid to add volume and width to your braid. You want your finished fishtail braid to look big and loose, rather than tight and perfect. When you are satisfied with how it looks, secure the end with a clear elastic hair tie.







, Unclip the second section of hair on the other side of your head. Split this section into two pieces and begin fishtail braiding it. When you reach the end of your hair, loosen your braid with your fingers and secure it with a hair tie. You should now have two loose fishtail braid pigtails.







, Once you are finished creating your two pigtails, it is time to create the crown. Lift up one of your pigtails – it doesn’t matter which – and stretch it over your head like a headband. Use bobby pins to secure the end of the pigtail in place on the other side of your head.







, Once the first pigtail is pinned in place over the top of your head, it’s time to complete the full crown. Take your second pigtail and wrap it underneath your head. In other words, the two pigtails will end up forming a full circle around your head – the “crown”! Like the first braid, pin this second braid in place with bobby pins.







, Once you have pinned your pigtails into place, use a handheld mirror to examine the back of your hairstyle. Make sure you like how everything looks, and re-pin your braids if necessary! Then, spritz your entire style with hairspray. This will help hold your braids in place as well as to reduce the chance of frizz and flyaways.

Spray your Viking braids with hairspray.",How to Do Viking Braids," Viking braids are not perfectly neat or sleek, and it’s easiest to create this look in second (or third or fourth) day hair. The oils in your hair will give it a bit of natural hold and texture. Remember, this look is supposed to look a bit messy and rugged!, If you have very fine, smooth hair (or if you showered recently), you’ll want to add a bit of texture. There are a few ways you can do this. You can buy a texturizing spray at your local pharmacy or beauty supply store, and this will add a bit of grit to your locks. A dry shampoo can do this exact same thing. Spritz it all over your hair, and then run your fingers through it.







, You’ll be creating multiple braids for this look, so sectioning out your hair is key. You can use claw clips, duckbill clips, or any sort of hair clip that you have handy. First, gather the hair on the very top of your head. Put your fingers on either side of your forehead and trace your fingers back, scooping up all of the hair on the top of your head going back. Clip this very top section up and out of the way with your hair clip of choice.








, Once the top section is clipped up, you need to section out the hair on both sides of your head. You will be creating two braids on each side of your head, for a total of four. First, gather up all of your hair on one side of your head, starting at your hairline. Then, create a part extending back from your hairline, splitting the side section of hair into a top and bottom section. Clip up the top section so you can work with the bottom section of hair first.









Do the exact same thing on the other side of your head.
When you are finished, you will have five total sections along the top of your head: the top section and two sections on either side.

, After you’ve clipped up the very top section of hair, you should’ve split the sections on either side of your head down the center horizontally. You’ll be starting with the bottom sections of hair on either side of your head, closest to your ears., Split the section of hair into two pieces for the rope braid. Start twisting them toward your head tightly, picking up more hair in the section as you work. You want the finished effect to be tight against your head, like a cornrow, so make sure you are holding the hair taut as you work.







, Once you’ve created a tight rope braid against your head and are behind your ear, switch from the rope braid to a three-strand braid. Don’t worry if it isn’t a perfectly smooth transition, because these braids are supposed to look imperfect.








Braid to the end of your hair, and then secure it with a clear elastic.

, Once you’ve created your first braid, do it again on the other side. Then, do the exact same process with the pinned up side sections. Note that the very top of your hair is still clipped up – this is just to finish the cornrow side braids. You will finish with two braids on either side.







, This step is optional. If you want to leave your two side braids as is, you certainly can. For some added interest, you can turn these into “snake” braids. To do this, untie the braid and firmly grasp the middle strand. Combine the two outer strands and push them upwards along the braid. This will cause the plaits to slide up and bunch at the top, creating a really intricate effect.








Pushing your braid up like this might create frizz, but that fits perfectly with the look of a Viking.
Tie your hair off at the bottom of the snake braid.

, Once you’ve completed and tied off your side cornrows, it’s time to work with the very top section. Unclip it and smooth out any huge tangles with your fingers. Then, French braid it to the back. It’s okay if you aren’t an expert at French braiding – the messier, the better.








If you have shorter hair, you can end the top braid in a small bun. In fact, the Vikings character Ragnar Lothbrok often rocks a version of the ""man bun"" at the end of his braid., You can braid until the ends of your hair, or you can do it about halfway down the strands. The important thing is that the very top of your head is braided, and the length of your braid is up to you. Tie it off with a clear hair elastic.







, The finishing touch for this braid is the backcombing, just like with the rest of your braids. After you’ve tied off the end, use a teasing comb to backcomb whatever hair is left. You can also carefully loosen or mess up your braid to give it a more tousled, authentically Viking look.








, Once you've finished braiding, teasing, and securing your braids, spritz the entire hairstyle with hairspray. This will help hold all of your handiwork in place and make sure your braids last throughout the day. The beauty of this style, however, is that flyaways and loose pieces are welcome. This style is meant to look a bit messy, so don't worry about making sure everything is perfectly placed.









If you are worried about your braids lasting throughout the day, bring a comb and some extra hair ties along with you. You can always re-braid sections of your hair as needed!

Add embellishment to your braid (optional).",How to Braid Hair1," Braiding goes a lot faster when your hair is knot-free. The comb should be able to pull easily through the length of the hair.


If you're working with thick or layered hair, use a bit of water or liquid hair gel to dampen the hair first. This will make it easier to handle.
You can braid hair when it is wet or dry. If your hair is completely wet, it will have a very smooth, tight appearance while dry hair will give a more messy look.
If braiding your hair dry, it is best to do it a few days after washing so that it is not so clean and slick. Slightly oily hair will hold a braid better than brand ""new"" clean hair.;
, If you tie hair into a ponytail or half ponytail with a hair tie, your braid will be easier to handle and turn out a little neater. Once you get the hang of it, try to start braiding loose hair at the nape of the neck.

, These will be the three strands of your braid, so try to make them as even as possible.









Grab the right section with your right hand and the left section with your left hand, letting the middle section hang free (for now).
In your right and left hands, hold the strands so that you're grasping them against your palm with your middle, ring and little fingers, keeping your index fingers and thumbs free.

, If your strands started out as A B C, they should now be ordered as B A C.









With the index finger and thumb of your left hand, grab the middle section of hair.
Using the index finger and thumb of your right hand, grab the left section of hair that's grasped against your left palm.
The original left-hand section is now the middle section.

, Your strands that are now ordered B A C will become B C A.









In your left hand, shift the strand that's between your index finger and thumb so that your other fingers are holding it secure against your palm.
Use your left index finger and thumb to grab the section of hair that's being held against your right palm (but not the one being held by the thumb and index finger).
The original right-hand section is now the middle section.

, Keep using the ""free"" index finger and thumb of one hand to grab the ""back"" section of hair (held by the other three fingers against the palm) from the other hand.









Tighten the braid as you go. Any time a strand changes hands, tug gently on the hair so that the plait moves upward, tightening it. Don't pull too hard, though.
Repeat until you run out of space to braid, leaving about 1–3 inches (2.5–7.6 cm) of unbraided hair at the end.

, Use a non-rubber elastic to tie off the end of the braid. You might have to wrap it around the hair several times.


Avoid rubber bands. These can damage the hair and be difficult to remove at the end of the day.
Whenever possible, use a ponytail holder that is the same colour as your hair or that is translucent, so that it blends in with your braid. This can make a braid look more natural, and get people to concentrate on the braid itself, rather than on the holder.

, Hairspray or spray gel can help your braid from developing flyaways as the day goes on.


If you decide to use hairspray, make sure to use it before adding any hair ornaments.
Use a shine serum along your braid to give it some extra glow. Rub a bit between your hands and then run along the length of the braid.

, Tie a colorful ribbon in a bow at the end of your braid for extra flair.


You can use tulle, grosgrain, or ric rac, all of which can be found in a variety of colors at your local fabric store.
Use a cute hair pin or brooch to pin near the base of your braid, or to hold back your bangs.

, The further along in the braiding process you go, the more and more your braid will begin to have the illusion of a waterfall. When you reach the point at which you feel your braid is complete, you can stop or finish with a regular braid. At either point, secure the end with an elastic band.





, Finger brush through the waterfall strands you dropped from your braid to make sure that they are tangle-free. Leave your hair hanging down for the best effect, and use a pretty pin or headband to complete the look. Give your hair a light misting of hairspray, and you’re done!

Finish your braid.",How to French Braid2," Just like you did for the normal French braid, brush through tangles to smooth out your hair. French lace braids can work down either one or both sides of your head, so need to part your hair. Use a center or side part, depending on what look you prefer.








, The size of this section does matter in French lace, as it determines the thickness of the braid. For a larger braid, grab a hefty section of hair, and for a dainty braid, grab a smaller piece. In general, it should be about one inch thick.








, As with the normal French braid, you need to divide your starting section of hair into three even pieces. Angle these pieces downward to frame your face, rather than pulling them toward the back of your head.







, Start the French lace in a traditional braid. Cross the ""right"" strand over to center, then cross the ""left"" strand over to center.








, In the French braid, you added hair from both sides of your head. In the French lace braid, you should only add hair from one side of the braid.








It doesn't matter which side you add new hair from. The important thing is that all new hair comes from the same side of the braid.

, As you move further along with your braid, it will start to form a crown or halo shape around your head. You can choose to braid over the top of your ear, or under it.









If you are making a single braid, wrap it all the way around your head. You will likely run out of hair near the ear on the other side of your head.
If you're making two braids, stop braiding when you reach the nape of your neck. Tie off the first braid with an elastic, then repeat the entire process on the other side of your head to create your second braid.

, Eventually, you will run out of loose hair to work into the braid. At this point, keep working in a traditional braid until you reach the ends of your strands. Tie off your hair with an elastic tie to secure your French lace braid.

, The strands should be perpendicular to the center part.








, Cross one strand over the other, then pull it through the formed loop. Gently pull on the strands to tighten the knot.








Twist the strands slightly to catch any flyaways. You can also lightly mist them with water instead.

, Take some hair from the left side of the knot, and add it to the left strand. Take some more hair from the right side of the knot, and add it to the right strand.








The amount of hair you are adding should be thinner than the strands themselves.

, Once again, give the strands a light twist to make them smooth, then tie them into a knot.







, You can continue the braid to the back of your head, or you can stop just behind the ear. Try to keep the braid centered as you work.







, When your braid is the length you desire, gather the two strands into a mini pigtail and secure them with a clear elastic or mini hair tie.








, Unclip the hair on the other side of your head. Gather a small section of hair from the hair line and split it into two strands. Chain-braid the two strands until you reach the back/side of your head. Secure the braid with an elastic when you are done.

, For a traditional French braid, this is probably the front section of your hair, that's closest to your forehead and temples.









You don't have to start a French braid at the top of your head. It's the easiest way to learn, but theoretically you could start a French braid anywhere. Just make sure you're including the hair above your ears in your starter section if you decide to move down the head.
You can create multiple French braids on your hair using several parts. If you have short hair, it may be easier to make two medium braids rather than one large one.

, These three strands will make up the beginning of the braid.









The real trick to French braiding is keeping your three sections evenly sized as you braid. Give yourself a solid head start by making sure your strands are equal to begin with.
Make sure the strands start from the same row of hair, rather than staggered areas. Keeping the three strands close together will also be helpful.

, Grasping the strands correctly will help you braid neatly and quickly. Though you might find another way that's more comfortable for you, here's a basic beginning grip:


Grasp the left strand in your left hand.
Grasp the center strand between the thumb and index finger of your right hand.
Grasp the right strand between your right palm and the last three fingers of your right hand.

, Here's how to shift the right strand without completely losing your hold on the braid:









With the last three fingers of your left hand, grip the left strand between your fingers and your palm. This should free up your left thumb and index finger.
With your left thumb and index finger, reach over the center strand and grab the right strand. You should now have two strands in your left hand and one in your right hand.

, This will be the same process as the previous step, mirrored.









With the last three fingers of your right hand, grip the right strand between your fingers and your palm. This should free up your right thumb and index finger.
With your right thumb and index finger, reach over the center strand and grab the left strand. You should now have two strands in your right hand and one in your left hand.

, Up until now, you've done a regular braid. This is where the ""French"" part of the process comes in. It might take you a few tries to get it right, but it's easier once you're comfortable with the grip.









Let go of the center strand, and allow it to hang between the left and right strands. You should be able to tell it apart from the rest of your hair — it'll be slightly elevated above the hair that hasn't been braided yet.
Grip the left strand between the last three fingers of your left hand and your left palm and grab the right strand with your left thumb and index finger. Your right hand should now be free.
Using your right hand, pull up a small section of unbraided hair from the right side of your head. Grab this new section with your left thumb and index finger to add it to the right strand of the braid.
Pick up the center strand of the braid again. Grab it with your right hand, and move it to the right, making it your new right strand. The section you added hair to, between your left thumb and index finger, is the new center strand.

, This process will be just like the previous step, but using opposite sides:









Let go of the center strand. Again, it will hang between the left and right strands.
Grip the right strand between the last three fingers of your right hand and your right palm.
Grab the left strand with your right thumb and index finger. Your left hand should now be free.
Using your left hand, pull up a small section of unbraided hair from the left side of your head. Grab the new section with your right thumb and index finger to add it to the left section of the braid.
Pick up the center strand of the braid again. Grab it with your left hand, and move it to the left, making it your new left strand. The section you added hair to, between your right thumb and index finger, is the new center strand.

, You will run out of new hair to add into the braid when you reach the nape of your neck, at which point you can finish with a regular braid. To keep the braid looking as neat as possible, try to add sections that are about the same size throughout the braid.








, Continue doing a regular three-strand braid with the hair that's still loose.








, Use a hair tie the same color as your hair, or one that is translucent so that it blends in. Avoid rubber bands, which can damage your hair and be difficult to remove.

, Hairspray or spray gel can help your French braid from developing flyaways as the day goes on.









If you're going to add extra embellishment to your hair, hairspray it first. This will prevent flaky residue from getting on your barrettes or ribbons.
Using shine serum will help to keep your hair looking smooth and soft, if it has the tendency to be rough and dry looking.

, For some extra flair, tie a colorful ribbon in a bow at the end of your braid.


You can use tulle, grosgrain, or ric rac, all of which can be found in a variety of colors at your local fabric store.
Adding a pretty brooch or multiple hair pins along the braid is a great way to add a bit of glam to your look.

",How to Braid Hair3," A fishtail braid looks like it's made of several small strands, but surprisingly there are only two primary sections.


For a neat braid, use a fine-toothed comb to make a straight part down the middle of your head, from forehead to nape.
For a more tousled, Katniss Everdeen-inspired look, just part your hair with your hands and separate into two sections that seem somewhat even.
You can fishtail your hair when it is either wet or dry.

, Once you get this grip down, you'll be able to do it for the whole braid.









Hold the right section of hair in your right hand.
Drop the left section and let it hang loose. Because you're only working with two sections, you don't need to worry about it mixing with another part of the braid.
Using your left hand, pull up a small strand of hair from the leftmost side of the left section. That is, from the side of the left section of hair that's closest to your ear.
Grab the small strand of hair from the left section with your right hand, incorporating it into the right section of the braid.
Hold the left section of hair in your left hand again. As you pick it back up, you can run your fingers through the section to smooth out any knots and tighten up the braid.

, This is just like the previous step, but mirrored.









For a more intricate-looking braid, pull up smaller strands of hair. For a quicker braid, grab larger sections.
Hold the left section of hair in your left hand.
Drop the right section and let it hang loose. Again, because you're only working with two primary sections, there's no need to worry about mixing strands.
Using your right hand, pull up a small strand of hair from the rightmost side of the right section (or the part closest to your ear).
Grab the small strand of hair from the right section with your left hand, incorporating it into the left section of the braid.
Hold the right section of hair in your right hand again. As you pick it back up, you can run your fingers through the section to smooth out any knots and tighten up the braid.

, Keep alternating sides and adding strands until you get to the end of your locks. Try to keep the small strands that you pull into the main sections as evenly sized as possible.

Start the next row.,
Finish cornrowing the rest of the hair.,
Keep your cornrows neat at night.,
Wash your hair every few days.,
Be careful in the sun.",How to Braid Cornrows," Having in mind what your end goal looks like will help you to form a path for getting there. You can do this in your head, draw a picture, or make some marks on a Styrofoam wig holder. The easiest amount to begin with will probably be four to six sections from the front to the back of the head.


Draw the path you want the rows to take. Do you want them to go straight from front to back, or do you want them to curve?
How big do you want the rows to be?;
, Spritz some water, or water mixed with detangler, on the hair. Comb or brush it through to remove all major tangles. The hair should be slightly damp, but not too wet. The reason for this is that you don't want to have to pull the hair a lot to create the tension needed to hold the style together. Hair expands when it's wet and contracts as it dries.









Despite what some people say about a tight braid, this is the best way to achieve it - not by pulling the hair hard away from the scalp.

, Start with a section of hair in the front, where you want the first cornrow to begin. Put the sides of the hair that you aren't braiding in two pigtails so they don't get in your way. Move other hair out of the way so that you have a clear path to follow. Then take a small section of hair where you want the cornrow to begin.


Don't take too much, especially near the hairline, or you will have to pull too hard to continue.
You can moisturize the first section with some cream. Keep moisturizing as you cornrow the hair.

,, Pass the right piece under the middle, the left piece under the middle, the right piece under the middle, and the left piece under the middle.








, Holding the two outer strands aside, reach down under this initial braid to add a little hair to the middle strand. Fully merge this new hair to the middle strand so that it becomes a part of it, and you again have 3 strands. Make a braid stitch out of these strands. Continue braiding, each time adding a little more hair to the middle strand, and repeat this until you've run out of hair to add.









If you've reach the end and there is still hair left over, then continue with a regular 3 strand braid.

, You can use a snap bead, hair clip, end bar, barrette, bolo tie tip, or whatever you like, just so long as you will be able to easily remove it later.









Uncovered rubber bands (elastics) are not recommended unless they are the kind made specifically for hair. The ones made for office use will break off the hair.

, Loosen a section of hair next to the first section. Make sure it's the same size as the first section. Moisturize the new section of hair, then start the braid with two stitches. Cornrow the section all the way to the tips, then secure it., Work methodically to create even cornrows running from the forehead to the nape of the neck. The cornrows should each be the same size.

, Wear a scarf on your head at night to keep the hairs from coming loose. Your cornrows should be able to stay in place for a week or longer.

, Simply wear a stocking cap over it, and use a shower massager or water pick to force water underneath the braids. Use a diluted shampoo and water mixture to wash, clear water to rinse, and spritz the hair with a leave in conditioner or hair oil afterwards.

, It is very easy to get a sunburn on your scalp, because the rows will expose the skin. Rub in sunscreen or wear a hat.

Continue braiding the remainder of your hair.,
Repeat the previous two steps.",How to Braid Your Own Hair1," This helps your braid stay smooth and neat.Use any kind of brush or comb, brushes are better to smooth out your hair.
Brushing your hair before you start braiding will prevent knots from forming in your hair as your braid.
Don't start braiding your hair when it is wet. It will expand as it dries and may break in your braid.
Avoid using lots of hair product when you start this process, but you can try a dry shampoo to help with texture if you need it.
Try using dry shampoo if you are having problems holding on to your hair. Clean, dry hair may be too slick to stay in place while performing the steps. The dry shampoo adds texture that helps you hold on to the strands.;
, Before you can start your braid, you need to decide where you want your braid. The placement of your braid on your head can transform your hairstyle for many outfits and occasions. It can be convenient, casual, or elegant depending on where you place your braid.


Pull your hair to either side to make a side braid. Brush all of your hair to the side you choose to ensure there will be no bumps. This creates a more elegant, put together look that can accent an evening out or day at the office.
Starting with a side braid can be beneficial if you are a beginner. It is easier to see and control what you are doing with a side braid.
You can braid down the back in a low, unsecured ponytail. This gives a more elegant classic braid and is more relaxed and unstructured.
You can also start by making a ponytail in the middle or on top of your head. This will add stability to a back braid but is a more casual look.

, Collect and hold your hair in your hands. 








You will have one section of hair on the left, one in the center and one on the right.
Hold the section of hair on the left between your left thumb and forefinger.
Hold the section of hair on the right between your right thumb and forefinger.
Let the center section hang loose for now.

, Start braiding by crossing the right section of hair over the center section.








Take the right section of hair, once you have crossed it over the center section, between your left forefinger and middle finger to secure it.
Grab the center section of hair with between the thumb and forefinger of your left hand.
Pull on the sections of hair in both hands to tighten the braid. This will ensure that the braid will be even with no gaps.
If you have longer hair, run your fingers down the section of hair to ensure it does not get tangled as you go.

, You should now rotate your left wrist to cross the left section of hair over the new center section of hair. 








Grab the left section of hair between your right forefinger and middle finger after you cross it over the center section.
Secure the center section of hair between your thumb and forefinger of your left hand.
Pull the sections of hair in both hands tightly to ensure that the tension on the braid is even as you go.

, Do this until you reach the bottom of your sections of hair.








Cross of the right section over the center, then the left over the center until the braid moves down the length of your hair.
Make sure to continue pulling your hair snug as you follow the braid.
If your braid gets too long while braiding down your back, pull your hair over your shoulder and continue the steps with the hair in front of you.
Tie with a hair tie at the bottom. Make sure the hair tie is tight. If it is too loose sections of your braid will come out.

When your hair is as pale as you can get it, buy Special Effects hair dye.,
When dying your hair pink, you can leave the dye in overnight if it is semi-permanent.",How to Dye Your Hair Like Audrey Kitching," This will strip any leftover colour out of the hair, resulting in a ginger tone.;
, If you have dark hair you will need to bleach your hair more than once. If you already have light hair you should only need one go of bleach, about. It is much safer, if you have dark or red hair, to see a professional to bleach it for you. It will be more expensive, but your hair will thank you.

, Use hair masks during those ""break"" periods. This will help minimize the amount of damage the bleaching will do to your hair. The end result should be a very very pale blonde, after you have bleached all the yellow and orange you can out of it.

, Choose which shade you prefer, In regards to Special Effects hair dye: Atomic Pink is darker but extremely vibrant and Cupcake Pink is a pale baby pink. Audrey has had both these colours, currently using the cupcake pink.

, It is also good to put some heat on it (wrap it up in plastic or hairnet, and blow direct heat from a hairdryer for thirty minutes on, thirty minutes off, for a few hours.) The longer, the better and brighter!

Apply the bleach to the first quadrant.,
Saturate all four quadrants in the bleach mixture.,
Let the bleach sit for the suggested amount of time.,
Rinse out the bleach thoroughly with cold water.",How to Dye Your Hair Light Brown1," If you fall into one of these categories, there’s no getting around pre-lightening with bleach before you move forward. Purchase a vol 20 or 30 bleach kit from a beauty supply store and follow the instructions that come with it. Your new hair color will not show up if you proceed without bleaching the current color out first.If you have red, dark or medium brown hair, use vol 20 developer.
If you have near-black or black hair, use vol 30 developer.If you have dark brown, medium brown or red hair that's never been chemically treated, you can skip the bleach and go right into dyeing.;
, Your bleach kit will contain both items, as well as an applicator and pair of plastic gloves. Put on the gloves before you open any packaging – these chemicals can burn your skin. Mix the bleach powder and vol developer until fully incorporated.Once mixed, you need to use the bleach immediately.
To protect your scalp from the bleaching chemicals, avoid washing it for several days beforehand. The natural oils will create a protective barrier., To ensure even results, you need to divide your hair into four manageable sections. Center part your hair from the crown down to the nape of your neck. Divide those sections in half by parting the hair at ear level. Use hair clips to keep the quadrants in place as you work.Drape a towel around your shoulders right before you apply the bleach to protect your skin.

, Start with the bottom quadrants before moving on to the top ones. Take the first clip out to release the hair. Use the applicator brush to apply the bleach from top to bottom. Do this as quickly as possible. Get as close to the roots as possible.Work carefully with the bleach, since it can burn your skin. Have a friend help you if this is your first time.
You might associate foil with the bleaching process. It's used when bleaching highlights into hair or for excluding areas that you want to protect. You need to bleach all of your hair for this process, so you won't be using foil.

, Continue applying the bleach as quickly and carefully as possible to each quadrant until your hair is completely covered in the bleach solution. Each time you finish a quadrant, carefully clip it back up out of the way., Each product will be different, and the darker your hair is, the longer it should sit on your hair. Bleach is damaging to the hair shaft, so leave it on your hair for the least amount of time possible. 30 to 45 minutes is typical.Check it every 5 to 10 minutes to avoid over-processing.
Never leave bleach on your hair for longer than an hour., Once the color has lifted from your hair, start rinsing the bleach out. The cold water will stop the bleach from processing your hair. Rinse thoroughly and shampoo your hair twice to make sure you’ve removed all of the bleach.After bleaching your hair, don’t be alarmed – your hair will appear to be bright orange. This is normal! The light brown hair dye will cover it.

Try a rope braid.",How to Braid Hair5," This is the reverse of a French braid, where instead of braiding strands over each other you braid them under. It is very simple to do, and instead of the braid sitting under your hair (as with a French braid), it sits as a 3-D section above your hair.

, This beautiful style is created by letting strands of hair hang loose from a French braid, similar to the look of a waterfall. When you feel comfortable with your skills in French braiding, take the next step to try a waterfall braid.

, This is a small, thin braid that goes from ear-to-ear across your forehead, like a headband. It uses the process of French or Dutch braiding to turn your bangs into a statement piece.

It will be difficult to pull your hair into sections for a braid if it is tangled.
Smoother hair is easier to braid and this will prevent a messy looking style.
Remember to avoid braiding wet hair or using too much product. If you are having trouble with your hair slipping out of the braid, you can apply a dry shampoo though.

, Use a hair pick or comb to pick up the section of hair at the crown of your head.


The French braid is more complicated than the traditional braid because the braid starts at the top of your head and gathers hair from the crown of your head.
This first section should extend from your temples to the top of your head.
You can also separate this section of hair by pulling your hair back along the side of your head from your temples to the back, using your thumbs.
Brush this section of hair back from your face to smooth it out.

, Split the hair into three sections, holding the hair high on your head.









Hold one section in one hand and two in the other, keeping them separated by your index finger.
It is often helpful to hold two sections in your left hand and one in your right hand.
Make sure your hold is firm on the three sections.

, Cross the right section over the center section to start.









Cross the left section over the section that is now in the center, as if you were doing a traditional braid.
This is the start of your braid. It should begin high on the crown of your head and look like a traditional braid.
Pull the sections tight to make sure the tension on the braid is even and that it is not too loose.

, You will do this by taking small sections of hair and adding them to the right section of your divided hair.









Pick up a small section of hair from the right side of your head.
Add it to the section of hair that you are holding in your right hand. Then cross this right section over the center section of hair.

, This will follow the same method you used on the right side.









Pick up a small section of hair from your left side of your head.
Add it to the hair that you are holding in your left hand.
Cross it over the center section of hair.

, Continue to pick up extra hair before crossing the sections into your braid.


This incorporates the hair not already in the braid, creating a cohesive braid.
Make sure you take even strands on each side of your head. This will ensure that your braid will be even and straight in the back.
The braid should follow the center of your head, from the crown of the head to the nape of the neck.
If you have longer hair, run your fingers down each the section of hair to ensure that tangling does not occur as you go.

, You will use a traditional braid once all the hair on the crown of your head is incorporated into the three sections you started with.









When you have no more hair to braid, tie the end with a hair tie.
If you have long hair, you will need to bring your braid over your shoulder to complete it.

It is much simpler to do a side fishtail braid when you are first learning. The multi-layered construction makes it difficult to do behind your back when you are not familiar with the process.

, Use a hair pick or comb to part your hair down the middle, dividing it into 2 large sections at the base of your skull.Make sure your sections are even so your braid will be as well.
If you want, you can brush out each of these sections to ensure that the hair is smooth and well divided.
This is different from traditional and french braids, which use 3 sections of hair.

, You will pull small sections of hair, about 1








Pull a small amount of hair from the front, outside of the right section of your hair.
Use your index finger to separate this smaller section of hair from the larger one on the right.
Cross this smaller section of hair over the right section of hair and tuck it behind the left section of hair.

, You will need to hold both left sections with your left hand and both right sections with your right hand.








After you merge each small, outside piece, you will go back down to two strands.
This is much more complicated than other braids. Work slowly and be careful not to drop the smaller strands of hair as you braid.
This varies from the other braids because you work with two stable pieces while creating the third strand each time instead of having three stable strands throughout the steps.
For a more intricate braid, use smaller strands of hair.

, Alternate sides as you go along.Cross the small, outside right section that is closer to your face into the center.
Merge this piece of hair with the large section in your left hand.

Mix a light ash brown dye with 10 vol peroxide.,
Apply the dye mixture to damp hair.,
Allow the dye to develop.,
Rinse the dye out once you achieve the shade you desire.",How to Dye Your Hair Light Brown2," Whether you have a warm or cool skin tone, choose an ash light brown dye if you've just bleached your hair. The cool ash tones will counteract the warmth of your newly-bleached bright orange hair. To reach a cool light brown hair color, you will need to leave the mixture on your hair longer than if you’re trying to achieve a warm light brown shade., Separate your hair into the four quadrants again and start applying the mixture on the first quadrant. Use the applicator that came with the dye to “paint” the mixture on from root to tip. Make sure you saturate the hair. Continue until all of your hair is saturated with the dye., After applying the dye, you will be able to see the color develop – your hair will go from orange, to golden brown, to neutral, and finally to ash. There is no exact science here, so you’ll have to watch carefully and rinse when you’ve reached your ideal shade. If you are trying to achieve a warm shade, you will rinse it out sooner than if you want a cool shade. The longer you leave the dye on, the cooler the shade will be.Check the dye's instructions for maximum set time. It's usually 30 minutes. Dyes stop developing after the max time elapses. Leaving it on past that time will not change anything., Continually check your hair in the mirror as the color develops. When you've reached your desired shade, rinse the dye out. When you do this is entirely up to you, and depends on what you're trying to achieve."

Identify the shade “level” of your blonde hair.,
Add copper toned dye first if your blonde shade is level 6 – 8.,
Add gold toned copper dye first if your blonde shade is level 8 – 10.,
Dye your hair with your chosen light brown shade.",How to Dye Your Hair Light Brown3," Because the base tone for all light brown shades is copper, going from blonde to light brown isn’t as simple as just applying light brown dye. Depending on your blonde shade, you may have little or no copper tone in your hair. When you put a light brown dye directly on top of it, you’ll end up with greenish, greyish or purplish results.


Hair levels are judged on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being black and 10 being the lightest blonde. As a reference point, level 5 is considered to be light brown.Level charts can help you determine your level if you aren’t sure. Type “shade range hair level” into a search engine to bring up the info you need.

, If your current blonde shade falls into this range, you’ll need to dye your hair with a dark copper blonde dye before moving forward with your light brown shade.This will prepare your hair with the base copper tone necessary to achieve all light brown shades. Without doing this first, the results of your light brown dye job could end up looking greenish.Purchase the dye and follow the directions on the packaging to add the copper tones to your blonde hair.

, If you fall into this shade range, your hair also lacks golden tones. Putting a light brown dye directly on top of it will result in either a bright purple or very dull, lifeless light brown shade. Use a golden copper/auburn blonde dye first, which will deposit the copper and gold undertones you need to achieve your ideal light brown shade. Purchase the dye and follow the directions to add the copper tones.

, Once you’ve added the copper/gold tones into your blonde hair, you’re ready to move forward with your light brown dye. Apply the dye to your hair according to the instructions that came with your dye kit. After the color develops (times vary from product to product), rinse out the dye and enjoy your new light brown shade."

Get your lemon juice.,
Mix the lemon juice with water.,
Spray the mix into your hair.,
Separate your hair into sections.,
Use heat to activate the lemon juice in your hair.,
Repeat.,
Tone down brassiness, if necessary.",How to Dye Your Hair from Brown to Blonde Without Bleach1," It is best if you used fresh squeezed, but organic lemon juice in a bottle will also work.The amount of lemon juice you need will depend on how long your hair is, how thick it is, and whether you want to use it all over your hair, or just on sections.


If you have very long hair and you want to lighten all of your hair, you will probably need at least 2 cups of lemon juice. If you have shorter hair, or you just want to lighten a couple of small sections, you might be able to get by with a 1/2 cup of lemon juice.
You can potentially also use non-organic lemon juice, but this should be a last resort as you won’t know what toxins and/or pesticides might be present in the juice. These may be trace amounts, but they still aren’t good for you.;
, Mix two parts lemon juice with one part water in a spray bottle.How much a part is depends on how much you want to make, it is not an exact measurement, but rather a ratio.In this case, if you were to use 2 cups of lemon juice, you would use one cup of water. If you used 1 cup of lemon juice as a part, you would use only a half a cup of water.

, If you want to lighten all of your hair, then spray the mixture all over, until your hair is completely covered in the juice. Use a wooden or plastic comb to help spread the mixture evenly through your hair.


Be careful not to get it in your eyes, as this will burn!

, If you only want to lighten certain parts of your hair, you can separate those sections, and apply the lemon juice directly to this part of your hair.


Dip your fingers in the mixture and then disperse the mixture throughout the hair you wish to lighten.
Alternatively, you can dip a cotton ball or pad into the mixture, grab the sections of hair you want to lighten and run the cotton ball down the shaft.
If your hair is long enough, you could also try dipping it directly into the mixture, and then applying it to the roots using your fingers.

, This method will work best if you then apply heat to your hair, and will work even better if you can spend some time in the sun.


If it is very sunny and warm outside, then your best option is to go outside for a few hours. The sunlight, in combination with heat, will lighten your hair. Make sure to apply sunscreen to your face, and any other areas where your skin will be exposed!
If you don’t have access to the sun, another option is to use a blow dryer. Turn the dryer on the highest setting, and dry your hair thoroughly

, You can repeat this process as often as necessary to achieve the desired result; however, be aware that the lemon juice is acidic, and will dry out your hair with frequent use.


Understand that you may not see results the first time you do this, especially if you have very dark hair.
Consider using a moisturizing shampoo and conditioner, or a hair treatment to keep your hair healthy.

, If you use the lemon juice method to lighten your hair, you may end up with “brassiness” in your hair, meaning it appears more orangey than blonde. If this happens, you can use tomato paste or tomato sauce to help combat this problem.Make sure the tomato paste or sauce only contains tomatoes and water.
Apply the tomato sauce on your hair so that it is evenly spread throughout your hair.
Wrap your head in aluminium foil.
Leave in for 20-25 minutes.
Rinse thoroughly.
Repeat daily until all of the brassiness is gone.

Touch up your color.",How to Dye Your Hair an Unnatural Color," Dyeing your hair, especially a unique color, requires some steps. The last thing you want after going through the trouble to dye your hair is to realize you want a new hairstyle., If your natural shade is dark, it will be harder to get the color to show through. You can always go for a darker shade, but the color may not be as vibrant than if your hair was a lighter hue.Lighter hues can also affect the outcome of a dye job. For example, if you are blonde and you try for a shade of red, your hair may come out orange. Go for blue, and you may end up with green instead.White or grey hair can also make dye much brighter than it actually is. A blue-black shade, for example, could become bright blue., A common recommendation is to never go two shades lighter or darker than your natural hair color. The best thing to do is start with a lighter shade. You can always go darker later if you want.Some shades may not work with your skin tone. If you have a tendency to blush, for example, you may want to avoid going with any pink or red tones.
If you have pale skin, bright greens, and yellows could make you appear to be glowing.

, Aside from your hair dye of choice, you'll need to gather a few items to make the process easier. Keep these stored in your bathroom for future dye jobs.


Hair clips: These are useful for holding large sections of hair out of the way.Rubber gloves: Hair dyes can contain some pretty harsh chemicals. Wear gloves to keep your hands safe. They'll also protect your skin from taking on the same color as your hair.Vaseline: Spread a thin layer on your hairline and on your ears. Put it anywhere the dye might come in contact with your skin. Vaseline helps prevent your skin from changing colors.Old clothes and towels: Dyeing hair gets messy. It's always a good idea to use materials you don't mind ruining.
Other items such as a kitchen timer, q-tips, spare gloves, and extra dyeing brushes are also good., While you could dye your hair on your own, the process will be much easier with a friend. Having an assistant who can get to those hard to reach spots will make for a smoother dye job.

, Unless you have white-blonde hair, you'll need to bleach your hair to get it to take a bright color. Bleaching your hair can be time consuming and expensive. You may have to go through several rounds of bleaching to reach the desired lightness.


If you need to bleach your hair multiple times, it's best to wait a week or so between applications.Too many bleach jobs can also damage your hair, leaving it brittle and prone to breakage.
If you're feeling at all uncertain, enlist the help of a professional. It may be expensive, but having a bad bleach job fixed could cost you much more., Dirty hair is best for dyeing. The natural oils in the scalp help prevent irritation and make for hair that is easier to work with., Before you start applying the dye, make sure you drape an old towel over your shoulders. It's also a good idea to wear those old clothes you keep with your dye kit.Dye can get everywhere. If you want to keep your bathroom from getting dyed as well, clean it beforehand, and lay some towels down., You will have to mix most dyes before you can apply the dye to your hair. Mix the dye in a bowl until it is well blended and smooth., Starting at your roots, apply a layer of dye. Brush the dye down to the ends working in parts. Use clips to section off your hair to make it easier to apply the dye.Once you've applied all the dye, run the dye brush through your hair a few more times to ensure even coverage.
While your hair processes, cover it with a shower cap. This helps the color soak in better, as well as preventing you from staining anything.You may have to wait 30-45 minutes for the dye to set in. The length of time will vary depending on the brand of dye and the color.

, Once the suggested waiting time has passed, rinse your hair in the shower until the water runs clear to make sure you have removed all the dye.


The best way to rinse your hair is to get in the shower and lean back. Try to avoid letting any of the dye rinse onto your skin as it can stain you., A lot of wild colors are semi-permanent, meaning they'll wash out rather quickly. Some colors are harder to maintain, with blue being the most difficult.


Always wash your hair in cool water. By avoiding a hot rinse, you may be able to decrease color fading., Dry shampoos can be quite helpful when it comes to maintaining brightly colored hair. They won't strip your hair color and they will keep your hair from becoming too greasy.

, After about a month, you may have noticeable roots. To touch up the color, repeat the dyeing process focusing only on the roots."

Whiten the blonde hair with a ""toner"" (optional).,
Die the lower portion of your hair black.,
Care for your hair.",How to Dye Your Hair Blonde and Black Underneath," Look at pictures of this hairstyle, and decide exactly how deep you want the blonde layer to go. It could stop at your crown, or go all the way to the back of your head.;
, Depending on the natural or dyed color of your current hair, this could take up to three processes. Because bleach is so harsh, let your hair go unwashed a day longer than you usually would - the excess oil will stop the bleach from damaging your hair as much.


Purchase a bleach kit at your local beauty supply store. The higher the number on the package, the stronger the stuff. 20 volume is good for dark blondes and light to medium brunettes, while anyone with darker hair would probably be better off with a 40 volume developer.
Use a fine-tooth comb or pic to part your hair. Run a clean line from one ear to the other, wherever it is that you want the blonde to stop. Tie the lower portion in a ponytail so it's out of the way.
Apply the bleach. Wear gloves to protect your hands, and use a hair coloring brush to apply the dye.
Set a timer. Because you could destroy your hair if you leave the bleach in too long, set a timer for exactly as long as the instructions in the bleach kit indicate.
Wash out the dye in the shower, using water that's as cold as you can stand. Avoiding warm water will keep your blonde from turning brassy.

, If you're going for an ultra-platinum or white blonde look, you'll need to use a purple toner on the bleached section of your hair. Again, this can be found at your local beauty supply store.


Wait a few days after you bleach your hair. Too much trauma at once can severely damage your hair.

, Dying the hair on the back of your head might be more difficult than dying the front portion, so consider enlisting the help of a friend. You can purchase the dye (semi-permanent or permanent) at a beauty supply store or big-box store.


Use a pic or fine-toothed comb to part your hair along exactly the same line you used to bleach it.
Tie up the bleached portion securely on the top of your head, and cover with a plastic shower cap. Make sure the edge of the cap hits the part you combed out between the sections.
Start applying the black dye. Start at the root of the hair, and be extremely careful that you don't hit the bleached portion at all. Have a friend help you with this part.
Wash out the dye. Keep the shower cap on the blonde portion of your hair as you rinse out the black dye. Wash it in ice cold water if you can - the dye will last longer.

, Color processing is hard on hair, and bleaching is especially harsh. Compensate for this by using a shampoo and conditioner designed specifically to moisturize color-treated hair. Avoid blow drying or flat ironing your hair when you can.

Blue dye will layer over your existing color, so it will hardly show up if you have darker hair. You can find bleaching kits at beauty supply stores, and they will have everything you need to bleach your hair, so they’re great for amateur colorists. The kits will come with bleach powder, developer, a mixing bowl, and a brush. Typically, they will contain a plastic cap and gloves as well., Just like bleach will change the color of your hair, it’ll change the color of any clothing it touches. To be safe, wear a t-shirt you don’t care about while you’re bleaching your hair. The powerful bleach can also irritate skin, so wear plastic gloves during this entire process., First, pour the bleaching powder into your mixing tub. Pour it carefully to ensure that the powder doesn’t scatter. Then add the developer, stirring the two together with the brush. Make sure to get all of the bleaching powder from the bottom and sides of the tub, so that everything is thoroughly blended., The process of bleaching and dying your hair is easiest if you separate your hair into smaller sections. Sectioning out your hair will also ensure you coat your hair thoroughly. The best way to do this is by clipping your hair into four “quadrants” in the front and back of your head.To create these sections, part your hair straight down the middle.
Then, part it again in the other direction, as if you are creating a plus sign.
Keep all of the sections clipped out of the way until you’re ready to work on them.

, Begin by applying bleach to the back sections. Start at the bottom of the strand and carefully apply the bleach moving up the strand. Bleach develops faster when heated, and the roots will bleach faster than the rest of your hair because of your body heat. Keep this in mind, and give the ends of your hair more time to process.Bleach will start processing the moment it makes contact with your hair. For that reason, it’s important to work efficiently.
Make sure that your hair is coated thoroughly with the bleach.

, Let the bleach work its magic. Check out the specific instructions on your bleaching kit to see how long you should let it sit on your hair. However, check on your hair sporadically as the bleach processes. You will be able to see your hair lightening, so check its progress.When it looks like your hair has lifted enough, wash your hair like usual. Be thorough to make sure that you’ve rinsed out all traces of bleach.

, Remember, a bleach kit will only lighten your hair a few levels per usage. Dark hair has to lift through many stages (including an orange stage) to become blonde. If you aren’t satisfied with how light your hair got with one bleaching, you can repeat the process in a few days. It’s important to wait a bit, because bleaching your hair repeatedly will damage it.


If it isn’t the perfect shade of blonde, that is okay. You will be adding blue dye over it, so it doesn’t have to be a flawless platinum. Only repeat the bleaching process if it is still a dark color.

, After bleaching your hair, you may be left with an orange or yellow tone. A toner will help to reduce this brassiness. You may only need to apply the toner on a few strands, or you may need to apply it to your whole head. It depends on what color your hair was when you started, and what color it is after bleaching.Follow the instructions on your toner, and make sure you leave it on for the full time.
A purple shampoo can also tone the hair. Apply it like a normal shampoo, and let it sit on your hair for five to ten minutes.

, Just like jeans, denim hair comes in all shades. You can create a deep, dark wash denim, or a silvery-blue – it is completely up to you. You can keep it simple by sticking with one semi-permanent blue dye, or create a custom look with a mix of blues, grays, and purples. Look for inspiration online – you’ll quickly see that the query “denim hair” turns up all shades!


You can find all sorts of colors at your local beauty supply store. You can find even more hues online!

, If you found a “denim” color that is exactly the shade you want straight from the bottle, you can put that in your mixing bowl and get straight to work. Otherwise, you’ll be creating a custom color in your mixing bowl. You can mix silver and blue semi permanent dye, or dilute dark blue with conditioner to create a light blue color. You can add a splash of purple to add a lavender tone, or even a bit of green. Play around with your dyes until you’ve created a color you’d like for your hair.Make sure you mix up enough of your color to coat all of your hair. You may not be able to create the exact same shade again, unless you carefully write down your ratios of dyes and conditioner.
Remember, the lighter your hair is, the more this color will show up. Semi-permanent dye will simply stain your hair, so it will show up more in white hair than it would in brown hair.
On the same note, the lighter your hair dye is, the less it will show up in your hair. A dark denim color will show up more easily than a very pastel denim color.

, For this step, splitting your hair into a top, middle, and bottom section is fine. The important thing is that you are working with smaller sections at a time, so that you can ensure all of your strands are fully saturated with the dye. Hold sections out of the way with claw or duck bill hair clips.


If you have thick hair, you may need to create more sections.

, Start coating every piece and section of hair that you want dyed. You can brush the dye onto your hair with a dye brush, or you can even apply the dye to your hair directly with your hand. Massage your strands as you apply the blue dye to ensure that they are completely coated.


Use a handheld mirror to ensure you’ve gotten all of the hair in the back, as well.
Unless you want denim-colored hands, wear gloves during this step!

, Let the dye soak into your hair. Check your specific dye for instructions about how long to leave it on. The longer you leave the dye on, however, the more vivid it will be once you rinse it out. Keep in mind that your hair will be about one full shade lighter once you wash and dry your hair., Once the dye has been on your hair for as long as the packaging suggests – or when you’re satisfied with the color – it’s time to rinse. Skip the shampoo. Every time you use shampoo on your colored hair, the color will lighten. Instead, rinse it thoroughly and condition. Let your hair air dry, and then admire your denim hair!, Every time your hair gets wet, particularly every time it gets shampooed, your color will lighten. In other words, try to really limit your hair washing whenever you have dyed hair. Dry shampoo is an excellent way to fight grease and keep your hair looking (and smelling!) clean, without the water., When you do wash your hair, use your conditioner as a way to revitalize your color. Add some of your hair dye to your bottle of conditioner so that it reduces fading by actually depositing more color. When you condition, let it sit on your hair for a few minutes., Hot water actually causes the cuticle of the hair to open. Because the dye is in your cuticle, it will wash the dye straight out. If you really want to maintain your denim hair, cold water will be your best friend. The cuticle of your hair will stay closed, and the color will stay locked in for even longer."

",How to Dye Your Hair at Home," It is recommended that you stay within two to three shades of your natural hair color when dying at home. When deciding between two colors, always stick with the more conservative choice (the one that is closer to your natural color).









Do a strand test before dying your entire head of hair. Apply the dye to a one-inch section of your hair and check the final result under natural light before proceeding.












;
, Having another person apply the dye will ensure that you don't miss any spots and prevent the process from getting too messy.








, Follow the mixing instructions that come with your kit and transfer the mixed dye into a small bowl so that you can dip the paintbrush into it.








, Wrap a dark towel around your shoulders and fasten the ends together around your front. Alternatively, you can tear a hole into a large trash bag and pull it over your head.

Only use a towel that you wouldn't mind disposing of.













The person doing the dying should wear gloves to protect his or her hands. Latex gloves are usually included in dye kits.














, Use a comb to part your hair into two or four sections, depending on how thick your hair is.








, Apply the dye to one section of your hair at a time, making sure that you don't miss any spots.








, Leave the dye in for the designated time, being sure to keep your eye on the clock to make sure you don't leave it in too long.








, Once the necessary time has passed, shampoo your hair until there is no more color running from it. Apply the conditioner that comes with your kit or use a deep conditioner.

The final color will vary depending on how dark your natural hair is. People with very dark hair may end up with a bronze, kind of orange tint whereas people with light hair will get a blonde, highlighted effect.

, Brew very strong coffee or black tea, and then let the liquid return to room temperature. Pour it into a spray bottle, spritz it over your hair, and let it sit for 45 minutes to one hour.









Wash and condition your hair to remove the liquid.

, If you want to add dramatic color to your hair, you need look no further than your pantry! Kool-aid can be used for colored streaks, colored tips, or overall color.









Bring 2 cups of water to a boil in a large pot. Remove the pot from heat, and then empty 3-5 packets (depending on how rich you want the color to be) of unsweetened kool-aid into the water. Mix until the powder dissolves, and either dip your hair into the pot or transfer the water to a spray bottle and spritz it over the surface of your hair.
Leave the kool-aid in for 20-25 minutes and then immediately wash it out with shampoo and conditioner.

You can purchase a bleaching kit at your local beauty supply store. Bleaching kits come with bleach powder, developer, a mixing bowl, a brush, and plastic gloves.If your hair is very dark, you may need to bleach your hair more than once.

, Carefully pour the bleach powder into the mixing bowl, taking care not to spill any or inhale the powder. Then, slowly add the developer while mixing the two together with the brush. Make sure to scrape along the sides and bottom of the mixing bowl to get all of the powder blended thoroughly into the developer.Put on an old t-shirt now too! Bleach will damage any clothing it touches, so it’s best to put on something you don’t care about before starting.

, The easiest way to ensure you reach all of your hair and apply the bleach evenly is to clip your hair into four sections. Part your hair straight down the middle and then part it again across, so you’ve formed a big plus sign on your head. Clip away the three sections that you aren’t using, and focus on one at a time as you apply the bleach., Start with the back sections and work your way up the strands, doing the roots last. Bleach will process more quickly when exposed to heat, so the roots will actually bleach more quickly than the rest of your hair because of your body heat.Continue applying the bleach to each section, making sure every piece of hair is fully saturated.


If you drip a bit of bleach on your skin, wipe it off quickly with a wet paper towel.

, Let the bleach begin processing, keeping an eye on the clock and your hair. Your bleach kit should have suggestions about how long to wait before rinsing, but you can also watch your hair process and get an idea about how much your hair color has lifted. Check a strand sporadically to see how it is processing.Bleach can only lift your hair three to four shades lighter, so don’t leave it on too long hoping to achieve lighter hair.

, The best shampoo to use is a purple shampoo that will help to combat the brassiness of newly bleached hair. Rinse your hair in cold or lukewarm water, which will stop any tingling from the bleach, especially if it's on your hairline. Make sure that you’re washing it thoroughly so that every bit of bleach is completely rinsed out. Condition your hair, and let it air dry.Hot tools can cause more damage to fragile bleached hair, so it’s best to let it air dry when you can.

, Whenever you bleach your hair, it’s important to tone it as well. You can purchase a toner at any beauty supply store, and it will typically be sitting right next to the bleaching kits because it's always used in conjunction with them. A toner will remove the strands that look yellow or orange. You can use a toner immediately after bleaching, and it will not damage your hair. Toners are moisturizing, so don't worry about letting it sit on your strands. By using a toner, you will brighten your hair and make it look white, which is exactly what you want. Let the toner sit on your hair for about 30 minutes, and rinse again., If you have naturally dark hair, you will not be able to go to platinum blonde in one try. You will need to bleach your hair again. However, this process is damaging and you need to give your hair time and TLC in between bleachings.

This will act as a barrier between the dye and the skin, so you won’t be left with any unsightly staining.If you skip this step and it does get on your skin, don’t worry. It can be rinsed off with some soap, water, and elbow grease.

, Unlike the bleach, there is not an exact science to this. The important thing is that you thoroughly coat each and every strand of your hair with this dye. You can clip your hair into sections and paint each one carefully with the dye, or you can massage it into your hair almost like shampoo.Just make sure to keep checking that every strand and every section is completely saturated with the dye.


Use a handheld mirror to make sure that the back is fully covered.

, This dye will stain anything it contacts, so it’s important to protect your house and your clothing by covering your hair while the dye processes. The hair dye will be on for a long time, so it’s good to be careful. That way, you can still do things around the house while the dye works its magic.

, The longer the dye sits on your hair, the more vibrant and intense your color will end up. If you can, leave it on for a couple of hours. It’s a time commitment, but it will be worth it when you end up with an extremely bold result., Use cold water. Hot water will open the hair cuticle, causing it to release dye. Grab your go-to conditioner and massage it into your hair while your dye is still on so that it loosens up a bit. Continue rinsing your hair in cold water until the water runs completely clear., Every time you wash your hair, your color will fade a bit. Try to only wash it a couple of times a week. If your hair gets greasy, try using a dry shampoo. This will help keep your hair looking clean between washes., When you do wash your hair, use cold water. Hot water will cause your hair to lose dye, which will cause rapid fading. Instead, wash your body with warm water and then wash your hair last, using water as cold as you can tolerate. Your color will stay intense for much longer if you refrain from your normal, warm hair washes., This is a great way to boost your color a bit with every wash. Add a bit of your dye to your favorite conditioner, and give your bottle a good shake. Every time you condition your hair, let it soak for a couple of minutes. The dye in your conditioner will help to intensify your color and help reduce any fading., When you start to notice your color looking dull or patchy, simply apply the jewel tone dye to your hair again. However, do not bleach it every time you re-dye it. Not only will this kill your hair, it is simply not necessary. Once you have noticeable root outgrowth, you will need to bleach only your roots. Do not put bleach over any hair that has already been bleached.Because your hair will inevitably get damaged from bleaching, it's important to give it some extra TLC. Use deep conditioners and hair masks once or twice a week, and skip the blowdryers and hot tools as much as possible!

Preferably apply in the shower or the bathtub. This may even stain sinks, bathtubs or countertops, so just pour some water, or keep water running just in case., Then scoop some of the dye and apply it from root to tip. Try not to apply too liberally to the scalp.

Most good hair stylists do not recommend ombres because it dries out the ends of your hair so if you're looking for a natural way to ombre your hair just apply the dye from wherever you want the hair color to change.
It's perfectly alright to have some dye leftover. You can use it if you want to further lighten/amber your hair in the next application or you can throw it away.

, You may need to use larger or smaller sections depending on the thickness of your hair., If it is still dripping after 10 or so minutes, squeeze out the excess and wait for another 5 minutes. Then bunch up the hair at the top of your head and secure with a hair band., If its not staying, use another hair band to tie the ends together. For an extra lock, take some saran wrap and wrap around your head., If need be take another hair band and use it to secure the towel or t-shirt.

The reason that you are wrapping twice is because it helps keep the moisture in. Also, makes sure that you're not staining other people and things. For at least the first few hours, the heat from your scalp will help make the dye work into your hair follicles. If you are sleeping with this dye in your hair.

, If it does, don't worry. As long as you have left it on for a couple of hours it's fine.

If you don't want to keep sleep with the dye in your hair, just leave the wrap on during the day. For the best results, leave the dye in your hair for at least 8 hours. The longer you leave the dye in, the better it will work.

, How long the dye lasts can range from two or so weeks to permanent (will last until your hair grows out). This also ranges on how healthy your hair is.

, Some popular choices are bangs or front sections dyed, the underside of the hair, and tips. Dying all your hair could be very damaging and beware: the color may not look the same after a few weeks. Ensure that you want this color all over your hair.

, These can be found at Hot Topic, Spencer's, Static, etc. Some beauty supply stores stock a few of these colors also.

, The dye, even if not permanent to hair is VERY permanent to skin and does not look pretty, especially if you are dying your hair for a special occasion.

,, The rest of the hair should be secured so that no dye accidentally gets onto it. If you are dying all of your hair, skip this step.

, Dry hair with another old towel and comb it thoroughly. If using the same gloves throughout the process, rinse them also to make sure no bleach mixes with the dye. This produces an unsatisfactory color. If not, change your gloves.

, Starting from the scalp down, apply the dye to the sections until they are fully saturated. Do not apply so much that it drips onto the other part of your hair. To make sure it is even, use a comb to spread it out from root (or other starting point) to tip (or other ending point).

, Keep the gloves on and keep the hair and water away from the body and the rest of your hair, as it will stain.

For the salon method, familiarize yourself with the salons in your area. Costs and products will vary amongst salons. Look on their websites or call in to get a sense of what they're using and how much it will cost. Talking to a stylist in person will give you a clearer sense of what your process and cost will be.
Consider the box kit method only as a last resort. When making an extreme color change, especially once that involves extensive bleaching, there is a risk of ending up with a color very different from what you want, or even seriously damaging your hair.
For the box kit method, read online reviews to see specifically which box dyes work best on black hair. A popular box kit is L’Oréal Paris Preference Les Blondissimes LB01: Extra Light Ash Blonde. It won’t dye your hair platinum, but some people claim that it gets them down to an ashy blonde in one go.Using professional-quality products (bleach, developer, red gold corrector, and toner) is the preferred method amongst those who choose to bleach their hair at home. This method offers more flexibility and power than box dye kits, plus you have the opportunity to buy in bulk to save money.;
, Regardless of which method you choose, it will likely take multiple bleachings to achieve the gray tone that you want.


Definitely take the time and expense (i.e. multiple salon visits, multiple purchases of dye kits or professional dyeing materials) into consideration before you decide on which method to use.

, One DIY expert says that unless your hair is light to medium colored, and relatively short, thick and healthy, you should go to a salon to have your hair bleached. Once it’s bleached, however, you can do your roots on your own.Bleaching your hair will damage it, no matter what. That’s why it’s so important to start with the healthiest hair possible, regardless of whether you’re bleaching your hair at home or at the salon.
Even if your hair feels healthy now, you can make it healthier by avoiding using chemicals and heat on it in the weeks/months leading up to bleaching it. You might even try using a weekly deep-conditioning hair mask.

, In the weeks or months leading up to the bleaching, avoid using harsh hair products and chemicals, and heat styling tools on your hair. If your hair feels damaged, do weekly deep-conditioning masks until it feels healthy enough to be bleached.


Experts recommend waiting at least 2 weeks between applying any chemicals to your hair. This time frame may be shortened or lengthened depending on how healthy your hair looks and feels.Use good-quality shampoos and conditioners that moisturize your hair without adding buildup or stripping your hair of its natural oils. Look for: low pH, oil (argan, avocado, olive), glycerin, glyceryl stearate, propylene glycol, sodium lactate, sodium PCA, and alcohols that start with “c” or “s.”Avoid: strongly fragranced products, alcohols whose names include “prop”, sulfates, and any products that claim to add volume to your hair., If you decide to dye your hair gray at home, you’ll need to start by bleaching it. The following materials can be purchased from a beauty supply store (Sally Beauty Supply is a popular one) or online:


Bleach powder: This comes in packets or tubs. If you plan on bleaching your hair more than once, a tub is the cheaper long-term option.
Cream developer: Cream developer reacts with the powder to bleach your hair. It comes in different volumes ranging from 10 (weakest) to 40 (strongest); the higher the volume, the quicker it will turn your hair blonde, but also the more damaging it will be.

Many stylists recommend using 10 to 20 volume. It will take longer for the mixture to lighten your hair, but it will also be much less damaging than using the higher volumes.
If you have fine, fragile hair, use a 10-volume developer. For dark, coarse hair, a 30- or 40-volume developer might be necessary.A 20-volume developer is your safest bet for effectiveness and gentleness, so if in doubt, choose that one!Do not use a 50-volume developer at home.


Red gold corrector (optional): Red gold correctors often come in little packages that you can add to your bleaching mixture to help reduce brassiness. This is an optional step, but it’s highly recommended as the whiter your hair, the better the gray color will turn out., Toners are what take your hair from yellow to white, which is the ideal base for gray. They come in a variety of shades, including blue, silver and purple. Even if you’re not dyeing your hair at home, a toner can be used every few weeks to maintain your color.


You can use toners to neutralize unwanted colors in your hair and remove brassiness. For example, to neutralize hair that’s too golden, choose a toner shade that’s opposite gold on the color wheel, such as a blue or violet ash-based toner.Some toners need to be mixed with developers before being applied to your hair, while others come ready to apply. Both types are effective, so just choose whichever you appeals to you.

, You should be able to find this at your local beauty shop, but if you can’t, online retailers like Amazon sell professional-quality brands of gray hair dye. If you purchase it online, pay attention to reviews.


If the veins on the underside of your wrist look blue or purple, opt for a cool white gray tone; if your veins look green or yellow, go for a warmer, steely gray., If you’re bleaching, toning, and dyeing your hair at home, you’ll need an applicator/tint brush, a plastic mixing bowl, a plastic spoon, gloves, plastic hair clips, towels, and plastic wrap or a plastic shower cap. Avoid metal tools as these will react with the bleach.

, Purple shampoos and conditioners specifically made for gray hair can help keep it toned and reduce the chances of some of your strands fading to yellow/blonde.If these aren't available to you, at least buy shampoos and conditioners that are designed for colored hair.


Your best bet is to purchase professional shampoos and conditioners, rather than drug store brands. Ask your stylist to recommend products formulated for gray or bleached hair.
Some shampoos can even deposit color into your locks as you use them. If you would prefer not to use a color-depositing shampoo, at least buy a color-depositing treatment to help keep your color fresh and reduce the money you spend on re-dyeing your hair., A patch test is necessary to make sure that you’re not allergic to anything in the bleach mixture. A strand test will help you calculate how long you need to leave the bleach mixture on your hair.


To do a patch test, create a tiny amount of the mixture you will use on your hair and place a small dab of it behind your ear. Leave it for 30 minutes, wipe any excess off, then try not to touch it or get it wet for 48 hours. If after 48 hours that area of skin is fine, go ahead with bleaching your hair.
To do a strand test, prepare a small amount of the bleach mixture and apply it to a strand of your hair. Check it every 10 to 15 minutes until it reaches the desired color. Note the time it took to reach this color so that you have an idea of how long it will take on your whole head.
If you only do one test, do the patch test. A severe allergic reaction could be fatal., Rub some extra virgin coconut oil between your palms to warm it up, then massage it into your hair and scalp. You needn’t wash the oil out before bleaching.


Leave the coconut oil on your hair for at least three hours before bleaching. If possible, leave it on your hair overnight, the night before you bleach your hair.
Coconut oil is an effective hair moisturizer because it is made up of molecules that are small enough to penetrate the hair shaft., Wear old clothes that you don't mind staining and drape an old towel over your shoulders. You will also need to protect your skin from the bleach mixture, which can cause burning and irritation. Wear flexible, disposable rubber gloves to protect your hands.


Have a small stack of old towels ready in case you need to clean the bleach mixture off your skin or elsewhere.

, Using a plastic spoon, place as much bleach powder as you need in a plastic mixing bowl. The powder should come with easy-to-follow instructions.


If the powder doesn’t come with instructions, use roughly a 1:1 ratio between the powder and the developer cream. Add one scoop of powder and then one scoop of developer, mixing them as you go, until you have enough.

, Add the correct amount of developer to the bowl containing the powder, and mix the two together with a plastic spoon. Aim for a thick, creamy consistency, similar to gravy.


Unless stated otherwise on the packaging, the ratio of developer to powder should be roughly 1:1 — 1 spoonful of powder per 1 spoonful of developer., This step is optional, but it can help reduce brassiness and make your hair whiter, which will help you achieve a better gray. Once the powder and developer are combined, add some red gold corrector to the bleach-developer mixture. Read the package instructions for how much you need to add.

, Use a tint brush to apply the mixture to your hair. Work with 1- to 2-inch strips of hair and start at your ends, brushing the mixture upwards and leaving roughly an inch of roots (you’ll do these last).


It is important that you leave your roots for last. The warmth of your scalp will cause your roots to develop (lighten) faster than the rest of your hair.
Work from the back of your head to the front of your head. This will make it much easier to keep track of what hair you’ve already applied bleach/dye too. It will also help prevent the bleach mixture from getting on your clothes.
Unless your hair is quite short, use clips to section of your hair as you work on it. Be sure to use plastic (not metal) clips, since metal can react to the bleach mixture.

, Once you’ve applied the bleach mixture to all of your hair, including your roots, check to ensure that your hair is fully saturated with the mixture.


You can do this by massaging your hair around your head and feeling for any spots that are dryer than the rest. When you come across these spots, add some more of the bleach mixture to them and massage it into your strands — avoid massaging it into your scalp, though, as this can cause irritation.
Use a mirror to help you get a clear view of the back of your head.

, You can also use a clear plastic shower cap. As the bleach works, your scalp may begin to itch and sting. This is normal.


If the tingling and stinging on your scalp become too painful, remove the plastic wrap and wash out the bleach. If your hair is still too dark, you can try to bleach it again with a lower-volume developer in 2 weeks if it's healthy enough.
Avoid the temptation to apply any heat to your hair at this point, as applying heat could end with your hair falling out completely.

, After 15 minutes, check a strand of hair to see how the bleaching has progressed. Spritz the strand of hair with water from a spray bottle and use a towel to wipe some of the bleach mixture away so that you can clearly see the color of the strand.


If your hair still looks dark, reapply more bleach to the strand of hair, replace the plastic wrap and allow it to sit for another 10 minutes.
Continue checking your hair every 10 minutes until it has become completely blonde.

, If you do, your hair may break off and/or fall out completely. Bleach is capable of dissolving hair, so be very careful with it.

, Remove the plastic wrap/cap and run your head under cool water until all traces of the bleach are gone. Wash, condition, and rinse your hair, then gently squeeze the water from it with a clean towel.

, Your hair should be a pale or bright shade of yellow. If it is yellow, proceed to the instructions for toning your hair. If your hair is orange or still dark, you will need to bleach it again, waiting at least 2 weeks between bleachings.Remember that the darker the blonde, the darker the gray will be, so bleach your hair as light as you want your gray shade to be.
Note that you won’t need to reapply the bleach to your roots if your roots are whiter than the rest of your hair. Just apply the bleach to the parts you want to lighten further.
You may even want to stretch the bleaching process over several weeks. Depending on how dark, coarse and thick your hair is, it could take up to 5 bleachings to turn it pale yellow., Just like with the bleaching process, you should wear old clothes and gloves. Have a stack of towels handy and make sure your hair is completely dry before starting.

, If your toner comes premixed and ready to use, you can skip this step. In a clean plastic mixing bowl, mix the toner and developer according to the instructions on the packaging.


The ratio is usually 1 part toner to 2 parts developer.

, Use your tinting brush to paint your hair with the toner, following the same technique as when you applied the bleach (ends to roots, back to front).

, Work your hands through your hair to ensure that the toner is saturating your hair and evenly applied.


Use a mirror to have a look at the back of your head to make sure the toner is fully covering your hair.

, Allow the toner to sit in your hair for the length of time specified on the packaging. Depending on the strength of the toner and the color of your hair, it could take as little as 10 minutes for your hair to go white.

, Depending on the type of toner you use and how on light your hair already is, the toner could work more quickly or slowly than expected.


Check your hair every 10 minutes to ensure that you don’t end up with blue hair: use a towel to scrape some toner off a thin strand of hair to get a sense of what color it’s going. If your hair’s not the desired color yet, reapply toner to that strand and put it back up beneath the plastic cap/wrap.

, Run your hair under cool water until all traces of the toner are gone. Shampoo and condition as normal, and gently squeeze the water from your hair with a clean towel.

, Let your hair air dry or, if you are impatient, dry it with your blow dryer’s coolest setting. Now that the bleaching and toning processes are complete, your hair should be white.


If you missed a spot, wait a few days and repeat the process on the strand of hair in question.

, If you’re less fussy about what color of gray your hair turns out to be, you can skip the strand test. The patch test, however, is absolutely necessary, as an allergic reaction could be fatal.To do a strand test, follow the manufacturer’s instructions for the specific dye that you buy. It generally requires rubbing a small amount of the developer (or the entire mixture, in some cases) on a patch of skin behind your ear, then leaving it for 48 hours.

, Wear old clothes and an old towel over your shoulders, and wear rubber gloves (vinyl and latex disposable gloves are popular). Have some old hand towels nearby in case you need to wipe dye off your skin.


You may even want to rub a bit of petroleum jelly or thick moisturizer around your hairline to prevent the dye from staining your skin.

, Exactly what you need to do to prepare your dye mixture will depend on the specific type of gray hair dye that you purchase. Some box kits are available, although most DIY home hair dye aficionados swear by professional-quality products.


As with bleaching your hair at home, use a plastic bowl and a tint brush to mix your dye.

, Read the instructions on the box to learn whether your hair needs to be wet or dry during application, as this differs depending on which dye you use. If your hair is long, clip it into sections.


Consider using plastic clips to separate your hair into 8 sections — 4 on each side, moving vertically from the nape of your neck up to your forehead. If your hair is particularly thick, you may need even more sections (at least 2 additional ones on the front sides of your head).

, Using the tint brush, brush the dye on to 2-inch sections of your hair, moving up from the ends toward the roots. Stop roughly a half-inch to an inch from your roots.


The warmth from your scalp causes the color on your roots to process more quickly, so you’ll save your roots for last.

, Once the lengths of your hair are covered in dye, go back around your head and cover all of your roots.

, Once you’ve covered all of your hair in dye, use a mirror to check the back of your head and ensure even application. Gently work your hands through your hair and feel for even distribution.


If you come across any spots that feel dry, add more dye.

, Cover your hair with plastic wrap or a shower cap and wait for the dye to process. The processing time will differ depending on which dye you’re using. Thirty minutes is an average processing time.

, Some dye manufacturers will suggest a general processing timeframe — for example, between 20 and 40 minutes. After 20 minutes, you could wipe a small amount of color off a strand with a towel and check on the color.


If you’re happy with the color, you can wash it out, if you’d like it to be richer, reapply dye to the strand and leave it on longer. Just make sure you don’t go over the recommended processing time, as this could damage your hair or even make it fall out.
If you're unsure of how long to leave the color on your hair, you’re best off doing a patch test beforehand. That will give you a good idea of how long to leave the dye on to get the color you want.

, Once the color has processed, rinse it out with cool water, then shampoo and condition as normal.

, After washing your hair, gently squeeze the water out with a towel — don’t rub your hair quickly or be otherwise rough with your hair while drying it. You’ll also want to avoid heat styling it for as long as possible after dyeing it.


Ideally, you’ll avoid heat styling your hair all together.

, Remember that you will need to actively care for your hair now that it’s been bleached. Adding the gray color to it will have helped bring some life back into your hair, but it will still be delicate.

, Bleached hair is fragile and damaged hair, even if it is in the best condition it can be. Take care of your hair, don't shampoo it if it feels dry and don't go overboard on the brushing, straightening and curling.


Most of the time, you’ll want to let your hair air dry. If you must blowdry your hair, be sure to use the coolest setting.
Avoid applying heat or otherwise manipulating your natural hair texture as much as possible, as this can cause your hair to break off — you could end up with chunks of hair sticking out from your head that are only an inch or two long.If you simply must straighten your hair, you can achieve a straightening effect with a blow dryer and a round brush — do this as an alternative to using a straightener. If done properly, this technique should eliminate the need to use a straightening iron.You’ll want to comb your hair with a wide-tooth comb., Bleached hair is porous and can more easily be discolored by water. Priming your hair before you wash it will help repel the water and protect your color.


Pre-wash primers can be purchased at salons, beauty supply shops, drugstores, and online. They often contain oils, for example coconut or almond oil, to help boost your hair’s moisture before washing., Many specialists recommend washing you hair only once a week after bleaching it.Shampoo strips your hair of its natural oils, and your bleached hair will likely need all the oil it can get.


If you regularly work out/sweat or use a lot of products in your hair, you can likely bump this up to twice a week. You can also substitute dry shampoo for a wash.
When you dry your hair, gently pat and squeeze it with a towel — don’t rub the towel quickly over your head as this can cause more damage to your hair., Use products specially made for bleached, color-treated, and damaged hair: a purple toning shampoo and a deep conditioner at the very least. Avoid products that volumize your hair, as these can dry it out.


A good hair oil will keep your hair looking softer and less frizzy. Some people swear by extra virgin coconut oil to reduce frizz and help condition their hair.

, Avoid drugstore brands as these may only coat your hair, leaving it feeling waxy and weighed down. Ask your stylist to recommend a professional deep conditioning treatment.

, Try to renew your color when your roots are an inch at the longest. This will help keep your hair looking more even. If you let your roots grow longer, it may be more difficult to touch them up without having them clash against the rest of your hair.

, The process for bleaching, toning, and dyeing your roots is almost exactly the same as for doing your entire head. The only difference is that you’ll be doing just your roots, and not the rest of your hair.


If the rest of your color needs a touchup, after bleaching your roots you can apply the toner to all of your hair, then after that’s rinsed out, apply the gray dye to your whole hair, too. This time though, start at the roots and work down, since the roots will need more color.
Some experts recommend leaving a bit of roots at all times just to keep your scalp and hair follicles healthier. If you choose to do this, you’ll never apply the bleach to your entire roots, as you’ll be wanting to keep it off your scalp.

Prepare to have to cut off some of your hair.",How to Dye Naturally Black Hair Silver1," This may seem like a major commitment, but if you want your new gray hair to look good this is the way to do it. You want to give your hair time to grow its way out of whatever previous color you were using for as long as possible. Otherwise it’s going to be much harder for the bleach to lift your hair to an even color all the way around. If you don’t currently dye your hair, you can skip this step.;
, You can have this done at your local hair salon. Using bleach is really hard on your hair. This is a preemptive measure to ensure that your hair doesn’t get as dry and damaged, or at least less than it would have been otherwise. Deep conditioning can help reduce breakage. , This will allow the natural oils in your hair to build up, which can help you protect your scalp from the irritation that the bleach may cause.

, Even with all these steps, be mentally prepared that you will have to cut off some broken or damaged hair after using the bleach. You may lose a little bit of length in the process, but it won’t be extremely drastic. Still, you don’t want to be surprised when it happens. Make sure your hair is at a length that you would be comfortable losing some.

Choose a subtle color change.,
Select a quality hair dye.,
Mix the hair color with developer.,
Brush on the color.,
Rinse out.",How to Dye Men's Hair," Unfortunately, obviously dyed hair can be a source of embarrassment for men in many societies. To avoid this, stick with colors close to your natural hair color, at most one or two shades lighter or darker. Aim for a dye one or two shades darker than the final result you're going for, to allow for fading.


If there are natural reddish tones in your hair, find a dye with warm tones.
If there are no reddish tones, select dye with cool tones. Ash tones work well for most men.;
, Most over the counter products give inconsistent results. Look for professional, brush-on products instead. Use a hair color product intended for men.


Pick up a coloring brush as well while you're shopping. If this doesn't come with your hair color product, you can buy one at a beauty salon.

, Refer to your product label for mixing instructions. Men's hair can be resistant to accepting color. To ensure a deeper color deposit, consider increasing the ratio of hair color to developer, and using a developer with higher volume. This may not be necessary for all men or all hair dye products.


For example, if your product calls for a 1:1 ratio of color and developer (20gm color and 20mL developer), consider boosting this to a 3:2 ratio (20gm color and 10mL developer). When making this change, use a developer with a higher ""volume"" (e.g. 30 instead of 20).

, Dunking your head in dye will create an obvious, artificial look. Instead, use your coloring brush to apply the dye. Pay close attention to the temples and sides of the head, leaving some natural color visible.


You can instead apply the color to a comb using a tint brush. Delicately comb through your hair for subtle color coverage.

, Check the product label to find out how long to leave the dye in. For a more natural look, reduce this amount of time. Rinse off the dye in a wide sink or bathtub to minimize splashing.

Wash your hair.,
Buy a good quality hair colour remover.,
Don't bleach your hair.,
So, pop in your colour remover, if you have black hair you'll end up with a mousy brown, brown hair and you'll end up orangey.. but hey, we're getting rid of that black!,
Select your new hair colour (Wisely!),
Because now you NEED to give your hair some major TLC, splash out on some really lush conditioner, and a really mild colour preserving shampoo.",How to Dye over a Dark Hair Dye," If you've just dyed your hair and it's too dark, the best thing you can do for your hair is wash repeatedly with an anti dandruff shampoo,. It will take the matte colour out and lighten you up a bit first - anything to avoid chemicals is something you should get very excited about if you want your hair to stay healthy.;
, If you've had dark dye in for quite some time and you're having trouble getting any other colour, you need to spend some cash, not a lot, but you will need to invest in a QUALITY 'hair colour remover' that takes the false pigment out of your tresses. Goldwell have a great colour remover but their stock is hard to find outside of a salon. Most pharmacies and beauty stores will stock removers, just be sure the ingredients don't sound too harsh. One pointer is to try to avoid products that contain a lot of 'hydrogen peroxide' - go for boxes that contain HP in a low volume.

, EVER. Not only are the chemicals really bad for you to be breathing in and absorbing through your pores, you WILL kill your hair. It will dry up like cotton wool, snap off and fall out. You may as well be setting fire to it.

, sacrifice!

, and apply. It is well worth reading up on selecting DIY hair colours, how they work and never to gauge the outcome by those little diagrams on the box! Unless your hair is platinum blonde to start with, you will never get the result on the box. Always select something around 2 shades lighter than what you're after - so look at the picture on the box and imagine it a few tones darker and you have a better idea. Most colours you buy at retailers don't lighten unless they are specific 'pre-lighteners' or blonding kits, they simply put a layer over your existing colour. (On the note of the 'pre-lightener' - it is just a fancy name for a bleaching kit - and you know how I feel about this! Run in the opposite direction)

, When I dye, I buy treatment masks by John Frieda, also Andrew Collinge 3 Minute Miracle is good, Klorane Mango Butter conditioner and because I'm a (fake) redhead John Frieda's Radiant Red conditioner, as it gives you a little colour boost each time you use it and makes your hair nice and shiny. I know this sounds like I'm trying to sell products here, but I'm not, I simply know what works and what doesn't through lots of trial and error, and finally know what my hair loves.

If so, leave a few inches of hair close to your scalp (or however much you prefer) untouched with each section you paint.
Make sure to wear gloves and follow all safety precautions that came with your lightening kit. Check your hair with gloved hands every five to ten minutes. Never leave bleach on your hair for longer than 45 minutes.
Fine hair lightens easier than coarse hair. Thus fine hair will process faster than coarse hair., Shampoo the hair to fully cleanse your hair of the mixture. Don’t use conditioner at this point. Towel dry your hair., Any sections of hair you’ll be using the opal technique on must be a clean blonde rather than brassy or orangish.If your hair is still orange rather than yellow, you’ll need to tone out the orange and/or lighten your hair more., Combine an ashy toner with a purple- or silver-based shampoo and conditioner. Mix one part conditioner to 1/4 part toner or semi-permanent hair dye. Apply it with a brush and let it sit for fifteen to twenty minutes before rinsing it out.Condition your hair and wait a least a week before lightening your hair with bleach again. When you reapply the bleach, leave it in until your hair becomes yellow (about twenty to thirty minutes). Then rinse it out completely right away.

, The goal is to achieve a silver blonde hue. Combine an ash blonde toner with 10 volume developer in a bowl. Use a 1:2 ratio. Stir it well with a brush., Make four equal sections and clip them up. Prepare sheets of tin foil and a new hair coloring brush for applying the base color. Begin dyeing the front sections of your hair first.


Wear gloves whenever you’re using hair dye. Make sure you’re in well-ventilated area (such as a bathroom with the fan on and/or window open). Have a damp paper towel nearby to wipe away any dye that gets on your face or neck.

, Do this section by section, making sure to coat the hair thoroughly. If you’re only dying the ends of your hair, just look for the lightened portions and paint them., Once the appropriate amount of time has elapsed, thoroughly wash the color out of your hair.

Alternately, you can use purchase pre-mixed pastel colors., Brush different pastel shades onto sections of your hair in streaks. Alternate between thin and chunky sections. Let your inner artist take over by blending complimentary pastels on top of each other.For example, blend pale lavender into light yellow or green to achieve a look of iridescence.
Optionally, you can use pieces of foil as a backing when you’re brushing on colors.

, Mix the colors in separate bowls. You can skip adding conditioner, or add a small amount of white conditioner. Create a rich green, blue and purple, each with its own brush and bowl.The rich colors should be accents to the pastel. For example, brush a bit of a vivid color on the end of a section already colored with pastel.

If your hair becomes weighed down and greasy, use the treatment less often.

, Use a moisturizing, sulfate-free shampoo. Once in a while, use a purple or blue toning shampoo. If you use the latter too often, the purple or blue can begin to tint your hair. But if you lather with it only occasionally, it will prevent your hair from shifting to beige.Invest in a quality, sulfate-free conditioner and a salon grade shampoo for colored hair.Use a blue or purple toning shampoo a few times per month., Touch up your roots every four to eight weeks, or as needed.

This degree of bleaching will likely damage your hair, so you will want it to start out as healthy as possible. If you've recently bleached your hair or used permanent dyes, avoid further chemical processing for about three months.If your hair is already extremely light in color, you can skip ahead directly to dyeing without having to wait.
Your hair doesn't have to be naturally platinum blonde to go straight to dyeing it gray. If your hair has already been bleached, then it's ready to go.;
, When bleaching darker hair to platinum blonde, some damage will be unavoidable. Since the ends of your hair are most likely to become dry and damaged during bleaching, you may need to trim them off when you're finished. Make sure you have an extra inch or two of hair you're comfortable with losing., With the silver trend in full swing, you have many different dyes to choose from. Do you want a light silver or a gunmetal gray? Do you want natural-looking neutral gray or an otherworldly shade with a hint of blue? Browse beauty blogs for reviews and pictures of how each dye looks. Pick the dye you like most.


In addition to permanent dyes, certain pale purple and blue semi-permanent dyes and hair toners will also turn platinum hair gray. However, keep in mind that these types of coloring only last a couple of weeks. Luckily, since these treatments are very gentle, you can simply reapply them as needed without having to wait.

, Even though silver hair is gaining popularity, it can still be difficult to find gray hair dye in brick and mortar shops. You will likely need to purchase your dye through a website. Remember that shipping will take a while, so plan accordingly. In addition to the dye, you will also need a deep conditioner, a bleach kit, and a purple toner.

, Both bleach and, to a lesser extent, permanent hair dye will dry out your hair by lifting away its natural oils. In order to minimize damage, you will need to make sure your hair is as well-moisturized as possible with a deep conditioning.


The exact instructions for your deep conditioner will vary. Check the product's packaging for details. In general, you will apply a large dollop to clean hair and massage it in as you would shampoo. Leave it to set under a bathing cap for 10 to 30 minutes before rinsing. Allow your hair to air dry afterwards.
Semi-permanent dyes and most toners are unlikely to dry out hair. These products do not penetrate the hair's outer layer and instead simply deposit pigment to only the surface of the hair.

, Don't bleach hair that is freshly washed. The bleaching process will dry your hair out significantly, potentially causing damage and breakage. Your hair's natural oils will prevent this. A freshly-washed scalp is also much more sensitive and will itch more during bleaching., Your bleach kit will have two main components: dry powdered bleach and a hydrogen peroxide solution. Mix equal amounts of the two using a tint brush or plastic spoon.


Follow the instructions on your kit if they are different from what is described here.
Developers come in different strengths rated by numbered ""volumes."" If your hair is already fairly light, use volume 10. Volume 20 is for darker blondes, volume 30 for light browns, and volume 40 for darker browns and black., If you've never bleached your hair to platinum blonde before, you will need to know how long it takes your hair to lighten. Cut a strand of hair close to the roots at an inconspicuous place and tie it together with a rubber band. Brush on some bleach using a tiny brush. Let the bleach set and check the strand every 5 to 10 minutes.If your hair is not light enough after an hour, you will need to do multiple rounds of bleaching. Rinse the bleach away between rounds and reapply it. To minimize damage, do not leave bleach in your hair for over an hour.

, Use a tint brush to apply your bleach mixture evenly to your hair. Work in sections, brushing in the direction your hair grows.


Start from the very back of your head and work your way forward, leaving the sections of hair that frame your face for the end.
If your hair is thick, flip up each section to expose the next layer of hair underneath and apply there, too.
Leave about a one-inch section around your roots to do last, after the face-framing strands. The heat from your scalp will cause your roots to bleach a little faster than your normal hair.
Try to go as quickly as possible to ensure an even color., Refer back to the results of your strand test to determine how long you should leave the bleach in your hair. Cover your hair up with either a shower cap or plastic wrap while you wait. Keep in mind that a little itchiness on your scalp is normal., Use warm water without shampoo. Be very careful to not get any bleach in your eyes as you rinse. If possible, ask someone to rinse your hair for you in a sink while you look up as if you were in a salon.


If you aren't immediately moving on to the next step, allow your hair to air dry. Blow drying can further strip your hair of moisture,potentially exacerbating any damage the bleach has caused.

, While toner will wash out eventually, you probably don't want a ring of purple skin framing your face for the next week or so. Scoop up a dollop of petroleum jelly or another thick moisturizer with your index finger and run it along any skin that is normally in contact with your hair. (Don't forget your ears!) The petroleum jelly will block your skin from absorbing the dye.


If you didn't bleach immediately before this step, remember that your hair should be unwashed. Color will grip dirty hair better than it will hair that is clean., After you've bleached your hair, it will likely be a pale yellow. Because purple is at the opposite side of the color wheel, purple toner will balance out the ""brassiness"" of yellow. The end result will be closer to a neutral white and ready for the gray dye.Wear gloves when applying toner to avoid staining your hands.
Begin with damp hair. If you haven't just done the bleach step, wet your hair with some lukewarm water.
Dip a tint brush into your toner. If your toner is packaged in a bottle, squeeze it into a bowl first.
Brush the toner on from roots to tips.
Start with the hair in back of your head and work forward.
Make sure all of your hair is evenly coated. If your hair is thick, clip already-coated hair to the side to get to the layer underneath.

, You don't have to cover your hair, but a cap or plastic wrap will help to prevent staining. After 20 minutes, rinse the toner out with warm water.Wrap a towel around your hair and gently squeeze out the excess water.


If you're using permanent hair dye, allow your hair to air dry first.
If your dye is semi-permanent, apply it while your hair is still damp., Reapply your petroleum jelly barrier first if it was washed away while rinsing out the toner. With a tinting brush, apply your gray dye in the same way you did your toner. At this stage, be especially careful to keep application even.


Wear gloves when applying dye.

, Run your hair under warm water until the water begins to run clear. Rinsing in the shower should be fine and is unlikely to stain your skin. Shampoo is unnecessary (and may cause your color to run), but you should finish with a conditioner.


Remember that each hair dye brand may vary in application. Always check your dye's packaging for specific instructions.

Choose the best brands to avoid cheap products. Remember that good quality will increase your chances of protecting your hair from damage. Protein/keratin based conditioners are recommended.;
, For less damage to your hair while dyeing it blonde, space out several bleaching sessions over a few weeks. If you have dark brown or black dye permanently layered on your hair, semi-permanent dyes are great for temporary use.


Semi-permanent dyes gradually wash out, especially when the hair is patchy in color beneath the dye. For a more vibrant shade, leave it in for about an hour. Completing that step will also help the dye last longer with washes.

, Purchase a good brand, making sure that it has plenty of good, helpful reviews. Keep in mind that some products - despite their popularity and excellent appearances - may not be the best choices for your hair. Purchase a bleach that has a reasonable price.


Schwartzkopf Live XXL blonde dye in Max Blonde/Absolute Platinum is a good choice.

The natural oils present in unwashed hair will help to protect your scalp and roots from the hair dye, especially when you get to the red layer.The hair dye will also penetrate your hair better and the results will be more vibrant if your hair isn’t squeaky clean when you color it.


If you must wash your hair before you dye it, use shampoo only and skip the conditioner. Hair dye has a hard time attaching itself to recently conditioned hair.;
, Skip the grocery store aisle and pick up your dyes at a beauty supply store. These dyes are usually salon-grade products and will produce better results. Opt for liquid formulas over mousse formulas for this – liquid black dye will result in a darker and more opaque black than a mousse formula.If you’ve never dyed your hair before, use a semi-permanent black dye the first time. If you’re more experienced, feel free to use permanent color.
If you are a natural blonde, you may want to dye your hair dark brown first, then black. Sometimes black dye on naturally blonde hair can result in a greenish tinge.

, How much black and how much red you want is a completely personal choice – there is no “right” way to create this look. As a general rule of thumb, you can start by putting your hair in a half-ponytail. Scoop it all up, starting at your ears, and hold it back in the same place you’d put a ponytail.


For a slightly more subtle result, pick up a little more hair after you have it in a half-ponytail.
Make sure to evaluate the different thickness options before you begin dyeing. It’s best not to make any impulse decisions when you’re in the middle of the process.

, Use a hand mirror or have a friend help you so that everything looks even after you separate the top layer from the bottom. Clip your hair firmly into place to avoiding having to deal with wispy pieces falling down while you’re coloring it.


Make sure that you clip back all of the face-framing pieces of your hair. These pieces need to be dyed black so that the red layer will appear to be “underneath” the black layer., Line a sheet of foil up directly beneath the top layer of your hair. It should hang down over the bottom layer. Make sure the foil extends down at least half the length of your hair. Curl the edges of the foil over the sides of your hair. Clip the foil in place on each side, so the foil will stay in place.The foil should be right beneath the top layer, protecting the uppermost part of the bottom layer.
If you feel confident that you can apply the black dye without getting it on the bottom layer of your hair, you can skip the foil.

, Follow the instructions that came with the dye for mixing and developing it. Wear gloves the entire time and keep a towel secured around your shoulders to protect your skin. To protect the dye from staining your face, apply a thick lotion or a layer of petroleum jelly around your hairline before you begin.

, Start in the front of your hair and work with one section of hair at a time. Pull a chunk of your hair out of the clip and apply the black dye to the section, taking care to saturate your hair with the dye from root to tip. Use bobby pins or hair clips to pin the finished sections out of the way so you can easily get to the rest.You can twist each completed section into a mini-bun and pin the sections like that, if you like.

, Pin the sections up as you finish them so that they are kept away from the bottom layer of your hair. Follow the directions included with the box of dye and leave it on your hair for the recommended length of time. Keep a towel wrapped around your shoulders in case the dye drips onto your skin.


As soon as you finish applying the dye, set a timer for the time span the product recommends.

, Before you rinse the dye out, gather the bottom layer of your hair and secure it in a low ponytail. This will keep it out of the way as you finish with the top section. You will need to lean forward and put your head under the water stream to rinse out the dye. Once you’re leaning forward, remove the clips and bobby pins and start rinsing your hair.


Don’t get the bottom layer of your hair wet and keep it out of the way.
It may be easier if you have a friend help you with this part.
Rinse your hair until the water runs clear.

, Squeeze out the excess water, then put a towel in between the top layer and the bottom layer. Flip your hair over and it will fall on the towel without touching the bottom layer of your hair. Squeeze out as much water as you can and towel dry it gently. Blow dry the top layer of your hair as you normally would.


Keep the bottom portion of your hair in the low ponytail throughout this process.
After your black layer is completely dry, clip the hair up again so that you can move on to dyeing the bottom layer.

, Most of the bright, unnatural dye colors available are semi-permanent dyes. Unless you have natural light blonde hair, you will need to bleach the bottom layer of your hair before you dye it red for the color to show up.

Bleaching is not as easy as dyeing your hair. Far more chemicals are involved and these chemicals can burn your skin and severely damage your hair.

, Begin with completely dry hair – never bleach damp or wet hair.Read the directions that came with your bleach product carefully. Follow them exactly. Wear the gloves provided and be extremely careful while you apply the bleach and when you rinse it out. Rinse the bleach out with lukewarm water until the water runs clear.


Make sure you are working in a well-ventilated area, since bleach fumes are quite strong.

, Run a wide-toothed comb through your hair to remove any tangles. Let your hair air dry about halfway before moving on to the red dye. You don’t want to apply the red to completely dry hair, but it shouldn’t be soaking wet either., Read and follow the directions for application. Place an old towel around your shoulders before you begin to protect your body. Once you’ve got the red dye on your hair, leave it on for as long as you can.


Semi-permanent dye is not damaging to the hair, and the longer you leave it on, the brighter the red will be. Try to leave it on your hair for at least three hours., You should still have your top layer securely clipped on top of your head. Follow the directions that came with the dye for rinsing it out. You may need to rinse it out with your head turned sideways beneath the faucet to avoid wetting the rest of your hair. Keep rinsing until the water runs clear.Gently towel dry your hair. Allow it to air dry or take down the top layer and style your hair as you normally would.
You may want to avoid sleeping on a light-colored pillowcase for a few days to avoid staining.

, Vibrant hair dyes fade easily. Do everything you can to preserve your color for as long as possible. Use sulfate-free hair products. Look for shampoos and conditioners that advertise as being “color-protecting.” Wash your hair less frequently and always do so in cold water.Avoid getting your hair wet in a swimming pool, since chlorine can wreak havoc on vibrant colors., Bleach dries hair out and, if you aren’t careful, it can damage it and cause significant breakage. Once you start bleaching your hair, you must take very good care of it to maintain its health. Get a good deep conditioner and apply it one or two times per week.

, Hair masks are similar to deep conditioners because they are highly moisturizing, but they usually include proteins and other ingredients formulated to strengthen your hair. A weekly deep-conditioning mask can help to rehydrate dry hair and restore hair cuticles that have been damaged by the bleaching process.


Look for products that contain ingredients like glycerin, vitamin E, shea butter, proteins, Argan oil, keratin, avocado oil, Moroccan oil and coconut oil., Heat opens the hair cuticle and lifts the color out, so limit your use of blow dryers, flat irons and curling irons. When you are using these tools, make sure to use a heat protectant spray on your hair first. It will create a barrier between your hair and the heat.


After bleaching, your hair is going to be much drier than before. This means it can burn more easily. Use heated tools with care., Vibrant colors will begin to fade within a few weeks, unfortunately. However, to revive the red color, you won’t need to repeat the bleaching process – at least, not for a while. Simply apply the red dye to your faded hair and rinse it out as you did the first time.Depending on how well your hair originally took the red dye, you may need to touch up your color as frequently as every other week.Do not bleach your hair every time you need to touch up the color. This will severely damage your hair.
Pay attention to the condition of your hair and only repeat the bleaching process when it’s healthy and strong enough to withstand the harsh chemicals.

The choice depends on the look you’re going for with your hair.Oil based pomades tend to be the a bit less expensive than water based pomades. They give a much greasier and shinier look than water based, and they typically have a much stronger hold. The negative side is that oil based pomades are water insoluble, so it won’t wash out with just water. It’s also hard to get it out by washing with shampoo as well. There are degreasing shampoos available, but they might strip your hair of its natural oils.
Water based pomades are much more user friendly, but a bit costlier. This type of pomade gives you a similar look to oil based pomades, but will wash out with water. Water based pomades aren’t as strong as oil based, but they will keep the hold as well as maintain flexibility to restyle throughout the day.;
, The sheen of a pomade determines how shiny your hair will look. You can pick the style of pomade based off the look you’re going for, or you can pick one based on the type of hair you have.A matte pomade has less shine and is best for hair that tends to get greasy quickly with pomade.
A sheen pomade has much more shine and would be good for someone with dry hair.
You can mix a matte pomade with a sheen pomade to create your own perfect balance.

, Pomades are sold in different strengths which will give your hair different amounts of hold. Research different brands of pomade to find out if they give a light, medium, or strong hold.If you’re new to using pomade, start with one that has a light hold. This will allow you to get a feel for how to style your hair and still allow you to change the style throughout the day.
Pomades that give a light hold are soft, and pomades that give a stronger hold are harder.
If you have thicker hair, you might want to opt for a medium or strong hold.
Try buying several different kinds of pomade to find the one that works best for your hair.

, Pomade adheres best to clean hair, so you should wash your hair before trying to style it with pomade. Wash your hair with shampoo to start with fresh, clean hair., Pomade looks best when it’s styled in hair that is slightly damp. After washing your hair, lightly dry it with a towel before styling. You want your hair to be just slightly damp but not dripping wet. This will allow the pomade to mix into your hair easily and look great when it dries.







, With pomade, a little goes a long way, so start with a very small amount. You can always add more as you go. Get a dime sized amount of pomade on your fingers and rub your fingers together to get it on all of your fingertips.








If you’re using very hard pomade, you may have to heat it up to be able to use it. Use a hair dryer to blow warm air onto the pomade for a few seconds to allow the pomade the heat up and get softer.

, Pull your fingers through your hair from just near the root all the way to the tips to evenly apply the pomade on your hair. If you only want the pomade on the tips, gently pull the tips of your hair to apply the pomade on them.









Make sure not to get the pomade onto your scalp. This will cause your hair to look very greasy and is bad for the natural oils on your scalp.

, Put a small amount of pomade on your fingertips to apply it to the tips of your hair. Use your thumb and fingers to gently pull the tips of your hair in the direction you want to spike it. Continue this process until you’ve spiked the amount of hair your want for your desired look. Make sure you only apply the pomade to the tips of your hair.









Try spiking the front forward and smooth the sides down for a sharp look.
Spike up the hair on the top of your head for a fun, elongating look.

, A styled messed up look is very trendy and a good style to try. Put a dime sized amount of pomade in your hand and work it on your fingertips. Run your fingers through your hair to apply the pomade. Start near the roots and pull your fingers to the tips of your hair moving in and upward direction. Use your fingers to gently tousle your hair by moving them side to side and front to back.


There’s no right way to achieve the messy look, so just keep playing with it until you achieve a look you like.
Try not to use too much pomade so you hair doesn’t end up looking extremely greasy.

, Brush your hair to get out any tangles that may be there. Put a small amount of pomade in your hair and work it onto your fingertips. Run your fingers through you hair to apply the pomade. Move your fingers from just near the roots to the tips gently pulling your hair towards the back of your head. Repeat this process until all of your hair is pointing towards the back of your head. Use the palm of your hand to smooth your hair back by starting near your hairline and then running it back towards the back of your head.









You can also slick the front part of your hair backwards and the sides of your hair down for a different slicked back look.
To keep your hair slicked back all day, you might want to use a medium to strong pomade.

, Pomade can be used to create unique styles with long, layered hair. Work a small amount of pomade in your fingertips to begin. Apply the pomade the the underside of one layer of your hair to give it lift and separate it from the others..


Pull the layer of hair you’ll be working with up towards the ceiling.
Use your fingertips to gently wipe a small amount of pomade on the underside of the hair starting near the roots and going down about 1 to 2 inches.
Carefully let your hair fall back down on your head and it should be a little lifted off of the layer beneath it.

, Put your hair into a ponytail or bun and secure it with a rubber band. Work a small amount of pomade on your hands and fingertips. Gently smooth your hair by running your hands over your hair from the hairline to the ponytail. Smooth all fly away hairs with your hands.

, You can use pomade to tame your frizzy fly aways and hide any split ends you might have. Use only a tiny amount of pomade to achieve this style without making your hair look greasy.To tame frizzy fly aways, work a tiny amount of pomade in your fingertips and then gently smooth it on the fly away hair in the direction the rest of the hair is going.
To hide split ends, work a tiny amount of pomade in your fingertips and then gently apply it to the tips of your hair to smooth split ends onto the rest of the hair. Do this in very small sections to make it look more natural.

Hair strippers smell bad. Make sure that all surfaces it can potentially get on (sink, counter, etc.) are covered with paper or plastic and that anything it comes in contact with gets washed well.

, After your 20 minutes is up, it may not appear like all your hair has been changed. Don't worry! Whatever dyes you ever used will completely wash out of your hair in the shower.


If you have ever bleached your hair before and it has never completely been cut and regrown, the parts of your hair that has been previously bleached will not return to your original color; they will go back to being blonde.

, What has happened is the hair stripper removed all the dyes left in the pores of your hair, which has clogged up and made it difficult to impossible for new dye to be added and remain in the pores of your hair.

, This is completely normal, especially with lye-based bars. This is because the alkaline levels of your hair have been raised, which causes the shaft of your hair to stick out more, causing tangles and the feeling that it's sticking to itself. If you were using liquid hair products, at this stage you would use conditioner on the hair which would smooth the hair shaft and minimize tangling. Some people find this feeling doesn't bother them as soon as their hair dries; others need to use an acidic rinse. An acidic rinse will help close the hair cuticle and prevent tangling. A good acidic rinse is diluted apple cider vinegar. If you don't like the smell, you can use diluted lemon juice.

Choosing a color that doesn't match your skin tone can clash with your skin and features, which can look unnatural. Before choosing a hair color, decide if you are a cool or warm toned person.;
, People with warm tones have yellow undertones. They generally tan easily without burning. These people look good in earth colors, such as browns, yellows, oranges, and cream. Gold jewelry usually looks good against warm toned skin.


Look at the veins on the inside of your arm. People who are warm toned have green veins.
People who have warm skin tones generally have dark eyes, such as brown, black, or hazel. Their hair is black, brown, blonde, red, or strawberry blonde.If you hold a white paper next to your clean face, your skin will look yellow or golden next to the paper if your tone is warm.
An alternate way to determine if you have warm tones is to hold a yellow or red paper beside your clean face. If it looks flattering, you have warm tones.

, People with cool tones have pink or bluish-red undertones. They usually burn or have trouble tanning.These people generally look best in blue, red, and purple hues. Silver jewelry usually looks good against cool toned skin.


People with cool skin tones have blue veins on the inside of their arms.
People with cool tones generally have light colored eyes, such as blue, green, or grey. They have blonde, black, or brown hair.
If you hold a white paper next to your clean face, your skin will look blue compared to the paper.
Another way to determine cool skin tone is to hold a blue, silver, or green piece of paper next to your face. If it looks flattering, you have cool tones. Do a comparison with yellow/red paper to check the difference., Some people have neither warm nor cool skin; they have a neutral skin tone. These skin tones have no obvious pink or yellow shades to their skin. Their veins are not obviously green or blue. People with neutral skin tones can wear any color.

, After determining your skin tone, decide what shade will look best on your skin. If you have a neutral skin tone, any shade will probably look good.


For warm tones, dark browns, warm browns, chestnuts, rich golden browns, auburn, warm gold and red highlights, and golden blonde shades will look best on you. Go for colors with a red orange or gold base; those will look good on you. Avoid blue, violet, and ash based hair colors which will wash out your skin color.
For cool tones, try shiny raven-wing blacks, cool ash browns, or cool blondes in shades ranging from mink to platinum and icy white. Avoid gold, yellow, red, and bronze tones in hair color. These warm tones have a tendency to make you look washed-out. You also may be able to wear many exciting bold, unnatural hair colors like lipstick red, cherry red, blue, and burgundies.

, Do you have light, medium, or dark skin? This is important when determining what color hair is right for you.


With paler skin, lighter shades work. For light skin and warm tones, try butterscotch, strawberry blonde, or honey. For light skin and cool tones, try platinum, flaxen, or champagne blonde.
Medium skin provides more versatility. Medium skin and warm tones can go tawny blonde, golden caramel, or copper. Cool tones with medium skin should try ashy tones, such as sand, wheat blonde, and walnut brown.
Olive skin looks great with rich browns or earthy shades. Cool tones should try auburn or cinnamon, while warm tones can go with ebony brown and mocha.
For dark skin and cool tones, go for espresso and inky black. For dark skin and warm tones, try maple brown, mahogany, or toffee., Eye color can determine whether a hair color looks good on your or not. Do you want your eyes to pop? Green and blue eyes might look great with reds, brown, or blonde, while dark eyes might look great with a contrasting color., The extent to which you want to change your hair color impacts your choices. Do you want to keep your hair looking natural? Or do you want to go completely opposite? Do you want to get a bold, unnatural color? Decide what is best for you and your life.


If you want to go natural, only go 2-3 shades lighter or darker than your natural hair color.Choose a color that will look good on you. Maybe you've always liked red hair, but is it right for you? If you love blue but have warm toned skin, consider another drastic, bold color.

, If you are unsure about a color, try temporary dyes. Permanent and semi-permanent dyes are more long-lasting if you want color that will stick around for awhile.


Permanent hair color won't wash out and will allow you to go lighter. Going lighter will probably require bleach. It's harder to reverse permanent dye, and you will have to retouch the roots as your hair grows.
Semi-permanent hair color fades away with washes. It's great for highlighting, changing color tones in hair, adding depth, and covering grey. It cannot lighten the hair significantly.
Temporary hair color washes out within 25-30 washes. It's good for adding shiny, vibrant colors to hair in a darker or brighter color. It also allows you to change your hair tone. They can't lighten your hair., Before you get a drastic makeover, decide why you are doing this. Are you following a trend? Have you recently had a traumatic experience, like a death in the family or a break up? Making drastic style choices based on emotions is not the best way to choose a style., Many websites will allow you to put different hairstyles onto a picture to see which you look best with. Others allow you to input your hair and style preferences to determine the right color for you.

, Clip a small section of hair from underneath where it won't be noticed. Color this strand to see how the dye will take to your hair. This will give you a sense of how your hair will look before you do your whole head - possibly helping you avoid a disaster.

, If you want to try out a hair color before committing, wear a wig. Wigs can give you a good idea of what the hair color will look like on your face without any permanent side effects. Make sure to try a high quality wig that gives you a correct idea of the hair color.

, This is the best suggestion if you are dying your hair for the first time or are making a drastic change. Hair experts can give you the best shade and ensure that you don't end up with any hair disasters.Make sure to bring a photo of the particular color you want if you have a specific one in mind. That ensures that there is little confusion. Terms like brunette, red, and blonde aren't very descriptive, but be mindful of using terms like ash, honey, caramel, and espresso unless you know what they mean.

, Highlighting is a great way to add warm or cool tones to your hair. If you have warm tones, highlight with golden blondes, copper streaks, or golden brown shades. If you have cool tones, highlights should be wheat, honey, taupe or ash shades.


Lowlights are another way to add color to your hair if you want a subtle change that has an impact on your looks.

, Don't forget about your eyebrows when you are coloring your hair. If you have dark hair and go blonde, consider dying your eyebrows. Drastic changes coupled with eyebrows can look odd or unflattering, so factor that hair into your decision.

Shake the bottle well every time you use it.,
Spray the product generously all over your hair.,
Dry your hair with a diffuser or allow it to air-dry.",How to Use Sea Salt Shimmer Spray1," Shimmer spray works well on wet hair, but you shouldn’t use it on soaking wet hair. After you wash your hair in the shower, use an old t-shirt or a microfiber towel to squeeze the excess water out of it. Then, starting at the roots and working your way down, use the towel to gently pat your hair.Opt for a microfiber towel or old cotton t-shirt over a terrycloth towel. The texture of terrycloth causes friction, which can create frizz and damage your hair.Avoid rubbing or using rough motions when you are towel-drying your hair, since this can also damage it.;
, Mica, a naturally-occurring mineral, is the gold substance in the shimmer spray that makes it sparkle. Natural separation between the formula and the mica will occur inside the bottle. For even and effective results, always give your bottle a good shake right before you spray the product on your hair.Shake your bottle and take a look – you should see the glittery mica swirling around evenly inside the formula. Make sure your spray looks like that each time you go to use it.

, Run a wide-toothed comb gently through your hair to detangle it, then shake the bottle up and spray the shimmer on. For the most noticeable results, spray the product on from root to tip. Along with delivering shimmer, spraying near the roots will provide additional volume.For a slightly more subtle look, start at mid-shaft and spray it down to the ends.If this is your first time using this product, you may want to start with a less-is-more approach until you know how bright the results will look. However, most of the sea salt shimmer products on the market are subtle rather than flashy, even when used on very dark hair., To place the most emphasis on curl and texture, dry your hair with a diffuser. Use it on the lowest heat setting for a little extra volume. If you’d prefer to avoid heat-styling, you can use the cool setting and still achieve effective results. Air-drying your hair also works – you’ll end up with plenty of shimmer and texture, but less bouncy volume.To further accentuate your curls, use the microfiber towel or old t-shirt to gently scrunch your hair during the drying process.
Tousle and style as usual.

For extra volume, be sure to spray near the roots.

, Many people avoid washing their hair every single day, especially in winter, when the climate can make hair especially brittle. Using sea salt shimmer spray on second or third day hair can keep your hair looking grease-free, texturized and bouncy for another day or so before having to wash it. As an added bonus to the beachy waves, sea salt shimmer spray provides a subtle golden glow!The results are similar to using dry shampoo, wicking away grease while still preserving your hair’s moisture.

, Although many regular sea salt sprays on the market can be drying, most of the shimmer versions are special organic blends that offer positive benefits along with that beachy iridescent glow. Check the labels and look for products made with moisturizing essential oils and aloe vera.

Accent your hair color with new shimmer colors.,
Control static electricity while adding a glow.",How to Use Sea Salt Shimmer Spray3," Regular sea salt spray creates lots of texture for the hair, which in turn provides extra grip that can help hold an up-do in place.

Simply spray the product onto your dry strands and style your hair into the desired look.


Once styled, spritz the product on your hair one final time as a finishing spray to get a extra sparkle., Up until recently, sea salt shimmer sprays were limited to formulas infused with gold mica only. Products have now been expanded to include rose gold and silver mica formulas. Just like the original gold version, these can be used on all hair types and colors. However, you can also gear your choice toward accentuating your hair color.For example, strawberry blondes and red heads can emphasize their strands with rose gold formulas.
Ash browns and other dark, cool tones can be accentuated by using the silver mica formulas.
The original gold formula can emphasize golden undertones for redheads and blondes., Many people combat static electricity in their hair during the cold winter months.

If you’re experiencing this issue, get your hair slightly damp and then spray the product all over your hair, root to tip. Tousle and style as usual.If you enjoy wearing knit caps during winter, static electricity can be even more of an issue than usual.

, The bleaching process works best on healthy hair that has not previously been dyed, permed, straightened or otherwise chemically treated.Professional hair stylists generally recommend waiting at least 2 weeks to between applying any chemicals to your hair; this time frame may be shortened or lengthened depending on how healthy your hair looks and feels.If your hair looks and feels healthy after you’ve dyed it, waiting 2 weeks before you bleach it will likely be fine.

, Rub some extra virgin coconut oil between your palms to warm it up, then massage it into your hair and scalp. You needn’t wash the oil out before bleaching.


If possible, leave coconut oil on your hair overnight before bleaching.
Some people even claim that the oil can help the bleaching process, although there is no real evidence for this.
Coconut oil is made up of molecules that are small enough to penetrate the hair shaft, making it an effective choice for moisturizing your hair., Look for ones that moisturize your hair without adding buildup or stripping your hair of its natural oils. If you're on a budget, you can find high-quality salon brands at beauty outlets and discount department stores.


What to look for: low pH, oil (argan, avocado, olive), glycerin, glyceryl stearate, propylene glycol, sodium lactate, sodium PCA, and alcohols that start with “c” or “s.”What to avoid: strongly fragranced products, alcohols whose names include “prop”, sulfates, and any products that claim to add volume to your hair., Pay attention to what types of styling products you use. For example, anything that provides lift or volume to your hair will also dry it out.As with shampoos and conditioners, only put things on your hair that will moisturize it.

, Don’t use a hair dryer, straightening iron, or curling iron on your hair. Applying heat damages and weakens hair follicles. After washing your hair, don't rub it with a towel — use the towel to gently squeeze the water from your hair.


If you simply must style your hair, consider using no-heat alternatives to straightening and curling your hair. Type “no heat alternative hair styling” into a search engine to discover a variety of methods.

, Drugstore brands of hair dye are generally of a poorer quality than the ones you can get in a salon. Beauty supply shops allow you to buy professional-quality products and tools.


Sally Beauty Supply is one of the most popular international beauty shops. Check to see if there's one — or one like it — in or near your city.

, Bleach powder comes in packets or tubs. If you plan on bleaching your hair more than once, a tub is usually cheaper in the long run.

, Cream developer reacts with the powder to bleach your hair. It comes in different volumes ranging from 10 to 40; the higher the volume, the quicker it will turn your hair blonde, but also the more damaging it will be.


Many stylists recommend using 10 to 20 volume. It will take longer for the mixture to lighten your hair, but it will also be much less damaging than using the higher volumes.
If you have fine, fragile hair, use a 10-volume developer. For dark, coarse hair, a 30- or 40-volume developer might be necessary.A 20-volume developer is your safest bet for effectiveness and gentleness, so if in doubt, choose that one!, Toner is what will take your hair from yellow to white. Toners come in a variety of shades, including blue, silver and purple.


When choosing a toner, take your skin tone and hair color into consideration. If your hair is too golden, you’ll want a toner shade that’s opposite gold on the color wheel such as a blue or violet ash-based toner.Some toners need to be mixed with developers before being applied to your hair, while others come ready to apply. Both can be equally effective.

, Red gold correctors often come in little packages that you can add to your bleaching mixture to help reduce brassiness; they aren’t absolutely necessary for getting white hair, but a lot of people swear by them.


Whether you need a red gold corrector will really depend on your hair. People with darker hair, or hair that contains red, orange, or pink tones may find red gold correctors particularly useful in getting their hair extra white.
Unless you already have ashy blonde hair that you're trying to make white, you might want to err on the side of caution and purchase a red gold corrector, as they are fairly inexpensive at around $1 USD per package.

, If you have long hair, you'll likely need at least two packages of bleach, developer, and red gold corrector, if not more.


If you’re unsure of how much you’ll need, you're better off buying too much than not enough. You can use any untouched packages later when you touch up your roots.

, Look for products that are specifically made for bleach blonde hair. These shampoos and conditioners will be a rich purple or purple-blue in color.


If you’re on a budget, at the very least buy the shampoo, which is more effective than the conditioner in keeping the brassiness out of your hair.

, In addition to the ingredients for your bleach mixture, you’ll need a tint brush, a plastic mixing bowl, plastic spoon, gloves, hair clips, towels, and plastic wrap or a clear plastic shower cap.


Do not use any metal as it can react negatively to the bleach.
For towels, you can use old ones that you already have too; just make sure they’re ones you don’t mind wrecking.

, Before you bleach your hair you’ll need to do a patch test and a strand test. A patch test will ensure that you’re not allergic to anything in the bleach mixture, and a strand test will help you determine how long to leave the mixture in.


To do a patch test, create a tiny amount of the mixture you will use on your hair and place a small dab of it behind your ear. Leave it for 30 minutes, wipe any excess off, then try not to touch it or get it wet for 48 hours. If after 48 hours that area of skin is fine, go ahead with bleaching your hair.
To do a strand test, prepare a small amount of the bleach mixture and apply it to a strand of your hair. Check it every 5 to 10 minutes until it reaches the desired color. Note the time it took to reach this color so that you have an idea of how long it will take on your whole head.
Another thing to pay attention to in the strand test is how damaged the hair feels after you've washed and conditioned the strand. If it feels very damaged, try a lower-volume developer or a slower bleaching process (i.e. bleaching your hair over several weeks instead of in one go).If you only do one test, do the patch test, as a severe allergic reaction could be fatal.

, Put on old clothes that you don't mind getting stained. Drape a towel around your shoulders, and have another stack of towels ready in case the bleach mixture gets somewhere it shouldn’t. Put on a pair of gloves to protect your hands.

, Using a plastic spoon, place as much bleach powder as you need in the mixing bowl. The powder should come with instructions that you can follow.


If it doesn’t, you’ll want to use roughly a 1:1 ratio between the powder and its developer. You may want to do one scoop of powder and then one scoop of developer, mixing them as you go.

, Add the correct amount of developer and mix it with a plastic spoon. Aim for a thick, creamy gravy consistency.


Unless stated otherwise on the packaging, the ratio of developer to powder should be roughly 1:1 — 1 spoonful of powder per 1 spoonful of developer., Once the powder and developer are combined, add some red gold corrector to the mixture using the instructions on the package as a guideline.

, Using a tint brush, apply the mixture to your hair moving from the ends upward, leaving roughly an inch of roots. Your roots will lighten faster than the rest of your hair due to their proximity to your warm scalp; for this reason, leave your roots until the rest of your hair is done.


Unless your hair is quite short, you’ll benefit from using clips to section off your hair as you work on it.
Work from the back of your head to the front of your head.
Wait at least 24 hours from washing your hair to bleach it. The oilier your hair is, the better, as your hair’s natural oils will help reduce the damage the bleach does to your hair and scalp.

, Once you’ve applied the bleach mixture to all of your hair including your roots, check to ensure that your hair is fully saturated with the mixture.


You can do this by massaging your hair around your head and feeling for any spots that are dryer than the rest. When you come across these spots, add some more of the bleach mixture to them and massage it into your strands.
Use a mirror to look at the back of your head.

, You can also use a clear plastic shower cap.


As the bleach works, your scalp may begin to itch and sting. This is normal.
If the tingling and stinging become too painful, remove the plastic wrap and wash out the bleach. If your hair is still too dark, you can try to bleach it again with a lower-volume developer in 2 weeks if it's healthy enough.
Avoid the temptation to apply any heat to your hair at this point, as applying heat could wind up in your hair falling out completely.

, After 15 minutes, check a strand of hair to see how the bleaching has progressed. Use a towel to wipe some of the bleach mixture away so that you can clearly see the color of the strand.


If your hair still looks dark, reapply more bleach to the strand of hair, replace the plastic wrap and allow it to sit for another 10 minutes.
Continue checking your hair every 10 minutes until it has become completely blond.

, If you do, it could cause your hair to break off and/or fall out completely. Bleach is capable of dissolving hair, so you really do need to be careful about how extreme you are with it.

, Remove the plastic wrap and run your head under cool water until all traces of the bleach are gone. Wash, condition, and rinse your hair as normal, then gently squeeze the water from it with a clean towel.


Your hair should be a yellow blond color. If it looks bright yellow, proceed to the instructions for toning.
If your hair is orange or still dark, it's necessary for you to bleach it again before toning. To keep your as healthy as possible, wait 2 weeks between bleaching.Note that you won’t need to reapply the bleach to your roots if your roots are whiter than the rest of your hair. Just apply the bleach to the parts you want to lighten further.
You may even want to stretch the bleaching process over several weeks. If your hair is quite thick and course, You might even need to repeat the process up to five times., Once you've bleached your hair, you're ready to tone it. Just like with the bleaching process, you should wear old clothes and gloves. Have a stack of towels handy and make sure your hair is completely dry before starting.


You can tone your hair directly after bleaching it (just make sure the bleach is washed out first!). You will also likely want to tone your hair every couple of weeks in order to keep it looking white.

, If your toner comes premixed and ready to use, you can skip this step. In a clean plastic mixing bowl, mix the toner and developer according to the instructions on the packaging.


The ratio is usually 1 part toner to 2 parts developer.

, Use your tinting brush to paint your hair with the toner, following the same technique as when you applied the bleach (ends to roots, back to front).

, Work your hands through your hair to ensure that the toner is saturating your hair and evenly applied.


Use a mirror to have a look at the back of your head to make sure the toner is fully covering your hair.

, Allow the toner to sit in your hair for the length of time specified on the packaging. Depending on the strength of the toner and the color of your hair, it could take as little as 10 minutes for your hair to go white.

, Depending on the type of toner you use and how on light your hair already is, the toner could work more quickly or slowly than expected.


Check your hair every 10 minutes to ensure that you don’t end up with blue hair: use a towel to scrape some toner off a thin strand of hair to get a sense of what color it’s going. If your hair’s not the desired color yet, reapply toner to that strand and put it back up beneath the plastic cap/wrap.

, Run your hair under cool water until all traces of the toner are gone. Shampoo and condition as normal, and gently squeeze the water from your hair with a clean towel.

, Let your hair air dry or, if you are impatient, dry it with your blow dryer’s coolest setting. Now that the bleaching and toning processes are complete, your hair should be a bright, sparkling white.


If you missed a spot, wait a few days and repeat the process on the strand of hair in question.

, White hair is fragile and damaged hair, even if it is in the best condition it can be. Take care of your hair, don't shampoo it if it feels dry and don't go overboard on the brushing, straightening and curling.


Most of the time, you’ll want to let your hair air dry. If you must blowdry your hair, be sure to use the coolest setting.
Avoid applying heat or otherwise manipulating your natural hair texture as much as possible, as this can cause your hair to break off — you could end up with chunks of hair sticking out from your head that are only an inch or two long.If you simply must straighten your hair, you can achieve a straightening effect with a blow dryer and a round brush — do this as an alternative to using a straightener.You’ll want to comb your hair with a wide-tooth comb., Many specialists recommend washing you hair only once a week after bleaching it.Shampoo strips your hair of its natural oils, and your bleached hair will likely need all the oil it can get.


If you regularly work out/sweat or use a lot of products in your hair, you can likely bump this up to twice a week. You can also substitute dry shampoo for a wash.
When you dry your hair, gently pat and squeeze it with a towel — don’t rub the towel quickly over your head as this can cause more damage to your hair., Use products specially made for bleached and damaged hair: a purple toning shampoo and a deep conditioner at the very least. Avoid products that volumize your hair, as this can dry it out.


A good hair oil will keep your hair looking softer and less frizzy. Some people swear by extra virgin coconut oil to reduce frizz and help condition their hair.

, Avoid drugstore brands as these may only coat your hair, leaving it feeling waxy and weighed down.

, You’ll need to reapply a toner regularly to keep your hair white. You might even need to do this every one or two weeks. Using a toning shampoo will help reduce how often you need to apply a toner to your hair.

, Try to renew your bleach when your roots are an inch at the longest. This will help keep your hair looking more even.


If you let your roots grow longer, it may be more difficult to touch them up without having them clash against the rest of your hair.

, This will be the exact same process as when you initially bleached your hair. Mix the lightening powder with the developer on a 1:1 ratio, then add the red gold corrector to the mixture as per the package’s instructions.

, Using a tint brush, only apply the bleach to your roots. You can let it drag down a teensy bit into your already bleached hair, but try not to cover your already bleached hair too much.


If your hair is quite thick or long, you’ll want to section it off with clips. You might even find it useful to section off short hair so that you can make sure you get all the roots.
Use the pointy end of the tint brush to work your way through your hair, painting the mixture on your roots, flipping the hair over with the end of the tint brush, and then painting the other side before moving on to the next chunk of hair.

, After about 15 minutes, check to make sure that your hair isn’t going too light. Check on it every 10 minutes after that until it's the desired color.

, Completely rinse the mixture out of your hair with cool water, then shampoo and condition as normal. Gently squeeze any excess water from your hair with a clean towel.

, As with the original toning process, prepare your toner and apply it to your roots using a tint brush.


If the rest of your hair could also use a tone, apply the toner to your yellow roots first, then pull it down to the rest of your hair.
Remember to keep an eye on your every 10 minutes to make sure it’s not going too blue, silver or purple.

, Rinse your hair with cool water, then shampoo and condition it. Afterwards, gently squeeze the water out of it and, preferably, let it air dry.

, If you find partway through applying bleach to your hair that you don’t have enough to cover your entire head, it’s not the end of the world.


If you run out of the mixture but you still have all the ingredients you need, quickly mix this together and then continue applying the bleach to your hair. It shouldn't take more than a few minutes for you to make the mixture.
If you need to go buy more ingredients, complete the bleaching process for the hair that you’ve covered in bleach (allowing it to sit on your hair until it’s blonde or until a maximum of 50 minutes have passed — whichever comes first). Then at your earliest opportunity, buy more materials and apply the bleach to your remaining unbleached hair.

, Ideally you’ve worn old clothes and protected them with a towel. If for some reason bleach gets on something you care about, you can try to remove it using the following method:


Apply a clear alcohol such as gin or vodka to a cotton wool ball.
Rub the stain and the area around it with the ball; this should move some of the garment’s original color over to the bleached area.
Keep rubbing until the color has covered the bleached area.
Rinse well in cold water.
If this doesn’t work, you might consider bleaching the entire garment and then dyeing it with a fabric dye in a color of your choosing.

, If you bleach your hair and after 50 minutes the color is nowhere close to blonde, don't panic. This is a common occurrence for people with darker and/or stubborn-to-dye hair. It may take you a few attempts to get your hair the color you want it.


If you need to bleach your hair a few times to get it blonde, be sure to give yourself at least two weeks in between bleachings.
After each bleaching, pay close attention to the quality of your hair. If it begins to feel very damaged, you’ll need to wait longer before you try again. Your hair should feel fairly healthy before you apply more bleach to it, otherwise you’ll risk it breaking off or falling out.

, After a few root touch-ups you may find that your hair has developed bands of different shades of yellow.


You can address the darker bands by applying a small amount of bleach to them and letting it sit for several minutes until the strip of hair is closer in color to the rest of your hair.
These bands will generally become much less noticeable once you’ve toned your hair.

Start with healthy hair.,
Buy dyeing supplies.",How to Go from Dark Brown to Blonde1," Going from dark brown to blonde requires an application of bleach. If you bleach hair that's dry or processed, you risk damaging the hair further and even breaking it at the shaft. To get your hair ready for bleaching, follow these basic rules in the months leading up to your dyeing session:


Wash your hair with chemical-free shampoo every three days or so. Chemicals can be abrasive, causing hair damage. Washing your hair more often than every three days dries it out.
Don't use heat styling tools. Put away your hair dryer, curling iron, and straightening iron in the months leading up to your dyeing session. Applying direct heat to hair makes it dry and brittle.
Don't use chemical processing treatments. Getting your hair permanently straightened or curled is also hard on your locks. Let it grow in its natural state before you dye it.;
, To dye your dark hair blonde, you'll need supplies for bleaching it and for recoloring it in the golden or yellowish blonde hue of your choice. Go to a beauty supply store and pick up the following supplies:


Bleach powder: This comes in packets or tubs - the tubs are recommended if you plan to bleach your hair more than once, since you get more powder for your money.
Crème developer: This substance is mixed with the bleach powder to create a paste you apply to your hair to bleach it. It comes in different volumes ranging from 20 to 40. The higher volume developer is stronger and more effective for dark hair, so choose 30 or 40. Never go higher than 40 or you'll damage your hair.
Red gold corrector. This is added to the bleach powder to increase its effectiveness. It prevents you from having to bleach your hair more than once. Buy two bottles if your hair is quite long.
Purple shampoo: This is designed specifically for people with bleached hair. Make sure you use this and not a regular shampoo.
Blonde dye: After bleaching your hair, it's necessary to add color back to your hair. Pick out a blonde hair dye in whatever shade you want.
Plastic gloves, a tinting brush, and a plastic bowl: The gloves will protect your hands from the bleach and dye, and the brush and bowl are used to mix and apply it.
Aluminum foil: This enables you to bleach your hair in sections.
Plastic wrap: This is used to cover your hair while the bleach and dye set in.

Try lemon juice as a lightener.,
Use chamomile tea to lighten your hair.,
Consider honey for lightening your hair.,
Make a lightening solution with rhubarb.,
Apply olive oil to lighten your hair.,
Employ baking soda to make your hair lighter.,
Create a lightening solution with apple cider vinegar.,
Administer cinnamon to lighten your hair.,
Utilize salt for lightening your hair.",How to Lighten Your Hair Without Bleach1," This method only works for hair that has not been color treated. Lemon juice seems to be one of the most popular methods of lightening hair without bleach. It will produce a subtle all-over lightening effect if you apply it to all of your hair or subtle highlights if you only apply it to some select sections. You’ll want to use pure lemon juice to do this. The bottled kind is perfectly okay, but fresh-squeezed lemon juice is more potent.Mix equal parts lemon juice and water. Put the mixture inside a spray bottle and spray the mixture onto your hair. Spray enough so your hair turns damp.
Alternatively, apply the mixture to your wet hair at the end of your shower and don’t rinse it out.
Regardless of which option you choose, the key to this step is to sit out in the sun while the lemon juice is in your hair. The UV rays from the sun is what helps trigger the lightening effect. Note — it is not the heat from the sun that reacts with the lemon juice, so using a blow dryer instead of sitting outside will not work.Only stay out in the sun for about 30-60 minutes. And make sure you’re also wearing sunscreen on your exposed skin.
Because lemon juice is highly acidic, you should use a lot of conditioner to re-hydrate your hair after you’ve used this mixture.
Keep in mind that this method will produce a very subtle lightening effect. Try repeating it once per week to lighten your hair gradually over time.;
, Chamomile, like lemon juice, is a very popular method of lightening hair. This works best if your hair is already somewhat light. It will not produce an effect on darker hair and is not recommended for hair that has been dyed. After the treatment, you will notice a very subtle golden tint and brightening effect on your naturally blonde hair. Start by brewing some strong chamomile tea. You’ll need about 5 tea bags and you’ll want to steep them in three cups of hot water for about 30 minutes, or until the tea is cool enough to apply it to your head.Once the tea has steeped and cooled, then put the tea (minus 5 tablespoons) inside a spray bottle.Take the remaining 5 tablespoons and add them to a bottle of your regular conditioner.
The next time you shower and wash your hair, use the pure chamomile tea as your shampoo.
Once the ‘shampoo’ is rinsed off, apply your conditioner/tea mixture as your conditioner. Let the conditioner sit on your hair for at least a few minutes before rinsing it off.If you have the time, allow your hair to air dry in the sun after you’ve shampooed and conditioned your hair with the chamomile tea.
An alternative is to simply spray the chamomile tea onto your dry hair and then go out into the sun., Honey is a great substance. Besides being able to lighten your hair, honey can also be used for a variety of medical purposes as it has anti-bacterial properties. Honey also contains very small amounts of hydrogen peroxide, which is what is able to lighten your hair. If you would prefer not to use hydrogen peroxide, you may want to skip this option.Mix 1-2 tablespoons of raw honey (commercial, pasteurized honey will not work) into a cup of water. Apply the honey/water mixture to your hair so it’s spread evenly. Once the mixture is applied to your hair, you want to let it sit for about an hour.

Regular Conditioner — An alternative to the honey/water mixture is to add the 1-2 tablespoons of honey to your conditioner. Then use your conditioner as you would normally.Honey/Conditioner Mixture — Mix ⅓ cup of raw honey with ¼ cup of conditioner. Wet your hair and then apply the honey/conditioner mixture to your hair. Make sure the mixture is applied evenly — you may want to use a comb to brush it through your hair completely. Put on a shower cap (or plastic wrap) and go to bed. Wash the mixture off in the morning using your normal routine.Honey + Cinnamon + Olive Oil — Adding cinnamon to the honey will produce a warm blonde with reddish undertones and olive oil is moisturizing. Mix 1 cup of raw honey to 2 cups of distilled water. Add 1 tablespoon of cinnamon and 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Mix the ingredients together. Wet your hair and then apply the mixture to your hair evenly. Cover your hair with a shower cap and go to bed. Wash the mixture off in the morning using your normal routine.
Instead of using distilled water for the Honey + Cinnamon + Olive Oil mixture, use 2 cups of white vinegar. The rest of the process is exactly the same., You can obtain rhubarb at a grocery store or a farmer’s market, or you can try growing some of your own in your garden. (Rhubarb can spread quite easily in a garden and can often be found growing in wild places on its own as well.)Chop up enough rhubarb to make ¼ cup. Add the chopped rhubarb to a sauce pan with 2 cups of water. Put the sauce pan on the stove and bring the mixture to a boil.
After the mixture has boiled, allow it cool down, then strain the liquid out of the sauce pan into a bottle.
Apply the liquid to your hair leave it on for 10 minutes. Then rinse the liquid out with water.

, In addition to using olive oil in various other mixtures, you can also use olive oil on its own. In addition to being able to lighten your hair, olive oil is also a great moisturizer.Apply at least a couple tablespoons of olive oil to your hair.
Allow the olive oil to soak into your hair for at least 30 minutes.
Shampoo your hair to remove the olive oil and then style your hair as you normally would.

, Baking soda can be used as both a shampoo and as a method to lighten your hair. It will produce a subtle effect, so you’ll want to use this method daily or weekly until your hair is lightened to the point you want it. Although, you can continue to use baking soda as your regular shampoo, just be aware that your hair may continue to lighten a little more.Mix baking soda, about ¼ to ⅓ cup, with small amounts of water until it turns into a paste.
Apply the paste all over your hair in place of your regular shampoo.
Rinse out the baking soda paste and apply your normal conditioner.

, Like baking soda, apple cider vinegar can also be used to both clean and lighten your hair. You can use apple cider vinegar regularly as a rinse after you’ve shampooed your hair. Apple cider vinegar is great for washing out all the chemical build-up in your hair from styling products.Mix ¼ cup of apple cider vinegar to 1 cup of water.
Shampoo and condition your hair as your normally would, then apply the apple cider vinegar mixture to your hair.
Leave the mixture on your hair for about 20 minutes, then rinse with water.

, Cinnamon can be used in other hair lightening mixtures, or it can be used on its own. The nice thing about cinnamon is that it also smells great!Mix 3-4 tablespoons of ground cinnamon into approximately the same amount of your regular conditioner.Apply the mixture to your hair evenly. Use a comb to make sure it’s spread throughout all your hair.Put a shower cap or plastic wrap on your hair and leave the whole mixture in while you sleep.Shampoo and condition your hair in the morning as you would normally.

, If you have ever spent an entire summer swimming in the ocean, you’ll know that salt water is a great way to lighten your hair. Even if you don’t live near the ocean, you can still use salt water to lighten your hair at home.Mix 1 part salt to 5 parts water. Rinse the mixture through your hair and leave it to sit for at least 15 minutes. Rinse your hair out with fresh water.
As an alternative, mix ½ cup of sea salt to a small amount of water so it forms a paste. Apply the paste to your damp hair and sit in the sun for a while. Rinse your hair out with water after you’ve been out in the sun."

Prepare to dye your hair.,
Make the bleach mixture.,
Apply the bleach.,
Cover your hair and let the bleach sit.,
Wash out the bleach.",How to Go from Dark Brown to Blonde2," Make sure your hair is dry and hasn't been washed in a few days, so it's protected from the bleach by the natural oils your scalp produces. Put on an old t-shirt and have a stack of towels available to wipe away stray bleach. Work in an area that won't get damaged if a few drops fall on the floor.


If your hair is thick, have hair clips handy so you can apply bleach to one section at a time while the rest of your hair is clipped out of the way.
Drape a towel around your neck to protect your skin from the bleach.
Put on your plastic gloves when you're ready to mix the solution.

, Check the bleach powder package to calculate how much you need to use for your hair length. Pour the bleach powder into the plastic bowl. Measure out the correct amount of crème developer and mix that into the powder. Add a tube of red gold corrector and mix well.

, Working in sections, use the tinting brush to apply bleach to your hair from tip to root. Cover the front and back of each section of hair, making sure each strand gets an even application of the bleach solution. Continue until all of your hair is covered in bleach.


Some find it easier to apply bleach to sections of hair by using strips of aluminum foil to keep the sections separate. Place a section of hair over a strip of foil and use it as a base on which to apply the bleach. when you're finished with a section, fold the foil over to keep it in place.
Stop short of completely dousing your scalp in bleach. You won't be able to avoid getting some on your scalp, but it will burn if you get too much on it.
A tingling sensation on your scalp is normal, but if it becomes too painful, you should wash out the bleach immediately.

, Use a sheet of plastic wrap or a plastic shower cap to cover your hair while the bleach goes to work. Let it sit for 30 minutes.


After 15 minutes, check the hair to see how it's progressing. If it looks like the bleach has already finished working, you can go ahead and wash it out. If your hair is still dark, let it sit for another 15 minutes.
Do not leave the bleach in your hair for more than 40 minutes. It could cause your hair to fall out.

, Remove the plastic wrap and the aluminum foil strips. Place your head under the faucet and rinse out the bleach with warm water until the water runs clear.

This should help limit the damage to your hair. 30V will do more damage to your hair, so you may need to take more precautions to protect it.

, Use a violet-based toner to remove yellow/brassy tones from your hair.

, You don't have to spend lots of money on these - lots of the cheaper brands work just as well. Find one that is beneficial to dry/damaged/coloured hair. You might want to get a few and repeat the treatment in the weeks following you bleaching your hair in order to restore moisture.

, Follow the instructions included in the particular brand of bleach you have bought, as it may vary. It may be best to apply the bleach in sections on your hair, especially if it is thicker. Ensure you have covered all the hair you want to bleach and leave on for the recommended time. Never exceed this developing time, as it can really damage your hair.

, If you are bleaching it multiple times make sure you condition after every bleach. Conditioning often works best if you keep a cap over your hair whilst it is soaking. If you don't have a deep-conditioning product, you can use normal conditioner and leave it to soak in your hair for as long as you feel is necessary.

, Use a 20V bleach and not 30V, as this may put too much strain on your hair.

, Follow the ratio on the bottle. Leave the toner in for the recommended time with a cap on your hair. Keep checking on your hair under the cap to ensure it hasn't turned silver! (Unless you want it to be silver!)

, Condition your hair afterwards to restore moisture and get rid of any tangles.

, Be careful how much product you are putting into your hair, as it will be weakened from the bleaching process.

,, Washing hair removes natural oils. Bleach removes oils from the hair, which is why conditioning treatments are important to restore moisture that has been stripped from the hair.

Use the sun to naturally lighten your hair.,
Try vitamin C as a hair lightener.,
Contemplate a hair lightening product.",How to Lighten Your Hair Without Bleach2," While the sun can burn and tan (i.e. darken) your skin, it’s also lighten your hair. One of the easiest ways to lighten your hair is to simply spend a lot of time outside in the sun. Always remember to wear sunscreen and protective clothing on your exposed skin so you don’t get sun damage.The great thing about the sun is that it can be used on its own, or in combination with any of the other hair lightening treatments. To have the sun lighten your hair faster, apply one of the mixtures mentioned in this article to your hair first, before going outside.

, To lighten your hair with vitamin C, you’ll need to obtain vitamin C tablets or pills. Crush 8-9 of your vitamin C tablets into a powder and then add the powder to your regular shampoo. Use your shampoo normally and the added vitamin C will slowly lighten your hair.As an alternative you can make a hair mask with vitamin C. Take 15-20 vitamin C tablets and crush them into a powder. Then add the powder to a small amount of anti-dandruff shampoo to form a paste. Apply the paste all over your hair. Put on a shower cap or plastic wrap and leave the mixture on for 1-2 hours, then rinse off with water., If you have tried other lightening options and you haven’t found them to work, or they do not last long enough to satisfy you, you may want to consider a more professional option. Also, if you have dark hair and want a more dramatic lightening effect, or if you have previously colored your hair at home or at a salon, then you will need to see a professional hair stylist. Professional hair color products are not made equal. There are several hair color products that are made without bleach or hydrogen peroxide, and even without other harmful chemicals. Because each person’s hair is different, your best option is to make an appointment with your hair stylist or colorist and ask them for the best non-bleach option."

Identify the main color of your hair.,
Buy the right hair dye.,
Use the dye to achieve your ideal look.,
Maintain your colour - not by regularly re-dyeing, as this is not a good idea, but by doing touch ups every five weeks to keep your colour.",How to Get Rid of Ugly Natural Highlights," Is it light brown, with golden natural highlights? Dark brown with light brown ones? If the highlights aren't extremely prominent, you may have to look carefully, adjust the light around you or examine your locks for some time. Some highlights can be very subtle, not too far from the main colour. But you should be able to separate the two fairly easy - the highlights should show up in a certain light, and be in smaller sections. Identify both colours. The main colour is the color you'll be dying your hair.;
, Since you'll be darkening your hair, you most probably won't need a permanent dye. Brands like Herbal Essence create dyes that wash out in up to 6-8 shampoos. They usually take a bit longer than that, and are a great way to decide if that's the color you'd like to keep your hair. Shop around, if you're not completely sure, and ask friends and hairdresser's on their opinions about hair dye. Don't be roped into something extremely expensive that you don't need, but don't use a cheap dye and pay for it, either. Look for solid good brands if you don't want to use Herbal Essence. Be sure to pick a shade a little lighter/darker, but close enough to your natural colour. The colour on the dye box/package should be the same colour as your skin tone. When trying to dye over highlights, it's important to stay close enough to your natural colour.

, Although your hair doesn't need to be spotless before dying (a little oil protects the scalp), don't use too many hair products before dyeing. Test out the dye colour first by applying it to a few strands of your hair. If you're not completely satisfied with that color, go back and try a darker or lighter one, or try using Liquid Tide for a couple of days to lighten it. Rinse in cold water afterward, and your unattractive highlights are gone!

, Take good care of your hair and use a suited shampoo (perhaps colour enriching, if you like) and conditioner to enhance your colour and shine - as just one colour.

Ensure that you have undamaged hair. Applying hair lighteners on hair that is already chemically dyed can cause unwanted effects. Be sure that you only use this method if your hair is in its natural state.
Select a test strip. As you begin to choose one or more hair lightening techniques, be sure to test the technique(s) on a small strip of hair before applying it to the rest of your hair. While some people prefer to test a strip underneath the top hair so that it cannot be seen, others prefer to cut off a small strip of hair for testing.;
, Spray a mixture of 1 cup freshly-squeezed lemon juice with 1/4 cup warm water on your hair. Sit in the sun for a couple of hours before you rinse the mixture out with shampoo and a deep conditioner.


The more you use the lemon-juice mixture, the lighter your hair will become. However, the lemon juice will also dry out your hair, so be careful to condition regularly.

, Apply a mixture of 1 cup honey and 1/4 cup water or apple cider vinegar to hair. Cover your hair in a plastic wrap and let it sit for at least 2 hours before rinsing.


The longer you leave in the mixture, the lighter your hair will become. Consider leaving the mixture in overnight.

, Mix chamomile, rhubarb, marigold, lemon juice, mullein and a little hydrogen peroxide with water overnight. Apply the mixture to your hair and sit in the sun for a couple of hours before rinsing it out.


Each of these ingredients is known to lighten hair, so it’s OK to try different combinations and ratios.

Apply the toner to the same test strip of hair before applying the toner to your hair.,
Rinse out the toner.",How to Get White Blonde Hair2," If you are familiar with dying your hair and have dyed it before, you may feel comfortable dying your hair white blonde by yourself. If you have dark hair, it may take two tries to achieve a white-blonde shade. Be sure to wait a couple of days between dyes or seek out a professional to be safe.


Be careful if you're dying your hair for the first time. Bleach can damage anyone's hair and it's important to handle the product with care. If you have dark hair, you will likely have to bleach your hair twice, once to achieve the yellow base necessary to dye it white blonde and again to achieve the desired shade.

, Be sure that your hair is in its natural state. If your hair is already dyed, the safest way to dye it lighter is to seek out a professional.


If you apply bleach to chemically-treated hair, there is a chance that you will burn off your hair.
You may want to deep condition your hair the day before you dye it to minimize the hair-drying effect of the dye.

, You will need to purchase bleach powder, creme developer, red gold corrector and toner. You will also need a mixing bowl, a plastic hair wrap, gloves, hair clips and towels.


Purchase your products at a beauty-supply store to ensure the highest-quality chemicals.
Purchase a bleach powder with a concentration of H2O2 between 3 and 6 percent. If it has a concentration of 10 percent or more, it may induce scalp blistering.Some trusted brands include Salon Care and Manic Panic.
If your hair is blonde or light brown, use a 20- or 30-volume developer. If your hair is black or very dark, you may need a 40-volume developer. The lower the volume, the less damaging the bleach is to hair.
The toner you need will depend on the exact shade of white blonde you want to achieve. Read the brands and product reviews to help you get an idea of which one you want to use. Wella T18 Lightest Ash Blonde Toner or Manic Panic Virgin Snow are two of the most popular.
Red-gold corrector will help the hair grab the color most effectively.

, Follow the instructions included with the products to ensure the correct ratios.


Depending on the product, the ratios could be slightly different. Consider purchasing the same brands of bleach powder and creme developer.
A typical ratio could be two scoops of power and 4 ounces of creme developer., It should take about 30-45 minutes. The resulting color of the test strip will alert you if you are using the wrong amount of bleach.


If the strip turns orange, do not apply the bleach mix to the rest of your hair. The most common reason your hair could turn orange is that your hair is too dark to bleach completely in one sitting, so you may have to wait a couple of days and try again with the same test strand.
If the strand is still orange or dark after the second bleaching, try adding a semi-permanent hair color to cover the orange INSTEAD of toning it.If you choose one shade lighter than the current strip color, you will retain a little orange, but keep the lightness. If you choose one shade darker than the current strip color, you will minimize the orange, but darken your hair a little.

, Once you are happy with your test strip, section off hair and apply the bleach mixture evenly throughout your hair using gloves and a brush. After you finish, you can cover your hair with a plastic wrap if you wish.


For the best results, ask someone to help you apply the mixture.
If your hair is very short, it helps to part your hair in a straight line and apply the bleach starting from the root and moving all the way up the strand of hair. When finished, part the next section and do the same thing. Continue until the mixture is applied everywhere.
If your hair is longer than chin-length, consider applying the bleach starting from a couple of inches away from the scalp and letting it sit for 10-15 minutes before you apply the bleach to the hair nearest the scalp. Because bleach is heat-activated, this will ensure a more even coloring.
If you are a brunette, it will be more difficult to achieve an even shade of white. Be extra careful to apply a generous amount of the mixture evenly on every strand of hair.

, Make sure that you are checking your hair every 5-10 minutes, however, to ensure you are achieving the desired results. If not, you can adjust your treatment before it's too late.


If you see that some spots are turning lighter faster than others, correct the darker spots by adding a little bit more of the bleach mixture.
As you wait, you are likely to experience some itching and burning sensations. This is normal. If you cannot stand the itching or burning, however, rinse it out since your discomfort could be a sign that your scalp is reacting poorly to the chemicals. Consider trying a different brand after a couple of days.
You want your hair to turn lighter yellow, not orange. If it does turn orange, wait 5 minutes to see if it turns yellow before rinsing it out and repeating the process in a couple of days or going to the hair salon.

, When you determine that your hair is light enough, rinse out the bleach with cool water and a mild shampoo followed by conditioner. Towel dry and blow dry.


Be careful not the let the bleach sit in your hair for too long or it will burn the ends off.
Remember only to proceed to the toning step if your hair is yellow, orange.

, The red-gold corrector will help your hair keep the color.

, Leave the toner in your hair until it reaches the desired color. Usually this step will take 30 minutes, but be sure to read the instructions on your toner product.


The longer you leave in the toner, the more silvery the resulting shade of hair., Wash the toner out of your hair. Consider using shampoo for bleached or blonde hair to help your hair retain its new color. Follow the shampoo with conditioner.

Just gather the section of hair you want to use the toner on and apply it.For example, you may want to tone down highlights or your roots.

, Ammonia-based toner is best if your hair is already a shade of blonde. This toner will change the pigment of your hair, so it is considered a demi-permanent dye.

Clip off split ends.",How to Treat Bleached Hair2," When you bleach hair, the cuticle (the microscopic scales on the shaft of your hair) open up, which causes the hair to weaken and sometimes snap. So when you wash your hair, try to just gently massage it into your scalp, then rinse with water. You want to be ginger with your newly bleached hair.

, Shampoo strips your hair of natural oils that keep it healthy. Since bleached hair naturally has less oil, you don't need to do this as much. What's more, excessive shampooing will lead to dry, damaged hair.


Avoid shampoos with wax and sulfates whenever possible.

, Conditioner does the opposite of shampoo -- it adds oils to you hair to give it healthy, happy sheen. Make sure you condition once a day to protect your hair and promote healthy growth with your new look.

, Hot water opens up your cuticles much like bleaching does, which can promote further damage from already weakened hair. When you shower, use the coldest water you can stand for the healthiest hair.


Even lukewarm water is better than a hot, steamy shower.

, Bleaching, which dries and opens up hairs, is notoriously bad for creating split ends. Split ends are when the end of the hair shaft divided into multiple, smaller hairs. This can travel all the way down your to your scalp, resulting in damaged, frizzy hair.

When you go, make sure to bring in a picture for your stylist. That way, your stylist knows exactly what you want, instead of trying to guess from your description. You can look up pictures on the internet to print or cut one out from a magazine.Also, be sure to allow enough time. When you make a big change, it can take some time to pull if off. Make sure you are blocking off several hours at least to get the changes you want done. Also, keep in mind that the bigger the change, the more money it's likely to cost.;
, Over the summer, your hair has likely been susceptible to some damage, in the form of sun and chemicals like chlorine. To make a fresh start with a new color in the fall, consider getting a trim to cut away some of the damage. Plus, it will help you get rid of dead ends, making it easier to color your hair., If you don't want to get a trim, at least try to repair some of the damage the summer has wrought on your hair. A good way to treat damage is to use a deep conditioner, which can help restore health and shine.It's always best to follow the directions on the package, but generally, you leave a deep conditioner in for 15 to 30 minutes. It can also help to heat the conditioner up (if suitable for the product). Also, make sure to pay particular attention to your tips, as that's where the damage is usually the worst.You can also try deep conditioning masks.

, If you have blonde hair with chunky highlights, think about thinning those out in the fall. That is, instead of large sections of blonde, try asking for your highlights to be in smaller chunks (think paper thin). Doing so creates a more natural look for fall.Another option is to try lowlights. In other words, you'll keep some of your hair the current blonde color, but you'll change some of it to a darker, light brown color. That will keep you from looking washed out., Light brown hair can start to look dull if you leave it to its own devices through the fall. However, if you add some warmer highlights, it can help to create a look with more dimension and color., With damage from the summer, dark brown hair can also start to look flat. To help transition to the fall, consider adding in some variation in color with both lowlights and highlights. Adding variation gives your hair dimension., To give red hair more dimension, try asking for your hair to be darker at the roots and lighter at the tops. To help transition from summer damage, ask for a gloss to help brighten up your hair., Dying black hair can damage hair that is already damaged from the summer. Instead, ask for a clear gloss at your salon. It can brighten up your look without having to damage it with more dye., In the summer, you have a tendency to go lighter with your hair color. The sun also naturally lightens up your hair color. However, the fall is the time to go a bit darker. You don't have to make a huge change, but you can try a shade or two darker then what you've been wearing., If you've always thought about becoming a ginger, fall is a great time to do it. A soft auburn color is reflective of the changing fall colors. Ask your stylist to help you choose an auburn that's right for your complexion., With ombre, you use a darker color at the roots and transition to a lighter color at the tips. The benefit of this look is it works well in both summer and fall, so you can just touch it up at the end of summer as you head into fall."

, Put a towel down where you'll be working. If you're working in a bathroom, be careful! Gentian Violet will stain porcelain and furniture.

, To dilute, it is a good idea to use any water-based hair product such as heat protection, although water is fine.

,, If you run out, use more drops. Make sure to dilute it, though or it may turn out black.

,, If rinsing in a porcelain bathtub, keep some rubbing alcohol handy to remove any purple stains.

Purchase some artist's chalk.,
Grab a towel or old t-shirt.,
Pre-soak the chalk.,
Wet a small section of your hair.,
Rub a small section down with chalk.,
Start on a different section.,
Let the hair dry.,
Run through a clean hand.,
Style as desired.",How to Temporarily Dye Your Hair Using Chalk," You will need at least one or two sticks of each color chalk. For best results, use soft pastel artist's chalks if you can; oil based artist's chalks may be difficult to remove, and sidewalk chalk is dusty and won't give you bright, vibrant colors.


Think about what colors you want to use! Most artist's chalks come in boxes of at least 24 -- you should be set with that many. And if you have dark hair, you'll need to work with bright colors.;
, While chalk is not a permanent stain on virtually any fabric, it will transfer quite easily and it'll save you time and worry in the long run if you're donning materials you don't care about. So throw on that old tee and/or wrap an old towel around your shoulders before you start.


You may want to clip the towel together at your neck to keep it from going anywhere.

, That's sort of a misnomer -- what you want to do is set your chalk in a few drops of water. If you have a pillbox, that's ideal. If not, set down your chalk and put a small teaspoon of water over it, releasing the color.


This stage can be skipped if you're in a bit of a time crunch -- but does allow for a more vibrant color (which is especially important if you have darker hair).

, This can either be done with a paintbrush, a spray bottle, or your fingers. Choose a piece of hair that is smaller than the length of the chalk. The smaller the section is, the easier it will be to work with.


You may want to tie up the top portion of your hair so you can color the lower section without it getting in the way.
It's easiest to chalk-dye your hair if you want just a few strands or the tips dyed. Coloring your whole head is a very time consuming endeavor.

, Take the chalk (the one you pre-soaked) at the top of where you want the hair to be colored and rub down. Lift it up off the hair and repeat. Avoid rubbing up and down -- going against the grain isn't great for your hair.


Continue the area you are coloring until it is saturated with the color the way you want it. You can color different colors in different layers or places, depending on how you want it to look.
Chalk will get all over your hands. Don't worry -- it'll wash right off with soap and water.

, If you're working with a bunch of different colors, it's best to work on a section that's far away from the one you just worked on. Since the hair is wet, the color will transfer -- and you don't want the two mixing.


Of course, if you're only doing one color, this isn't an issue. However, if you're worried about the color mixing, dry the strand before continuing on.

, You can either blow dry your hair or let it air dry. Heat is generally bad for your hair, but if you're pressed for time, it'll have to do. It's very important that the hair dries before you go about your day as the color will transfer to your clothes if it's not.



Completely dry -- not just mostly dry.

, If you don't have a clean hand, wash 'em (and then dry 'em). Then grab a section and run it through your hand. Does any color come off? It so, it's not ready. It'll need to dry more.

Do this with each section. Pat down with a hair straightener to speed up the process.

, Once it's dry, the color will stick regardless of what heating implements you use. If you've colored the bottom layer or the tips, make sure it shows! Chalk-dyed hair looks just as good pulled up as down.


If you have blonde hair, it may take a couple washes to come out 100%. But darker shades will see the color come out after one wash.

Redye often, but not too often.",How to Take Care of Color Treated Hair," Hair dye can be regarded as the point-of-no-return. Even if you can dye it back to your natural color, it won't feel the same. If you're trying to lighten your hair a whole bunch, consider the fact that your hair will become much dryer and coarser than you're used to. Be willing to change your hair care routine for the very best care and results for your hair.


Do you have to dye all of your hair? The ombre look allows you to play around with dyeing only some of your hair and getting a unique look as a result.;
, For the very best results, get your hair professionally dyed by your favorite stylist or a professional colorist. Most stylists love having some funky, challenging style to do and will love to create it with your hair!

, You can save yourself the high amount of money professional hair dyeing involves by purchasing a home dyeing kit. Always read the instructions thoroughly and follow them closely.


You may like to consider using vegetable dyes. These won't leave your hair as dry or coarse as other dye types, even after bleaching.

, Once the hair is freshly dyed, make sure you or your stylist goes over it with a flat iron after it's dried. This helps lock the color into the hair shaft.

, Don't wash your hair for at least 48 hours. This is a mandatory step for anyone wishing their hair-color to last more than a week. Ideally, wait as long as you can. If you're only dyeing a small section of your hair (bangs, streaks on top, tips, etc.), avoid hitting this with your shampoo as much as possible.

, Most shampoos bottles will state if they are designed for color treated hair.

, Dyed hair tends to be dry and straw-like. Don't hate your hair for it; nurture it.


Use conditioner on the length of your hair first, then shampoo only on your scalp.

, Not just the first time, but all the time. Hot water dries out hair and skin, leaving it dull. Cold water will not only help you keep your color but also helps you keep your hair's health and shine.

, These hair care products are also dye-sucking vampires.


If your hair is particularly vibrant and unnatural (bright reds, purples, blues, greens, pinks, etc.), try to keep away from spending extended periods of exposure to sunlight and water. Sunlight has been known to work somewhat as a natural bleach, so be careful if you have any long beach trips or life guarding stints planned.

, Your hair shaft is delicate, and should only be dyed once a month or so. Any sooner than that and it will be prone to breaking, splitting, tangles and straw-like texture.

Liese by KAO
Palty
Etude House
Beautylabo
Lucido-L
Beauteen;
, Once you have decided on a brand, select the right dye according to the shade you want. Be sure that you use your current hair color as a reference in order to ensure that you are left with the desired shade. You can use the Color Guide on the back of the product package or on its website.


If you are uncertain about what color you want, ask your hairstylist and friends for advice. You could also read reviews online, as well as look up images of hair models wearing different colors from the product.

, The following should be included in the box:


1 Bottle of solution
1 Bottle of color solution
1 Foam pump
1 Treatment pack
1 Pair of gloves
A step-by-step instruction sheet

, Be sure to wear a t-shirt or an unwanted top, as you may accidentally get dye on your clothes. Wear a top that has short sleeves to prevent them from falling over your hands. Be sure that it is loose enough to allow motion.

, In order to successfully dye your hair, locate an area that provides mirrors, such as a bathroom. Also, be sure you are dyeing your hair in a place that allows easy cleaning. If you want to avoid cleaning up messes, you could lay out garbage bags on surfaces and on the floor.

, While you are waiting for the dye to set in your hair, you will need to occupy yourself with an activity. Find a simple one that allows you to remain still without splashing dye on yourself or on the floor. A good example is reading a book or watching the television.

, If you are a first-time user for the product, test it on your skin. Wait for ten minutes to half an hour for a negative reaction, such as a rash. This will ensure that you do not have an allergic reaction to the product when using it in your hair.

, Before beginning, put on the gloves included in the package. Then, pour the color solution into the bottle of solution container. Screw on the foam pump to the solution container before tilting the bottle upside down about ten times.


Understand that it is important to avoid shaking the bottle.

, Once you have tilted the bottle, squeeze the dye into your hands. You should receive soft, foamy bubbles. Evenly spread it in your hair while making sure to cover all parts, including the roots. Once you are finished applying the dye, it should look like shampoo in your hair.

, Place a plastic bag over your head to prevent the dye from leaking all over. Wrap a cloth around your shoulders in case dye slides down from your hair. Wait for thirty minutes.

, Once thirty minutes have passed, wash out the hair dye before shampooing your hair. Remember to use the hair treatment (it comes with the package) as a replacement for your conditioner. Allow your hair to dry naturally.

Wet the area with warm water.,
Scrub gently.,
Repeat as needed.",How to Remove Hair Dye from Skin1,"


Use a detergent free of dyes and fragrances to avoid causing irritation to your skin.
Keep the detergent away from your eyes.
Note that this method may work best for your hands, rather than your face, since the skin on your face tends to be more sensitive and may react to the detergent.
Use more or less detergent as needed to cover the dyed area.;
, Soak a clean rag in warm water and dab the water onto the dye stain.


You could also apply the water with your fingers, by running the area under your sink faucet, or with a soaked makeup remover pad.

, Use a rag or cotton makeup remover pad to gently blot at the dye stain until it fades.


Note that this only works with weaker dyes and may not be effective against strong dyes or dyes that have been left to soak on the skin for a prolonged period of time.

, If the stain fades but does not completely disappear, you might be able to remove the rest with additional detergent.


If the first round of detergent does not fade the dye at all, however, you would be better off moving on to another method of dye removal.

Combine equal parts baking soda and liquid detergent.,
Rub the mixture onto the dyed skin.,
Rinse with warm water.,
Repeat as needed.",How to Remove Hair Dye from Skin2," Mix 2 tsp (10 ml) baking soda with 2 tsp (10 ml) liquid dish or laundry detergent. Stir well until completely combined.


The baking soda has an abrasive effect and scrubs off the dead skin cells stained with dye, revealing clean skin underneath.
The detergent attracts the dye molecules and cleans the skin by lifting the dye off.
Use a mild detergent with no added fragrances or dyes, if possible, to reduce the risk of irritation.
Do not apply near the eyes. This mixture is safest when used on areas other than the face.

, Use a cotton makeup remover pad to scrub the baking soda solution onto the dyed skin, applying it in a circular motion. Scrub the mixture over the dye using gentle pressure.


Use as much or as little of the baking soda mix as needed to coat the entire stained area of skin.
Rub for 30 to 90 seconds. Stop if you feel any tingling, burning, itching, or other signs of irritation.
You could also use a cotton ball or clean rag instead of a cotton pad.

, After scrubbing the dyed skin with the baking soda, wipe the area clean with a damp washcloth until all of the baking soda solution has been removed.


You may find it easier to rinse the skin under running water. If you rinse the baking soda off with running water, gently rub the area with your fingers to loosen the baking soda under the water.

Only use as much toothpaste as needed in order to create a thin coat of paste over the stain.
Toothpaste can be used on dye skins around the face as well as those on the hands.
Toothpaste is a mild abrasive and can actually scrape off dead skin cells stained with dye. Once the skin cells have been removed, new, clean skin can come through.
Any toothpaste will work, but one with baking soda in it may work even better than others since it has larger granules.

, Use a cotton ball or cotton makeup remover pad to gently rub the toothpaste over the dyed area of skin up to a minute, massaging it in using a circular motion.


Note that you can also use your fingertips to massage the toothpaste into the dye.

, After scrubbing the area with toothpaste, gently rinse it with warm water until no traces of toothpaste remain.


You may need to rub the toothpaste off while rinsing it by using your hands or a clean washcloth.

Petroleum jelly is safe to use on your face and hands, but you should still avoid getting it in your eyes.
You can use your fingers to rub the petroleum jelly onto the dye stain, but a cotton ball or cotton pad may work better since the dye may accidentally transfer onto your fingers if you bring them into direct contact with the dye.

, Let the baby oil sit on your skin for 8 hours or overnight.


If you are concerned about the oil soaking into your pillowcase or bedsheets, cover it with clean cotton bandages.

Rinse well.",How to Remove Hair Dye from Skin6," Soak a cotton ball or cotton pad in an acetone-based nail polish remover. Wring slightly by squeezing it with your fingers to remove any excess.


The acetone in nail polish remover can be very abrasive and will remove the dyed, dead skin cells on top of your skin while also lifting up the dye.
Keep the nail polish remover away from your eyes.
Note that this method is risky to use with the sensitive skin of your face and may work better for hair dye stains on your hands.

,

Shampoo your hair with the mixture.,
Rinse thoroughly.",How to Remove Dye from Hair1," You can get this at any drug or grocery store. It will be labelled clearly as a dandruff product. Head & Shoulders and Original Formula Prell are popular options.Dandruff shampoo is a little more heavy-duty than normal shampoo; people with dandruff have excess sebum that causes the skin to flake off, necessitating a stronger formula.;
, Make sure it's baking soda and not baking powder. The packaging often looks similar, but baking powder will not work for this. Baking soda is a natural (although not strong) bleaching agent.Baking soda won't actually bleach your hair, but it will help to lighten and remove dye.
If you don't have any baking soda on hand, just try plain dandruff shampoo. Often, the act of washing your hair will help remove the dye from your hair, especially if the dye is semi-permanent.

, You can mix them together in a container, or just pour equal parts of each into the palm of your hand. It doesn't have to be exact!








, Work up a nice lather, then let the mixture sit on your hair for a few minutes before you rinse it out., You'll see the hair color running out when you rinse. You can wash your hair with this solution several times, if necessary.

Cover your head with conditioner.,
Use a hairdryer to heat your hair.,
Rinse your hair with cold water.",How to Remove Blue or Green Hair Dye from Hair Without Bleaching1," Clarifying shampoo is a great way to fade semi-permanent dyes. However, if you used a permanent dye, then using a clarifying shampoo may not be powerful enough to make a difference. This method may fade permanent dye a little, but it will take longer to do so.
, You will need to buy a clarifying shampoo that is not recommended for use on dyed hair. This type of shampoo will help to strip your hair of the dyed color. You will also need conditioner. This can also be on the cheaper end of the conditioner spectrum.Suave Daily Clarifying is a good shampoo to use.
If your hair tends to be dry or unmanageable, you should buy a deep conditioner that will give your hair the nutrients it needs.
You can also try an anti-dandruff shampoo., Baking soda is a natural bleaching agent, so adding it to your shampoo can make the color-stripping process go faster.

, Make the water as warm as you can stand it. Warm water opens up hair follicles and cuticles making them more receptive to being stripped of the dye. Get your hair thoroughly wet with the water before shampooing.

, Pour a quarter sized amount of shampoo in your hand and apply it to your hair. Use your fingertips to give your head a good scrub. Squeeze off any excess foam (which should be the color of the dye you are removing). Make sure your hair is thoroughly coated in the shampoo, but do not rinse yet!

, If you have short hair, you can leave it down. Place a bath towel around your shoulders that you don’t really care about (the shampoo and dye will run and could potentially get on your towel).

, Make sure the shower cap covers all of your hair and is securely fitted on your head. Use a hairdryer to heat your hair, but take care not to hold the heat on one spot for two long or you could potentially melt the plastic. The heat will help the shampoo strip your hair of color.If you don’t have a plastic shower cap, you can use a plastic bag. Wrap it around your head and secure the opening in the front with a clip.

, Once you have let it sit, rinse your hair thoroughly with warm water. Lather your hair with shampoo two more times, rinsing after each time you use the shampoo. When you are done rinsing, the foam should only have a hint of dye left.

, Rub your hair thoroughly with the conditioner, making sure your whole head is covered. If your hair is long enough, clip it up, otherwise just leave it down.

, Once your hair is semi-dry, let your hair sit for 25 to 30 minutes. Rinse your hair with cool water so that all of the conditioner gets washed out.

, To close the hair cuticles up, blast your hair with freezing cold water. This will help to ensure that your hair retains the nutrients it needs from the conditioner. You should see that the dye has faded to roughly 2/3rds of what is once was. Let your hair rest for a day and then repeat this process."

Use vitamin C tablets.,
Invest in Epsom salt.",How to Remove Blonde Hair Dye1," You can buy hair color remover at most drug stores and salons. You can follow the directions on the bottle to figure out to use it to remove color from your hair. Usually, you apply remover to your hair and let it sit for a specific timeframe before rinsing it out.Make sure to get the right color remover for your hair type. Color removers are sold for permanent dye as well as temporary dye.
If a color remover does not work right away, try it again. Very strong colors may take a couple rounds to remove.;
, Some people find that anti-dandruff shampoo actually helps remove color. It is usually far less costly than color removal products. Simply wash your hair with anti-dandruff shampoo and see if any color is removed. This tends to work better if you act fast. If the color has time to set in, it will be harder to remove., You can pick up vitamin C tablets at any drugstore. You should crush two tablets and mix them into your current shampoo. Then, wash your hair as you normally would. You may notice some of the color fading.This does not work with all types of dye and hair colors. You may have to try another method if vitamin C does not work for you.

, You can use this method in the bath. Sprinkle a generous amount of Epsom salt into the water and add some baking soda. Then, take a bath and soak your hair until you notice color fading.This only works with semi-permanent hair colors. If you colored your hair using permanent dye, you will have to try another method.

, Rub up a soapy lather, allowing the dish soap to penetrate deeply into the hair. Lather your hair for at least a couple of minutes.

, Dish soap causes hair to become very dry and strips out natural oils, so be sure to rinse it out thoroughly. You will probably have to repeat this technique more than once, but because dish soap is so harsh, don't repeat it too many times in a row.








, The results won't be drastic right away, but you should start to see the color fade significantly after doing this for two to three days.








, Always follow the last rinse with a deep conditioning treatment such as hot oil. Dish soap is extremely drying; your strands will need a dose of hydration every time you use it.

Make a paste out of Vitamin C tablets.,
Apply the paste to wet hair and let it sit for 1 hour.,
Rinse it out and wash your hair.",How to Remove Dye from Hair3," If you dyed your hair a darker color with a semi-permanent dye (one that claims to wash out in 28 shampoos) and only a couple of days have passed, try this technique. Dump a bunch of vitamin C tablets in a bowl, add hot water, and crush with a spoon to make a thick paste.








If it's been longer than 3 days, you probably won't see drastic results from vitamin C.

, Be sure to apply the paste to wet hair, not dry hair. The vitamin C penetrates best when your hair is wet. After applying the paste, put on a shower cap or wrap up your hair in plastic. Let the paste sit for 1 hour. 







, Rinse out the paste thoroughly, then shampoo and condition your hair as you normally would. As long as you apply vitamin C within a few days of dyeing your hair, you should see significant results.








You will not need to re-color your hair; the paste is non-damaging.

Decide how many streaks you’d like.,
Get bleaching and streaking supplies.",How to Put Streaks in Your Hair at Home1," First, you will need to decide on a color for your streaks. If it’s your first time, it’s usually better to go with a color that is only slightly lighter or darker than your own hair color. But, the color you desire is ultimately your choice. You may want blonde streaks, or pink or purple streaks. If you're unsure what will look good in your hair, start small by streaking one piece of hair with your favorite color. If you love it, you can always add more.Some people choose to have one pretty pink or purple streak running down the side. This adds a subtle beauty to your style.
For a punk look, add a lot of streaks extending from the crown of your head down to the tips. Choose blue, green, or platinum blonde.;
, Consider how many streaks you would like to put in your hair. You may want a few streaks for a subtle effect, or a head full of streaks to dramatically change your hair color. It’s important to plan what your desired outcomes is before beginning the dyeing process.If you aren’t confident about dyeing your hair on your own, it’s better to start with only a few streaks.

, The supplies you get will be partially determined by the natural color of your hair. If you have light blonde hair and are planning to streak it with a darker color, you may be able to get away without bleaching it first. If you have dark or medium hair and want a light or unnatural color, you'll definitely need to bleach before streaking to make sure the color comes out looking bright and beautiful. You can buy your supplies at a beauty supply shop, like Sally’s Beauty Supply. The supplies you will need are:Bleach powder, which comes in either packets or tubs. If you're doing just a few streaks, you won't need much.
Crème developer, which makes the bleach work. If your hair is already blonde or light brown, use a 20 or 30 volume developer. If your hair is dark brown or black, you may need 40 volume developer. Never get a volume higher than 40, or you'll damage your hair.
Red Gold Corrector is added to the bleach powder to increase its effectiveness, so you don't have to bleach twice. You will need this if your hair is on the darker side.
""Purple shampoo,"" which is a special shampoo designed to wash bleached hair.
A tint brush, a bowl, and aluminum foil.

Put on clothes you are ok with staining. Something that you only wear at home or would feel comfortable getting paint on. This is not something you want to do in formal wear.
Brush your hair before application. The chemicals could get caught in the tangles of your hair and remove more dye in these areas. This can cause you to have spots throughout your hair where more dye was removed.
Use a balm like vaseline to cover your face and around your hairline to avoid any staining or skin interactions. This will keep the skin from having too much chemicals on it. This is also a great option to remember the next time you dye your hair to keep your skin from changing colors.
Put on your gloves and start mixing. Now that you are prepared for working with the chemical read the instructions and mix it before putting it on your head. Some kits will have a very sulfur or rotten egg smell that could be distracting. It may be best to turn on a bathroom fan.

, When using an at-home hair color removal kit, be aware that you may have to dye your hair following the removal of the black dye. This is due to the fact that your hair will likely be lighter in color than its natural shade following the removal of the black hair dye. While this may be acceptable for some, you may prefer to add additional color to get a more natural look. You may also want to wait to color your hair again for at least a couple of weeks to give time to rest. However, many kits will say your hair is safe to dye immediately after use.

Wash out the bleach.,
Use a purple shampoo.",How to Put Streaks in Your Hair at Home2," Bleaching and dying hair can really dry it out, so you'll want to give your hair a good head start. In the days leading up to streaking it, don't shampoo it or use hairspray and other hair products. Let your hair's natural oils protect it from the chemicals you'll be applying. When you're ready to streak it, start with hair that is completely dry.Your package of bleach may specify that you start with clean hair. Check the instructions before use.

, You need to separate the hair that will be bleached and colored from the rest before you can begin the process. You can do this with a highlighting cap, or by using hair clips and aluminum foil. Beauty supply stores sell caps used to highlight your hair. You place the cap on your head and use a hook to pull strands of hair through tiny holes. Use this if you want all-over streaks.
Hair clips and aluminum foil is the better technique to use if you want just a few large, bold streaks. Pull back the hair you don't intend to streak and clip it away from your head. Now take a long strip of aluminum foil and place it underneath the section of hair you want to streak. Pinch it around the roots to keep it in place.

, Put the bleach, developer, and red gold corrector in a bowl. Read the instructions that came with the bleach powder and developer to figure out how much to mix together. The amount you use depends on the size of the bottle you bought, and the brand of product you’re using.If you're only streaking a few sections of hair, you can half the recipe, since you won't need enough to bleach your entire head.
The finished mixture will look bluish white.

, Use the tint brush to apply bleach from the tips to the roots of the sections of hair. Use only enough bleach needed to cover and saturate the hair. Continue applying bleach until the hair is completely covered.It is important to wear gloves when applying bleach. The chemicals used in bleach are strong and can stain your hands and burn your skin. Do not get bleach anywhere near your eyes.
If you're using the highlighting cap method, cover your head with a large piece of plastic wrap while the bleach sets in.
If you're using the aluminum foil method, fold the foil over the section of hair to cover it and protect it from drying out.

, Use a towel to wipe off a little bleach. If your hair is blonde, the bleaching process is finished. If it still looks dark, apply more bleach to the area you wiped off, replace the plastic wrap or aluminum foil, and give it more time. Keep checking every 10 to 15 minutes until it is finished.


Don't leave the bleach in for more than 45 minutes, even if your hair still looks dark. Your hair can get damaged if you leave the bleach in longer.
You may have to wait a day and bleach it again to achieve the desired effect (this is common for people with very dark brown or black hair).

Dye your hair the day after you wash it.,
Protect the perimeter of your hairline.,
Reinforce the perimeter with cotton.,
In a pinch, try masking tape.",How to Prevent Hair Dye from Staining Skin1," The oils from your scalp and pores are natural protectants. They repel water, and since dyes are water-based, they are your first defense against stained skin. Try to wait at least one day after your last shampoo to dye your hair. Bonus: hair dye adheres better to dirty hair than it does to slippery, clean hair.





;
, Using petroleum jelly, moisturizing cream, or a thick lotion to create a protective wall just outside of your hairline, around the entirety of your head. You should apply this layer thickly, but there’s no need to make it extend too far down your head. Half an inch to an inch of moisturizer should be plenty.








Be careful not to get your protectant of choice in your hair, and don't forget the tops and undersides of your ears.
Don’t use a moisturizer that breaks you out, or you could get acne around your hairline.

, For extra protection, press teased-out cotton balls, or cotton coil, into the moisturizer you applied. This way, if any hair dye manages to seep out of the hairline, the cotton will soak it up.








If the moisturizer isn’t sticky enough to hold the cotton, don’t panic--just apply more moisturizer over it, and forget about the cotton.

, If you don’t have any moisturizer thick enough to get the job done, don’t despair. Instead, you can use a lightly adhesive painter’s, masking, or gaffer’s tape applied to the edge of your hairline. Be careful not to catch your hair in the tape, and definitely don’t use another type of tape (like masking or duct) instead!Be careful when pulling tape off. Masking tape can potentially pull out or irritate the soft, fine hair known as vellus hair that covers your body, including your face.

Wear plastic gloves.,
Wear an old shirt.,
Wrap an old towel around your shoulders.,
Wipe away any errant dye.,
Keep your dyed hair up.",How to Prevent Hair Dye from Staining Skin2," People often concentrate on keeping their hairlines stain-free, but forget about their hands. It’s easy to avoid blue fingers and nails if you wear simple disposable gloves. Wear gloves the whole time you apply the dye, and even the first few times you wash your newly colored hair.








Many hair dye kits come with gloves to make the process easier.
Don’t wear latex gloves if you’re allergic! There are plenty of latex-free alternatives available.

, Ideally, you should wear a long-sleeved, high-necked shirt when you dye your hair. Cover as much skin as you can, to protect against drips that can cause stained skin. Once you’ve been doing this for a while, you’ll probably have a designated dye shirt that you wear every time you color.







, To offer your neck some extra protection, swaddle it in a hand towel that no one will get mad at you for staining. Pull it tightly, and secure with a duckbill or binder clip. This will prevent hair dye from dripping down onto your neck and staining it.









, No matter how carefully you cover your skin, accidents can happen. If dye does land on your face or neck, wipe it off as soon as you notice, using a rubbing alcohol-soaked cotton ball.Then, rinse with water.










It’s best to keep rubbing alcohol and cotton balls handy as you color your hair. Most people have a small mess-up or two.
If you get a giant blob on your neck, remove the bulk of it with a paper towel or toilet paper, then use the cotton ball and rubbing alcohol to get the last of it off.

, If you’re working out, going out in the rain, or in any other circumstance where your freshly-dyed hair could get damp, put it up in a ponytail or bun. Otherwise, residual dye could sneak out and stain your neck or even your shirt. Once you’ve washed your hair a few times, you can relax this rule."

Cover your hair when bathing.,
Shampoo with color-safe shampoo.You’ll want to use shampoo that’s designed for color-treated hair, to better keep all your colors from bleeding.",How to Prevent Hair Color from Bleeding1," During the dyeing process, coat lighter hair in conditioner to protect it. The conditioner will act as a shield when you rinse the dye itself out, lessening the unwanted contact that the dye has with your hair., Washing it too early can dislodge the coloring agents. Though it wouldn’t affect the vividness of your dyed hair too much, those colors can easily find their way into the parts of your hair where you don’t want them., Unless you’re ready to take all your showers cold, you’ll need to start washing your hair over the sink in cold water. During shower time, wear a cap or pin it up out the way to ensure it doesn’t get wet in the hot water. Hot water opens up the cuticles in your hair and lets some of the dye out; run-off here will be particularly noticeable when you’re trying to keep the colors in your hair separate from one another.,


If your hair’s getting too dirty with fewer shampoos from fewer showers, try out a dry shampoo to keep your hair clean in those interim periods.

Use purple shampoo.,
Install a shower head filter.,
Use a toner.,
Get hair wet before going in the pool.,
Use an acidic hair rinse to counteract green tones.",How to Prevent Natural Blonde Hair from Darkening1," A number of purple shampoos--literally, the shampoo is purple--are available at salons and drugstores, and they work to counteract brassiness in blonde hair.”Brassiness” is when blonde hair takes on an unflattering yellow or orange tone. It results when the blue molecules in hair begin to fade and leave the yellow and orange molecules to shine through more strongly.
Purple shampoos work by restoring blue tones to the hair, helping to prevent brassiness.;
, The minerals in tap water can contribute to changing blonde’s natural tone into a brassier color (from iron deposits) or into a greenish color (from the chlorine in the water).Installing a filter on your shower head will help prevent those color-changing minerals from being absorbed into your hair and will help keep your hair its natural shade.

, If your hair is taking on a brassy tone, make an appointment at the hair salon to have toner applied or buy toner at a drugstore and apply it yourself.Toner increases the blue and purple tones in your hair and mutes the orange and yellow ones, counteracting brassiness.
You can typically expect to pay about $40 or more for a toning treatment at a salon.
A drugstore toner will typically cost around $10, but may not be as effective as a salon treatment.

, Spraying your hair down with tap or filtered water before going in the pool will help prevent it from soaking up chlorine in the pool water.Be sure the water you’re spraying your hair with isn’t already highly chlorinated, or it will defeat the purpose.

, If your hair begins to take on a greenish cast after swimming in a pool or because your shower water contains higher levels of copper or chlorine, you can help tone down the green by using an acidic hair rinse. An acidic hair rinse will remove the buildup left behind by styling products and mineral deposits that can cause changes in your hair color.Mix 1/2 cup (for shorter hair) to 1 cup (for longer hair) of apple cider vinegar with 16 ounces of water. After shampooing, rinse your hair with the vinegar mixture and let it sit for about 5 minutes. Rinse your hair again and style as usual.
Dissolve 6-8 aspirin tablets in a glass of warm water and rinse your hair with the solution. Let it sit for 10-15 minutes, then rinse out the solution."

Shower less.,
Wash with the coolest water you can handle.,
Shampoo less often, and with color-safe shampoo.,
Use hair sunscreen.,
Apply a color glaze.,
Wear hats or scarves while you’re outside.",How to Prevent Hair Color from Bleeding2," Water is the primary culprit in color’s bleeding and fading. While you need not swear off showers altogether (please don’t, actually), regular washing causes the dye to fade.


If you usually shower every day, try transitioning to every other day. Or: wear a shower cap to protect your color on the days you’re only washing your body.
To supplement this strategy, you can try adding a shower filter specially designed to cut down on mineral content in your water. Minerals like iron and lime are particularly harsh on dyes.This advice will be especially relevant if you’re looking to stretch out the timeline on your semi-permanent and demi-permanent hair dyes, as they’re intended to wash out after 12 and 24 shampoos respectively.

, Warm water isn’t going to be the end of your hair color, but hot showers will only expedite the color’s fading. Heat and steam opens the cuticles of your hair and allows the dye to seep out more easily.

, You’ll want to use shampoo that’s specifically marketed for color-treated hair. You should also shampoo less often, as all scrubbing and water will have a negative effect on your hair color.


If your hair’s getting too dirty with fewer shampoos from fewer showers, try out a dry shampoo to keep your hair clean in those interim periods.

, Spritz some hair sunscreen onto your damp hair to better protect your color when you’re out at the beach, or going to be in the sun for extended periods of time. UV rays continue to penetrate and bleach hair, whether it’s dyed or not.Focus on the crown of your head with the sunscreen, as it receives the most sunlight.

, Celebrity stylists suggest using a color glaze product in between dyeing sessions. Glaze will boost the brightness and gloss of your hair, combatting the natural color fade that occurs over time., As mentioned above, UV rays will bleach your hair and affect your hair color. Cover your head while you’re out and about to keep the color consistent, especially when your hair has been freshly dyed.

",How to Prepare Your Hair for Bleaching," Talk to a professional about your treatment plan. Every head of hair has its own history and its own needs. If you plan to bleach in a salon, the stylist who will bleach your hair may agree to see you for a quick consultation free of charge.


You may need multiple visits before your hair is bleached to the right shade. Talking to your stylist beforehand will help you decide.
Some questions you can ask include: ""Will this damage my hair badly? What products should I be using before and after I bleach it? Will it take more than one appointment to get to the color I want?""
Have your stylist test bleach on a strand of your hair. If you are planning to bleach your hair at home, test the bleach on your hair a few days before you bleach. If you are unsatisfied with the color or texture of the strand, take yourself in and consult with a stylist.;
, If you recently treated your hair with any chemicals, wait to bleach. If you have recently dyed, highlighted, permed, or relaxed your hair, wait a minimum of two weeks before bleaching. For best hair health, wait a month or longer before you bleach.Wait even longer if your hair reacted strongly to the treatment.


Hair that is already suffering (brittle, dry, breaking) should not be bleached.
Keep in mind that the darker your hair is, the more damage it will sustain in the bleaching process. People with darker hair tend to have more trouble both getting their hair to the desired shade (because there's so much difference between the starting and finishing shades). Long term bleaching can also cause thinning and irreparable damage. Because the bleaching process is less arduous on lighter coloured hair, these effects are not as common though the risks are still there, because less bleach is used and often less frequently.

, Reduce or stop using a curling iron, hot rollers, flat iron, blow dryer or other heating tools. Heat tools damage hair, and bleach is already going to be hard on it.


Hair that is natural, not treated, is healthier and will suffer less from bleach.

, Don't wash your hair the day of the appointment. In fact, it's healthier for your hair to be a little oily when you bleach. Don't wash your hair for two or more days before bleaching..


Bleach, unlike some hair dyes, does not need to go on clean hair. Having dirty hair isn't going to stop the bleach from distributing evenly., There are a lot of products designed specifically for preserving and/or prolonging bleached and blonde hair, so it's a good idea to make sure that you can afford and access good products for caring for your new hair - before you make the jump. Some salons will sell it at touchups, but it's a lot cheaper to get something at the supermarket. Similarly, extra care needs to be taken with styling because the bleach strips the hair and makes it weaker, even with proper care, so if you're used to (for example) heat curling, consider also adding a heat protection product or non heat styling products to your repertoire.

, Coconut oil in particular strengthens the proteins in your hairbut avocado and argan oils are also great for looking after damaged or treated hair. Starting before you bleach will help your hair tolerate and absorb the bleach better. In particular, the night before you dye your hair, melt half a cup or more of coconut oil in a saucepan or in the microwave. Wait for it to cool, then massage it into your hair. Sleep with a plastic shower cap over it, or cover your pillow with an old towel.


You'll get pretty oily, but don't worry: coconut oil is good for your skin, too.
If you're bleaching at home, you can re-apply the oil before you apply the bleach. Don't wash it out.After you've dyed your hair, continue to look after it by applying oil every day or two. Massage the oil into your hair, starting at the ends and ending near the roots.

, Once or twice a week, apply a mask to your hair. Make a mask at home by mixing any combination of coconut oil, olive oil, yoghurt, honey, bananas, avocadoes, and egg. Blend together and wear in your clean, dry hair for 30 minutes.For best results, start this routine as soon as you know you are going to bleach your hair, and maintain it after you have bleached.


Many hair care professionals recommend using masks instead of washing with conditioner, based on their power to moisturize and strengthen damaged hair.You can also buy professional masks and deep conditioners., Oils such as coconut, argan and avocado are great for healing color-treated, bleached, and fried hair.If you don't have time to make a mask, just massage some oil in, starting at your ends and ending at your roots. Start applying oil as soon as you know you are going to bleach, and maintain it in your routine.

Add honey to your conditioner.",How to Prevent Natural Blonde Hair from Darkening2," To keep your hair from darkening, mix equal parts pure lemon juice and water or olive oil and spray it into your hair.Diluting the juice with water or olive oil will help keep hair from drying out, though it may also cause the juice to take longer to work.


Sit outside in the sun for about an hour and the lemon will help lighten your hair naturally.
Follow the lemon with a conditioning treatment, as lemon juice can be drying to your hair.Repeat several times a week until your hair reaches the desired shade.

, Like lemon juice, hydrogen peroxide can help lighten hair, particularly when exposed to the sun.


Fill a spray bottle with hydrogen peroxide.
Spray the peroxide through your hair.
Go outside and let your hair dry in the sun.
Apply a conditioning treatment afterward, as hydrogen peroxide can be drying to hair.
Repeat weekly until you reach your desired shade.

, Camomile tea--the same stuff you drink--will give a warm golden glow to your hair when you use it as a rinse.Boil about 16 ounces of water and add about 5 camomile tea bags.
Steep the tea bags for 15-20 minutes.
Allow the tea to cool.
After shampooing and conditioning your hair, pour the tea through your hair, or, alternatively, fill a spray bottle with the tea and spray through your hair.
Leave the tea rinse in and let your hair air dry.
Repeat each day until your hair is the desired shade.

, If you prefer a slightly more intensive treatment, you can use a camomile mask on your hair rather than a rinse.Boil about 1 cup of water and add about 4 camomile tea bags.
Steep the tea bags for 15-20 minutes.
Allow the tea to cool.
Mix about 2 tablespoons of plain natural yogurt into the tea (2 tablespoons is best for medium-length hair; if your hair is shorter, use less; if your hair is longer, use more).

Dry and style your hair as usual.",How to Ombre Hair," Therefore, you should choose a color that works well with your natural color. The usual options are a lighter shade of brown, a shade of red/auburn, or a shade of blonde.There are two types of ombre: traditional, and reverse. The traditional ombre has a lighter color at the tips of your hair than at the roots, while a reverse ombre has darker tips and lighter roots.
Select a shade that is no more than two shades lighter than your existing hair color.
The more subtle the color change, the more natural and sun-kissed your hair will appear.
Whenever possible, look for mild or all-natural dyes that will be less damaging to your hair.;
, Equally important as the color selection is choosing where your natural color and dyed color will meet. The lower down your hair the two meet, the safer your look will be. If the two colors meet too high, you run the risk of looking like you have grown-out roots, rather than a beautiful ombre.Ombre hair is more suitable for those with longer hair, as this makes you less likely to look like you have grown-out roots. The longer the hair, the further down the ombre can begin to work its contrast.
In general, the jawline is a good place to have the two tones meet.

, Make sure that there are no tangles left in your hair. This step will make applying the bleach easier, but it will also help you to make sure that your hair will be evenly colored., There is a good chance that you will get bleach or dye onto your clothes during the process. An artist or styling smock should help prevent this, though. If you do not have a smock to throw on, change into an old t-shirt that you can get dirty.

, Gloves generally come with a dye kit but if they don’t, you can simply use normal rubber, vinyl, or latex gloves. Remember that it is very important to wear gloves when dyeing or bleaching your hair.


If you do not use gloves, you can end up dyeing or bleaching your hands in addition to your hair. The bleach can also irritate your skin, causing a burning sensation.

, Unless you are doing a reverse ombre, you will need to use bleach to lift the color from your hair. There is the option of using blonde hair dye - which is safer on your strands - but it doesn’t lift as much color so your end-result will be much more subtle.


Developer comes in 10, 20, 30, and 40 volumes. However, you should not need 30 or 40 volumes to achieve an ombre look.
The easiest and cheapest at home bleach method is to use equal parts of 20 volume peroxide and powdered bleach. Mix 2oz each of the 20 volume peroxide and powder until they are completely combined into a creamy mixture.
Always mix the bleach in a well-ventilated area to avoid inhaling too much of the fumes.

, Part your hair down the middle so that it is split half-and-half. Then, divide both halves into as many sections as you want. At the very least, you should divide each half into half again, splitting your hair into quarters.If your hair is long and/or thick, you may want to divide it into more sections.
Pin or tie each section off to separate it from the rest. If using clips, always be sure they are non-metallic – metals can react with the chemicals you’re using on your hair.
Tease up the hair around the area where you want the ombre to begin. Teasing your hair around this area will help prevent a stark line or line of demarcation where you applied the bleach.

, If you’re using a dye or bleach kit, chances are you were provided with a small brush to apply the bleach. If not, the best option is to use an applicator brush. You can find these are your local beauty supply store.


Alternatively, a similar soft, small brush will work well for application. Just make sure that you use a brush that you would be okay with tossing out after you are done.

, Add bleach starting at the ends and working your way up to the desired fade line. Don’t feel like you need to work fast or to work in large sections; work in such a way that you get all the strands evenly coated with the lightening product.


Make sure that you apply the bleach evenly to both sides of your hair. Check in the mirror to make sure that the bleach starts at about the same spot on both sides.Make sure that you coat all of the hair that you want to bleach. Inspect your strands to check for any spots you may have missed – even saturation is key.
To avoid a stark line or line of demarcation, apply the bleach using an applicator brush and take vertical strokes down the hair strand, rather than painting the hair in a horizontal motion.

, Depending on how light you want your hair to be, you will need to let the bleach set for anywhere from 10-45 minutes. To check, remove the bleach from a small strand of your hair after about 10-20 minutes. If you like the shade, remove the rest of the bleach. If you want to go lighter, leave it in and check again in 5-10 minutes.


For a slight change in color, leave the bleach in for only 10-20 minutes.
For a more bold change in color, leave the bleach for 40-45 minutes. Leaving the bleach in for longer will also help prevent orange or brassy tones., Keeping your gloves on, rinse out the bleach with warm water. Then, wash your hair with a sulfate-free shampoo. Be sure to get out all the bleach, or your hair will continue to lighten. Don’t condition your hair just yet.

, Use a towel to dry it off before beginning the coloring process. You may even want to wait for an hour or two to allow your hair to get mostly dry.

, Divide your hair into its original sections. Tie off the ends with elastic bands or hair clips to make your dying job a bit easier. Use at least 2-3 sections, or as many more as you need to feel comfortable.


Again, use non-metallic clips to avoid reactions with the dying chemicals.

, Gloves generally come with a dye kit but if they don’t, you can simply use normal rubber, vinyl, or latex gloves. Remember that it is very important to wear gloves when dyeing or bleaching your hair. If you do not, you will end up dyeing or bleaching your hands as well.

, Most box hair dyes require a bit of measuring and mixing, so follow the instructions and prepare your dye. Make sure that you mix your dye in a well ventilated area.

, Follow the application instructions that came with your hair dye to properly add it to your hair.


If you’re dying your hair with a traditional ombre (lighter ends), then apply the hair dye to all the bleached sections of hair and just a bit further up your strands as well.
If you’re doing a reverse ombre, add the color just up to the color fade line, and then a second heavier coat near the tips (similar to the bleach application).
Make sure that you coat all of the hair that you want to dye. Inspect your strands to check for any spots you may have missed. As with bleach, even saturation with dye is very important.

, Follow the box instructions to be determine how long you should leave the dye in your hair. Wait the recommended amount of time for your hair dye to set. Since your hair has been bleached, you probably won’t need to leave the dye in for more than ten minutes.

, Keeping your gloves on, rinse out the dye with warm water. Then, wash your hair with a sulfate-free shampoo. Bleaching/coloring your hair can be very damaging, so take the time to use a deep conditioner to help add some moisture back into your locks.

, With your hair being a tad fried from the chemical dye, it may be best to allow it to air-dry and avoid any hot tools. However, if you’re like most of us you’ll want to blow dry your hair right away and get it looking back to normal. Doing this also allows you to determine if you’ve gotten the color you want, or if you need to do some touching up post-dye."

Try rhubarb if chamomile is ineffective.",How to Naturally Dye Your Hair2," If you want to enhance the natural blond color of your hair, you can rinse chamomile tea into your hair. Not only can chamomile make naturally blond hair lighter, it can reverse damage. If your hair has brown streaks from sun exposure, for example, a chamomile rinse may be helpful.First, prepare the tea.

Then, strain and cool the mixture., While waiting for the tea to cool, shampoo your hair. Do so as you normally would, using your regular hair care products. You will add the chamomile after your regular washing regimen., Once you finish washing your hair, you can add the chamomile. Pour the mixture over your hair at least 15 times. You should pour it into your hair over a basin, bowl, or a blocked sink. You want to re-use the same chamomile over and over again on your hair. When you finish, wring out any excess moisture. Let the mixture set for half an hour and then rinse out your hair using clear water.If you can't find chamomile flowers, you can also use calendula, mullein blossoms, yellow broom flowers, saffron, turmeric, or quassia chips., A chamomile rinse might not work for everyone. Many blonds use rhubarb root to enhance their hair color. Rhubarb tends to add a honey-colored glow to naturally blond or light brown hair.


Take three cups of hot water and pour them over four tablespoons of rhubarb root, chopped into small chunks. Let simmer for 20 minutes.Strain the concoction and then pour it over your hair. As with the chamomile, pour the mixture over your hair 15 times, catching it in a bowl or basin to use again.Rinse your hair with clear water and then let your hair air dry.

Prepare your paste.,
Apply to your hair.,
Rinse your hair.",How to Naturally Dye Your Hair3," You can use henna powder to bring out your hair's natural brunette shades. However, how you prepare a henna mixture depends on the specific shade of brown you're trying to achieve.


When used alone, henna can produce an orange-red shade. Unless you're looking for a particularly bold color, it's a good idea to mix henna with other herbs or roots. However, if your hair white, gray, or another very light shade you may be better off using henna solo.If you have dark hair already, mix henna with some chamomile to lighten its effects. Use one part powdered chamomile and two parts powdered henna., Once you've decided how dark you want to go, prepare your paste. Take the henna powder, with whatever additives you're using, and throw in enough boiling water to produce a paste. Then, add a tablespoon of vinegar. Blend well and allow the mixture to sit until lukewarm to the touch., First, run your hair under clean running water to get it damp. Then, slip on a pair of rubber gloves.

Try a sage rinse.,
Use alder bark.,
Try walnut hulls.",How to Naturally Dye Your Hair4," If your hair is black or very dark brown, you can bring out these natural colors using sage. If your hair is graying, sage can also serve to hide gray hairs.


Use dry sage, which you can buy at most supermarkets. Steep about a handful of sage in a quart of boiling water for at least 30 minutes. Allow it to cool.Strain the sage and water. Then, pour the mixture over your hair 15 times. Make sure to catch the mixture as it falls through your hair, using a bowl or basin. You'll want to re-use the same substance. Allow it to sit in your hair for 30 minutes before washing it out with cool water.This is a method that takes awhile to work. It will not dye your hair instantly. Rather, the effect will build over the course of a few weeks. Repeat this process weekly until you get the shade you want. From there, re-dye your hair once a month to maintain that shade., If sage does not work for you, you can try using alder bark. This is a botanical substance that produces a slightly lighter shade than sage. It can be used to lighten graying locks or darken naturally blond hair.


Obtain bark chips from a health food store or buy them online. Simmer an ounce of the chips in a quart of water for about half an hour. Cool, drain, and use the mixture the same way you would use a sage mix., Simple walnut hulls are something many swear by when it comes to darkening hair. Walnut hulls (the nuts' outer casings) stain easily, so be careful when using this method. It's a good idea to wear gloves. Walnut hulls also require a lot of preparation before they can be used on hair.


Crush the hulls into a paste. How much you use depends on how much hair you have. You want to be able to coat your hair completely, so you'll need more for longer hair. Cover the paste with boiling water and a dash of salt. Allow the paste to soak for three days. Then, add 3 more cups of boiling water and simmer for five hours. Make sure to simmer the walnut paste in a non-metal pan.Strain the liquid and place the remaining bits of walnut hulls in a cloth sack. Twist the sack very tight, making sure to strain out any remaining juice. Place the remaining liquid in a pot and boil it until it's about a quarter of its original volume.Add a teaspoon of ground allspice to the remaining water. Place the mixture in your refrigerator for about a week. Then, apply to your hair as you would a sage or alder bark mixture."

For dirty blonde hair, use this old trick.",How to Make Your Hair Blonder1," Exposure to sunlight will lighten your hair, especially in the summertime. This is the reason many people claim that their hair color is darker in the winter, when there's less sunlight and people spend less time outdoors.


The more time you spend outside in the sunlight, the lighter your hair will turn.
If you plan on going swimming and spending time in the sun, get your hair wet in the pool first and then let it dry in the sun.;
, Unfortunately, this will only work if your hair is already somewhat blonde. If you're a brunette, it will turn your hair a reddish-orange color.


Apply lemon juice sparingly to your hair, and expose your hair to sunlight for 30-60 minutes.
Alternately, mix the juice of 1 lemon, 1 lime, and 1 orange, and run the mixture through your hair.
While lemon juice will naturally lighten your hair, it will also dry it out. Try mixing it with water to dilute it, and be sure to wash and condition your hair after you go outside.

, Not only is beer great for your hair, but it also lightens it. And because you mix the lemon juice with beer, it won't dry out your hair that much. All you need to do is take lemon juice from half a lemon, 3 tsp of honey, and mix it with beer (golden colored beer), until you have enough to cover your hair. Sit outside in the sun for about an hour, and then wash and condition your hair. Afterwards you can go back outside and let your hair dry in the sun. If you do this a couple of times, your hair will become much lighter, but will look natural.

If you have red in your hair, you should be careful, because this mixture could make your hair a lot redder, even orange. This works best on natural blondes, who had lighter hair when they were little.

, This method is also inadvisable for brunettes, because it will give your hair an orange, brassy looking color. If you have blonde hair already, though, and you want to bleach it a bit more, peroxide will work just fine!


Put a little bit of hydrogen peroxide in a dark spray bottle. Spray sparingly on the parts of your hair you want lighter. Alternately, wet a cotton ball with hydrogen peroxide and brush cotton ball through hair for highlights. Most people leave the peroxide in their hair for about 40 minutes, but you can leave it in there longer for lighter hair. After allotted time, wash hair with cold water and condition hair afterward.

,


You can buy cassia dye prepackaged at your local drugstore or supermarket.
You can also buy cassia powder and mix your own dye. Mix cassia powder with chamomile tea to form a paste. You can add different herbs for different results. Add cinnamon to give your hair faint red or auburn tones. Unbleached chamomile leaves can boost the blonde in the cassia mix. Powdered cloves can help mask the scent. Whatever combination you try, always perform a strand test before dyeing your hair.

,,, Use warm water.

,, If you're a lighter brunette and want more of a bleached blonde look, consider this potent combination.


Mix chamomile, rhubarb, marigold, lemon juice, mullein, and a tiny bit of hydrogen peroxide.
Combine with water, and let it steep overnight.
Apply to hair, and sit in the sun ideally from 11:30 AM to 2:45 PM. It works on blondes, too, but if you're a light brunette who's tired of reading about natural dyes that only work on blondes, try this, and don't be afraid of the rhubarb. After several tests we've determined that it doesn't turn your hair orange or urine-yellow.

Test your hair first.,
Do not attempt major changes with natural dye.,
Use caution if you've dyed your hair at a salon previously.",How to Naturally Dye Your Hair6," You'll want to test out any natural hair dye method before using it. Your hair may react poorly to a certain method or produce a color you dislike. Dye a small portion of your hair first, using a lock from the back of your head. See if you like the results before attempting to dye your own hair.

, Natural hair dye will not dramatically change the color of your hair. It seeks primarily to enhance your hair's existing shades. For example, if your hair is a dirty blond using chamomile can produce a lighter, more yellow blond. However, adding henna to naturally blond hair will not turn your hair brown. If you want to completely change your hair color, it's better to go to a salon.

, Some salon products may cause your hair to react poorly to certain natural hair dye methods. As always, test the method on a small piece of hair before attempting to dye all your hair. You may also want to call your stylist and ask her what products he or she used and whether they interact poorly with natural hair dyes.

Pick out your dye color.,
Perform the required pre-dye routine.,
Follow the instructions on the package to the letter.,
Perform post-dye routine.",How to Make Your Hair Blonder2," Obviously, it can be hard to get your hair looking exactly like the hair in the product picture, but use that as a frame of reference. Choose a color that you might be comfortable with if it were a couple shades lighter or a coupler shades darker, just to be safe.

, There are some tips on what to do pre-dye that might not show up on the dye package instructions. Here they are:


Don't wash your hair. It might not be ideal, but try to leave your hair unwashed for as long as possible before dyeing. Your hair builds up natural oils that will protect the follicles from damage. Shoot for three days of not washing.
Use Vaseline or petroleum jelly on your hairline to prevent staining. You don't want the outline of your forehead looking a different shade.
Use an old towel over your shoulders, preferably one that will never see the company of friends, lovers, or the public.
Enlist a friend or family member to help you. They'll be able to apply the dye more evenly, eliminating patches.

, Many people skim the directions or try to cheat by only leaving the dye in their hair for half of the recommended time if they want a darker shade. This doesn't work!


Dyes strip the hair of its natural pigments. Everyone's hair has blue, red, and yellow pigments, just in different concentrations. Blue is the first pigment to go when you dye your hair, then red, then yellow. If you don't leave the dye in long enough, you'll only strip blue and red pigments perhaps, and end with yellow hair. Follow the instructions on the product box to avoid ending with yellow hair!

, This is just as important as the pre-dye routine. Make your hair look brilliant with these steps:


Use conditioner after dying to seal the hair follicles and reduce fading.
Use conditioner in your hair before jumping into the swimming pool. This will form a barrier between the chlorine and your hair.
Apply weekly coats of color seal gloss. This will keep the color in your hair looking vibrant and beautiful, and ensure that you won't have to dye it as often.

Re-dye your hair as needed.",How to Lowlight Hair Yourself," Some hair dye manufacturers already have products made especially for ""at home"" lowlights. Pick this if it is available. If not, choose your color carefully according to your natural hair color.;
, Pick one to three colors in a similar shade. Pay attention to the shade of your skin, working with colors that are cool or warm, depending upon your skin's natural color. Make sure you are using the same brand of dyes, to avoid timing confusion when you color.Blondes should try a deeper shade of blonde or a light brown. Most store-bought coloring advertises these shades as caramel, coffee and honey colors.
Brunettes should choose rich brown and red shades. These may appear on the box as cinnamon or auburn. Brunettes with pale skin should avoid color that is too dark, as you need to compliment your skin tone. Choose gold or copper tones instead.
Red heads should choose red shades. However, if your hair is dark, try golden brown or brunette tones.
Black haired people should choose dark shades that are tinted with other colors.

, This is recommended by most box colorants. Test the dye by placing a drop or two of it on a small area of your skin. Wait 10 minutes to see if you have a reaction. If the skin that the dye is on or near begins to turn red or bumpy, you are allergic to the dye and should not use it.

, You do not want to wash your hair the day you plan on dyeing it. The natural oils your hair develops when it remains unwashed help to bind the dye to your hair. These oils also help your dye last longer.


Avoid conditioning your hair the day before you dye it. Conditioners disrupt the natural oils your hair produces.

, As you may have guessed, dye can really mess up a shirt, rug, or anything else it might get on besides your hair. In order to protect against dye stains, cover the ground where you will be dyeing your hair, as well as any nearby surfaces, with newspaper. You should wear an old t-shirt that you don’t mind getting stained.It is a good idea to have paper towels nearby, just in case there is a dye spill.

, Place an old towel that you don’t mind staining around your shoulders. Put latex or rubber gloves on before you mix the dye so that you don’t ruin that cute manicure you just got.Most dyeing kits come with gloves to use during the dyeing process. If your box doesn’t, you can purchase latex and rubber gloves at your local drugstore.

, In order to do this, you will need to rub vaseline along your hairline, neck, and over your ears. Vaseline helps wash away the dye after you have finished dyeing your hair.


Some dye boxes come with a conditioner made specifically for protecting your skin from the dye. If your dye comes with this, use it.
You can also use lip balm instead of vaseline, but vaseline is recommended.

, The dye you purchased will have come in a box that has directions on. Follow those specific instructions for your dye. Your box should also contain a mixing bowl and brush. If it did not, a plastic bowl that you don’t mind staining will work just as well. Some dyes come with an activator. If this is the case with your dye, mix it into the dye. If you are using multiple dyes, mix them all at once to make the dyeing process more efficient.


If you do not have a dye brush or your dye box didn’t come with one, you can use a large paint brush purchased at your local art supply store. The brush should be no smaller that one and a half or two inches wide.

, Keep in mind that only some dyes need to be mixed with developer. Your dye should have come with developer. If it did not, but the box says that you need to use developer, you will have to buy it. You can purchase developer at most beauty supply stores.


If you are using dye that is much darker than your hair, you should only use 10% developer.

, To do this, use a comb with a pointed end to make the process easier. Unlike highlights that are added to the top of your head, these will go at the bottom, so you will need to pin your hair up on top of your head if it is long.It also helps to brush your hair thoroughly so that you do not have any tangles that make sectioning off the hair harder.

, They do not need to be symmetrical. It will look more natural if they are varied.For a more noticeable look, plan your lowlights close together.
For a more natural look, plan your lowlights further apart.
Blondes should avoid adding too many lowlights in the back of the hair, as these may not look natural, especially when they are exposed to direct sunlight.

, Doing this ensures that you are choosing the areas you have planned for each shade. Your dye kit should come with an applicator or a brush to dye your hair with.

, Place the applicator no closer than 1/2 inch (1.3 cm) away from your scalp and follow the hair to the tip. You want to evenly coat the section of hair, making sure that every inch of it is covered.


If you plan to do many small sections of lowlights, use small strips of foil to section off hair as you dye it with different colors. Place the foil under the hair. Brush the dye from root to tip and fold the foil. Keep the dye on the strands for the indicated time, then remove and rinse.

, This is called the processing time, which is when the dye binds to your hair. The box that the dye came in will tell you how long you need to leave the dye on for.

, Use a wet paper towel or washcloth with soap to do this. You don’t want to leave dye drips on your skin for two long or they may begin to dye your skin. While this is not permanent, it can last for several days.

, You can either rinse your hair in the sink or take a shower. Use cool water to wash your hair but don’t use any shampoo or normal conditioner--only use the conditioner provided in your dyeing kit. Don’t be shocked if it looks like all of the dye is running off of your head in rivulets--it’s not, but it is going to look like it. Continue rinsing your hair until you can see anymore dye going down the drain.


If post-dye conditioner did not come in your dyeing kit, purchase some at a beauty supply store. It should be a conditioner specifically made for dyed hair.
Do not use normal shampoo and conditioner for at least 24 to 48 hours.
If you used very temporary shampoo, dye will wash off of your hair every time you shower.

, It is best to avoid direct sunlight for at least a day after you have dyed your hair. UV rays from the sun can reduce the dyed color. The same goes for blow dryers--avoid blow drying your hair for several days after the dyeing process.

, After you have waited at least 24 hours, you can wash your hair with shampoo. However, it is highly recommended that you buy shampoo and conditioner specifically made for dyed hair. Normal shampoos can strip your hair of the dye.

, To keep your lowlights looking perfect, repeat this process every 6 to 8 weeks for short hair or every 3 months for long hair. In order to avoid the fried look that can sometimes come from hair that is dyed too often, leave your conditioner in your hair for a full five minutes while you shower.

To create a slightly stronger fading agent, mix together equal parts shampoo and baking soda. Apply this mixture to your dyed hair as described above.
Instead of shampoo, you may use dish soap. Dish soap will remove slightly more color than clarifying shampoo. It will also leave your hair drier and frizzier., Laundry detergents contain chemicals that will drastically fade the color of your hair. This method may remove up to 75% of the dye from your hair. If you use this method, make sure the detergent does not contain bleach or bleaching agents.


Apply a tablespoon of detergent to your damp hair.

Try on a wig with the same color you intend to dye your hair.",How to Pick a Hair Color1," If your hair color drastically differs from your skin tone, it will give you a more dramatic look. If you want people to look at you and notice you, or you want to stand out in a crowd, consider going down this path. If you choose a hair color that compliments the tonality of your skin and eyes, you'll be able to achieve a more natural look.Think about the reasons why you want to dye your hair and choose a color that helps you achieve your goals.


If you're tired of being overlooked or passed by in the bar or a club, having a drastic hair color may invite people to have conversations with you.
The more drastic your dye differs from your natural hair color, the more likely it will look brassy or ashy.Colors that don't naturally occur in nature like pink, blue, green, or purple will make you stand out.;
, Certain hair colors will cost more for you and will be more expensive depending on your desired hair color. For instance, dark haired people that plan on going blonde must invest in monthly root touch-ups and quality sulfate free shampoos and conditioners to keep their hair looking healthy.When considering your finances, think about how you want to get your hair dyed. You can either go to a professional salon which will cost more, or go to a department store and purchase a home dyeing package.


Root touch-ups vary in cost depending on the salon or area that you are in and can range anywhere from $50 to $150.Call salons in your area and ask about prices for different services, as well as the frequency in which you'll need to maintain it.
If you are on a budget, you can at home root touch-up kits for less than $35.If you can't afford the cost of the expensive monthly maintenance, consider getting highlights instead.
You can also experiment or look into semi-permanent dye which may be cheaper.

, Unlike all-over color, highlights are a process that lightens portions or strips of your hair but not all of it. Lowlights, on the other hand, are when the hairdresser darkens part of your hair. Highlights and lowlights are more subtle than all-over color and cost less in maintenance because only a portion of the hair needs to be re-dyed. Also, they cause less hair damage because only a portion of the hair is being bleached or dyed.The cost of getting highlights can be anywhere from $75 to over $300.
While initial cost for highlights may be more expensive, touchup costs for highlights and lowlights end up being anywhere from 50%-70% less than all-over color., Semi-permanent or temporary dye does not require you to bleach your hair and can be healthier than using permanent dye. However, exposure to the air and shampooing will fade the color quickly, and the dye typically only lasts for six weeks. Permanent dye uses the process of oxidation, which infuses the color into your hair for a longer period, but can also cause more damage to your hair than a temporary dye would.If you are unsure of the color that you want, use a temporary dye first before committing to a permanent dye.

, Talk to your hairdresser and ask for advice when seeking out a new hair color. Their experience will allow them to give you tips on what colors they think are right for you. They can also fill you in on the cost of getting the color done, as well as the cost of maintenance over time. If you regularly go to the same hairdresser, ask for their advice, as they already have a good idea of your hair type and its health.


If you have damaged or broken hair, make sure to consult a professional before dying it yourself.

, A good way to choose a hair color is to copy a celebrity that you like. Make sure that you have similar skin tones or eye colors because the pigment can look vastly different on different people. If you find that a celebrity has the same eye color and skin tone as you, but their natural hair color is different, you can also try to dye your hair to their natural shade.


Actress Sofia Turner from the show ""Game of Thrones"" dyed her hair from copper red to icy blonde. She has fair skin and light blue eyes., Trying on a wig will give you a preview of how that hair color will look on you.You can even wear the wig out with your friends to see how comfortable you feel with the new shade.


Make sure to try to get the closest match to your intended hair dye so you have an accurate idea of how you will look in your new color.
You can purchase wigs at beauty salons, wig stores, or online.

Head outdoors.,

Give your hair a honey mask.,
Use vitamin C. Not only a daily health requirement, vitamin C can bring out lighter hues in your locks as well.,
Try hydrogen peroxide.,
Brew up some black tea.,
Rub on some olive oil.",How to Lighten Your Hair Naturally1," There’s a reason everyone is golden and glowing in the summer; the sun! The sun has a natural bleaching effect on hair in addition to tanning your skin. Wait for a sunny day, and then leave your hair down for the sun to work its magic on. Just remember to wear sunscreen so you don’t get burnt in the process.;
, Because time in the sun and swimming outdoors often go hand in hand, it’s hard to differentiate the hair bleaching done by each process. However, sun is not the only process at work; the salt and chlorine in the ocean and pools works to lift the color of your hair (the former naturally). Go for a dive into a nearby bay, and your strands will be lighter in no time.

, The recent trend of ‘no-poo’ or washing your hair without shampoo has led people to the discovery that vinegar works to lighten hair. When you hop in the shower, rinse through your hair with apple cider vinegar. Doing this on a regular basis will slowly lighten your hair over time.

, Similar to vinegar, baking soda is a ‘no-poo’ alternative to chemical-filled shampoos that also lightens hair color. When you go to shower, sprinkle your hair with baking soda and give it a good rub-down. The paste that develops should bleach your hair naturally.

, Want honey-hued hair? Use the real stuff to make a mask. Mix honey with a bit of distilled water and stick it to your hair. Allow it to soak for 30 minutes or more. When mixed with the distilled water the honey undergoes a chemical process that helps to lighten your hair super fast. For a double bonus, head out in the sun while your hair is soaking., Get your hands on a bottle of vitamin C tablets, but use it for your hair rather than your consumption. Crush up 5-10 (depending on the length and thickness of your hair) and add the powder to your shampoo. Washing with this concoction will give your hair a dose of bleaching nutrients.

, Although not the most natural of dying techniques, hydrogen peroxide is a way for you to lighten your hair at home without using several products. Rinse your hair with hydrogen peroxide, leaving it to set for about 10-15 minutes before a second rinse with water. Test this method on a small section of hair first to make sure you’re happy with the color it will change to.

, Useful on many beauty quests, black tea is full of tannic acid which can bring out highlights in your hair over time. Brew a few cups of very strong black tea (using several tablespoons/teabags) and pour it through your hair. Let it soak for up to 30 minutes before rinsing out with warm water., Not only does olive oil nourish your hair by moisturizing it, it also brings out your natural highlights. Slather on some olive oil and let it set in your hair for a minimum of 30 minutes. Rinse it out when you’re tired of oily hair, and you should notice a general brightening of your strands.

Look at the color of your jawline.,
Determine your skin's undertone.,
Think about the color of your eyes.,
Pick a hair color that compliments your tone.",How to Pick a Hair Color2," Make sure to stand in natural light and wear white clothes when determining your skin tone.Colored clothing may reflect artificial light which can affect how you see your skin color. Use a mirror to determine the surface color of your skin. Surface color skin tones are fair, light, medium, or dark.


Fair skin tones are light and burn easily.
Light skin tones are also fair but have more beige and yellow undertones than fair skin.
Medium skin tones are darker and have olive undertones and usually have green, warm brown, or hazel eyes.
Dark skin tones are deep and rich. Those with dark skin tones typically have dark brown eyes.Your surface skin tone may change depending on the season or how much time you spend in the sun., Unlike surface skin tone, undertones remain constant regardless of skin conditions like rosacea and acne. To determine your undertone, look at the color of your veins in your wrist. If your veins appear blue or purple, you have a cool undertone. If they appear greener, then you are warm-toned. Neural toned people will have blue-green veins.


Many people from African or Indian who have an easy time tanning have warm undertones.
If you get red, flush easily, or burn when tanning, you most likely have a cool skin undertone., The color of your eyes also contributes to your overall tone. Those with golden brown, green, and blue eyes are normally warm-toned. Additionally, those with gold specs in their eyes commonly have warm undertones.Those with black or deep, steel blue, or hazel with gray or blue flecks have cool undertones. Keep your eyes in mind when considering your hair color.Light blue or gray eyes look good with light blonde hair.Darker toned people look good in dark brown or mocha hair.

, If you aren't looking to make a fashion statement or have people notice you, then you may want to pick a color that compliments your tone. Doing this will allow your dye to look natural and attractive.


Those with a cool tone look good in colors like wheat blond, walnut brown, tawny blond, golden caramel, or copper.
Those with a medium tone look good in gold, honey, auburn, cinnamon, ebony brown or mocha.Chocolate brown, mahogany, toffee, or other warm and rich colors are best for people with darker complexion."

Chemical dyes may not work as expected on hair which has been previously dyed with henna. Henna at best colors vibrantly grey hair, and may add a dark red hue in bright sunlight for dark colored hair. For African hair, henna might leave your hair feeling brittle.

Undiluted hydrogen peroxide from the bottle will also bleach your hair, but it is much stronger and thus more likely to damage your roots--which is why many people use honey to gently lighten their hair.
Honey also acts as a moisturizer, which counteracts the drying effects of the peroxide within.

, This should be easy to find at most grocery stores and health-food outlets.

Honey is very sticky, and water loosens the consistency so that it is easier to apply to your hair. Apple cider vinegar acts as a natural conditioner.
If you want a more drastic color change, consider adding several capfuls of hydrogen peroxide to the mixture. This accentuates the peroxide that is already present in honey, and reacts with your hair to bleach it several shades lighter. Do not add the extra peroxide if your hair is black or very dark brown--it may come out orange.
For a reddish-blonde hue, you can add henna powder, cinnamon, or ground coffee to the mixture. Several tablespoons of hibiscus petals will add a strawberry-blonde tint., This will allow the ingredients time to settle.

Rub your hair together between your hands. This will help spread the cinnamon.
Consider using a brush to help spread the cinnamon throughout your hair. If you do, make sure that the brush is wet so that the cinnamon will glide through your hair more smoothly.

, If possible, leave the mixture in your hair overnight.


The longer that you keep the cinnamon in your hair, the lighter the end result will be. Four hours will make a slight impact, but you may need to continue the treatment for eight hours or more to achieve the shade that you want.
Err on the side of caution. Remember: you can always try the treatment again!
Cover your cinnamon-hair with a shower cap or a plastic bag so that the cinnamon does not rub off.
You may feel a slight heat and tingling on your scalp--but this is normal, and it will pass.

, When dry, your hair will smell amazing!


If you have curly hair, use shampoo to get the cinnamon out.
If the resulting shade is not light enough for you, remember that you can always try again!

Touch up the lowlights every six weeks.",How to Lowlight Blonde Hair," Highlights are a few shades lighter than your hair, while lowlights are a few shades darker. If you want a more subtle, natural effect, go about 2 shades darker. If you want a more dramatic effect, go 4 to 5 shades darker., Hair comes in two tones: warm or cold. If your hair is honey-colored, with yellow or orange tones, it is warm, and you should choose a warm-toned hair dye. If your hair is ashy or white blond, it is cool, and you should stick with a cool-toned hair dye.If you have warm-toned hair, try a dark caramel for the lowlights.
If you have cool-toned hair, try a taupe shade for the lowlights.

, You can place the lowlights all over your hair for a more realistic effect while still adding plenty of dimension to your hair. You can also create a more dramatic effect by using foil for the lowlights and blending them less. Another option would be to place them in certain areas.Like highlights, lowlights can help frame your face and add definition to your hair. Use this to your advantage!

, Unnatural colors, such as peach, purple, indigo, or pink, are all great choices. They work well on any complexion and can help add dimension to your hair without getting too dull. It should be the opposite of your base shade, however., Cover your counter with newspaper so that it won't get dirty. Mix the hair color with the developer in a bowl according to the instructions on the package. Have a hair dyeing brush handy and wrap a hair dyeing cape around you.

Be sure to wear a pair of plastic gloves for this process.
If you can't find a hair dyeing cape, use an old towel instead.

, The pieces need to be about 4 inches (10.16 centimeters) wide and about the same length as your hair. Fold the top ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) on each piece (narrow side only). This will prevent the foil from scratching you when you put it in your hair., Use a rat-tail comb to create a horizontal part, going from one side of your head to the other. Clip the upper half of your hair up and out of the way and leave the bottom half loose. You can start as high or as low as you want to, depending on how many lowlights you want.If you plan on doing a different pattern, then section off your hair accordingly.

, Grab a thin, 2-inch (5.08-centimeter) wide section of hair from the exposed bottom layer. Weave the handle of the comb up and down through the hair, from one side to the next. Push the comb as close to your scalp as you can., Lift the comb up just enough to separate the top part of the woven hair from the bottom. Slide a piece of aluminum foil under it until the folded part touches your head. Set aside the rat-tail comb and let the strands of hair fall against the aluminum foil.Have your hair covering only half of the foil. Have the remaining 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) or so sticking off to the side.

, Dip your brush into the dye, wipe off any excess on the edge of the bowl, then brush it onto the hair.

You can coat the entire length of hair with dye or just part of it.

, Fold the bottom half of the foil upward so that all of your hair is sandwiched inside the foil. Next, fold the excess foil over the hair, covering it completely.If you only dyed the upper half of your hair, then you don't need to fold the bottom part of the aluminum foil up.

, How long this takes you depends on how many layers of lowlights you do. They should be in roughly the same area as your highlights., Once the dye has set, remove the foil pieces and rinse your hair out using cool water.Wash your hair with color-safe conditioner, then dry and style it as usual., This will help your dye job last longer while hydrating and nourishing your hair. It would also be a good idea to use a deep-conditioning hair mask once a week. This will help keep your hair soft, smooth, and shiny., Too much sun, heat, and pool/ocean water can cause the color to fade. Wear a hat when you step outside for long periods of time. You can also help the color last longer by applying pre-pool treatments that help repel water and lock in the color. This will help prevent the colors from fading in the pool or beach., After spending so much time and effort in creating them, it would be a shame if you didn't show them off. Half-up hairstyles are great for this. You can do a half-up ponytail or bun, or even a Dutch braid., You can also go longer between touchups, depending on how fast your hair grows."

Stay away from chlorine.",How to Keep Dark Dyed Hair from Fading," One of the first and biggest mistakes you can make when it comes to dyed hair is to wash it too soon after dyeing. The dyeing process opens the cuticle layer of hair, which is where the dye actually resides in strands of hair.One of the first steps to preserving color entails giving the cuticle layers of hair enough time to close completely before washing the hair. To do this, you should wait 72 hours after dyeing your hair before ever washing it.As many people already know, the dye will seep out naturally to some degree as the cuticle layers of the hair close. You should wear dark clothing and use dark pillow cases during this period to avoid staining them.;
, Even after the cuticle layer of hair closes, shampooing causes hair to swell and allows the color to escape.By simply washing your hair less often, you can help preserve the color.If you have an oily hair type and would really hate washing less often, take advantage of color-safe dry shampoo.This will allow you to clean your hair minus the water and suds.

, When you do actually wash your hair in the shower, use a shampoo specifically formulated to preserve dyed hair. Most companies now offer lines of color-protecting shampoos and conditioners. These products actually help seal your hair cuticles, which help to lock dye inside hair strands.In addition to using color-protecting products, you should also completely avoid clarifying shampoos because they can strip hair strands and speed up the fading process.Some stylists may recommend a clarifying shampoo the day before a color refresh, however, specifically because they help strip the old dye and ready the hair for the fresh dye.You can also look into products such as Aveda Clove Color Conditioner. This and similar products contain trace amounts of dye and deposit it on your hair when used, essentially providing a micro-recoloring each time you use them.Just make sure to find the product appropriate to the color of your hair.

, Just like hot water opens pores, it also opens the cuticle layers of hair, allowing dye to escape. It may not sound like a very fun proposition, but using cold or even lukewarm water to wet and rinse your hair will help preserve the dye.In addition to avoiding hot water, you should avoid excessive rinsing in general. Once you have completely rinsed shampoo and conditioner out of your hair, don’t simply tilt your head back and allow water to continue running through your hair because this can slowly strip dye as well., As many people may have already noticed, towel drying dyed hair is an easy way to ruin a towel. Roughly towel drying your hair scrapes even more dye out of the cuticle layer of hair that is already open from the shower water swelling hair strands. By gently blotting hair and allowing it to air dry as much as possible, you will strip less dye., Most of us live in locations that have mineral-heavy hard water. If you dye your hair often and can justify the purchase, consider installing a water purification system for the shower. This will eliminate minerals and trace amounts of chlorine from treated water, both of which can strip hair dye., Colored hair is often more brittle, making it more vulnerable to heat. Try to avoid overusing curling irons, flat irons, and blowdryers when styling your hair to keep the hair healthy and stop fading.If your style really requires the use of these items, then make sure you apply a heat-protectant spray first., Many of the common ingredients in hair products can dry, bleach, or strip hair dye. Look for specifically color-safe hair products while especially avoiding products with alcohol, peroxide, or ammonia.In addition to color-safe products, you should use products for your particular hair type—fine, thick, oily, dry, etc.—since these will promote healthier hair and counteract the drying and brittleness that dyeing hair can lead to in general., Keeping in moisture and preventing over-drying of colored hair is important to keeping the hair healthy. By using a hair mask once a week, you can help protect dark-dyed hair. Make sure the product you use is paraben free with aloe, and leave the hair mask on for a full hour with a shower cap over it to help it most effectively penetrate your hair.If you prefer hot oil treatments to hair masks, you can substitute these instead, but avoid using both unless you have extremely dry hair since both can leave your hair looking greasy.

, UV rays are some of the biggest enemies of hair dye. While you no doubt want to show off your lustrous locks in the sunshine, you should still try to minimize sun exposure.Use this as an excuse to show off some of your best sun hats.

, Obviously, no one wants to permanently avoid sunshine. Though less effective than a hat or simply avoiding UV rays, you can use a leave-in hair treatment with UV absorbers to help filter the UV rays.For effective UV absorbers, look for products with benzophenone-3 or -4, polyquaternium-59, cinnamidopropyltrimonium chloride, or butyl methoxydibenzoylmethane., Especially during the summer, the draw of pools and hot tubs can prove too strong even though you know the chlorine is terrible for dyed hair. In these instances, rinse your hair with fresh water before going swimming. By wetting the hair with regular water first, you will limit the chlorine absorption in the pool.Rinsing chlorinated water out of your hair as soon as you get out of the pool or spa will help as well, but you’re still better off avoiding chlorinated water completely when you can.

Combine 2 cups of baking soda and 1/4 cup of clarifying shampoo in a non-metal bowl.The alkalinity of the baking soda works to open your hair up, letting the clarifying shampoo better strip its color.Use a whisk to work the baking soda and shampoo together.,

Blow-dry part of your hair to check the color.,
Make another batch, if necessary.",How to Lighten Dyed Hair2,"


You might want to bump the baking soda up to 3 cups if you have longer than shoulder-length hair.

, Heat, in conjunction with the baking soda, will greatly open the cuticles of your hair. Do not use cool water, because it will close the cuticle.

, You can use your hands, or a spatula. Thoroughly cover the dyed hair, so that you don’t end up with mis-matched color.


Take care not to get the mixture in your eyes! You might want to use a towel or cloth around your head, to keep the mixture from dripping down toward your face.

, The duration will depend on how much color you’re looking to remove. Leave it in for longer for more drastic results, but no longer than the recommended 15 minutes. Multiple batches is recommended if 15 minutes doesn’t prove sufficient.

, As you might need to wash it again—and heat will cause undue strain on your hair—you should only dry a small section of your hair. If the color looks good, then great! If not, you’ll want to mix another batch of baking soda and shampoo and get ready for round 2.

, If your hair hasn’t sufficiently lightened, you can re-apply for better results. A more powerful mixture can be concocted by adding a tablespoon of hair bleach powder to the original recipe. When handling bleach, be sure to wear gloves.


After you’ve finished, avoid any styling that uses heat for a day or two. Both dyeing and “un”dyeing your hair take a toll.

Finished.

",How to Lighten Dyed Hair5," For best results, you’ll want to be able to apply the peroxide to your hair via spray bottle. Pouring it directly from the bottle over your head will leave you to guess as to how much of your hair has been affected.


Peroxide is definitely the least predictable, and likely the least optimal option available to you. It doesn’t work against the dye and chemicals already in your hair, but instead adds another one. Use it with caution.

, Use the “mister” setting, if you have the option, as opposed to the “stream” setting. Spray the hair you wish to lighten from a distance of about a foot away, using a hand or cloth to cover your eyes.


Peroxide is safe to get on your skin, but can cause burning in your eyes.If you get some in them, flush them with cool water.
Going outside in the sun can cause further lightening, but can also dry your hair out. Be aware of the effect sunlight will have if you choose to go outside with the peroxide in your hair.
Use pins or clips to arrange your hair, so that you only spray the hair you want to.

, Excessive peroxide use can easily lead to a brassy, orangey hair coloration.


A deep conditioning is recommended if your hair feels dry after the peroxide treatment.

Color depositing shampoos/glazes are great for refreshing color.",How to Keep Red Hair Color from Fading," Hair color sold in department stores contains aluminum, which coats the hair and prevents the color from holding well. Also, stylists pretty much know what they are doing; red is the trickiest color to keep up with. You want to make sure you have someone who knows what they are doing.;
, This ensures that the color looks real.

, This may seem hard, but you can get a shower-cap to wear while bathing, or just use baby wipes if you don't want to risk it. (Oh, the sacrifices we make for beauty...)

, If you can't bear to take a cold shower, simply rinse with cold water after you've shampooed and conditioned your hair. Alternatively you can keep your hair dry in the shower and wash it in the tub or sink in cold water after your shower. This prevents your whole body from being cold and makes the cold water more bearable.

Bleaching your hair is not recommended for people who are unfamiliar with hair dye and bleach, as the results can be very drastic (not so much in a good way) and highly damaging to your hair. For a fast and simple solution, try using an at-home hair dye with a color that is a couple shades lighter than your actual desired hair color.


Dark hair generally needs to be bleached and lightened before it can be dyed a lighter brown color. This method comes with assumed risk, but it is an alternative solution for quicker results.

, A lightening hair spray can give your brown hair a lighter tint that builds gradually.However, depending on your natural hair color, some lightening sprays have been known to give hair an orange-y coloring, but if you spray you hair with small amounts of the product, any change should be subtle enough to notice the unwanted change in color and stop use.


Usually, the sun brings out the traces of blonde coloring in your hair even more.

, Lightening creams work well on un-dyed natural hair. You simply leave the cream on your hair for a designated amount of time, and then thoroughly rinse out the cream.

Your skin is made up up layers, and as the dye seeps into your skin, it will dye it layer by layer. If you allow the dye to sit on your hands, it will be able to dye more layers of your skin, and deeper layers of your skin.
If the dye is allowed to stain the deep layers of your skin, it will likely take harsh measures to remove, which may damage your skin.;
, Toothpaste has abrasive agents that scrub your teeth, and these will exfoliate your skin. Removing the dead, dyed skin cells of your hands will reveal the new skin underneath, which may not be stained yet.Scrub your hands for about 30 seconds, then rinse with warm water.
If your hands are still stained, try scrubbing again, only this time add a pinch of baking soda.

, This is an especially helpful method if you have sensitive skin. The oils will slowly dissolve and break down the dye while simultaneously softening and conditioning your skin.








Rub the oil over your hands using a cotton ball or a damp washcloth.
The oil may ruin your sheets if you touch them while you sleep, so try wearing gloves or even clean socks on your hands while you sleep.
Use a cotton ball to remove excess oil in the morning and scrub with warm water.

Look for a dish soap that is gentle on your hands and won't dry them out.

, Because it is formulated for use on your face, makeup remover will definitely be gentle on your skin. If the stain hasn't penetrated too deeply, it should be able to dissolve and lift the pigment.Pour the makeup remover onto a washcloth or cotton ball and rub the stain.

Run your fingers through your hair.,
Get out into the sun!,
Repeat as necessary.",How to Highlight Dark Hair Naturally," The proteins and B vitamins in beer are great for repairing damage, and a light beer can help to lighten the color of your hair.To make a paste that’s nourishing and easier to apply, mix half a cup (118 g) of beer with half an avocado and mash the two together into a paste.;
, This recipe calls for lemon and chamomile, both of which can be used alone to lighten hair. To start, pour the juice from three lemons into a bowl. Make an eight-ounce cup of chamomile tea using two bags (four grams) of tea. When the tea has cooled, strain the leaves.


Add the tea to the lemon juice and add one tablespoon (0.5 ounces) of almond oil. Stir to combine., Apple cider vinegar and hydrogen peroxide, like beer and lemon juice, can be sprayed onto your hair to help lighten it. Before applying vinegar or peroxide, mix with equal parts water.


When applying either of these as a highlighter, use a cotton ball to apply the liquids to sections of hair.Keep an eye on the peroxide, as this may have to be washed out sooner (after 15 to 20 minutes even) than some of the other products.
You can also use rhubarb in the same way to lighten hair. Dice a half cup (50 grams) of rhubarb root and boil it in a pot with four cups (one quart) of water for 20 minutes.When cool, strain and apply the liquid to your hair with a cotton ball.

, Henna is a dye that’s extracted from plants, and that produces a reddish orange effect in the hair. To mix a henna paste, take three tablespoons (45 grams) of henna powder and mix in boiling water, just enough to form a thick paste. Set the paste aside in a cool, dark place for about 12 hours.Be sure to wear gloves when applying henna, as it will dye your skin and nails as well.

, In a small bowl, combine the juice from one lemon with three tablespoons (45 ml) of honey, one teaspoon (5 g) of cinnamon, and one teaspoon (four capsules) of vitamin C powder to make a highlighter that will bring out reddish tones in your hair., Wash and condition your hair using your normal shampoo and favorite conditioner. Rinse out the conditioner. Pat your hair dry with an absorbent towel and allow it to air dry.


Having clean hair will remove dirt, oil, and other particles that might prevent you from spreading your highlighting material evenly.
When your hair is completely dry, comb through it with a wide-toothed comb or plastic-tipped brush.

, Divide your hair into lower, middle, and upper layers, keeping the two upper layers tied or clipped on top of your head and the bottom layer down and loose. To highlight evenly, it’s easiest to work in layers so that you can get highlighting product all over., Start with the bottom layer of loose hair. Using just your fingers or a clean toothbrush,apply your highlighter of choice to small sections (about one inch (2.5 cm) wide) of hair. Work the product thoroughly through the sections of hair from the tips to just before the root.Don’t apply the product to all your hair, but rather to certain sections, leaving the rest of your hair untouched. Try to balance the amount of hair you highlight so it’s even on both sides.
When you’ve finished the bottom layer, let the middle layer down and repeat. Try not to overlap the highlighted sections of hair. Instead, stagger them from the highlighted sections on the bottom layer.

, Let down your top layer of hair when you’ve applied highlighter to the bottom and middle layers. For the hair framing your face, make the highlighted sections smaller, closer to a half-inch (1.3 cm).For the sections in the middle and back of your head, you can go back to using one-inch sections.

, Finger comb your hair two or three times to help distribute the highlighting product naturally throughout your hair., For most natural highlighting products, the sun will help activate them and expedite the lightening process. Leave your hair down and the product on for 30 minutes to an hour (or longer if you can) before rinsing and conditioning your hair.


If you can’t get into the sun during this time, pile your hair on top of your head and wrap your hair in plastic wrap or cover it with a shower cap instead.
Henna generally stays on for one to four hours, or until you achieve the desired intensity. When you’ve finished applying it, wrap your hair in plastic.

, Because these products don’t contain bleaches or harsh lightening products, you may have to do several applications to see any results. Repeat every two weeks as necessary or desired to achieve or maintain the right lightness.


Henna is a more powerful dye, so you will likely see results after a single application, and won’t have to repeat the process bi-weekly.
If you’ve chemically colored your hair, you likely won’t be able to lighten your hair with these natural methods.

, This will get rid of any color you have previously dyed your hair in the past, whether this be just the red you currently have, or a long list of other colors. I recommend 'color b4'. I used this for my already treated hair and it got rid of all the colors i had ever dyed it. If you have had a lot of strong colors in your hair, choose a higher volume. This should take you back to your natural color unless hair has been previously bleached. If your hair has already been bleached then it will most likely go to how it was then which is usually an orangey yellow color. After you have used this move onto the next step

, Follow instructions on bleach. If your hair is naturally blonde i suggest you skip this stage as your hair will most likely be light enough to dye already from the stripper.

, This will also help in cancelling out yellow tones caused by the bleach in order for the platinum or blonde to take place.

Purchase the necessaries.,
Strip your hair with a sulfur-based hair color remover.,
Consider gradual coloring.,
Prevent hair damage.,
Visit a salon.",How to Lighten Black Hair2," You will need hair dye specially formulated for dark hair and a color remover to help strip the color from your hair. Bleach and ammonia are commonly used to strip hair, though since these can be very damaging, you might consider using a sulfur-based color remover.


Read all product information before use. Some products might be specially formulated to require extra steps or specific wait times/procedures. Follow the directions for the best results., These products will be much gentler on your hair, unlike bleach or ammonia.As these are sulfur-based products, they can be quite smelly, but you don't have to worry about that smell sticking around.To help with the smell, you might want to step outside while allowing it to set.


Each product will be different, and you should follow the directions that accompany your preferred product for best results., Spacing out hair coloring over the course of a month, or several months, will not only give you better, more accurate results, but will also do the least amount of damage. Also, changing your color by shades will help ensure that you meet your target without overshooting it. A lighter shade of dye, like a 20 volume developer, can be used to lighten gradually with each application.

, You should space out dye applications as much as possible. A deep conditioner is a must to help keep your hair hydrated while dyeing. You should also think about using a product with protein added to it to help, which will strengthen and hydrate. Use these products throughout the dyeing process to protect your hair from damage., Hair is unique to each individual, and if your lightening techniques don't accomplish your desired results, it may be best to visit a professional. Professional hair stylists are often able to easily strip your dark hair of its color and add a lighter color on top of it.


While you are at the salon, you should inquire about lightening shampoo or spray-in treatments. Professional hair stylists will have a better idea of how it will affect your hair. Many products are designed to help individuals with blonde hair brighten their blonde color; these will not be effective for your dark hair.

Consider adding highlights.,
Have fun with Photoshop.,
Take your hair out to tea.,
Sprinkle some cinnamon on it.",How to Lighten Black Hair3," Though highlights will not make your hair uniformly lighter, the right application of subtle highlights can lighten the tone of your hair overall. If you are afraid of committing to a completely new and lighter color, a trip to the salon with this goal in mind might be for you.

, This is a excellent way of testing out new colors without having to commit. An inexperienced stylist or an overconfident friend can leave your hair an embarrassing shade. By digitally adjusting your tint, you will better know whether lightening is really worth it.

, Believe it or not, some teas have lightening properties. Boil some water and steep one bag of chamomile tea for roughly 10 minutes. Be sure you allow the tea to cool and then rinse your hair with the mixture, allowing it to remain in your hair for about 15 minutes.For extra lightening strength, repeat this process several times before you shampoo or rinse your hair clean.

, Cinnamon also has lightening properties in addition to its wonderful aroma. Add cinnamon powder to your conditioner until it forms a paste and coat your hair from top to bottom. It's important you do so evenly; you don't want irregular coloring! You may want to comb this mixture into your hair to ensure an even application.After the cinnamon is in, put on a shower cap and allow it to set for at least six hours, though overnight might get you even better results.

Spray hairspray on your hands.,
Mix laundry detergent and baking soda and rub it into the stain.,

Spraying the hairspray onto a cotton ball and then rubbing it on your hands may increase the effectiveness of this treatment. Rubbing the hairspray in may help it penetrate deeper and the fibers of the cotton ball may help loosen dead skin cells.
Use warm water to rinse the hairspray off your hands.

, Detergent may irritate your skin, but it works quickly and effectively to break down the dye.The baking soda adds an abrasive element, which exfoliates and removes dyed dead skin cells.

Rub the cotton ball on your nails and you should see the dye start to come off on the cotton ball.

, If you have dead skin or cuticles that changed colors because of the dye, use a cuticle clipper to carefully remove the skin. This will save you from using harsh nail polish remover on your skin.








, If you're having trouble cleaning the skin under your nails, use a clean toothbrush or a nail brush to scrub underneath.









Try soaking the brush in soap and water to wash away any dye that is under your nails.

, If you've tried everything and your nails are still discolored, your best bet is to cover them with a fun nail polish. Be fashionable and disguise the stain at the same time!

Leave the toner on for 20-30 minutes before rinsing it out.",How to Go from Black to Blonde in One Night," The best product to use is cholesterol, which is sold in jars and can be easily found in most beauty supply stores. If you can’t get that, use the strongest deep conditioner you can find.


Run a wide-toothed comb through your mane to untangle it and distribute the conditioner well.
This step is only necessary if your hair is currently dyed black. If black is your natural hair color, you can go straight to the bleaching process.;
, After you finish each section, let it cool for 5-10 minutes before blow drying the next section. By concentrating on one section at a time, you are allowing those hair follicles to open and soak up the deep conditioner.


Letting the section of hair cool immediately after blow drying will seal the moisture into your hair.Once you’ve dried all of your hair, allow it to completely cool before you moving on to the stripping process.

, After you open the box, you’ll find 2 small packets. Put on a pair of plastic gloves and mix the content of the 2 packets together. Be prepared to apply the mixture immediately after mixing it for full potency.


The ingredients in these packets are non-toxic, so if you accidently get a little on your skin, it won’t harm you.
If you are allergic or sensitive to sulfur, you should not use hair dye remover. Sulfur is one of the ingredients., Immediately after mixing, apply and massage the product into your hair until it is thoroughly covered. After 20 minutes, shampoo your hair. As you shampoo, you will see the previous hair color rinsing out of your hair. , After shampooing, condition your hair well and then blow dry it. At this point, your hair is probably an unbecoming shade of orange, but don’t worry! It’s just temporary.If possible, give your hair a short break from the chemical processing and bleach it the next morning (waiting 3 days is ideal).
However, if you don’t want to wait, you can begin immediately.Keep in mind that your hair as a higher chance of additional damage if you do this.

, The ratio of bleach powder to developer is usually 1:1, but check your product’s instructions for any variance or specifics. Dump 1 scoop of bleach powder into a mixing bowl. Measure out 1 scoop of developer and add it to the bowl. Mix well.Start with this amount of mixture. You can mix more as you go along, if needed.
If possible, use salon-grade bleaching powder for best results.
Bleach is a dangerous substance, so wear plastic gloves for this entire process. Purchased bleach products usually provide them for you.

, Working in sections will make the process much easier. Middle-part your hair at the crown from forehead to neck to get your first 2 sections, then clip them up. Part the remaining lower portion of your hair from ear to ear and clip those up, too.You should have a friend or family member helping you with the rest of the bleaching process.You’ll end up with better results and the process will be far less stressful and taxing if you have some help.

, Starting at one of the clipped-up sections at the top of your head, take down small, thin layers of your hair, one at a time, and apply the bleach.Be sure to brush the bleach onto both sides of your hair.Continue this process for the rest of that section, starting at the top and working your way down, until the entire section is covered in bleach.
Move on to the next sections and follow the same procedure until your hair is completely and thoroughly covered in bleach.
Potential damage to your scalp and hair follicles is possible during bleaching. If you have a very sensitive scalp and/or you don’t mind having visible roots, consider excluding them from the bleaching process., Do not leave it on longer than 1 hour.Then rinse until the water runs clear and wash your hair with purple shampoo. If you’re using a bleaching kit, purple shampoo is probably included. If not, you can get it at any beauty supply store.


Rinse the shampoo out thoroughly.
Blow your hair dry and then consider taking a little break before moving on.
At this stage your hair should be a light yellow or orange color.

, If your hair is light yellow after bleaching, you’ll need a light ash, silver or pearl shade of toner. Pearl blonde toner is usually the preferred choice, but choose the shade that is 1 shade lighter than your current hair color.The cool tones will counteract the warmth and prevent brassiness.If you have short and/or very fine hair, you’ll only need 1 box of toner.
For those with thick, long hair, you’ll need to get 2 boxes.
If possible, use a high quality salon brand of toner for best results.

, After bleaching once, it’s possible that it won’t be as light as you want (unless you were going for a darker blonde look). This is especially true if you began with black hair. In this case, you’ll need to bleach it again. However, bleaching again on the same day would be too damaging on your hair, so you’ll need to wait a week.The dark ash blonde toner will counteract the orange and yellow tones and give you a dark blonde mane that will be tolerable and presentable until you bleach it again.If you have any orange after bleaching, you must use the dark ash toner to neutralize the orange.
Never choose a “matte ash” shade, which could result in a greenish tint., You will apply the toner in the same way you did the bleach, so divide your hair into 4 sections and clip them up. Repeat the same application process, starting at the crown of one section and working your way down.


Repeat the same process when applying the toner to the remaining 3 sections.
Apply the toner as quickly as you can for best results.

, Check your toner packaging for specifics, but 20-30 minutes is pretty standard. You may not even need to leave it on for that long – check your hair every 5-7 minutes to see if it has reached the tone shade that you want. If so, go ahead and rinse it out.


Rinse until the water runs clear and immediately apply a strong, high quality conditioner to your hair.
The toner probably included some conditioner for this purpose in the box.
Rinse the conditioner out after 2-5 minutes. Blow dry and style your brand new blonde mane!

Apply a thin layer of toothpaste over the stained area of skin.,
Rub the toothpaste into your skin.,
Rinse the toothpaste off your face using warm water.",How to Get Hair Dye off Your Face1," Any non-gel toothpaste will probably do, since they all have abrasive properties, but choose one that has baking soda in it. They tend to be even more abrasive, and baking soda has stain-lifting properties in it.;
, You can use your fingers if you don’t mind getting a little messy; otherwise, use a cotton ball.


The toothpaste layer should not be too thick — you want a thin layer.

, Some sources suggest using a toothbrush to rub the toothpaste into your skin, but that could result in skin irritation, so don’t do that. Instead, use your fingers or a cotton ball to gently massage the toothpaste into the dyed area using a circular motion.


Be careful not to rub too aggressively, as this can irritate your skin.
Take a break or stop the process altogether if your skin starts burning or itching.

, Use a face cleaning product to make sure your face is clear of all products that don’t belong there.

Decide which parts of your hair you want red, so you can bleach them first.,
Apply the bleach to your hair.,
Leave the bleach on for the right amount of time.,
Wash the bleach off.,
Apply the red to the bleached areas of your hair.,
Leave the dye on for around about half an hour to forty five minutes or so.,
Wash the colour off your hair.",How to Get Red Highlights in Black Hair," The best way to do this is to part your hair into sections, and isolate the parts of hair you would like to be a different colour. You can do this with tying up these sections of hair with hair bands or hair clip. Just make sure they keep away from the rest of your hair, just in case the bleach splashes onto the other parts of your hair and you have random lighter sections later on.;
, If your hair is dyed darker, start with the bottom half of your hair and work up into your roots, as this section will not need so much bleach. Not only that, if you apply the bleach to the lighter sections of your hair for too long than the time specified on the packet, you could really damage or dry out your hair. Make sure you use a dye brush, as this really allows you to get to the roots of your hair.

, If you are unsure what this might be, have a look at the back of a bleach packet. There should be a chart that corresponds with how much time you should leave the bleach on in comparison to your hair colour.

, Make sure you give your hairline a good wash, as well as the areas around where your hair begins - such as the back of your neck and ears. These areas can be very sensitive, and leaving peroxide on them for too long can cause visible burn marks.

, It is strongly recommended that you wear gloves for this, unless you want to walk around for the next few days looking like you've murdered someone!


Make sure you apply a generous amount of dye to each section of your hair and that you really work it into the separate strands, and roots, if need be. This will give you a stronger, more long-lasting colour.

, This gives time for the colour to properly soak into your hair.

, Towel or blow dry if necessary and voila - you now have what will be black and red hair!

The benefit of using petroleum jelly and your fingers is that there’s a decreased chance of irritating your skin with abrasive rubbing!
The drawback is that as the stain comes loose, things get messy. Be careful not to get the dye on anything as it starts coming off of your skin.

, You’ll be able to see when the dye starts coming off the skin and mixing with the jelly, but it may be difficult to see if the whole stain is off. If there’s still some dye on your skin when you wipe off the jelly, you have two options:


Reapply another layer and repeat the process as many times as is necessary
Move on to the next step

, Follow the same procedure as the first step, but make the layer thicker than the previous one. This time, though, allow the jelly to sit on your skin for several hours.

, This is an optional step; on its own, lemon juice won’t remove hair dye stains, but it can boost the effect of the other two products being used in this case.

, A dry washcloth won’t pick up as much of the mixture, and you’ll have a harder time getting the stain off your skin.


You can also use cotton balls or your fingers, but a washcloth will do a better job of rubbing it into the stain.

, Rub gently at the stain, making sure not the irritate the skin or rub yourself raw. Depending on how much dye you have on your skin, this might take some time, so be patient.

, Use a face cleaning product to make sure your face is clear of all products that don’t belong there.


If the stain isn’t completely removed at this point, repeat the process as many times as is necessary.

, Baking soda can really dry your skin out, so you want to give it a moisture boost after you get the stain out.

, For lighter highlights, apply more solution to the hair and leave the solution on for a longer amount of time. For subtle, natural looking highlights, apply a smaller amount of solution and leave the solution on for less time.

If you bleach your hair too often it can begin to fall out., Whenever you bleach your hair, an oxidation process is taking place, which removes the color from your hair. This is what leaves your hair a white or yellow shade, because the keratin (the protein your hair is made of) in your hair is naturally a pale yellow. Be prepared for your hair to suffer from dryness and brittleness as well as the fact that it will be more prone to breakage and split ends.Because bleaching your hair is a serious process that can greatly damage your hair if done incorrectly, it is best to visit a professional if you are looking for a drastic color change.
If you don't want to bleach your hair, you can use temporary color, demi-permanent, semi-permanent, or permanent color. These types of coloring only lightens your hair, so if you have very dark hair, it may not be very effective. However, the benefit of dyeing your hair versus bleaching it is that the dye won't strip your hair of color. It will still damage your hair somewhat, though, so you'll still need to take care of your hair in the same way that you would had you bleached it.

, If you are going from a very dark shade to a very light blonde, the process takes some time and during that time your hair will usually begin to develop an orangey tint. This happens because as you bleach your hair, cooler tones are lifted from your hair easier than the warmer, underlying pigments. So, as you remove color from your hair, the warm hues (reds and oranges) are what remain because they are trickier to lift from your hair.


To counteract these warm hues you can add toner to your hair if you are going a very light blonde. This will counteract the remaining color in your air, thus removing those orangey, yellow tints in your hair. You can find the appropriate toner by looking at a toner wheel or asking a professional., Anytime you bleach your hair it is important to take care of it to prevent further damage. Before you bleach your hair, apply a deep conditioner, and after you bleach your hair apply deep conditioner again. Also, try to avoid using heating products, as the heat from these can further dry out your hair and make it more prone to breakage.If you must use your flat iron, blow dryer, or curling iron, make sure to use a heat styling product that will protect your hair from excessive heat.

Determine your brassy tone.,
Use a blue or purple shampoo a few times per week.Violet hued shampoos will neutralize yellow brassiness.,
Alternate with shampoos and conditioners made for color-treated hair.,
Install a shower head filter.Chlorine and iron deposits in the water supply can cause brassiness and fade your hair color.",How to Fix Brassy Hair Color1," When hair color turns brassy, the tones range from yellowish orange to copper. In general, those with darker blonde shades will end up with brassiness that is copper toned, while lighter blonde shades usually lean toward more yellow tones. Once you’ve figured out which camp you fall into, you can more effectively combat your brassy strands.It is possible to have both yellow and copper toned brassiness present in your hair color.;
, Blue (silver) toned shampoos will cancel out copper brassiness. This works because blue and purple are opposite orange and yellow on the color wheel, effectively counteracting the brassy tones. There is a wide variety of options, ranging from affordable drug store versions to pricey salon products.If you can't determine your brassy tones, or if they seem to be both yellow and copper, use a shampoo that has both purple and blue tones in it.
Look for products that claim to be ""color correcting"" or ""tone correcting."" You can also ask a clerk at the beauty supply store for recommendations.

, You shouldn’t use blue/purple shampoos every day – stick to using them only a few times each week. In between blue/purple shampoos, use hair products made specifically for color care. There are shampoos, conditioners, masques and more that will help you preserve your color and fight brassiness without the use of blue/violet pigment.


Avoid hair care products that are alcohol-based. These will accelerate color fading and dry out your locks., Investing in a shower head filter might seem a little excessive (they’re about $150) but when you consider how much money can go into coloring your hair, it’s actually quite an investment.


Not only is the filtered water a bonus for your hair health, but your skin will love it, too.

You'll have to bleach your hair two or three times to get it light enough to apply the grey blue tones.Bleach is very damaging to the hair, so waiting 2 to 6 weeks between bleaching sessions is recommended. If you still want to go for it, just know that you'll have to invest quite a bit of time and energy into getting there, and you may significantly damage your hair in the process.For medium brown hair or darker, you'll probably need to bleach 2-3 times.
For light brown hair, you'll probably need to bleach 1-2 times.
For dark blonde to blonde hair, you'll probably only need to bleach once.;
, Bleach can irritate and even burn your skin. The natural oils that build up on your hair and scalp when you don’t wash it will protect your scalp from irritation. At minimum, give your hair a 48 hour break from washing before you begin the bleaching process.Focus on deep-conditioning your hair several times in the weeks leading up to bleaching. This can help minimize damage and breakage.

, Unless you currently have very light blonde hair, you have to bleach it to the lightest possible shade to achieve this look. Developer is the chemical that lifts the color from your hair, and the strength you need depends on how many shades you have to lift. There are 10 levels, or shades, ranging from black (1) to the lightest blonde (10). Light brown/dark blonde is considered level 5.Volume 40 is the strongest developer. It will lift four levels, or shades, from your hair. It’s not recommended when dyeing all of your hair, because it’s too strong to use near the scalp. Vol 40 is mostly used for highlights.Volume 30 will lift two to three levels. If this doesn't get you to level 10 blonde, you will have to repeat the bleaching procedure in 2 weeks.
Volume 20 will lift one to two levels.

, When combined, these two chemicals lift the color from your hair. Both can be purchased at beauty supply stores, along with an applicator and pair of plastic gloves. Put on the gloves before you open any packaging to protect your skin. Mix the bleach powder and volume developer, using a 1:1 ratio, until fully incorporated.If your product suggests a ratio that’s not 1:1, follow those directions.
Once mixed, you need to proceed with the bleaching process immediately. The chemicals will lose their effectiveness if left sitting out.

, Dividing your hair into four manageable sections will help ensure you get even results. Part your hair down the center, vertically, from the crown to the nape of your neck. Then divide those sections in half, horizontally, from ear to ear. Clip each section in place on top of your head.At this point, drape a towel around your shoulders to protect your skin during the process.

, Start with the bottom sections before moving on to the top ones. Remove the clip to release the section of hair. Use the applicator brush to apply the bleach mixture from root to tip. Work as quickly as you can and try to get as close to the roots as possible without touching your scalp.


Once the section is saturated with the mixture, clip it out of the way.
You need to work quickly, but also carefully – bleach can burn your skin. Have a friend help you if this is your first time bleaching your hair.

, Repeat the same process of unclipping the section, applying the bleach mixture from root to tip, and clipping the section back up until you’ve completed all four sections. As you work through each section of hair, try to apply the bleach in thin layers to small areas to ensure saturation.


At this point you can wrap your hair in saran wrap or place a shower cap over it, which can help with dripping and prevent the mixture from drying out. However, it’s not required., The exact timing will depend on the current color of your hair and the particular product you’re using, but 30-45 minutes is typical. The goal is to strip essentially all of the pigment out of your hair, until it resembles the color of the inside of a banana peel. This is level 10, or the lightest blonde possible. Remember, depending on what shade you started from, you may not be able to reach that level in one session.You should check your hair often during this 30 minute interval to avoid over-processing.
Never leave bleach on your hair longer than one hour., The cold water will stop the bleach from processing. Rinse it out thoroughly. Once you’ve rinsed, then shampoo twice to make sure you’ve removed any remaining residue.

, Depending on what shade you started with, your hair is now somewhere between orange and very light yellow. Unless you’ve reached the pale yellow shade, you will need to bleach your hair again to if you want to achieve the grey blue look. If you try to proceed otherwise, the blue grey tones will not show up on your hair.If your hair hasn’t reached level 10, slather your hair in a good conditioner and then rinse after about 10 minutes. Wait at least 2 weeks before attempting to bleach again.
If you have reached level 10, do not condition your hair at this point. Move on to toning first; you’ll condition your hair after that., Using purple toner at this stage is necessary to achieve the blue grey look. The purple counteracts and removes any yellow tones left in your hair. If you want the silvery blue hue, the yellow tones have to go. You can purchase purple toner at beauty supply stores., Read the instructions with your product, which will most likely tell you to mix the toner with a 20 volume developer. Use large bowl to mix the ingredients, similar to when you mixed the bleach. Continue wearing gloves to protect your skin. Follow the directions that came with your products for exact measurements to mix the solution., Your hair should be damp for this. Repeat the same process you used for bleaching – divide your hair into sections and clip them up. Release them one at a time and use an applicator to saturate your hair with the mixture. Clip the section back up, and do the same thing for the remaining three sections., Set a timer in case you lose track of time. Check on it often; you’ll be able to see your hair losing the yellow tones as it processes. Once the timer goes off, use cold water to rinse the toner thoroughly from your hair., At this point, your hair is probably feeling very brittle. This is normal and is a result of the bleach and developer. Before completing the final stage of this process (actually dyeing your hair blue/silver), you need to condition your hair. Apply a strong deep-conditioner to your damp hair and let it penetrate for about 10 minutes. Rinse as you normally would., The shades range from a pastel blue grey to a darker grey steel-like hue. Select and purchase your chosen shade from a beauty supply store. You can dye your hair immediately after toning or, if you’re exhausted at this point (this is a lengthy process!) you can wait until the next day., Each product will be different. Locate the instructions and follow them. The process will be very similar to what you’ve been doing. Make sure you are wearing protective gloves and your shoulders are protected by a towel., Divide your hair into four sections, then use an applicator to apply the dye to the sections one at a time. Clip each one out of the way after you’ve saturated the hair with the mixture before moving on to the next., Your product may direct you to rinse after a different amount of time. If so, follow those directions. However, it’s typically about a 30 minute set time. Use a timer in case you lose track of time. Once it goes off, rinse the dye from your hair thoroughly., Purple shampoos can be purchased at beauty supply stores. They will help keep the yellow tones from returning to your hair. Those yellow tones will negatively affect the blue grey hue you want, so actively work to keep them at bay. This is key to maintaining this look.You can use purple shampoo every time you wash your hair, or you can use it intermittently. If you choose to use regular shampoo sometimes, make sure it’s sulfate-free and formulated for use on color-treated hair.

, No matter what products you use to combat fading, you’ll start to notice it happening after a few weeks go by. The more you wash your hair, the faster it will fade. Try to go a few days in between washings. If your hair gets oily fast, try using a dry shampoo on off days., As you’ve now discovered, this process can be hard on your hair. After bleaching, you will experience damage and breakage – this is normal. The best way to combat these issues is to use deep-conditioners and hair masks at least once per week. These will help to restore nutrients and hydration., To keep maintenance as hassle-free as possible, address your roots before they grow too long. When the time comes, you will need to bleach, tone and dye your roots again. You do not need to do your entire head of hair. Concentrate only on the regrowth."

Let your hair sit for 30 to 45 minutes.,
Apply toner to your hair.,
Rinse out the toner and apply conditioner.,
Repeat this process two weeks later.",How to Get Blonde Hair from Dark Brown2," Before you bleach your hair you should apply a deep conditioner to help protect it and keep it as healthy as possible. Bleach will greatly dry out your hair, so adding as much moisture to your hair as possible before you bleach it is an important step. That added moisture will lessen the damaging effects of the bleach.Wash your hair a few days before you bleach it, but try to hold off until after you bleach it to wash it again. Bleaching freshly washed hair can irritate your scalp, so it's best to bleach hair that has more natural oils in it.
You can use a few tablespoons of olive oil or coconut oil as an alternative to deep conditioner. These products will still condition your hair, giving it the moisture it needs.

, Put on an old t-shirt or towel to prevent bleaching your clothes and gather the ingredients and tools you will need: a small bucket or a color bowl to mix the bleach, a tint brush, and rubber gloves.

, You can purchase bleach for your hair at a local drugstore or cosmetics store. You'll also need to buy some developer, which helps to lift hair color quickly. Follow the directions on the label to mix the bleach and developer together.The higher volume of developer will lift more levels of color out of your hair. A lower volume developer will lift less levels of color out of your hair, leaving it a darker shade after you have finished bleaching it. If you want to take it easy and bleach your hair slowly, it's best to use a lower volume developer. Salons usually use a 20-volume developer.
A bleach and developer mixture is what salons typically use to bleach hair. You can definitely a purchase a boxed-dye mix, but you can't customize it to suit the needs of your hair. It's beneficial to buy the items separately. The cost will be about the same and you'll have better luck protecting your hair., Some people have allergic reactions to certain hair products, so you'll need to test a portion of your hair to make sure the bleach doesn't harm you. Take the mixture and using a toner brush, apply to a one to two inch strand of hair on the bottom layer of your hair at the back of your head. Leave the mixture on for 30 to 45 minutes and then rinse it out.


If you haven't experienced any reaction to the bleach you can proceed to bleach your hair.

, To achieve the best coverage and even bleach on your hair, separate it into four sections. Part your hair down the middle of your head or along your part, and then part your hair horizontally across your head. Then pull the front sections of hair around your face away from the rest of your hair. You can then clip your hair up to get it out of the way.

, Start at the back sections of your hair, because they don't absorb bleach as well as the top so they will need more time to sit. Gather a piece of hair about a quarter inch thick and separate it from the rest of your hair. Then, use a tint brush to apply the bleach mixture, covering the roots last because the roots tend to process faster than the rest of your hair. Make sure you have evenly saturated the hair.


Be careful not to get the bleach on part of your body or on your scalp as this can irritate your skin and cause a burning sensation. Make sure when you bleach the roots that you lift your hair up from your head so that you avoid brushing the bleach onto your scalp.

, After you have applied your bleach to several sections of your hair, take a piece of foil about five to six inches wide and lay some of your bleached hair on top of it. Then, fold the foil up so that your hair isn't exposed.


You don't have to use the foiling technique, but it can be helpful because it keeps the rest of your hair away from the hair that you have already bleached or if you're doing highlights and want to keep the bleach off of the rest of your hair.
If you feel the foiling method may be too tedious, try using a plastic cap. It's much easier on your scalp since the foils can get heavy and it'll be easier to see how well the bleach lifts your hair.

, Once you have covered all of your hair with bleach, let the mixture sit for about 30 minutes. Check it often to ensure it is lightening to the right degree. You may need more or less time, depending on how well your hair takes to the bleach. Then rinse your hair out with water and apply a purple shampoo. Let the shampoo sit for the amount of time recommended on the label, and then rinse it out.To prevent any extreme hair damage, every 10 minutes, perform a pull test. You can do this easily by simply pulling gently on a few strands of hair from different sections. If any significant amount of hair breaks off or looks and feels ""gooey"" (it's probably fried), rinse the bleach out of your hair immediately and wash with a gentle shampoo and condition. You'll need to seek professional help from a colorist. Be sure to do your research before coloring your hair yourself!
Because your brown hair has naturally warm hues, it will likely have a brassy color after you've bleached it. Purple shampoo helps remove the brassy color and neutralize yellow undertones. If you plan to use toner you don't have to use purple shampoo, but it does help remove those awkward tints to your hair. You can find this shampoo in the shampoo or hair dye section of your local drug or cosmetic store. You can also likely find purple shampoo in the brands John Frieda and Clairol Professional in your local grocery store.If you chose not to use foil, make sure you cover your head with a shower cap, or something else that will prevent it from being exposed to the air -- you don't want your bleach to dry out.

, If you are happy with the color of your hair, you can proceed to condition it. However, if you want to remove even more brassiness, you can apply a toner to your hair. Towel dry your hair and comb it out with a wide tooth comb. Then, mix your toner with a 20-volume developer and apply evenly in your hair. Cover your hair again and let the toner sit for twenty to thirty minutes.


To find the appropriate toner you can look at a toner wheel. On the wheel find the color that most matches the hues in your hair, and then purchase a toner in the color that is on the exact opposite side of the toner wheel.The amount of toner you mix with the developer will depend upon the type of toner you buy. Consult the directions for that specific toner before mixing it together.
Make sure that you don't condition your hair before you apply the toner as that will make it more difficult for the toner to stick to your hair.
If you plan to bleach your hair another time, wait to apply the toner until the last time you have bleached your hair.

, Once the toner has set, rinse it out with water and apply a deep conditioner. This has been stated several times but it's very important to do this to protect the health of your hair. You can also apply hair conditioning masks to provide even more moisture to your hair.

, If you want to go a lighter shade with your bleach, you can repeat this entire bleaching process a second and third time. Make sure that you wait at least two weeks between each bleach so that your hair has time to recover. Then, apply the bleach in the same way and condition to moisturize your hair inbetween each treatment to keep it healthy."

Gather your ingredients.,
Boil water and allow tea to steep.,
Pour mixture into a spray bottle.,
Sit out in the sun.,
Apply conditioner to your hair.",How to Get Blonde Hair from Dark Brown3," To bleach hair naturally, meaning the sun will be what activates the blonde in your hair, you will need lemon juice, chamomile tea (or tea bags) and hot water. This process will take a much longer time and can be used to bring out the natural highlights in your hair, but most likely won't bring you to a platinum blonde color.

, Steep five to ten chamomile tea bags for a few minutes in about half a liter (or two cups) of hot water in a microwave-safe glass measuring cup. Then, add about one half cup of lemon juice to your tea, pouring it into your solution until it becomes somewhat cloudy.The amount of lemon juice you'll need to use varies, so start with half a cup and pour it into your tea for a few seconds, stopping when your tea becomes a cloudy mixture.

, After you have combined the ingredients, you'll want to pour the entire mixture into a spray bottle so that you can apply it to your hair. Then, spray throughout your hair for an even coating. Your hair should be damp with the solution but not soaking wet.

, For the bleaching agents in the lemon juice to work, it will need to be exposed to the sun for a while. Stay outside in the sun until your hair dries, making sure to use sunscreen on the rest of your body to avoid damaging your skin. For the best results, leave the mixture on your hair for one to two hours.This method works slowly, gradually bringing out the highlights in your hair, so know that it may take several weeks, spraying your hair daily or every other day, before your hair really becomes blonde, especially if you have very dark brown hair.

, Anytime you lighten your hair, even with natural products, you should protect it and keep it moisturized by applying a conditioner. You can use a leave in conditioner or coconut oil."

Boost color and minimize brassiness with a foam gloss.,
Refresh color and tone down brassiness with a temporary rinse.,
Treat brassiness with a semi-permanent toner.These come in liquid or cream form and the results last about a week (or a few shampoos) before fading.",How to Fix Brassy Hair Color2," These lightweight foams are easy to use and meant to be applied in the shower, immediately after shampooing your hair. The foam boosts color and shine while breaking down brassy tones.The whole process only takes about 5 minutes and it’s extremely effective. These products are gentle enough to use as often as you like, although you will probably only need to use them about once per week.To use, apply to your hair from roots to tip immediately after shampooing. Rinse the foam out immediately or leave it on for 3 minutes to enhance your color, then rinse. Follow it up with a good conditioner.
For those with an ash or silver hair tone, you may want to use the mousse every day, post-shampoo.
Foam glosses are mostly found at beauty supply stores, but there are a few drugstore versions on the market.

, Temporary rinses are applied after you shampoo and towel dry your hair.Saturate your hair with the product and then run a comb through to ensure even distribution. You don’t need to rinse it out after applying – simply blow dry and style your hair as usual. It’s called a temporary “rinse” because the color boost only lasts until your next shampoo, which rinses the product out of your hair.You’ll need to wear rubber gloves when applying the product.Temporary rinses are usually sold exclusively at beauty supply stores.

, Semi-permanent toners contain no harsh chemicals and therefore they don’t damage your hair – a major plus. You can use them weekly and there are reasonably priced drugstore versions that you can try at home.

Enhance your color with lowlights.Lowlighting means to dye darker streaks into your hair and it can add a lot of dimension to your hair color.,
Try a demi-permanent or permanent toner.Both of these solutions provide “long lasting” results, which range from 6-8 weeks.,
Minimize fading.",How to Fix Brassy Hair Color3," Lowlights can also neutralize brassy orange tones by introducing darker blonde shades into the mix, creating an overall cooling effect. It’s a procedure best performed by an experienced hair stylist, so lowlighting isn't the cheapest solution.


However, the results can be very striking and it’s certainly something to consider if you’ve tried a lot of other things with no success.As with all “permanent” dyes, lowlights may start to fade after about 6-8 weeks.

, Demi-permanent toners are less damaging to the hair shaft than the permanent variety, with results typically lasting about 6 weeks. Permanent toners will give you about 8 weeks of results. To use, separate your hair into 4 large sections. Work with one section at a time, leaving the other 3 clipped up out of the way.


Apply the toner in small sections, starting at the top and working your way down to the ends until you have full coverage.
Keep a close eye on the dye as it develops and rinse thoroughly.

, Preserving your color can go a long way toward preventing brassiness. Even “permanent” dyes start to fade after about 8 weeks, and frequent dyeing can severely damage you hair. Along with all of the other toning strategies, actively try to prevent your color from fading in the first place. Only wash your hair when it’s necessary – try to avoid daily washing. When you do wash it, use blue/purple toning products. Limit your sun exposure and the use of heating tools, like blow dryers and straight irons.Smoothing serums and other similar products can help you maintain color by sealing your hair cuticle when you apply them.

, Either walk to a store that sells hair dye, take a bus, or have a friend's mom drive you if you don't have a driver's license. If you only have a small amount of money, perhaps you should visit multiple stores to get the best deal. Also, look for coupons in the newspaper, for they will save you a couple of dollars at the most.

, Try to make it a couple of shades lighter or darker. if you want a more natural look. Maybe you shouldn't get a bold color, such as pink or red, for this will be more noticeable to your mom if she catches you off-guard. Ask around about the brand of the hair dye, for some brands are known to permanently damage hair. Try to get a type that you can still use normal shampoo on.

, Hide it in your drawer, closet, or any other spot where you know your mom will not look. Keep it there until you are ready to actually do the hair dying. Try to avoid setting the hair dye directly under heavy items, for this may cause some damage. Also, avoid putting near the window or vent, for extreme temperatures may cause the hair dye to act up 

, Call up a friend, and ask them if you can come to their house to dye your hair. Make sure the date is a day when both families aren't busy. Remember to call multiple friends if the first one you call won't let you come over. The goal is to avoid dying your hair at your own house, for it may leave an odor that your mom will most likely notice.

, Bring all of the hair dying supplies with you in a bag. Explain to your mom before you leave that you're just going over to a friend's house, if a reason is needed. Your mode of transportation doesn't matter, for your mom won't know you will be heading over to your friend's house to dye your hair.

, Read them at least three times before beginning so you will know exactly what to do. Have your friend help you out if you need some assistance. Once you believe you are finished, pack up your materials and head on home. However, be sure to spray an air-freshener in the bathroom of your friend's house, and thank your friend for allowing you to come over.

, Don't let your mom see your hair once you return home. Cover it up it any way possible. Try to avoid your mom by going into a different room and not talking to her. Also, you may need to hide it from siblings if they are the type to snitch on you.

Semi-permanent dyes can be found in a variety of places, ranging from grocery stores to specialized fashion shops, with the biggest selection at beauty supply stores. Pick the color that’s your favorite, matches your wardrobe best, and/or is most flattering for your eye color and skin tone. Semi-permanent dyes work on all hair colors, but show up brightest on light hair. On very dark hair, though, they will appear as a very subtle sheen.;
, Bleaching hair will make the color turn out brighter on all hair types. If you want intense, bright colors and you have darker hair, you will need to bleach it.Just keep in mind that bleaching may damage your hair.

, A patch test is an easy way to check for allergens at home. This step is very important, especially if you have sensitive skin. If you go straight to dyeing your whole head without checking, you may end up with an itchy scalp or permanent hair loss.


Dab a small amount of dye onto a cotton adhesive pad and place it somewhere on your skin that isn’t too sensitive or typically exposed like your upper back.
Leave the patch on for however long you plan on leaving the dye in your hair (usually an hour).
Remove the patch and rinse the dye from your skin.
Wait another 48 hours before dyeing your hair.
Do not use this dye if your skin experiences itching, redness, or swelling. If your skin starts itching while the patch is still on, remove it immediately and scrub away the dye with soap and water., Select a small strand of hair that is not on the surface of your hairdo. Dye this strand following the instructions on the bottle.This step can be skipped if you don’t care about the exact shade of your new hair color. If you’ve never bleached your hair before, you may want to do a strand test with both your bleaching method and then with the dye.

, Normally you should avoid using a blow dryer, as it can dry out and damage your hair. However, the drier your hair, the better your dye will soak in. Don’t condition your hair until after the dye has been applied and rinsed out.

, While semi-permanent dyes eventually wash out of hair, they can be fairly difficult to remove from other materials like most fabrics. Semi-permanent dye is usually easy to remove from skin with a good scrubbing, but the process may take a few days. It's less work to prevent making a mess than cleaning it up later.


Wear some clothes that you don't mind staining.
Put a towel down on the floor in the area where you’re working.
Wear exam gloves.
Place a thin layer of petroleum jelly on the skin along your hairline.

, You can dye all of your hair the same shade or you can get more creative. Here are a few options to consider:


Dye only your highlights. Many people with dark hair go for this look with bright colors.
Dye just the ends. This is called the ""dip dye"" look, since it seems like the hair has been dipped in paint. Section off your hair with plastic clips and you can use multiple colors for this method.
Two colors from the same brand can be mixed. You can dye your tips one color, the hair near your roots another, and mix the two in the middle for an “ombré” look.
Try a wild, multi-colored look or make a pattern by keeping certain sections of your hair un-dyed. Put a little conditioner on the parts of your hair that you want protected.

, Place a thick amount of hair dye wherever you want it. The best way to do this varies based on your style:


If you’re dyeing a large area or your whole head, the best way to do this is by massaging the dye in by hand. Grab a palm full of dye and work it into your hair as if you were shampooing. If your hair is long, you will need to do this a few times with more dye to spread the color evenly throughout. You can also try dyeing thicker hair in sections.
If you’re dyeing a smaller section, use a special tools called a tint brushes. Dip the brush into the dye and ""paint"" your hair. This will help you to both control where the color goes and make sure all your hair is coated. Go over each section a few times to make sure the dye is even., How long you should leave it in for will vary by brand, but 30 minutes to an hour is typical. Unlike permanent dyes, which contain harsh chemicals that can damage your hair and skin, there is usually no ""too long"" with semi-permanent colors.If you want to leave your work area while the dye sets, put your hair in a shower cap to keep from making a mess.

, Rinsing in the sink will reduce the chance of dyeing your skin but may be inconvenient. Rinsing in the shower is usually fine, even with dark colors.


Soak your hair thoroughly with running water. This is more important if you've left the dye in so long that it has dried out.
Gently wash your hair with color care shampoo. Keeping your hair moisturized will help maintain the color.
Keep rinsing your hair until the water starts running clear. If you leave any dye in, you will end up staining anything your hair touches.
Apply conditioner. This will also help keep your hair moist.
Allow your hair to air dry. Blow drying will dry out your hair too much and make your new color fade faster.

, Semi-permanent dye will fade more each time you wash your hair. To make the color last longer, wash your hair as infrequently as you can get away with. The thicker and less oily your hair, the less often you need to wash it., When you do wash your hair, be sure to use a shampoo that will minimize fade. Most major shampoo brands have at least one color-protecting product. If you have trouble finding one at the drugstore, try checking a specialty beauty supply shop.

, Dry hair is more prone to fading. Use conditioner, whether rinse-out or leave-in.If you have very textured, coily type hair, try using shea butter.

, The nature of semi-permanent hair color is that it doesn’t last forever. Dye your hair using the same steps above once it fades to a color you aren’t quite happy with. You could also try a different color. If you bleached your hair before, don’t bleach it again unless your roots have grown out.

If you have very light hair, you have more options because many colors will show up. If you want to try a really “out there” color or don’t quite know how a certain color will look on you, this DIY hair dye is perfect for you. You don’t have to commit to any color for too long, and it’s no big deal if you don’t like your results– it’ll be gone in a couple washes.;
, Crayola washable markers work well and come in a variety of different colors and shades, but any brand of marker will do as long as it is labeled ""washable"". Once you've chosen your color (or colors), you need to get the ink out. With just a little bit of force, you can break open the marker.









Using scissors, pry the stopper off the end so that the back of the marker is completely open.Tap the front of the marker against a hard surface, so that the ink tube inside is knocked loose.
Carefully extract the ink tube.

, To do this, you’ll first need to dip the tip of the tube into water. As the tip is submerged, the ink will flow out of that tip to the opposite. The tip in the water will begin turning white as the ink leaves. Continue holding the tube in the water until the tip is completely white, and thus ink-free. Once it’s white, you’re safe to put your lips on the tube and begin blowing.








Make sure you’re holding the tube over a cup or container of some sort. Once you begin blowing, ink will flow from the opposite end, You need something to catch the ink to avoid making a mess.

, You can apply the dye directly to the hair if you want a more intense color. However, some people prefer adding a squirt of hair conditioner to the extracted dye. Adding conditioner will make the dye easier to work with, but it will also dilute the color. Try both methods, and decide which one you prefer.







, Washable marker dye will stain your hands and clothing just like it stains your hair. It will wash off your hands, but your hands may have a strange tint for a couple days if you don’t use gloves. Put on an old t-shirt that you don’t care about, because it will certainly get on your clothing (unless you’re a seasoned pro)., Some people prefer to dip the ends of their hair into the container of dye, while others like to paint streaks throughout their hair. Maybe you want to just do a section of your hands, or maybe you want to be ambitious and dye every strand of hair on your head. Just keep In mind how much dye you have to work with. The more hair you want to cover, the more dye you need, and the more markers you need to crack open.









Some DIY hair colorists prefer cutting open the ink tube and rubbing the felt directly onto the hair. You can certainly try this method if you think it would be easier for the look you want to create., If you did streaks of dye, wrap the sections in foil to prevent the dye from rubbing on the other un-dyed sections.If you dip-dyed your hair, you can wrap the tips in foil or leave them exposed. Just be extremely careful not to rub your hair on anything while the dye soaks.









Unlike traditional hair dye, you will not be washing this dye out of your hair. Instead, you will let your hair dry with the ink in it. Keep the foil on until your hair is dry.

, If you used foil on sections, remove after 30 minutes to an hour to let your hair air dry. It’s best to let your tresses dry naturally, although you can certainly blow dry if you are short on time. While your hair is drying, be careful not to rub your hair on furniture, walls, or anything else that the ink could transfer to.








If you used an ink and conditioner combo, wash the mix out with cold water. Then let air dry.

, If the color is more intense than you like, rinse with cold water. It’s important to use cold water, because hot water can strip the dye from your hair completely. If you don’t think your hair dye is dark enough, you can do the process again until you achieve the desired effect.The great thing about this hair dying technique is that you can really tailor it to the look you want to create. You can rinse it easily to lighten the color, and you can do it repeatedly to darken a color without damaging your hair. Unlike regular hair dye, you can play around with this method until you’ve figured out what works for your hair.

, Style your colorful hair however you want. When you’re finished, set the style with hairspray. This will both hold the style, but also sea and smooth the colored sections.Enjoy your fun new hair!

Then, mix in some lemon juice or vinegar. Stir this mixture till it gets thick. Keep adding liquid till it has a creamy type of thickness to it. Once it’s thick enough, you should wrap the bowl with plastic wrap.You should do this the day before you dye your hair. It’s recommended that henna be refrigerated for twelve to twenty-four hours, as this will release the dye.

, You want to place a large amount of henna paste on your hair. It should be so thick that it goes down to your scalp.

, Once you’ve placed a substantial amount of henna on each section of your hair, wrap plastic around your head. You should not remove this wrap for two to four hours. Doing this will make sure that your hair absorbs the henna completely.

, Comb your hair and aim to get rid of any tangles or knots. After you do this, you will want to section your hair into a few different parts. This will make dyeing your hair less difficult. The most common way to section hair is to create four different quadrants. To do this, create two divides. First, you should divide your front and back hair. Then, you should part your hair into a left section and a right section. This will give you four separate parts.Use bobby pins or hair clips to hold each section in place.

, Your hands might get dirty and end up looking blue from the indigo. To avoid this, put on a pair of rubber gloves prior to applying indigo. Latex, kitchen, or gardening gloves will do., It’s best to do this once you are ready to start the dyeing process. Pour warm water into a medium-sized bowl. Sprinkle in the indigo powder. Wait for about ten to fifteen minutes. You will want to mix this until you create a textured sort of paste., You should now have a prepared indigo mixture. Spoon this on your hair using your hands. You should place indigo on all parts of your hair that you want to be darkened.

, You want to make sure the indigo seeps into your hair. Therefore, once you have covered your hair with indigo, you should put a plastic wrap or a shower cap on your head. You will want to leave your hair covered for about an hour., Using cool water, you should rinse out all of the paste that is in your hair.


Do not use shampoo for the next two to three days.
It will take a couple of days for the indigo to oxidize. Once it does, then you will see the actual color it was supposed to produce.

After the hair dye process is completed, don't use regular shampoos.",How to Dye Your Hair With Manic Panic Hair Dye2," Do not put any conditioner on the hair before you add the Manic Panic––you want the hair to be as porous as possible.


Blow-drying and straightening can help remove a lot of moisture.

, If this is a sectioning method, or however you choose to do it, you might like to mix it with some conditioner to dilute it. Put it on as if you were just conditioning your hair.

Brew some coffee.,
Mix the coffee with conditioner.,
Apply the mixture to your hair.,
Rinse your hair.",How to Dye Your Hair With Coffee1," Brew about 1–2 cups (240–470 ml) of organic coffee. The coffee should be organic, because non-organic coffees usually have added chemicals and preservatives.Be sure to use a dark roast coffee or espresso.This will help make sure your hair will darken with the coffee. Make this brew strong, by adding a little bit more coffee than 1–2 cups (240–470 ml) calls for.


You can brew the coffee however you want (a drip coffee maker, on the stove), but brewing your coffee in a single serve instant coffee maker might not brew the coffee as strongly as it should be to adequately dye your hair.
Let the coffee cool and use it when it is completely cooled, or lukewarm.;
, You can use any kind of conditioner to mix with the coffee, however, thicker conditioners might make application easier. Mix 1 cup (240 ml) of your brewed coffee, with 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of conditioner, and 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of the organic coffee grounds.Use a spoon to mix all of these ingredients together.


If you have longer hair, you can increase the quantity of coffee and conditioner used.The exact measurements are not a rule, but more so a guide.

, Apply this mixture to your hair using your hands, and consider using a wide toothed comb to spread the mixture evenly through your hair. Once you have added all of the mixture to your hair, consider pinning your hair up in a bun to keep your hair out of your face as you let the mixture soak in. Leave this mixture on your hair for at least an hour.After an hour, the conditioner may start to dry and harden.


Apply this coffee mixture to your hair in a bathroom with a mirror so you can contain any mess and see what you’re doing.
Be sure to have a junky towel (one you don’t mind getting messy) draped over your shoulders. This will prevent any of the coffee mixture from falling on your clothes and staining the fabric.

, Rinse the coffee and conditioner mixture out of your hair in the shower. Don’t add shampoo; simply let the water clean out the mixture from your hair.You may need to repeat this dying process a couple times to reach your desired results.

Use tea to change your hair color.,
Make hair darker with coffee.,
Deepen hair with walnut shells.",How to Dye Your Hair Naturally1," Plants and herbs that contain tannins have long been used as dyes, and although the coloring teas made by steeping plants in water aren’t as permanent or strong as commercial dyes, they can still change the color of your hair, especially if you repeat the treatment frequently. To darken hair with tea:


Choose a loose-leaf black tea or black tea powder and steep one-half cup (72 grams) of tea in two cups (16 ounces) of boiling water. Allow the water to cool with the leaves still in it. When it reaches room temperature, strain out the leaves and transfer the tea to a spritzer or spray bottle.
Spray your scalp with the tea water and massage it gently in to the roots of your hair. When you have saturated the roots, continue working downward toward the ends, spraying and massaging hair in sections until your hair is saturated and the tea is gone.Twist your hair or pile it on top of your head and secure it with a large clip or a few bobby pins. Then, cover your hair with a shower cap or plastic wrap and let the tea sit for an hour.
Rinse with lukewarm water only and style as usual. For best results, repeat on a weekly basis.;
, Like tea, coffee also contains tannins that can be used to change your hair color. With coffee, it’s easiest to grind one tablespoon (15 grams) of instant coffee granules into a course powder in a coffee grinder or with a pestle and mortar. Mix the powder into a cup (eight ounces) of your favorite conditioner.








When you bathe, use the coffee conditioner instead of regular conditioner. Each time you use it, let the conditioner sit in your hair for 10 to 15 minutes before rinsing it out.

, Black walnuts are another tannin-containing plant, and the shells can be crushed into a powder to make a hair dye. Place two to three cups (7.5 to 11.5 ounces) of crushed walnut shells into a large pot and cover with four cups (32 ounces) of water. Allow to soak for 12 hours. After soaking:Cover the pot with a lid, and bring it to a boil over high heat. When it boils, turn the heat down to medium and continue boiling for about two hours, or until the water becomes a deep brown. Remove the pot from the heat and allow it to cool to room temperature.
Strain out the walnut shells. Put on some disposable gloves (or gloves you don’t care about staining), wrap your neck and shoulders with a towel to protect your skin, and apply the walnut water to your hair with a tint brush, paint brush, or a cotton ball.
Let it sit for an hour, then rinse with lukewarm water and a mild shampoo."

Warm toned people have golden, olive, or dark skin with brown or dark eyes. Their hair is black, brown, blonde, red, or strawberry blonde.People considered warm tan easily. If you are warm toned, your hair reflects gold, and gold jewelry looks good on your skin.
Cool toned people have fair skin with blue or green eyes. They have blonde, black, or brown hair. These people burn instead of tanning. If you are cool toned, your hair might reflect silver in the light. Silver jewelry looks good on your skin.
Turn your arm over. Look at the veins in your wrist and forearms. If they appear to be green, you have warm tones. If they are blue, you are cool toned.Another method is to hold a white piece of paper up to your face. If you are cool toned, your skin will look blue compared to the paper. If you are warm toned, your skin will look yellow or golden next to the paper.;
, Whether you are dyeing your hair from a box or at a salon, the shades can sound like food options at a bakery. Warm shades contain words like warm, honey, golden, butter, caramel, or copper. Cool shades are called ash, beige, and ice., No matter what skin tone you have, if you want your hair to look natural, only go 2-3 shades lighter than your natural hair color. Also consider the color of your eyebrows when deciding on a natural blonde shade.Going a few shades lighter can easily be done at home. Lifting your hair's natural hair color a few shades can be achieved through a boxed dye.
If you are going a few shades lighter on already dyed hair, but your hair naturally is dark, go for ash-toned blonde shades.Consider dyeing your hair with cool or neutral shades of blonde if you are doing it at home. Warm shades, with golden or honey in the title, can end up making your hair look orange., Adding warmth to your hair if you have a pinkish hue can result in an over-reddening of your face. Go for cooler blonde shades, like sandy blonde, ashy blonde, or beige blonde., Anyone can go blonde, but you have to find a complimentary shade for your skin. Darker and olive toned skin may not be right for a super bright blonde shade. Try a honey blonde instead. Another suggestion is to keep your darker roots and ask for golden beige highlights. The roots help prevent your face from washing out.Caramel is another shade of blonde that will compliment your tones.


Alternately, you can try buttery or strawberry blonde shades.If you have brown hair, be careful going too light because it can wash you out. Avoid platinum, white, or orange. Go for blonde highlights or lowlights instead.

, You can try golden blonde, beige blonde, or even light blonde. Keep warmth in your hair to match your warm skin tone. To get a subtle ombre, keep your light brown base and add varying tones of honey highlights through the middle of your hair, going a bit lighter at the ends.If you have warm skin tones, avoid brassy blonde colors. Brassy blonde colors can end up giving you an orange hue. Ashy colors can leave you washed out.

, If you have light skin, you want to choose golden, strawberry, or light blonde while staying away from white, ash, and reddish.The lighter your skin, the lighter the shade of blonde you can go while still looking natural.


Try buttery highlights on a caramel base. For a multi-dimensional, natural lighter blonde, go for a mix of butter, gold, and honey.Dyeing your hair blonde works well if you were blonde as a child, or your hair got blonde as you spent time in the sun., For a bold blonde that goes beyond 2-3 shades lighter than your natural hair color, seek the help of a professional hair stylist. Extreme blonde shades or highlights require multiple bleachings, and most of the time, multiple visits to the salon. If you try to bleach your hair at home, you could end up with banana or canary yellow hair or brassy, golden orange.Anyone can be platinum blonde, but it may take months to achieve. Lighter hair will be much easier to dye a white blonde. Hair that has been dyed before or naturally dark hair will take much longer. To safely dye your hair, you need to gradually lighten the hair. If your hair is dark, you probably are not going to be able to reach platinum blonde in one visit. It could take months of dyes in lighter shades to work you up to a white blonde.Most hair colors need at least 3 appointments to achieve full blonde status.For a white blonde, go for ice blonde if you are warm toned. Platinum blonde works better on cool tones. Remember - there is no white. Ask a hair specialist to help you understand the different white shades if you have trouble.

, At home bleaching can go very wrong. If this is the first time you are dyeing your hair, go to a professional.When bleaching at home, make sure to follow the directions on the box exactly. Don't leave the bleach on for more than 45 minutes.Your hair should be a pale yellow when you finish bleaching. If it's an orange, which happens sometimes with very dark hair, wait a week to bleach again. Put conditioning treatments on your hair during this week.
If you are trying to dye your hair platinum at home, you will need to use a purple toner on your hair. This is a must if you want to dye your hair white blonde because it erases the yellow brassiness. Go for a 30 or 40 volume toner. Rinse with white vinegar to help keep the toner color longer.Don't try to leave the bleach on your hair for a shorter amount of time to reach a darker blonde and a longer amount of time to reach a lighter blonde. Bleach doesn't work this way. It strips the hair if the pigments.

, Blonde hair is a large undertaking. Your hair will need a lot of maintenance to keep it looking healthy, and you will need to spend time and money every few weeks filling in roots or getting touch ups. If you are not prepared for the responsibility of blonde hair, think about going a few shades lighter instead of anything drastic.

, Before you do any kind of dye job, it is important to prep your hair. Wash it the day before with clarifying shampoo to remove any product build up from the hair. Don't shampoo your hair the day before you dye it. The natural oils help protect your scalp from irritation from the products., This step is essential. Dyeing your hair strips it of its pigment and lipids, which dries it out. Switch your regular conditioner for a deep conditioner. If your hair is dry, use a moisture product; if it is brittle and damaged, use a damage product. Use dry shampoo so you don't have to wash it every day and dry it out. Use conditioning masks when you wash your hair.


If you go platinum or ice blonde, use shampoos that contain blue pigment to maintain the color.Choose sulfate-free shampoos to preserve color.
Try putting coconut oil on your hair once a week. Melt it down and put it on your hair, wrap your hair in plastic wrap, cover it in a towel, and leave on for about an hour., Bleaching your hair can damage it, so to keep your hair healthy, cut it right after you dye it. This removes the dead ends, which can lead to breaking., When you have bleached and dyed your hair blonde, stay away from the heating styling tools.

While your hair doesn’t need to be platinum for this to work, the rose color will not show up on brown hair. You will need to reach a golden color before you can do anything else.You can purchase a bleaching kit at your local beauty supply store. Depending on the kit you use, your exact instructions may differ.
If you are going from a dark brown to blonde, it is highly recommended that you go to a professional. Bleaching your hair at home may take several applications, and you will most likely achieve an orange color before getting close to blonde. Multiple applications of bleach can be damaging to your hair, and if you can shell out a little bit of extra money to visit a salon, it may be worth it.;
, Bleach is a powerful product, and it can ruin clothes and irritate your hands. It’s best to wear clothes you don’t care about while you’re doing this, and protect your hands with some plastic gloves. On that note, take extra care to keep your workstation as clean as possible. Bleach can easily ruin your bathroom rug or your nice hand towels!

, Both of these will come in the bleaching kit that you purchase, as well as mixing tub or a bottle to mix them in. Use a brush to mix the developer and bleach in the mixing tub, or shake the bottle vigorously to thoroughly mix the two products. Once it’s mixed, it’s ready to apply., To ensure that you coat all of your hair with the bleach, it’s best to work in small sections. Use claw clips or duck bill clips to section your hair into four sections. Part your hair down the middle, and then part it again across your head, like a plus sign.Make sure each section is thoroughly brushed out before you begin applying the bleach. It’s much easier to work with tangle-free hair.

, Begin with the back sections. It’s important to work efficiently as you do this. It may seem strange, but rather than applying the bleach to your roots and working down the hair, you will be doing the opposite. Start applying the bleach to the ends of your hair and work your way upwards. Your roots will bleach faster than the rest of your hair because of your body heat. By applying the bleach to your roots last, the dye has more time to sit on the rest of your hair.Make sure you are completely saturating your strands.
As soon as the bleach hits your hair, it will start processing, so it’s important to have a game plan before starting.

, It’s important to read the instructions that came with your particular bleach kit. You can also keep an eye on your hair as the bleach processes, and rinse it when you believe your natural color has lifted enough. Then, wash your hair like usual until the bleach is completely rinsed out.

, Remember, after one application your hair may be a bit yellow or orange if you were beginning on dark hair. A bleach kit can only lift your hair a few shades at a time, so you may need to repeat this process in a few days once your hair has had a little time to breathe.


Because you aren’t leaving your hair at this color, it’s okay if you haven’t achieved a flawless white blonde color. Once you’ve achieved a golden color, you’ll be applying on your rosy dye!
Bleach is damaging, so it’s important to hydrate and repair your hair with a deep conditioner in between bleaching sessions. The less bleach you use on your hair, the better!

, If you are happy with the color you’ve achieved after the bleach, you can skip this step. If your hair was dark to begin with, however, you’ve likely ended up with an orangey or yellowy color after the bleaching. A toner can help to remove some of this brassiness. Apply it to your entire head, and let it sit for at least half an hour.Using a purple shampoo can also help you reduce the brassy colors.

, There are a variety of dyes that can achieve this look, so shop around at your local beauty supply store or online. You can find many dyes that will actually be called “rose” or even “rose gold,” but layering any pink dye of choice over your golden hair should do the trick.Depending on the intensity of the color dye you choose, you may need to pick up a diluter as well. A diluter will dilute the hair dye, giving you a lighter, more pastel result.

, By splitting your hair into sections, you can ensure that you coat every piece with your rose dye. Sectioning your hair into a bottom, middle, and top layer may be sufficient. Hold sections out of the way with claw or duck bill hair clips. If you have thick hair, you may need to create more sections than that.

, Because there is no bleach involved in this step, time is a bit less critical. It’s more important that you thoroughly coat every single strand of hair that you want to be rose gold. You can use a dye brush to apply the product, but you can also simply rub the product into your hair with gloved hands. After you’ve applied it to each section, brush the section out to help distribute the dye even more and ensure you’ve gotten every piece., Typically, the longer you let your dye sit, the more intense the final color. Check the instructions on the dye you’ve purchased, and keep an eye on your hair as it processes. Once time is up, rinse the dye out of your hair.


If your hair was very light, you may not need to leave your rose dye on for very long.

, Every single time you wash your hair, your rose color will soften a bit. If you love the color and want it to last as long as possible, try to skip the washes as much as you can. Don’t worry – that doesn’t mean you need to completely neglect your hair hygiene. Purchase a bit of dry shampoo to minimize oil and keep your hair looking fresh., Semi-permanent hair dyes in unnatural colors wash out a bit every time you wash your hair. If you’re a fan of your rose gold hair and want to keep that color intense, add another tube of the dye to your favorite hair conditioner. When you shower, let your conditioner soak into your hair for a couple of minutes. This will intensify the rose gold color every time you shower., When you rinse your hair with hot water, the cuticle opens. When the cuticle opens, the dye you put in your hair washes out. By limiting your washes to cold water, you’ll help keep that cuticle sealed and help keep that dye locked in. While every wash will dilute your rose gold a bit, using cold water will minimize that."

, Just like the black dye will dye your hair, it will also dye your carpet and clothing. To avoid ruining your favorite clothing, put on an old t-shirt before you begin.

In a tub, mix up the developer and the dye with the provided dye brush. Make sure you stir everything together thoroughly so that the dye and developer are thoroughly blended.

, The downside about applying black dye to your hair is that it easily stains the skin. Instead of hurting your skin scrubbing the black stains, protect your skin by applying a layer of Vaseline or other petroleum jelly around your hairline. This will create a barrier between the dye and your skin, and you can simply wipe away the jelly once you’re finished., Use the provided brush to put the dye on your hair. Then, use your gloved fingers to massage the dye into your hair. By using your hands, you can make sure that your hair is evenly coated and saturated. Do this for your entire head, from roots to tip.

Use cool water to rinse your hair while massaging it, just like you would with shampoo. Keep rinsing it until the water runs completely clear – this can take awhile! Once you’re sure all the dye is out, give your hair a little TLC and condition it. Shampoo can strip out some of the dye, but conditioner will not.

, Every time you wash your hair, you will rinse a bit of the dye out. In order to keep your hair as black as you want it, try not to wash it more than you absolutely need to. Clip up your hair or cover it with a shower cap when you shower, and use combat grease in between washes., When you do have to wash your hair, use cold water. It might sound unpleasant, but it will help your color last longer. Hot water will cause the cuticle of the hair to open, which is where the black pigment is.

By using cold water, the cuticle of your hair will stay sealed and hold onto the black dye., Inevitably, your black hair will start to fade and your roots will begin to grow out. When you notice this happening, it’s time to repeat the process! Grab another box of black hair dye and give your color a boost. To maintain a dark black, you will need to re-dye your hair every couple of weeks.

, Use large, plastic salon clips (found at your local drugstore) to hold the sections apart. Separating your hair into these sections will ensure that you don’t miss a patch of hair.







, Break each section of hair up into smaller 1/4""-1/2” subsections as you work (this will just make your dye job more even.) Use the applicator bottle or brush to dispense the dye onto your hair. Use your gloved fingers to work the dye into your hair.Whether to begin applying the dye will depend on whether or not you have ever dyed your hair before.









For virgin (first time dyeing) hair, start applying dye about 1 inch from your roots.
For touch-ups, start applying dye about ½ inch from your roots.
Work the dye into your hair well so that you do more than simply color the top layer of your hair.
The thicker your hair is, the smaller you should make your sections so that the dye can saturate the hair fully.

, Follow the instructions on the box. Do not rinse the dye out before the minimum time or leave the dye in past the maximum time. Make sure to follow the directions exactly. If you have a lot of grey hair, it’s best to leave the dye in for the maximum amount of time. It may help to sit under a heated dryer, as well.Never leave hair dye in overnight. Leaving it in overnight will dry out your hair and it may cause severe skin irritation as well.

, Do not disturb the dye in your hair. If you want, you can put a shower cap on your hair to keep the dye from going everywhere.









Once you have put a shower cap on, you can wrap your head in a towel so that the cap retains the heat of your head. This will speed up the dyeing process.

, After your time is up, either get into the shower or use a sink to rinse your hair out. Use warm water to rinse the dye out of your hair. Rinse your hair until the water runs clear.








Don't panic if you see the color run in the shower - this is totally natural and does not mean you’ve messed up the dyeing process. Keep in mind that if the dye is temporary, the dye will continue to run each time you wash it until it is completely gone.

, Wait at least an hour before shampooing your hair. Waiting to wash allows the dye to more thoroughly penetrate your hair shaft. After you have shampooed your hair, use the conditioner that came with the dye kit. Rub it thoroughly into all of your hair. 








Almost every kit comes with conditioner, but if yours did not you can just use what you have at home.

, You can either blow dry your hair or let it air dry. After your hair is dry, style it as you normally would and show off your new hair color! If you are unhappy with your results, you may want to see a hair stylist for color correction. It is also a good idea to wait at least two weeks to color your hair again.

It's a bright red flower that can be used to add a ruby hue to your hair that sparkles in the sun. If you can't find fresh Jamaican sorrel, buy the dried version instead. You'll need two cups. In addition, get the following supplies:


2 cups water
1/4 cup honey;
, Place the two cups of water in a small saucepan over medium high heat. Bring to a boil, then add the sorrel, cover the pan with a lid, and turn off the heat. Let it soak for several hours so that the sorrel dye steeps into the water, then strain the water into a bowl and mix in the honey.

, Shampoo your hair as usual, but don't use conditioner. Conditioner stays in the hair and can prevent the dye from setting as well. Towel dry your hair and use a wide-toothed comb to remove tangles.

, Put on latex or plastic gloves and use your fingers to spread the mixture through your hair from the roots to the tips. Make sure to distribute it well so that no strands of hair get left out.


If you want red highlights, choose just a few strands, separate them from the rest of the hair using strips of aluminum foil, and use an old paintbrush or pastry brush to apply the treatment.

, Use a plastic shower cap or plastic wrap to cover your hair so it doesn't dry out while the dye is soaking in. Let it sit for 4 hours or overnight. The longer the dye stays in your hair, the redder it will look.

, Remove the cap or plastic wrap and rinse your hair with warm water. Shampoo and condition as usual, then dry your hair and style it.

Care for your lightened hair.",How to Dye Brown Hair Without Bleach1," If you want to lighten your brown hair without bleach, you will need to purchase a high lift dye. This is the only kind of product that will actually lighten the pigment in your hair, rather than simply covering it up with another color. You can lift it four to five shades with this product, without the damage and irritation that can be caused by bleach. When you had head to the beauty supply store, look for boxes labeled “ash blonde.” These colors have toning agents in them to minimize orange pigments that can result from lightening brown hair. Unless you’re going for orange hair, the “ash” keyword is very important!It’s important to manage your expectations with this kind of product. If you are starting with dark brown hair, it will only lighten your hair to a lighter brown. If you are starting with very light brown hair, it can bring your hair to blonde.
High lift dyes only work on untouched, uncolored hair. If you already have dyed your hair, these won’t work until the previous dye has fully grown out.
Choose a reputable, salon-quality hair dye brand. The less expensive brands will not have the high lifting effects.
Check the box for any other products you will need to use in conjunction with your high lift dye, like peroxide, a mixing bowl, and a brush.;
, All high lift dyes will come with their own set of instructions, and it’s important to read the one for your specific product. Typically, high lift dyes need to be mixed with a 40 volume peroxide, which you can also find at your beauty supply store. Mix your dye and peroxide into your mixing bowl according to instructions., Depending on how thick your hair is and the look you want to achieve, your sectioning may differ. An easy method to ensure you dye all of your hair is to section it off into four sections. Divide your hair into a middle part, and then gather your hair into two pigtails on either side of your head. Then, split each pigtail into a top half and a bottom half so that you’re left with four sections.Using section is important to make sure you can efficiently apply your hair dye. By applying it quickly, you can make sure that it doesn’t sit for significantly longer on certain sections, which can create uneven tones in your hair.

, Go through each section, brushing your mixed hair dye onto your hair. It’s easiest to do the top of each section first, then move downwards through the section. After you’ve gone through each section and applied your dye, use a mirror to ensure that you’ve covered all of your hair. Check your instructions to see how long you should let the hair dye sit on your hair for.The waiting time can differ from person to person, depending on your starting color and the color you want to achieve. It’s helpful to check your color every five to ten minutes, making sure the color is processing to your liking.

, Once your waiting time is up, or you’ve arrived at a shade you are pleased with, it’s time to rinse out the dye. You can certainly use your favorite every day shampoo or conditioner, however it may be helpful to use a purple shampoo. Purple shampoos can be bought at most pharmacies and beauty supply stores, and they help to neutralize the brassy tones in lightened hair.If you notice orange tones, which are common when lightening brown hair, you can let the purple shampoo sit in your hair for a while to tone these pieces, softening the brassy shades.
To understand purple shampoos, look no further than the color wheel. Purple sits opposite yellow on the wheel. When your hair has brassy, yellow tones in it, the purple shampoo helps to tone and balance them out.

, While you avoided using a bleaching kit on your hair to achieve your lighter color, it’s important to recognize that lifting your hair color can still damage it. Try to minimize additional damage by being gentle on your hair. Always use heat protectants when you style it with hot tools. Treat your hair to a weekly deep conditioning treatment to give it a boost of hydration. After showers, spritz your hair with a leave-in strengthening product."

Buy henna powder.,
Make henna paste.,
Apply the henna paste.,
Cover your hair and let it sit.,
Rinse out the henna.",How to Dye Dark Brown Hair Red Using Natural Products3," Henna powder is derived from the henna flower. The powder is made into a paste that is applied to skin or hair to turn it a coppery reddish color. Henna powder typically comes in 100-gram boxes, which is the perfect amount to dye medium-length hair.

Purchase your hair color of choice.,
Section off your hair.,
Read the instructions for your specific hair dye.,
Apply your hair color.,
Rinse your hair.",How to Dye Brown Hair Without Bleach2," You can find lots of different colors at beauty supply stores, and there are even more selections online. If you want to dye your brown hair a funky color like red, purple, blue, or pink, many people will recommend that you bleach your hair first. This will remove the dark pigments and allow the dye color to show up vividly. If you’re determined to skip the bleach, you can certainly still achieve a cool, fun color in your hair.It’s important to understand that your final color may (and probably will) be different than the hair color you see on the packaging. Often, the models show the color on hair that was very light originally. You will be layering the color over darker hair, so the final color will be darker. For example, a color may look pastel purple on someone with platinum blonde hair, while it will look like a darker purple on a brunette.

, Before you start applying the hair color, it’s best to section off your hair to make the process as easy and efficient as possible. Part your hair down the middle into a center part, and then hold your hair into pigtails on either side of your head. Section each pigtail into a top and bottom section, and clip them or tie them into these four sections.


If you have thicker hair, you may need more sections. If you have thinner hair, you might get away with only using two sections.

, Most hair dyes have generally the same instructions, but it’s always important to see what your specific product says to do. This will give you application instructions, timing, rinsing instructions, and even color maintenance tips.

, You can apply it in whatever manner is easiest for you. Some people prefer brushing their dye onto their hair, while others use a squirt bottle to apply it, rubbing it into their hair with gloved hands.After you’ve applied the hair dye, use a mirror to double check that you’ve covered every strand in the back.


If you’re unsure how a dye will look in your hair, you can dye a test strand first. Grab a piece from a bottom layer and apply the hair dye as instructed. Let it sit for the recommended time, and rinse. This will help you decide if you like the color before taking the plunge and dying your entire head of hair.

, These funky colors are semi-permanent, so be warned that your color will fade the more you wash it. After you’ve rinsed out our dye with shampoo and conditioner, try not to wash your hair very often. When you do get your hair wet, use cold water to preserve the color as much as possible.If your hair gets greasy between washes, use a dry shampoo to make it appear clean without having to wash.

Bleach more than once if needed.",How to Do Glow‐in‐the‐Dark Hair1," While you may be able to bleach or dye your hair yourself, it can help to have a professional do at least the bleaching part of the process. A professional knows how to bleach your hair with as little damage to it as possible., Bleaching can be hard on hair, so try using a deep conditioner in the two weeks leading up to when you bleach your hair. A nourishing mask can also help. The conditioner will help prevent your hair from looking as damaged once you bleach it., This advice may seem counter-intuitive, but it's a good idea to start with slightly dirty hair when you're bleaching it. The oils actually help protect your hair and scalp a bit, leading to less damage, particularly for your scalp.Try bleaching your hair when it hasn't been washed in two to three days. Also, skip the deep conditioner on your last wash.

, You can find bleach and developer at your local hair supply store or big box store. One recommended brand is L'Oreal Quick Blue. For the developer, if your skin or hair is sensitive, go for something under 30-volume. Otherwise, use 30-volume or 40-volume developer, depending on how dark your hair is (40-volume is for darker hair).You can also buy kits that include both the bleach and the developer.

, The developer essentially activates the bleach for use on your hair, so you'll add it to the bleach. You should use a separate bowl to add the developer in (not the container the bleach came in), unless you have a kit with a bowl. When you mix the developer with the bleach, it should be about pudding consistency.It's best to wear gloves when mixing and applying bleach.

, Use a dye brush to paint the mixture into your hair. Be sure to divide it into sections as you go, so you're getting as close to your scalp as possible all the way through your hair. Check your hair after half an hour to see if it is lighter. Don't leave it on for longer than 45 minutes.Keep in mind that you only want to bleach the parts of your hair you want to dye. If you just want a streak, that's all you need to dye. Make sure to protect the rest of your hair from the bleach with something, such as a towel, foil, or plastic.
Wash out the bleach when you're done. Use both shampoo and conditioner.

, Sometimes, you may need to repeat the bleaching process if the first or second time didn't get your hair light enough. You should wait a week before trying again because the process can be damaging. Your hair needs to be very light to dye it neon."

",How to Dye Blonde Hair Black," This color should be dark enough that your blonde, be it light or dishwater colored, is covered. A medium to dark brown is good.

, However, if the box includes a color seal or highlight conditioner, skip it. You can do that after the black. The brown step is a ""just-in-case"" step. Some black dyes on light blonde hair cause it to look green. Even if it doesn't look green, the hair may have an unnatural color that looks odd.

If you are dyeing your hair at home, it is better to stay with a darker shade. A blonde or dramatically different shade can be difficult to achieve without the help of a stylist, and dyeing it improperly can leave hair very damaged.If your hair has been relaxed, then it is best to go to a professional.Choose a color that is within two to four shades of your natural hair color. Choosing blonde when your hair is naturally dark can result in a shade of orange.;
, You have the option of choosing a permanent, semi-permanent, or temporary dye. A semi-permanent dye is probably the better option because it isn’t as harsh and doesn’t last as long. A temporary dye doesn’t penetrate the strands, and it will wash out within a few washes. Choosing a semi-permanent dye can also be healthier for your hair because natural hair coloring options, like henna, are available with semi-permanent hair color.Buy at least two boxes of color to be sure that you will have enough dye.
Henna is a great choice for natural, virgin hair. But, if you’re hair has already been chemically treated, then henna can damage your hair.It is possible to apply dye to locs.

, Applying a deep conditioner will strengthen your hair before exposing it to the dye. Using a deep conditioner will also provide your hair with more moisture, which will allow the color to soak in better. Apply the conditioner for five to thirty minutes, depending on the instructions, and then rinse thoroughly., Clean hair can be too slippery for the hair color to attach to. Although it might not feel right, it is better for your hair to be slightly dirty when you apply color. The natural oils give the color something to hold on to, and the oils act as a buffer between your scalp and the hair dye., Comb through your hair gently in order to relieve any tangles. Doing this will ensure that there are no obvious “patches” in your hair after it is dyed. Then, part your hair into four sections and clip the sections down and away from each other. You will apply the dye to one section at a time to ensure that every strand is coated with color., Carefully review the instructions specific to the product you’ve chosen before preparing the dye. There is generally an activator along with the color and an applicator to apply the mixture to your hair. If an applicator is not supplied, you can use an applicator brush. Typically, you will need to mix the applicator and color into one bottle, shake it, and then you are ready to apply the color to your hair.Every hair dye kit is different. Don’t assume you know how to prepare the dye because you’ve used a hair dye kit in the past.

, Gloves should be supplied in the kit. If not, you can buy a plastic or rubber pair from a beauty supply store, like Sally’s Beauty Supply. Gloves are important to wear during the dyeing process because skin exposed to dye can be burned by the chemicals used in the dye.You should also use gloves to avoid staining your hands and fingernails.

, Take a small amount of color and apply it to a strand of your hair. You should do this to test the color and make sure it is what you want before committing to it. Your hair texture also determines the amount of time the color needs to sit, so a strand test helps you decide how long you will need to set the timer for when you apply the color to all of your hair.If the color does not turn out as expected, it is best to wait for professional guidance or buy another kit.

, Hair dye may drop during the application process. Wear an old T-shirt or robe you don’t care about staining while dyeing your hair. Make sure to wear something that can be easily removed and will not rub against the hair dye when you remove your clothing for a shower.


An old button-up shirt or robe is ideal because you don’t have to remove it over you head.

, It’s normal for some hair dye to get on the forehead and neck during application. Apply Vaseline to the forehead around your hairline and any area that may be exposed to dye to avoid the dye staining your skin. If dye does stain your skin, you can remove it with products like makeup remover and nail polish remover with a washcloth.Be sure to rinse the remover as soon as the dye is removed. Nail polish remover can cause irritation to skin.

, Going by one section at a time, apply the dye mixture using the applicator. Untie or unclip the section you are dyeing, but leave the other sections up until you are ready to dye them. Smooth the dye into the hair with your fingers gently moving from root to tip. Take your time as you apply. Going too fast could affect your curl pattern. Make sure every strand is covered.Once you think all of the hair has been covered in dye, go back through one more time and make sure there are no strands left to color.

, Read the instructions to check how long the color should stay on for. You can also judge the amount of time according to the strand test you did before coloring all of your hair. Set a timer to make sure the color sits for the length of time required.Some dyes are made to stop processing when the amount of time is up. Keeping the color on longer will likely not impact the color, but not keeping the color on long enough can change the results.

, Once the dye has been in your hair for the required time as per instructions, rinse your hair thoroughly with cool to warm water until there are no traces of dye left. You can use a shampoo during this time to clean the hair. There should not be any dye visible in the water when you are finished rinsing your hair., Many dye kits will come with a deep conditioner to use directly after the dyeing process. If not, use a deep conditioner of your home. It’s important to deep condition your hair after dyeing to strengthen the hair and add shine. Apply the conditioner and gently run your fingers through your hair to make sure it is coated. Then, wrap your hair in a warm towel, or cover with a shower cap and scarf for approximately fifteen minutes to lock in the moisture. Rinse thoroughly once the amount of time is up.You can cover your hair in a plastic wrap and apply heat to it while the conditioner is on to intensify the conditioning.

, Avoid using a hair dryer if possible. Instead, allow it to dry naturally. During this time, you can use a styling product, like mousse or oil, to aid in the styling process and add extra shine., Use a shampoo and conditioner made for dyed hair to provide extra moisture and extend the life of your hair. Shampoos and conditioners made for dyed hair should not contain sulfates, which will strip the hair.Avoid washing your hair in hot and hard water, which will strip your hair of its color.You can also buy products made to make color last. A color protectant product may come in the form of a shampoo, spray, or cream."

Depending on the look you’re going for, you may want to keep it simple and just choose one color, or you may want to buy four. It’s totally up to you! You can buy a blonde highlighting kit that will lighten pieces of your brown hair, auburn dye, gorgeous golden hues, soft brown dyes – whichever dye you think will look good in your hair. The darker your hair is, the less of an effect you’ll notice.

You’ll need products containing bleach to lighten up brown hair. If you don’t want to lighten but just create different shades, you can purchase a regular hair dye without bleach.;
, You will be creating your tiger eye hair through the balayage technique. Balayage is a very natural way to color hair, where the dye is gently painted throughout the hair for a natural, softer effect. The tips of the hair are saturated, but the rest of the hair is very delicately painted to avoid any harsh highlights. It is done freehand and there is no foil involved.The balayage technique is perfect to create tiger eye hair, because you can create a soft mixture of the colors you’ve chosen. You can gently paint a variety of dyes into your hair so that everything blends very naturally.

, This process can get a bit messy, so it’s important to prepare the area you’ll be using. Put a few paper towels on the bathroom counter under the dyes to prevent them from getting on the counter. Make sure to put on an old t-shirt so that you don’t stain your nice clothes. Finally, grab a pair of gloves – these usually come in the boxed dyes.

Prep all your dyes according to each box directions. Have every color ready to go before you start.

, After you’ve chosen your assorted colors, you’ll need to prep them all according to the instructions for each product. Because you’ll be using multiple colors, it may be helpful to label each mixing bowl with the name of the dye, like “caramel” or “auburn,” so that you don’t mix up the colors while you’re in the middle of the process., Before you start painting strands all over your head, it’s important to make sure your hair reacts to the dye how you want it to. Grab a few small strands from your bottom layer of hair, where it is easily concealed. Then, do a little “test strand” for each dye you want to use. Let that process as the instructions indicate, and then rinse and dry the strands.This will allow you to see how the color will develop before you start applying it all over your hair.
You can also determine if you need to leave dye on longer, you can practice applying the dye, and so on. A test run is always a good idea.

, Balayage is a very organic, freehanded way to apply the dye, but it’s important that you spread it throughout your hair. By applying the dye section by section, you can ensure that there is a bit of color everywhere. The amount of sections you’ll need to create depend on how thick your hair is. One bottom layer below your ears, one layer at your temples, and one top layer is usually a satisfactory method.You can purchase cheap plastic hair clips at your local pharmacy, and these are perfect for creating the sections.

, Pick up one thin strand of hair at a time. You don’t want to dye large strands of hair – balayage is all about subtle hints of color throughout your hair, rather than chunky highlights. You can apply the dye with a coloring brush, but using your fingertips may be the easiest method.

Make sure you clean your finger tips when you switch between different dyes.

, The key to successful tiger eye balayage is to only apply it to the bottom half of your hair, not up towards the top. Pick up a bit of dye in your fingers, and then rub it onto the hair. The very tip of hair should be saturated with dye, and apply it lighter as you move up the strand. To ensure you don’t have an unsightly stark line where the dye ends, make sure to gently and lightly pull dye up slightly to create a blurred border., The unique thing about tiger eye balayage is the warm, dimensional mix of different hues. Make sure you alternate between your browns, reds, and golds as you paint strands throughout your layers. You don’t need to worry about following any sort of exact pattern or science – just make sure you put a little bit of every dye in every layer., After your dyes have set for the instructed amount of time, rinse the strands out fully with your favorite shampoo. Sometimes, lightening brown hair can result in orangey hues. If this occurs, you can fix or soften it by using a toner or purple shampoo."

Magenta is more purple-toned and is darker. Copper is a more auburn, yellow-based color.One way to pick the right hue is to consider the shade of lipstick you wear most often. If you go for blue or purple, that tells you to choose magenta. If it's a true red or more orange, pick copper or red.
Hold a sample hair swatch close to your face to see if the color works with your skin tone. Understand your natural hair's undertone. Black hair has a blue undertone, which works better with magenta usually.
20 volume dye will make your hair darker red. 30 or 40 volume will make it a brighter red. Match the color to the undertone of your skin. If you have light skin tone, dark reds will make you look too pale. Go copper instead. If you have medium skin tone, choose magenta. Avoid darker eggplant colors like magenta if you have dark skin tone. ;
, There are different kinds of hair dye: Permanent dye lifts the hair cuticle, and lasts months. Temporary color, which places the dye on top of the natural hair color, will last a few days. Temporary colors usually come in shampoo bottles. The L'Oreal box is permanent dye.If your hair is curly, it will be more fragile. Don't lighten it more than three levels from your natural color or you will damage the hair.
Ion sensitive developer works best for people with skin that irritates easily.

, Be honest with yourself about whether your hair is in the proper condition to be dyed. Hair dye will cause damage to your hair, so it's very risky to dye hair that is already damaged.


If your hair is already dyed, it can be very risky to apply more dye to it. That's because the dye will lower the porosity of your hair, making it harder to absorb the new dye. You could end up with black hair in some spots, and red in others. Virgin hair (hair that hasn't been dyed before) will show brighter color.
Be upfront with your stylist about whether your hair is already dyed.

, Don't try to dye your hair without a shopping list. If you forget one item, though, such as a tinting brush, you won't likely get the outcome you want.


You can get most of what you need at local beauty stores.
Expect the entire process to take 2-3 hours. The processing time takes 30 minutes. That doesn't count the amount of time it takes you to mix everything, apply it, and rinse. Plus, you should repeat the process twice for black hair.

, Black hair used to require bleaching before you could dye it red. However, now there are hair dyes on the market - like L'Oreal Excellence HiColor Reds for Dark Hair Only in H8 - that promise you red hair without bleaching the black first.


Be aware that this hair color does have bleach already in it, though, so it will damage hair if you use it over and over again. For waist-length thick hair you may need four boxes. For shoulder-length hair, choose two. , You don't want snarls, so brush your hair thoroughly. Then, use clips to pull the hair into small segments.


Apply Vaseline at your hairline so you don't end up dying your skin orange.
It's a good idea to separate the hair into four equal segments.

, Add your tube of dye and developer to the mixing bowl. Use a 2 to 1 ratio. Add 1 tube of dye (1.2 ounces) and 2.4 ounces of the developer into the bowl. Use the measuring cup to make sure you get the right proportion of developer. The 1.2 ounces should be the entire tube of dye.









Mix them together in the bowl with the tinting brush until the dye is smooth. You don't want chunks in the dye. It should be the consistency of paste and not too watery. , Using the tinting brush, you should paint the dye starting with the tips of each section of your hair except the roots. Paint it on one section at a time. Move upward toward the roots. 








Squirting the bottle of dye onto your hair directly won't create an even look. That's why painting it on is a better approach.
Wear plastic gloves when applying dye. Otherwise, you will stain your hands.
Remember to paint the tiny hairs near your ears. You might want to use your finger to reach those.
Completely saturate the hair with dye.
Do everything but your roots. You usually have virgin hair at the roots, so if you do the roots first, you could end up with brighter red color at your roots than elsewhere. That's why you should do the tips first, and the roots last.
Then, put a shower cap on your hair, and let it process for about 20 minutes. Next, remove the shower cap, and paint the roots. Let that process for about 10 minutes, also with the shower cap on.

, Follow the instructions on the box. But you will be told to rinse your hair. You need to use shampoo that is designed for red hair, though, if you use it, but it's usually better at first to just rinse the hair..


Use lukewarm or cool water, but never hot water as it will make your color fade.

, You will want to dye the hair twice for best results. Dry your hair first, with either a blow dryer or naturally.









With black hair, the first pass through will turn the hair somewhat red, but you will need the second process to make it a true red. However, don't redo the roots because they will absorb more color the first time.
You can wait 24 hours if you want to redye your hair or you can do it again right away.
Make sure you have enough dye before you start. Buying more dye than you think you need might be a good idea since you will have to go through the process twice.

, Red dye has larger molecules than other hair colors. As a result, you need to treat dyed red hair a little differently than other colors.


Don't take hot showers. Hot showers will make your color fade faster.
Red hair dye will probably stain your towels. Don't be surprised if some of it comes off after showering.
Touch up the red. Red hair requires a lot of maintenance. So you will have to touch it up with the same process. People often have to touch up their hair after three weeks, largely at the roots, using the tinting brush. You shouldn't need to saturate the whole head though.

, You might need to switch your makeup when you go from black to red hair.









Red hair will bring out your skin's pinkness, so pink blushes won't work anymore. The same is true of lipstick. However peach shades work well.
You can make your eyebrows look like they match your hair by choosing matte eyeshadow a few shades lighter than your red hair color. Brush it on the brows with a makeup applicator.
Black eye makeup can be too harsh on redheads. , Remember that dying your hair will cause it damage. So you'll want to make sure you apply deep conditioner to it in the days after you've dyed it.


Avoid shampoos with sulfate in them. They can strip the color out of your hair faster.
Choose shampoos that are specially designed for red hair that is dyed.

Figure out what highlighting kit to purchase.,
Prepare your hair for highlighting.,
Set up your highlighting station.",How to Do Your Own Highlights1," Highlighting kits are available at most drugstores, but you may be better off going to a beauty store, where you'll find a larger selection. When you're considering what type of kit to buy, there are several factors to take into consideration:



The length of your hair. If you have short or medium hair, the kit you buy should contain a cap, a hook, and a brush. If you have longer hair, you need a kit that has applicators you can use to apply the highlights evenly as far down your hair as you'd like them to go.
The type of highlights you want. If you just want some light highlights, nothing too dramatic, choose a kit that comes with a rubber fingertip applicator that you can use to apply highlights exactly where you want them to go. For more dramatic highlights, you'll need a kit with a brush or long-hair applicators.
The color you want the highlights to be. If you want your highlights to look natural, choose a blond-colored highlight a few shades lighter than your natural color. Auburn highlights are also a great choice, especially if you have dark brown or black hair.;
, Plan to highlight your hair a few days after you last washed it. Using bleach and dye on clean hair can damage it, since the natural oils your scalp produces to protect the hair shaft have been washed away. Your hair should also be dry when you begin highlighting it.


, Set up a work area (preferably your bathroom) in a space with bright lighting and quick access to water. Put on an old t-shirt and have old towels handy in case stray highlighting solution gets on your skin.



You may want to wear a pair of gloves in order to prevent getting highlighting solution on your hands. Some kits come with a pair of plastic gloves for this purpose.
Put away items in your bathroom that might get damaged by the highlighting fluid - it will dye anything it comes into contact with.

Take care of your hair.",How to Do Ecaille Hair Color," Spread some newspaper over your counter and drape a dyeing cape over your shoulders. If you don't have one, use an old towel instead. Put on a pair of plastic gloves.
, Be sure to fold the top ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) over so that the foil doesn't scratch your scalp when you insert it into your hair. You can also use pieces of plastic wrap instead; keep them separate so that they don't stick together.

Make the sheets about the same length as your hair and about 4 inches (10.16 centimeters) wide.

, Ecaille focuses on adding golden tints into your hair in a pattern that is reminiscent of a tortoise shell. You can go as light as you want to, but avoid using anything over 30 volume, or you will risk damaging your hair. If your hair has been previously lightened, then don't use anything higher than 20 volume.For more dimension, use two different volumes., Purchase a hair bleaching or lightening kit from the store. Mix the powder and the cream developer together in a tray or mixing bowl according to the instructions. In most cases, you'll need to use 1 part powder and 2 parts developer., Part your hair down the center, then use the handle of a rat-tail comb to create a vertical section in front of your ear on the left and right side of your head. Clip these two sections out of the way. Split the back section horizontally just below your ears, and clip the top section out of the way as well., By now, you should have just the back section of your hair hanging loose. Take a 2-inch (5.08-centimeter) wide section from the left-most side., Slide the teeth of your rat-tail comb upwards through the strand, starting from the middle and finishing at the roots. If you have thick hair, do this twice., Tuck a piece of aluminum foil under the dyed section of hair, with the folded edge against your scalp. Fold the foil in half over your hair, sandwiching it inside., Apply a thick band of lightener to the middle of the strand, then another to the bottom. Be sure to saturate the strand.For best results, use a brush with angled bristles., You can place another sheet of foil over it, or you can simply foil the existing piece in half., This time, only apply the lightener to the bottom half of the section. Cover the strand with aluminum foil when you are done., Alternate between using two bands and covering the bottom half of the strand. When you finish the row, let down more hair from the upper section. When you finish the back section, work on the sides.

When you reach the sides, consider angling the sections upwards, then angling the bangs downwards., How long this takes depends on the brand you are using, how dark your hair is, and how light you want it to go. Avoid going too light, however; you want the strands to maintain a golden color.Check on the color every 5 minutes. Your hair might process a lot faster than the recommended times on your kit's package.

, Do not use any shampoo or conditioner until after you have rinsed everything out. It would be a good idea to wear an old shirt during this process in case any lightener gets on you., Many lightening kits will include a shampoo and conditioner. If yours came with them, use them right now. If yours didn't, wash your hair using a shampoo and conditioner formulated for bleached, dyed, or damaged hair. This will help nourish and hydrate your hair and prevent it from getting too brittle., Even though you did not add color to your hair, you still want to use a shampoo and conditioner made for bleached, damaged, or colored hair. You will also want to use a hydrating mask weekly and limit the heat styling. When you do heat style, remember to use a heat protectant and a lower temperature."

Pick a color or colors.,
Protect your hairline.,
Protect your space and hands.,
Apply the dye.,
Add highlights with a toothbrush.,

Rinse out the dye.,
Get under a black light.",How to Do Glow‐in‐the‐Dark Hair2," Often, with the glow-in-the-dark trend, people use a variety of neon colors on their hand for an variegated effect. However, you can just stick to one color. Keep in mind that colors like neon yellow and bright neon pink will likely show up better in a black light.Try using colors that will flow well into each other. For instance, yellow and purple dye next to each other could mix and make an awful color combination. However, yellow and orange or yellow and pink will mix to make better combinations. You can also use shades of the same color, such as light yellow and neon yellow.You can try Kenra Neon Yellow, for instance, or Manic Panic's neon colors.

, It's easy to get hair dye all along your hairline when dyeing. That extra dye on your skin isn't the best look. To avoid it, apply a clear lip balm along the line, making sure you get a solid layer. The lip balm will help protect your skin against the dye., That is, the dye will get everywhere. You should wear gloves. It's best to put on an old robe so you don't have to lift a shirt over your head.Also, lay a towel or even trash bags over areas you want to protect from the color, such as the floor and your sink., Following the directions on the box, apply the dye to your hair. Generally, though, you start with completely dry hair.Apply the dye to your hair with a dye brush in sections, to ensure you are coating your hair evenly.


You can also squirt the dye on from the bottle.
If you want to use more than one color, try starting at the top with one color and fading it into the other color at the tips. If you're using complimentary shades, you can even just splash on colors in places at will, as long as you make sure to cover your hair completely.
Start with the roots. Roots take more time to dye, so if you start there, you're less likely to end up with different shades from taking too long to apply the dye across your head., If you want to create some highlights in your neon hair, pick a shade that's lighter than your main color. Use a toothbrush to (lightly) add the color in strategic places, such as along your part. Don't get too heavy-handed., Like the bleach, you need to let the dye sit so it can soak into your hair. You can generally let it sit for about an hour, though always check the directions on the box. The longer you let the dye sit, the more saturated the color will be.You can put a shower cap on for this part.

, Once time is up, wash out the hair dye. You can just use your normal shampoo to rinse it out. Rinse it until the water runs clear. Once it does, use a bit of vinegar to help set the dye. Simply pour some white vinegar in your hand, and rub it into your hair. Once it's been in there for a couple of minutes, rinse it out., Once you've colored your hair, it's time to test it out. You can either buy a black light bulb to check out your hair at home or take yourself to a club that uses black lights. Get someone to take a picture of your glowing locks!

Try glow-in-the-dark skin and hair paint.,
Spray a neon color into your hair.,
Add glow-in-the-dark hair gel.",How to Do Glow‐in‐the‐Dark Hair3," These paints are truly temporary dyes. You brush them in or use your hands to rub them in where you want them. You can even create streaks with different colors. Keep in mind, though, these colors will only last for a night or so., Another option is to use a neon hairspray. Like the paint, this color change will only last the night. It's very simple to apply. Simply spray into your hair where you want the color. Make sure not to breathe it in as you spray.

, You can also use glow-in-the-dark gel to add a bit of pizzazz to your hair for a night. The bonus of this method is that some gels even work in total darkness, rather than in just black lights. Simply spike it into your hair like you would normal gel.

Take a shower.,
Wrap your hair up in a towel and get dressed and what not.

,
After about two minutes, while your hair is still pretty wet, take it out of the towel.

,
Part your hair where you want it.

,
Brush your hair so there are no tangles or knots.

,
Section off your hair into four parts: first into two parts down the middle in the back, as if you were going to do two pigtails, and then halfway through the top, so there is a section on the top, and a section on the bottom.

,
Apply mousse to the first section where you would like to start.,
After you apply the mousse, apply gel to the same place.,
After the products are in your hair, braid that section.,
Do those same steps for each section of your hair.

After all the braids are complete, spray each braid with hairspray thoroughly.,
When you wake up, spray the braids with hairspray every few hours.,
When you take the braids out, put a big wad of gel into your hands, rub them so it spreads the gel out, and scrunch your hair all over.

, Use curl shaping gel with extra strong hold.

, Make sure the braid is as tight as you can get it.

,, Again, don't get any of the products on your roots to avoid the greasy look.

Choose where to place your highlights.,
Apply the highlighter.,
Cover your head with a clear cap.,
Rinse out your hair.",How to Do Your Own Highlights2," The cap that comes in highlighting kits has tiny holes through which you pull strands of hair to be highlighted. The cap can help you make sure the highlights are evenly distributed. However, if your hair is too long to pull through the cap, or you want to have greater control over the highlight placement, you may not wish to use it.



If you're using the cap, put it on and take a look at where the highlights will go. Use the hook that came with your kit to pull small sections of hair through the holes in the cap. You don't have to use every hole provided; just pull through as much hair as you want.
If you have long hair, look at yourself in the mirror and determine which strands of hair you want to highlight. Use small clips or bobby pins to section the parts off your hair you want to highlight.

, Working according to the instructions included with your highlighting kit, mix the cream and powders to create the highlighting solution. Use the applicator brush to apply highlighting solution. Make sure each strand gets an even coating of highlighter. Work from front to back, so the front strands of hair, which would naturally be lighter, have more time to lighten while you work your way backward.










If you have short or medium hair, apply the highlighting solution to the strands that you pulled through the cap.
If you have longer hair, use strips of aluminum foil to keep the strands of hair you are highlighting separate from the rest of your hair. Place a strip under the part of your hair you are highlighting, use the special applicator to paint highlighting solution down the length of the hair, from the roots to the tip. Leave the aluminum strip in place while the highlighter works.

, Your kit should have provided a clear plastic cap, similar to a shower cap, to protect your hair while the highlighter works. Place it in on your head and let the highlighter sit in your hair for about 20 minutes, or as long as the instructions provided state you should leave it in.



The longer you leave the solution in your hair, the lighter your highlights will be.
Be careful not to leave the solution in your hair for too long. It is made out of strong chemicals that can damage your hair if you aren't careful.

, Remove the plastic shower cap and use the cream provided in the kit to rinse out your highlighted hair, making sure all the solution is completely washed out. Afterward, remove the cap with holes and use shampoo and conditioner meant for color-treated hair to wash and condition your hair as usual.










Make sure to use the cream to rinse out the highlighter before mixing your highlighted hair with the rest of your hair. If you used aluminum strips, wash each strand separately with the cream, then shampoo your entire head.
Using shampoo and conditioner made for color-treated hair helps prevent your hair from drying out.

Buy a touch-up kit.,
Use a natural highlighting technique.",How to Do Your Own Highlights3," When your highlights start to grow out, use a touch-up kit of the same color to brighten up your roots. Touch-up kits come with rubber fingertip applicators that make it easy to apply a little highlighter solution directly to your roots. Follow the instructions, and make sure not to leave the solution in for too long.


, If you don't want to spend money on more dye, consider using a natural technique. Locate one of the following household items and apply it to your hair:



Lemon juice. If you have blond highlights, simply mix half lemon juice, half water in a spray bottle and spray it on your roots. Go outside in the sun for about half an hour, and the rays with react with the juice to brighten up your hair. Wash it out when you come back inside.
Chamomile. If you have blond highlights and want a subtle lightening effect, make some chamomile tea and use an applicator brush to apply it to your roots. Leave it in for about 30 minutes, then rinse your hair and wash and condition as usual.
Cinnamon works to boost red or auburn highlights. Make a paste with cinnamon and water and apply it to your roots. Leave it in for 30 minutes, then rinse it away and wash and condition your hair as usual.

Wet your hair (or don't!).,
Dispense some mousse into your palm.,
Work the mousse into your hair.,
Dry your hair.",How to Mousse Hair Properly1," Even if you're not interested in a methodical styling session, you can still use mousse to quickly and easily give your hair a more vibrant look. Wetting your hair is a good start, but it's not essential. As a general rule, the wetter your hair is when you use mousse, the shinier and ""wetter"" it will appear when you've finished styling. If you choose to wet your hair, wet your hair under the sink to ensure it's evenly wet, with no dry spots. If you really soak your hair, dry it lightly with a towel or allow it to air dry, ideally to a moderate level of wetness. Your hair should feel like you've just dried off from a shower.


Mousse is a great choice for anyone who doesn't want to carry hair product with them throughout the day - all it takes is a spritz of water to reactivate mousse, allowing you to re-style your hair throughout the day.
Mousse can also invigorate thinning hair.;
, As with any normal aerosol can, hold the can upright for the best results. Begin with a small amount; if you don't use enough, you can always reapply more later. Depending on the length and thickness of your hair, the amount will vary slightly. For medium length hair, try starting with an egg-sized amount./images/thumb/1/13/Mousse-Hair-Properly-Step-2-Version-4.jpg/v4-550px-Mousse-Hair-Properly-Step-2-Version-4.jpg

Using a lot of mouse can give your hair a shiny, slightly flat appearance. This is great if you're going for a ""slicked back"" look, but if you're trying to give your hair some lift, use mousse more sparingly.

, Spread your mousse onto both hands. Then, brush your hands up through your hair from the front to the back. Pay special attention to your roots (the part of your hair near the base). Ensure the mousse is spread evenly through your hair, using your fingers or a wide-toothed comb to work the mousse so that your hair feels uniformly ""wet"" with mousse. You can also try ""teasing"" your hair at its roots with the tips of your fingers to get it to stand up.

If you've got especially long hair, you may get better results taking a more methodical approach when applying mousse to your hair. Refer to the method above for tips.

, Use a blow dryer set to ""low"" if you're going for an Ace Ventura-style lifted hairdo. Part your hair with a comb so that the blow dryer can reach your roots. On the other hand, if you want a more subdued hairdo, it's perfectly acceptable to allow your hair to air-dry and then style it with your hands.

If you blow dry, your hairstyle will ""set"" more strongly than if you air dry. Air-dried hair can easily be re-styled throughout the day with your hands.
Throw a quick style into your hair while it's drying. Most short hairdos only take a few easy hand motions to shape. Mousse is best for styles that don't require extreme hold — if you're looking for a foot-long mohawk, try again with gel or pomade. Here are a few easy styles you can make on your way out the door:

Run your fingers back through your hair to give it a taller, fuller appearance. This volume-enhancing look can be especially useful for men who want to make the most of their thinning hair coverage.
If you have thicker hair, form your hair into a rough peak at the middle of your head for an easy faux-hawk.
If you have long bangs, try styling your hair to one side for a bold ""Flock of Seagulls"" look.

Look for foods containing iron.,
Get plenty of vitamin A and vitamin C. Sweet potato, carrots, dark leafy greens, squash, and apricots are all high in vitamin A. Guava, bell peppers, kiwi, oranges, and grapefruit are all high in vitamin C.


Both of these vitamins help your hair follicles produce natural oils called ""sebum."",
Avoid magnesium deficiency and selenium deficiency.",How to Make Your Hairline Grow Back," There are plenty of shampoos that claim to regrow hair, but some work better than others. Know what to look for before you invest any money in this type of specialty hair product.


Look for a gentle shampoo that clears your pores without the use of harsh chemicals. Herbal shampoos can be especially beneficial. Look for ones containing chamomile, aloe vera, ginseng, horsetail, rosemary, biotin, cysteine, proteins, silica, and/or vitamin E.
Check the ingredients and make sure that your shampoo does not contain sodium lauryl sulfate. This is a fairly common ingredient in many commercially produced shampoos, but it can cause already weakened hair to further shrink and break.;
, Hair that remains properly moisturized will be stronger, thicker, and less likely to break.


A good conditioner is a crucial component in keeping your hair moisturized. Herbal conditioners can be a great choice because they are less likely to contain potentially hazardous chemicals. In particular, look for conditioners that contain amino acids, biotin, aloe vera, ginseng, and/or green tea. Apply the conditioner and leave it in for 15 to 30 minutes before rinsing it with lukewarm water.
After conditioning your hair, use a steam treatment to open the cuticle and liquify the conditioner so that it penetrates each strand of hair deeper.Wrap your hair in a washcloth dampened with hot water, then cover both your hair and the cloth with a plastic shower cap.
Lay a second warm washcloth over the cap, then cover the entire thing with a second shower cap.
Sit for at least one hour to allow adequate steam to form. If possible, spend part or all of this time underneath a hooded dryer.



, Good hair regrowth balms, masks, and serums can help thicken and protect the hair around your forehead, temples, and nape. Massage your chosen product directly into the damaged hairline.Look for a product that mixes a light protein treatment with a gentle moisturizer. Products that contain vitamin E are also good since this nutrient can replenish any damaged skin on your scalp.
Giving your scalp a light massage as you apply these products can help, too. Massaging the skin will stimulate blood flow to your scalp. Increased blood flow to any area of the body increases that area's ability to function, so increase blood flow to your scalp can increase your scalp's ability to regrow hair.

, Natural oils moisturize and thicken your hair, and since you'll be blending them together yourself, you'll know that there are no hidden chemicals to worry about.


One formula consists of one part organic castor oil, three parts extra virgin olive oil, and five drops of organic tea tree oil.The olive oil acts as a carrier oil, making it easier to apply the product evenly over your scalp, and it also contains beneficial antioxidants and vitamin E. Castor oil stimulates dormant hair follicles, and tea tree oil can unclog hair follicles that are too blocked to grow effectively.


Another option is a mixture of 2 oz (60 ml) coconut oil, 10 drops of rosemary oil, and 10 drops of lavender oil.

The coconut oil provides intense moisture. Lavender oil can cleanse and relax a stressed scalp, while rosemary oil stimulates blood flow and awakens dormant hair follicles.



, Once you've settled on a particular hairline oil formula, you'll need to massage it into your scalp so that it can do its work.


Consider mixing the oils in a plastic squeeze bottle with a long tip. Evenly apply the product directly to your roots using that tip.
If you only want to use the product on your hairline, consider applying it with a cotton swab or clean mascara wand.
Regardless of how you apply the oil, use your hands to massage it into your scalp. Focus on the hairline area and massage for at least 10 minutes before rinsing. A good massage can stimulate and improve circulation, which should encourage hair regrowth.

, If your best efforts don't produce any results, schedule an appointment with your dermatologist or general practitioner.


A dermatologist would be your best bet since this branch of medicine deals directly with hair and skin conditions, but visiting your general practitioner or family doctor might be enough if the damage to your hairline is only minor.
The doctor should be able to tell you if it is possible to regrow your hairline at all. If it is, he or she might be willing to prescribe regrowth medication or otherwise recommend a special regrowth procedure., Brushing and combing your hair can put stress on your hairline. Cutting your hair short reduces the amount of time you'll need to spend brushing your hair, thereby reducing the amount of brush-related stress.


In fact, if you don't mind shaving your hair completely, doing so might be the best long-term option for restoring your hairline.

, When you do need to brush your hair, do so as gently as possible to avoid breaking off any strands at the root.


Be especially cautious when brushing your edges. Stop using a heavy brush along the hairline and opt for a soft bristle brush instead. For severely damaged hairlines, you should even consider using a toothbrush instead of an actual hairbrush.

, After washing and rinsing your hair, allow it to air dry or dry it gently using a soft towel.


Do not rub your hair dry or wring out excess moisture. Either action can create additional stress on the remaining hairs of your scalp., Braids, cornrows, weaves, tight buns, and even simple ponytails can put stress on your hairline. Keep your hair down to reduce the amount of stress placed on your follicles.


When your hair is tied back, strands of hair can break of at the root, causing hair loss around your temples, bangs, sideburns, and forehead.
If you do need to throw your hair back for some reason, there are ways to minimize the stress. Keep any ponytail, bun, or braid as loose as possible. Similarly, ponytails and buns tied below the height of your ears put less tension on your roots than high styles do.Likewise, if you want to wear a sew-in weave, talk to your hair stylist about sewing the weave into a net instead of sewing it directly into your hair. This solution is still less than ideal, but the net would create less tension and do less damage., Chemical relaxers and dyes only do minimal damage to healthy hair, but when used on weakened hair, these common products can make the problem even worse.


The negative effect that potent chemicals have might seem obvious enough, but you should even restrict your use of milder chemical products. For instance, most commercial hair gels contain alcohol. Alcohol removes moisture from your hair, making it more brittle and likely to break off as a result.

, Your hair needs oxygen to thrive and grow. When you suffocate your hairline with a heavy wig, you cut off that oxygen supply and shrink the cuticle, thereby weakening each individual strand of hair.


The same can be said of weaves attached with a net or stocking cap. Even though this type of weave is less damaging than those sewn directly into your hair, they will still dramatically reduce the amount of oxygen your struggling hairline receives.

, Most hairline treatments focus on topical care, but hair originates within the body, so internal health is just as important as external health.


Your body sends the nutrients you consume to your organs and other essential tissues first, so even if your body is receiving enough nutrition to remain healthy, it may not be receiving enough to keep your hair in good shape.Certain nutrients play a more direct role in hair care than others. Consuming foods that are rich in these nutrients can give your struggling hairline an additional boost from the inside.
Nutritional supplements that contain these helpful nutrients can also make a difference, but in most cases, your hairline will derive greater benefit from direct food sources than it will from artificial supplement sources.

, Good sources of omega-3 include fatty fish like salmon and tuna, flaxseeds, walnuts, kale, and Brussels sprouts.


Omega-3 clings to the hair shaft and cell membranes in the scalp, where it strengthens your hair follicles and encourages growth. It also makes your hair less brittle, so strands around your hairline will be less likely to break off as they grow back.

, A few sources worth considering include chickpeas, wheat germ, beef, veal liver, and oysters.


Zinc encourages tissue growth and repair within the body, so if your hairline troubles are linked to a damaged scalp, a little extra zinc can make a big difference.
Additionally, zinc also encourages glands along your scalp to produce oils that keep your existing hair healthy and vibrant.

, Meat and legumes are some of the greatest sources of protein you can find. Include more chicken, turkey, eggs, peanuts, beans, peas, and lentils in your diet. Greek yogurt also provides a considerable dose of protein.


Hair is almost entirely made of protein, so if you don't consume enough protein, you'll never be able to regrow your lost hairline. Protein deficiency can also cause your remaining hair to thin out and turn gray.

, Iron can be found in a wide range of foods, including dark leafy greens, whole grains, red meat, oysters, beans, and clams.


Iron improves blood flow around the body. Without it, blood won't be able to carry enough oxygen to the cells around your scalp, and you won't be able to reinvigorate dormant follicles.

, This oil keeps your hair hydrated and reduces the risk of breakage.
Note that consuming more than 15,000 IU of vitamin A on a daily basis can actually cause further hair loss, however.

, Nuts and fish can be good sources of both nutrients. Halibut, almonds, and cashews are rich in magnesium. Halibut is also rich in selenium, as is tuna, shrimp, sardines, and Brazil nuts.


Magnesium plays a crucial role in many different biochemical bodily functions, including hair growth.
Selenium allows the body to make selenoproteins, which can help stimulate dormant hair follicles.

Spray with hairspray.",How to Make Your Hair Look Gray for a Costume4," Purchase gray or silver hair chalk at a beauty supply store and dip the tip of the hair chalk in water. Use a spray bottle filled with water to spray and dampen your hair.Hair chalk is very strongly pigmented, much more so than sidewalk chalk or even artist pastel chalk.

, Brush your hair to separate all the strands, then separate a strand of your hair and hold it at the tips away from your face., Starting at the roots of your hair, rub the dampened tip of the hair chalk downward to coat and color the section of your hair., Repeat the process of holding out a section of hair and coloring it with the gray hair chalk on the rest of your hair. You may need to re-dampen the tip of the chalk several times if you have long hair., Once you finish coating your head, wait for about one minute and then blow-dry your hair to set the color into your hair for the day. If you want the color to last a few days, use a hair straightener or curler on the gray parts of your hair to encourage the color to last longer., Since hair chalk has the tendency to rub off on your clothes without using hairspray, spritz your hair all over with hairspray to make sure it doesn’t rub off.Hair chalk should come out in one to two shampoos.

Put on disposable gloves.,
Mix developer and dye in a bowl.,
Return caps to bottles and store.,
Isolate an unnoticeable strand of hair.,
Apply the mixed dye to the strand.,
Leave the dye on the strand for about 30 minutes.,
Rinse and dry the strand.,
Wait 24 hours for best results.,
Observe if the color is too dark.,
See if the color is too light.,
Determine if the color is otherwise unexpected.,
Proceed with your full dye or another strand test.",How to Do a Strand Test Before Dyeing Your Hair," Pull on the plastic gloves provided in your dyeing kit to protect your hands from the chemicals in the dye. You should leave these gloves on throughout the strand test.


If you don’t have gloves included with your dyeing materials, purchase any disposable latex or latex alternative gloves from the store.
It’s important that you avoid contact of the dye with your skin. Many products contain dyeing agents that are toxic and can stain the skin. If you do get dye on your skin, rinse with warm water as soon as possible. For more stubborn stains, use olive oil, baby oil, or a gentle soap or laundry detergent.;
, Squeeze 1 teaspoon of hair color and 1.5 teaspoon of developing cream into a plastic bowl and mix together thoroughly with a plastic spoon or applicator brush if you have one.


It’s best to use a disposable bowl or cup and spoon, as the dye can stain the bowl and utensil permanently.
Follow your specific dyeing instructions if they suggest different quantities of color and developer. You need only a very small amount for one strand of hair.

, Screw the caps back onto your color and developer bottles and store them in a cool, dry place until you use them for your full hair dye.


Don’t mix the rest of your dye ahead of time. Mixed dye should be used on hair right away and not stored.
Clean up any spills with warm water and soap or oil if necessary to fully remove any drops of dye on a sink, counter, or other nearby surfaces.

, Separate a strand of your hair that doesn’t often show in whatever style you most commonly wear your hair in. Clip back the surrounding hair so that it doesn’t get in the way or get dyed accidentally.Try a section near your ear for an easily accessible and often hidden strand.
Separate a strand that’s at least an inch wide for a more accurate representation of what a larger quantity of hair will look like once dyed. Choose a strand that includes some gray hairs if you aim to cover grays with this dye.You may perform this test by cutting a smaller strand of hair off to dye it, but note that this will only test for color results, not allergic reactions.

, Use an applicator brush, comb, or your gloved fingertips to apply the mixed hair dye from your bowl to your separated strand of hair.


Make sure to work the dye through the hair strand thoroughly from root to tip as you would when dyeing normally and according to your instructions. Try to apply to roots as close to the scalp as possible without getting dye directly on the skin of the scalp.
If this is your first time dyeing your hair, apply dye to the middle of your hair strand and leave it in for 15 minutes before you apply to the roots and ends. Dye processes more quickly at the roots of hair due to heat from your scalp, as well as at the ends due to dryness, so this application may help to create more even color.If you’ve dyed your hair previously, apply the current dye to your strand of hair at the roots down to where your previous dye color shows and leave it in for 15 minutes before adding color to the rest of the strand. This will help even out possible differences in color between previously dyed hair and undyed roots., Leave the dye in for 30 minutes or whatever duration your specific instructions recommend.


Take care to keep the dyed strand from touching any other hair, your skin, or clothes during this time.
You can wrap your dyed strand in tinfoil or plastic wrap to protect it if you wish. Note that this can also accelerate the dyeing process and result in stronger color due to the heat insulated within.

, Rinse out the dye from your strand of hair with warm water until the water runs clear, then blow dry or let it air dry.


Don’t use shampoo on your hair right away, but you may use a small amount of conditioner after the rinse if you wish.
Try to keep the strand isolated during rinsing and drying so you can more accurately compare and determine the results.

, Wait another 24 hours after your strand dries to determine the results of the test. This will allow any allergic reactions to fully develop, and let you observe the color of the dyed strand in different lights and get used to the color.


If you know you are not allergic to the ingredients in your particular dye, you can perform the full dye on the rest of your hair right after the strand test, though waiting a full day can still be beneficial to help you get a better idea of the color.
During the 24-hour period, test the condition of your hair by feeling its texture compared to your non-dyed hair and stretching out an individual hair to see how it behaves. Damaged hair will feel dry or coarser than normal, and will not resume its normal shape or length after being pulled.To do a more accurate allergy test, you should perform a separate patch test by applying a small amount of dye to your inner elbow and observing your skin after 48 hours. If you notice any redness, itching, swelling, or pain with either a strand or patch test, you should wash off the dye immediately and not use it again., Look at your dyed strand when it is fully dry. If the color is darker than you wanted, leave the dye on for a shorter period of time or select a lighter shade when you dye your full head of hair.The color on your hair strand may turn out darker if your hair is dry and brittle from excessive heat exposure or previous dyes. You may want to treat dry hair for a few weeks or months before you do a full dye.
Color can also turn out darker if your hair is currently a lighter shade or if you’ve had it previously bleached or permed.

, Observe your fully dried hair strand to see if the new color is lighter than you want or expected. If so, leave the dye in for longer or select a darker shade of dye when you treat your full head of hair.Your hair may not take the color as well if it has been recently shampooed or if you have previously colored your hair using henna, which can leave a residue that prevents dye from working as well. You may want to leave your hair color in longer, and apply it when your hair has not been washed in a couple of days.
Hair dye also may not bind to your hair as well if you’re taking certain medications such as thyroid treatments, certain hormone therapies, or chemotherapy. You should apply dye when you are not taking these medications if possible, and consult a doctor or pharmacist to be sure that hair dyes will not interfere with the performance of any medication., Look at your dyed strand of hair when it is dry to see if it is a different tone or color than you were expecting. You will likely want to purchase a different shade for the full hair dye if this is the case.


If the color is too red, yellow, or “brassy,” try a dye with “ash” in the name of the shade (like “ash blonde” or “ash brown”) to neutralize it. You can mix the ash shade with your current shade to achieve the desired color. You may want to do another strand test after mixing the two shades.If the color is not covering gray hair, you may need to leave the dye on for a longer period of time (see your specific dye instructions) or apply a cover or heat to your hair while the dye sits., Replicate your exact process during the strand test when you use the full amount of dye on the rest of your hair.


If you weren’t happy with the strand’s color, do another strand test with a new shade, mix of shades, or a different time period/heat application to achieve the desired results.
If you do another strand test, isolate a different strand of hair than the one you used for the first test."

Do an allergy test.,
Pour the shampoo you will be using into a mixing bowl.,
Mix 1oz of bleach and 1oz developer in a second bowl.,
Pour everything into one bowl and mix thoroughly.,
Wet your hair with cool water.,
Put an old towel around your shoulders.,
Apply the bleach wash to your damp hair.,
Clip your hair up while the bleach processes.,
Use a spray bottle and towel to remove a bit of bleach.,
Wash out the solution.",How to Do a Bleach Wash on Your Hair," If this is your first time using bleach or doing a bleach test, you should perform an allergy test before covering your whole head in bleach (or else you might have a bad reaction.) Mix up a small amount of equal parts bleach and developer. Take a cotton swab, dip it in the bleach, and rub it on the inside of your elbow. If that area begins to itch, grow patchy, or take on a bright red color, then you are most likely allergic to the bleach and should not use it on your whole head. Monitor the area for 48 hours. If nothing happens then proceed with the bleaching.If your bleach and developer come with instructions on how to perform an allergy test, follow those instructions.;
, If possible, use a clarifying shampoo as this sort of shampoo will help you to gauge the strength of the bleach you are using. You should use the amount of shampoo you would normally use when washing your hair.


You may want to add a tad bit more in case you need to add a bit more bleach to your hair.
Most shampoos are fine to use but do not use a toning shampoo.

, There are many different types of bleach - cream, oil, liquid, or powder - but it really doesn't matter what kind you use. They all do the same thing in the end.Using a 30 or 40 developer can break or snap re-treated hair, so use with caution! Developer comes in many volumes with lower numbers being weaker and 40 being the strongest.

, The shampoo--if a clear clarifying one--should turn whatever color the blech is.Add conditioner. This step is optional, but recommended to keep hair healthy. However, do not add conditioner if you are planning on dyeing your hair directly after bleaching it.

, Plan to bleach your hair when it is damp but not dripping. Run your hair under a cool stream of water (be it in the shower or sink). Once your whole head is wet, towel dry it so that it is damp rather than soaking wet (ie. there should not be water dripping in rivulets off of your head).You can also let your hair air dry for several minutes in combination with towel drying it.
Bleach can be applied to wet or dry hair. You should use whatever approach is more consistent with your level of bleaching experience. Your bleach will likely go best if you use a method you are comfortable with.

, Bleach has a tendency to remove the color from everything (not just your hair but clothing too) so it's important to bleach-proof your work area. Wrap an old towel (one you don't mind discoloring) around your shoulders. To be safe, you may want to wear an old shirt you don't care about as well. Put your latex or rubber gloves on so that the bleach doesn't irritate your skin.

, You will need to wear latex or rubber gloves for this step. When applying the bleach wash, start at the bottom (or tips) of your hair and work your way up to the roots. Once you have reached the roots, rub the rest of the bleach bath into your hair just like you would rub normal shampoo into your hair while showering.It's okay to apply the mix only to certain spots on your hair (like where the color didn't work out like you wanted it to.)

, Once your hair is clipped up with plastic clips, put a shower cap over it. The shower cap will make the bleach process more quickly, and will also ensure that the bleach doesn't drip everywhere.

, Spray a small section of the hair with plain water in a spray bottle and wipe a bit of bleach clean with an old towel. Do this every few minutes to keep an eye on how much your hair is lightening. It is important to keep an eye on your bleaching hair or else you may end up with a more intense platinum that the one you were hoping for.For already bleached hair, you may only need 7 - 10 minutes.
For removing a dark dye, you may want to process it longer than 10-15 minutes, though it should only be 30 minutes maximum.
If you do decide to use 30 or 40 vol - for extra lift or speed - don't let it process longer than 7-10 minutes (depending on your hair color and condition).

, Once you have reached the color you were hoping to achieve, its time to wash the bleach out. If you are planning on dyeing your hair after this bleaching process, do not use conditioner while you wash your hair out (some conditioners keep dye from getting absorbed into the hair.) If you are not planning on dyeing your hair, use a deep conditioner to bring some life back to your bleached hair. Wash your hair out as thoroughly as you can.If you're trying to remove hair dye, your hair should look orange or yellowish.
If you're trying to remove a toner, it should leave the hair yellow.

Decide if natural colorants are right for you.,
Manage your expectations.,
Do a strand test.,
Decide where you will color your hair.,
Use a natural conditioning treatment after coloring gray hair.",How to Cover Gray Hair Naturally1," Naturally coloring your hair can be a messy process and take longer to process than chemical dyes. However, if your hair is damaged or easily damaged, natural colorants will be easier on your tresses than conventional hair dyes. It’s up to you personally whether the benefits outweigh any inconvenience.If you have sensitive skin, herbal colorants may be the best choice for you, since chemical hair dyes can cause contact dermatitis.Natural colorants such as cassia obovata, henna and indigo are mixed into a paste that needs to sit out overnight. They also take longer to develop (from an hour to six hours) once applied to your hair.;
, While you can plan for a general shade, natural colorants react differently to each individual’s type and condition of hair. Your results will be unique and may be lighter, darker, or more varied in hue than you expect.Natural colorants, particularly tinting rinses, may not give you complete coverage of gray hair. How well it works for you depends on the method you use, how long you let it sit, and your hair type. You may need to repeat the process of coloring after 48 hours if your gray hair has not been covered successfully., Your individual hair type as well as various hair products you’ve used in the past affect how your hair takes to natural colorants. Save a few trimmings of hair the next time you get your hair cut, or snip a lock of hair near the back of your neck. Apply the colorant you want to use to the strand using the instructions for the method you’ve chosen.After applying the colorant, rinse the lock completely and allow it to dry in direct sunlight, if you can.
Check the final results under bright natural lighting. If necessary, adjust the ingredient or processing time for your own hair – more or less, depending on the shade you desire.

, Because natural hair colorants are typically messier than conventional hair dye, you will want to think about the best place to color your hair beforehand. Cassia obovata is not staining unless there is something added to it, like rhubarb. Henna, however, is both difficult to apply and very staining. If the weather is nice, you may want to bring one to two large mirrors and dye your hair outside.
If you’re dyeing your hair in the bathroom, you may want to do so inside of a bathtub or shower.

, When hair turns gray, not only the pigment changes. The cuticles are also thinned, making the strands of hair coarser and more prone to breakage.You can restore moisture to your hair with a natural product: egg, honey and olive oil, or coconut oil.


Cassia obovata, henna, lemon and tea can be drying to your hair, so especially consider doing a natural conditioning treatment afterwards.
Mix a whole egg and apply it to clean, damp hair once a month. Leave the mixture in for twenty minutes, then rinse it out with cool water.Massage 1/2 cup of honey and one to two tablespoons of olive oil into damp, clean hair. Allow the mixture to sit in your hair for twenty minutes, then rinse it out with warm water.Coconut oil is in a solid state at room temperature, so warm it in your hands or a microwave (if the latter, make sure it is warm and not too hot before applying). Work a couple of teaspoons of it into damp hair and wrap your hair in an old towel (coconut oil can stain fabric). Let it sit for one to two hours, then fully rinse it out and shampoo your hair."

Apply the paste to your hair.,
Cover your hair and let the paste soak in.,
Rinse out the paste thoroughly.,
Follow with indigo paste to get black hair.",How to Cover Gray Hair Naturally2," For a blonde shade, use cassia powder with water or citrus juice. For strawberry blonde, add henna. Use pure cassia powder for blonde, or 80% cassia powder and 20% henna powder for strawberry blonde. Use water to transform the powder into a paste, or if you want an extra lightening effect, orange or lemon juice. Add liquid to the powder a little at a time until its consistency is similar to yogurt. Put the mixture in the refrigerator and let it sit for twelve hours.Use cassia obovata for blonde or gray hair. If you have gray hairs but the rest of your hair is darker than blonde, cassia obovata alone will only brighten and condition your darker hair, not lighten it to blonde.
Use one box (100 grams) of cassia powder for short hair.
Use two to three boxes (200-300 grams) of cassia powder for shoulder-length hair.
Use four to five boxes (400-500 grams) of cassia powder for long hair.

, Mix into henna powder three teaspoons of amla powder, one teaspoon of coffee powder, and a little bit of curd. Stir the ingredients well.Slowly add one to two cups of hot water (not boiling) to the henna paste in a bowl until the paste is thick, not runny. Mix the contents. Close the bowl with a lid or tight plastic wrap. Let it sit for twelve hours to twenty-four hours, unrefrigerated.Amla (Indian gooseberry) is nondrying and adds coolness to the red so that it is not quite so bright. You can omit the amla if you want a very vibrant orange-red. Amla volumizes hair as well as enhances texture and curls.Use 100 grams of henna powder for hair up to medium length, or 200 grams of henna for long hair.
Henna can be drying, so you may want to add a conditioner to the paste the next morning, such as two to three tablespoons of olive oil and 1/5 cup moisturizing conditioner.

, Once henna paste has sat for twelve to twenty-four hours, mix in indigo powder well. If the paste is not the consistency of thick yogurt, add warm water little by little until you achieve the right texture. Let the paste sit for fifteen minutes.


If you have short hair, use one box (100 grams) of indigo.
If you have shoulder-length hair, use two to three boxes (200-300 grams) of indigo.
If you have long hair, use four to five boxes (400 to 500 grams) of indigo.

, Put gloves on. Section your hair and apply the paste to damp or dry hair with your gloved hands, a pastry brush, or a coloring brush from a beauty supply store. Make sure that you cover all of your hair to the roots. You may find it handy to clip sections of hair back once you’ve finished coating them.


Henna paste is thick, so don’t try to rake it through your hair.
Apply the paste to the roots of your hair first, since that is typically where the most hue and processing time is needed., If you have long hair, you may want to pull it up first into a clip. Use plastic wrap or a shower cap to protect the dye.For red hair, leave the paste on for about four hours.
For brown or black hair, leave the paste in your hair for one to six hours.

, Wear gloves when you’re rinsing out the dye, or it will stain your hands.Use a mild shampoo to wash your hair.You can use moisturizing conditioner afterwards if desired.For red hair, you can dry and style as usual. For black hair, you’ll follow this with indigo dye.

Let the paste sit for fifteen minutes.Apply the paste to damp or dry hair. Wear gloves. Put the paste on in sections, starting at the back of your head and moving forward. Coat the hair thoroughly to the roots.For short hair, use one box (100 grams) of indigo. For shoulder-length hair, use two to three boxes (200-300 grams) of indigo. For long hair, use four to five boxes (400 to 500 grams) of indigo.
Once your hair is saturated with the paste, use a clip or hair pin to put your hair up. Wrap plastic wrap or a shower cap over your head. Let the paste sit in your hair for one to two hours.After one to two hours of processing time, rinse the paste completely out. You can use conditioner if desired. Dry and style your hair as usual.

Ask your friends for their opinion.,
See how you look with blonde hair by using photoshop.",How to Decide if Blonde Hair Is Right for You1," Blonde hair comes with a more sensitive upkeep. For example, with blonde hair, you can't jump right into a pool. Blonde hair absorbs chlorine and other chemicals that will give it a green appearance after swimming. Also, blonde hair that is washed in a shower where the water is high in copper or iron will eventually start to look orangy-red or green. In regards to washing blond hair, it is advised to shampoo your hair every three days to keep it looking healthy and toned correctly.


If you absolutely have to wash your hair everyday, going blonde might be tricky for you.;
, Blondes are said to have more fun, but being blonde can also welcome unwanted attention and insult. If you do make the transition to blonde hair, make sure you have tough skin for possibly offensive blonde jokes. While these joke usually mean no harm, they can come off as rude and distasteful. In addition to negative attention, blonde hair can also be attention drawing in positive ways, so either way, be ready for more eyes to be on you.

, If you are unsure about undergoing a major hair transition, your friends and family are great people to turn to for input. Tell them you are thinking about going blonde and gauge their reactions. If they are all for it and seem excited, that may be your indicator to go for it. If they express reservations about your idea, find out why.


Take their opinions and tips into consideration, but regardless of what they may say, make sure you do what makes you happy.

Figure out what your skin tone is.,
Choose a flattering blonde for you.,
Look at your natural hair color for guidance.,
Factor in how fair or dark your skin color is.,
Try highlights instead of all over color.",How to Decide if Blonde Hair Is Right for You2," This is one of the best ways to find a complimentary shade of blonde for you. If you try going blonde with the wrong shade, it could wash you out. Regardless of how light or dark your skin is, your skin tone can fall into either of the two main skin tone categories. Most people are either warm toned or cool toned, with very few people falling somewhere in the middle. Here are the best indicators for which skin tone you have:Cool skin tones usually burn in the sun and range anywhere from porcelain, rosy-beige, pink, olive, brown or ebony skin. The veins in your wrist will look bluish-purple and you will have a blue or pink undertone in your skin.Warm skin tones tan more easily in the sun and range anywhere from golden, peach, pale, or yellow skin. The veins in your wrist will look more bluish-green and you will have an olive undertone in your skin.Neutral skin tones are somewhere in the middle between cool and warm and may show characteristics from both sides. You will be able to choose almost any blonde shade if you have neutral skin so feel free to play around and see what works best for you., There are so many shades of blonde to pick from, and once you identify your skin tone, you can begin choosing.


For cool skin tones, choose a blonde that has an ash or green base to better compliment your skin. An example may be vanilla or dishwater blonde. Stay away from brassy shades because they may look harsh and wash you out.If you have warm skin, you want to look for blondes with red or golden bases. An example may be golden, caramel or rose gold blonde., If your natural hair color is more ashy or rich chestnut brown with no red, you should look for cool blonde colors. If your natural hair color reflects warm tones such as red or gold, then you may want to look for warm blonde colors. Keeping your natural hair color in mind will help your new blonde hair look more ""natural"".


For help seeing the undertones in your natural hair, try looking at your hair in the sunlight.

, You will have better color results if you pick a color that allows a deeper contrast between your skin and hair. The trick in choosing the right shade of blonde is to find an option that offers contrasts but still compliments your skin.Avoid picking a color that matches your skin tone too closely.

, Highlights are a great way to lighten your face. With highlights you get the same effect as being blonde but without all of the damage. Another great thing about highlights is that there is less upkeep. When your roots grow out, it will be less noticeable and will require less trips to the saloon. You can choose to have skinny or chunky highlights or decided if they will be all over, or framed near the front of your face.


Highlights offer a more ""natural"" looking appearance than all over blonde colors.
Highlights can add depth and texture to your hair which is especially great if you have hair on the thin side."

Determine the hair color maintenance level you are comfortable with.,
Have a professional bleach and tone your hair.,
Touch up your roots and hair tone regularly.,
Factor in the time it will take to become blonde.,
Plan for the financial cost.,
Research quality hair products.",How to Decide if Blonde Hair Is Right for You3," Blonde hair needs more attention than other hair colors. Keep in mind that transitioning more than two shades lighter or darker will require a stronger effort to maintain. When your roots begin to grow out, you will need to use the same professional process to do a touch up. If high maintenance is an issue, err on the side of caution when deciding to go blonde or not.

, Do not attempt to bleach or tone your hair at home. Bleach is an extremely harsh chemical that strips your hair follicles. You will need to pay a saloon professional to transition you to blonde and for all of the maintenance visits.

If you are going to a saloon for touch-ups, which is highly recommend, this endeavor becomes pretty pricey. Consider the long term expenses and be sure you have not only the time for saloon visits, but also the money it will take to maintain your blonde hair., Going all blonde at once is not recommended. It is natural to become excited about having an all blonde look, but it is important you work your way up to an all over color. Depending on how dark or damaged your current hair is, your saloon professional is going to want to gradually lighten your hair using blonde highlights and then slowly build on them over time. This prevents your hair from going into shock and breaking off.


Most stylists will deny a full coverage bleach job because they know how damaging it is to your hair.
Your stylist is going to ask you about past color treatments and process jobs. It is important for them to know how damaged your hair follicles are and what your hair is capable of enduring, so be honest.

, It is going to take multiple trips to the saloon before you walk out with one beautiful shade of blonde, and that is going to cost money. It would be helpful to plan out the financial costs so you can be prepared for the expenses.


You can try calling saloons to ask for their prices, but most of the time, in order to give you an accurate price, a saloon professional will need to see and examine your hair to figure out the right treatment plan for you.
Once you discuss what you want and the best way to get there, your stylist can have a better idea about how much going blonde is going to cost you financially.

, The chemicals that develop beautiful blonde colors also take a toll on your hair follicles. In order to replenish essential vitamins, minerals, and moisture back into your hair, you have to use quality products. This includes shampoo, conditioner, deep conditioning treatments, heat protectants, and after showering moisturizers.

Seal your design with hairspray.",How to Create Stencil Patterned Hair," Imagine you were trying to stencil something onto a piece of paper. Would you want a flat sheet, or crumpled sheet? The same concept applies to your hair. You want to have sleek, straight hair as your canvas, because you will be able to hold the stencil flat against it while creating your design.


If you don’t have natural straight hair, you can use a hair dryer or flat iron to straighten it.
If you have very short hair, like a buzz cut, that also works perfectly too.;
, If you decide to leave it down, you will need to style it in a way that there is very little movement. Sleek bobs work well, as well as long, straight hair that can lie flat on your back or in front of your shoulders.The reason this works best is because the hair will stay in the position it was in when the stenciling was done.


If you create a beautiful design on straight hair over one shoulder, it will be ruined if you throw your hair over your back.

, If you decide to put your hair up for this style, make sure that the pulled back hair is sleek and smooth. The stenciling will be going against your head on this pulled back hair. The advantage is that you know this hair will not budge, and your stencil creation will stay intact.Ponytails and buns work great for this style.

, Once your hair is styled how you want, add some hold with your favorite hairspray. This will help to achieve that really smooth surface that will make the stencil designs look great. When it comes to stencil patterned hair, sleek is the name of the game.







, You can find regular plastic or rubber stencils at a craft store. Rubber stencils are ideal because you can press them to your hair, but either can work. Consider the different sizes and decide which ones will fit best on your hairstyle. Simple things like flowers, stars, hearts, and polka dots work well for this.If you have a very specific design in mind, you can try your hand at creating your own stencil.

, The easiest way to do this is by using the temporary colored hairspray that you can find in party supply stores, costume shops, and some beauty supply stores. If you have trouble finding them there, you can find plenty of colors online. You can stick with one color, or you can use a handful of colors to make your hair art really pop., Try holding the stencils where you want the design. You may realize that it’s impossible to hold the stencil with a sturdy hand while also spraying the hairspray. It’s extremely helpful to enlist a friend to help you out.They can help make sure the stencil is flat and exactly where you want it. They can also help do the back sections, if you’re doing them.









If you’re only doing a few stencils near the front, you may not need any help at all.
Give your hairsprays a few test sprays as well, so you know how close or far away from your hair you should be holding it to fit the spray inside the stencil design.

, Once you’ve decided where the designs will go, get to it! Hold the stencil as flat as possible, so that the paint will not bleed out from the intended area.Carefully spray the hairspray so that it goes within the stencil design and not outside the stencil.








, With hair stenciling, you can create amazing, colorful designs, and you aren’t limited to one color per design. For example, you can use pink spray on half a design, and fill in the other half of the stencil with yellow spray. You can even layer colors to create a tie-dye effect. Get creative!








You can always practice techniques on a sheet of paper before trying them on your hair.

, Once you’re satisfied with the hair stenciling you’ve done, add a bit of hairspray. This will do two things. It will help seal the colored hairspray to your tresses, and it’ll also add a bit of extra hold to really ensure that your canvas doesn’t move.

Limit the heat styling.",How to Dip Dye Dark Hair," Cover your counter with newspaper. Wrap a dyeing cape or an old towel around your shoulders and put on a pair of plastic gloves. Lastly, make sure that you have all of your supplies laid out and ready to go., Purchase a bleaching or highlighting kit from the store and prepare the bleach according to the instructions. Each brand will be a little different. In most cases, however, you will have to mix some sort of powder into a cream.The type of bleach you choose depends on how dark your hair is to begin with and how much lighter you need it to go.

, Use a rat-tail comb to divide your hair in half horizontally so that you have a top and bottom section. Clip the top section out of the way, then split the bottom section into two pigtails., Gather a 2-inch (5.08-centimeter) section of hair. Apply the bleach to it using a tinting brush. How far you apply the bleach is up to you. Most people choose to only do the bottom half of their hair, but you can go higher or lower if you want., This will not only keep your dyeing cape/towel clean, but also prevent the bleach from getting onto the rest of your hair., Once you have finished the entire bottom row, let down another layer of hair from the top section and bleach it as well. Keep going until you are done. Remember to wrap each section with foil or plastic wrap as you finish it.

, How long you wait depends on the type of bleach you used, so be sure to follow the instructions closely. Double-check your hair while it is processing. The times on the kits are only recommendations, and your hair may process faster! Do not over-process your hair, however; the longer you leave the bleach on, the more likely your hair is to be damaged. Be careful and don't lose track of time!If you want a warm tone, such as red, violet, or pink, lighten your hair until it is marigold-yellow.If you want a cool tone, such as blue or green, lighten your hair until it is pale yellow, like the inside of a banana peel., Make sure that you use one specially formulated for bleached, damaged, or color-treated hair. Your hair will look darker at this point, but only because it's wet., Sometimes, dark hair turns orange when it is bleached. This can affect the color your dip dye will turn out. Get some toning shampoo for blond or bleached hair. Mix it with some water, then apply it to your hair as a mask. Leave it on for a few hours, then wash it out with cool water.Toning shampoo has some blue or purple dye mixed into it. This will help neutralize any copper or brassy tones.

, Only do this if the instructions on your kit say it is safe to do so. Keep in mind that bleach is very harsh on hair, and that the more often you bleach your hair, the more damaged it will become., If you already have the cape and gloves on from before, wipe them clean so that there's no bleach left. It might be a good idea to put on a fresh pair of gloves for this. Next, mix your dye and developer in a mixing bowl. Lastly, put on a dyeing cape.

If you don't have a dyeing cape, drape an old towel around your shoulders instead.
Some dyes already come with the developer already mixed into them (ie: Manic Panic). They are ready to go!

, Use the handle of a rat-tail comb to divide your hair in half horizontally. Clip the top section out of the way, then divide the bottom section into two ponytails. If your hair is very thick, you may need to create more horizontal sections and ponytails., Work the dye into your hair well, making sure to saturate it. Start from the ends first, then work your way up to the middle, where the bleached part ends. This will help make the ends more vibrant., Rinse the dye off of your gloves, then pat them dry with a towel. Grab your ponytail where the dyed part ends. Twist your hair into a tight rope.You can also switch to a new pair of gloves.

, This will help soften the transition and blend the color into your natural color better. The fade won't be as fine as an ombre, but it won't be as stark either., Wrap a piece of aluminum foil around your finished ponytail. Repeat the dyeing process on the other ponytail, and wrap that as well. Un-clip the top part of your hair, split it into two ponytails, and do the dyeing process all over again.You can also use a piece of plastic wrap instead.
Make sure that you apply the dye up to the same level on each ponytail.

, The longer you wait, the deeper the color will be. For a very strong color, wait up to 45 minutes. For something more subtle, wait about 10 to 15 minutes instead.If your dye has specific processing instructions, follow those instead.

, Do not use any shampoo, or it will take the color out. Instead, apply some conditioner to your hair, after you have rinsed all the color out. Let it sit for a few minutes, then wash it out as well.

, When you do wash your hair, use cool water instead of how. This is especially important if you have never bleached or dyed your hair before., Make sure that you use products specially formulated for colored hair. Not only will they keep the color bright and prevent it from fading, but they will also have hydrate and nourish your hair., Dyed hair is often brittle and dry, so you will need to add moisture back into it. The best way to do this is with a hair mask.After you finish shampooing and rinsing your hair, skip the conditioner and apply the mask instead. Let it sit for 3 to 5 minutes, then rinse it out.


You can also apply raw coconut oil to your hair instead., Heat styling is damaging enough as it is. Combined with harsh bleaching and dyeing, it can ruin your hair even further. If you do decide to heat style your hair, apply a heat protectant first and use a lower temperature, if possible.

, You can also use a plastic bag with a rubber band to hold it in place. Keep it on for at least one hour and thirty minutes. The longer you leave it in, the darker your hair will become.

, Do not shampoo your hair. Simply rinse the coffee off with water. If you didn't add in the olive or coconut oil, you can use a conditioner in your hair after you rinse out the coffee.

With each application of bleach, your hair is lifted three or four shades lighter. If your roots were very dark to begin with and the rest of your hair is very light, you may need to apply bleach for a second time in order to get it light enough.Many websites mistakenly suggest first toning orange hair. Toner will only work for hair that is already the desired lightness, but simply has hints of orange or yellow. It will not fix dark orange hair.;
, After the bleach has been on your roots for the time specified on the packaging, rinse your hair thoroughly. After a second round of bleach, your hair may still be orange, but it should be lighter. If you’re satisfied with the lightness of your roots, you can move on to the next step.


If your roots are now a yellow color and the rest of your hair is light blonde, you should be all done bleaching. If your roots are still slightly orange and the rest of your hair is a darker blonde, you’re all set. The trick is to bleach your hair to light yellows in order to achieve light blondes, and darker yellows and oranges are great bases for dark blondes.

, You can find toner at beauty supply stores. If you aren’t sure which toner you need, you can always ask someone who works there. As stated before, a toner will not magically turn your hair from dark orange to a platinum blonde, because it will not lighten your hair at all. It will, however, remove the orange or yellow notes from hair while keeping it at the same lightness level., Once you’ve bleached your roots and they’re the right lightness, you’re ready to apply a demi or semi-permanent dye. In other words, your roots may still be orange, but another application of bleach would make them much lighter than the rest of your hair.Buy a hair dye that is lighter than your hair. For example, if your hair is a dark blonde and you don’t want it any darker, buy a shade of hair dye in a platinum blonde. Because the hair dye will layer over your dark blonde, applying a matching shade of dark blonde hair dye will darken it up. A lighter shade of blonde will keep your hair light and bright, but help mask the orange.

, Make sure that you evenly coat your roots so that all orange and yellow sections are saturated. Because the demi-permanent color doesn’t have bleach, it’s not a big deal if it touches the rest of your hair, but try to keep it only on your roots.Leave on for the amount of time specified on the package.


Check your roots before rinsing¬– if you can still see hints of orange or yellow, you can keep the dye on for a bit longer.

, The bleach should have gotten your orange roots down to the desired lightness, the toner should have removed some of the brassiness, and the demi-permanent hair color should have masked any remaining bits of orange. It can be really hard to bleach your hair on your own, so this process may take some practice. With a little bit of experimentation, you won’t even break a sweat at the sight of bright orange roots.

Lighten or bleach your hair, if needed.,
Protect your work space.,
Put on a set of old clothes and plastic or vinyl gloves.,
Squeeze white conditioner into a plastic bowl or container.,
Add some food coloring.,
Adjust the dye color to neutralize yellow or brassy tones, if needed.,
Divide your hair into sections.,
Apply the dye to your hair, starting from the roots.,
Tuck your hair under a shower cap.,
Leave the product in your hair for 30 minutes to 3 hours.,
Consider doing a strand rinse test.,
Wash the dye out with cool water.,
Blow-dry your hair on a low setting.,
Take care of your dyed hair.",How to Color Hair With Food Coloring," Food coloring is translucent. This means that it only adds to whatever color is already there. If you have dark hair, the dye may not show up at all. If you have light brown or brown hair, the dye will turn out darker. If having a darker tint does not bother you, then you can skip this step.

Be aware that blue may turn out greenish on blond hair, and brownish on brassy hair. If this bothers you, tone your hair to a more neutral color.;
, Find a place that is easy to clean, such as a kitchen or bathroom. If the area is carpeted or hard to clean, spread some newspaper or a large, plastic sheet over the floor. Have all of your supplies laid out and ready.

, If you don't have any old clothes that you don't mind ruining, put on a dark colored shirt instead. It would also be a good idea to wrap a hair dyeing smock or an old towel around your shoulders.

, You will need enough conditioner to cover your hair, at least 2 tablespoons (30 milliliters). Avoid using colored conditioner, as it might affect the color of the dye. You can try a white-colored hair cream or gel.

For a permanent option, use 2 tablespoons (30 milliliters) of developer instead., How much you use depends on how dark you want the color to be; the more food coloring you use, the deeper the color will be. Keep in mind that the color will turn out lighter than what's in the bowl. Be sure to use regular liquid or gel food coloring; do not use vegetable-based dyes as they won't adhere to your hair.For a permanent option, mix 1 tablespoon of food coloring into the developer., If you lightened your hair earlier, you may be left with yellow or brassy tones. This may affect the outcome of your dye job. If you have yellow or brassy tints in your hair, add some purple or blue to your dye to make it cooler.You can also mix up a separate pale blue (for brassy tints) or pale purple (for yellow tints) dye, and use that in your hair first. After you wash and dry your hair, you can dye it the color you want.

, Plan on having at least four sections. This will make dyeing your hair easier. If you plan on dyeing your hair multiple colors, then divide your hair into sections based on the colors that you want to dye., You can do this with your hands, an old toothbrush, or even a special brushed used for applying hair dye.Be sure to work the dye into your hair. Don't let the dye create suds, as this can dilute the dye and make it less effective.


If you want highlights, apply the dye to thin sections of hair. Wrap each section with plastic wrap to keep it separate. Don't dye all of your hair.
Another way to add highlights would be to poke holes into a shower cap, put the shower cap on, the pull strands of hair through the holes.

, If you need to, twist your hair into a bun, then secure it with a claw clip. Leave it there for up to 2 hours.If you don't have a shower cap, try plastic wrap or a plastic bag. Secure it with plastic hair clips.

, The longer you leave the dye in your hair, the deeper the color will become. Keep in mind that the lighter your hair is, the faster the color will set.If you are using a developer for a more permanent option, let it sit for about 40 minutes.The longer you leave the dye in your hair, the deeper it will be. If you want a lighter color, leave it on for a shorter period of time.

, This is only really necessary if you are going for a specific shade, or if this is your first time dyeing your hair with food coloring. Take a strand of hair from an inconspicuous area, and rinse it. If the color is too light, leave the dye on longer. If it just right, move on to the next step., You can do this over the sink or in the shower. Don't use shampoo and conditioner, however, or it will remove the color. If you dyed your hair multiple colors, keep the dyed sections separate.

, You can also towel dry your hair then let it air dry. Make sure that you use an old towel, however, as some of the dye may rub off.

, If you used conditioner, avoid washing your hair for 3 to 5 days. This will help the color set.It would also be a good idea to sleep on colored (preferably dark) pillow cases to avoid staining.

Temporary dye jobs will start to fade with each wash. They should last about 2 weeks total, depending on the color and your hair type.Some dye jobs may come out after only 2 to 3 washes.#* Permanent dye jobs will last about 3 weeks before they start to fade."

Use cool-toned brightening shampoo.Brightening shampoos formulated specifically for blonde dye will usually work best, but those meant to correct silver tones can also work in many cases.,
Moisturize with a brightening conditioner.,
Shield your hair with a heat protecting product.,
Dry using lower temperatures.,
Consider enriching your hair with a neutralizing gloss.",How to Correct Poorly Dyed Blonde Hair1," Either way, look for a brightening shampoo with a cool blue or purple hue to help balance out the warm brassy tones in your blonde.In a pinch, blue or purple anti-dandruff shampoo may also help balance out some of the brassiness, but a brightening shampoo intended specifically for this purpose will probably be more effective.
Apply the shampoo according to label instructions. Usually, you’ll need to apply it like you would apply any normal shampoo: massage a dime-sized or nickel-sized amount into your scalp and hair, then rinse with warm water.;
, While following your shampooing with a normal conditioner will protect your hair from damage, following up with a brightening conditioner will both nourish your hair and further your color-correcting efforts. When possible, try to use a conditioner that matches the brand and product line of your brightening shampoo.


Like your shampoo, your conditioner should also be a cool-hued blue or purple to help balance out the warm brassy shades in your hair.Label instructions may vary, but typically, you’ll need to apply the conditioner after shampooing and leave it in for about three minutes prior to rinsing. Most brightening conditioners should not be left in the hair without rinsing.

, Before drying your hair, mist a heat protecting spray or work a heat protecting serum into your locks. Heat damage can worsen the brassiness of blonde hair, but a heat protecting product can help shield your hair from the additional damage., This is another important way to protect your brassy-blonde hair from heat. When using your hair dryer, make sure that it’s set on the “low” setting instead of “high.” It’s also a good idea to leave it partially damp instead of drying it completely.You should also avoid the use of flat irons and curling irons as much as possible, at least until your hair returns to the proper shade. If you notice brassiness returning after using heat styling tools, it might be better to omit them from your routine completely.

, A neutralizing gloss is a hair treatment that revitalizes dyed hair, giving it a glossy sheen. Selecting a neutralizing gloss will tint your hair with a color that balances out brassy tones, leaving you with “pure” blonde hair.You can apply a brass-breaking foaming gloss at home. It's important to select a formula designed to remove yellow/orange tones from your hair, however, since basic formulas only add shine without correcting color. Apply the gloss to your hair after washing and rinse it out after three to five minutes; repeat one to three times a week until the problem is fixed.Check the label instructions when using a home gloss treatment. Some should be applied after shampooing but before conditioning, while others should be applied after both shampooing and conditioning.

Use clarifying shampoo.,
Rinse with cool water.,
Pat your hair dry.,
Untangle your tresses with a boar-bristle brush.",How to Correct Poorly Dyed Blonde Hair2," Blonde dyed hair is usually the result of product buildup. If your hair color looks dull, try washing it with an anti-residue shampoo to remove that buildup.Alternatively, you might consider an apple cider vinegar rinse instead of a clarifying shampoo. Mix one part apple cider vinegar with five parts water. Spray this solution directly onto your scalp, then lather it in with your fingertips until it feels fizzy. Rinse it out with cool water and skip the shampoo afterward.Regardless of whether you use clarifying shampoo or apple cider vinegar, you should follow the wash with a light conditioner to maintain a healthy amount of moisture.

, Exposure to the elements can also make your hair color look dull. One way to combat this effect is by doing a final rinse with cool to cold water after washing and conditioning your hair like normal.The cool water closes the hair follicle, which forces it to lie flat. As a result, your hair should look glossier and more uniform.

, After washing your hair, gently pat it dry using a soft towel. Never rub or pull the strands since doing so could cause damage, making your hair color look dull and lifeless.Try to let your hair air dry as much as possible, then touch it up using the cool heat setting of your hair dryer. Avoid high heats that may damage your hair and make the color dull. For this reason, it's also best to avoid heat styling tools like flat irons and curling irons.

, Boar-bristle brushes are great at distributing natural, healthy oils through your hair. Hydrating your hair with your scalp's natural oils should keep the follicles and strands plump, making the color look brighter and shinier as a result."

Use a chlorine removal shampoo.,
Alternatively, wash with ketchup.,
Follow up with conditioner.",How to Correct Poorly Dyed Blonde Hair3," Chlorine in either pool or bath water can cause blonde dye to turn green, so using a chlorine removal shampoo should restore your hair back to the intended blonde hue.Look for chlorine removal shampoos containing thiosulfate.Apply the shampoo as you would apply any other shampoo when washing your hair.
If you don't have chlorine removal shampoo, try rinsing your hair with club soda, tomato juice, or lemon juice after exposing it to chlorine-heavy water. These natural remedies may remove most of the green tint., If you don't have access to a chlorine removal shampoo, or if your blonde hair turned green due to sun exposure rather than chlorine exposure, try applying ketchup to your hair. The red in the tomatoes can actually neutralize the green tint.Additionally, the acid in the tomatoes can strip away minerals responsible for the adverse reaction.
When working with ketchup, massage 2 to 4 Tbsp (30 to 60 ml) into your hair using your fingertips, then rinse it out with cool water after 20 or 30 minutes.You should then be able to shampoo your hair like usual.

, Regardless of whether you use chlorine removal shampoo or ketchup, you need to follow your shampoo ritual with a moisturizing conditioner. Hair dye, clarifying shampoos, and acidic tomatoes can all strip your hair of its natural, necessary oils. Applying a conditioner can help restore the moisture that would otherwise be lost.


The exact conditioner needed may vary by hair type and damage. If your hair is otherwise healthy, any standard conditioner should probably be fine. If it feels dry or brittle, however, a leave-in conditioner would be better.

"
"
Go to the salon to treat major damage.,
Skip the shampoo for one week.,
Opt for gentle shampoos afterward.,
Use leave-in conditioner.,
Apply an olive oil or coconut oil mask once a week.,
Skip the heat.",How to Correct Poorly Dyed Blonde Hair4," Hair that feels severely dry and brittle should be handled by a professional, since treating it at home can often cause even more damage. Bleach strips the hair of natural pigment, and when too much pigment is lost, professional treatments are required to restore it back to health.If you do get a professional treatment, you'll need to follow up at home by applying hydrating conditioners during each wash and deep conditioning masks at least once a week. You should also avoid dyeing your hair again for several weeks or months, depending on the severity of the damage.If you're satisfied with the color of your bleached blonde hair but just need to add a little moisture back in, you might consider home treatment. Going to a salon will still minimize the risk of further damage, but as long as your hair isn't breaking apart every time you handle it, you can probably restore it to health without altering the color at home.

, If you choose to fix brittle bleached hair at home, you need to stay away from shampoo for at least one week. You can still shower every two or three days during that week, but only apply conditioner during this initial period.Bleach strips away pigment and oil, leaving your hair raw and weakened. Shampoos also strip away oil, but does so to a lesser degree. While the amount of oil stripped away by shampoo is usually healthy for your hair, hair weakened by bleach needs time to recover and restore a healthy balance of natural oils, and constantly removing those oils with shampoo will prevent that from happening.If your scalp feels too oily during this first week, switch to a cleansing conditioner but still skip the shampoo. A cleansing conditioner will be a much gentler way to clean the skin of your scalp without removing healthy oils from your hair., After the first week passes, you can probably return to shampooing your hair. Select a gentle moisturizing or color-preserving formula, though, and stay away from harsher clarifying shampoos. You should also skip one or two days in between washings to avoid stripping away too much.


It’s also a good idea to use warm water instead of hot water when shampooing. Hot water will dry your hair out faster, worsening the damage caused by bleach. Try to make your showers shorter, too, to limit the amount of time your hair is exposed to the water.

, When you begin shampooing again, put away the clarifying conditioner and switch to an ultra-hydrating leave-in conditioner. Your hair is still dry and damaged at this point, so you need to use a product that will add moisture back into your hair to restore it to health.After washing your hair with shampoo and rinsing it out, apply the leave-in conditioner according to label instructions. This may mean massaging a dime-sized amount of conditioner into your hair or spritzing your entire head of hair with conditioner in spray form. Either way, it’s important to leave the conditioner in your hair without rinsing it out.

, A natural oil mask can be a great way to restore additional moisture to your hair. Apply the oil mask before shampooing your hair, leave it in for 30 to 60 minutes, then wash your hair with a gentle shampoo and skip the leave-in conditioner. Do this about once a week until your hair feels and looks healthy again.You'll need anywhere from 2 to 4 Tbsp (30 to 60 ml) of oil, depending on the length of your hair. Stick with either olive oil or coconut oil since other oils may not hydrate your hair quite as well.
Focus on applying the oil to your hair while avoiding the scalp. Your scalp should already be producing oil at this point, and applying additional oil to the scalp can make your roots feel grimy even though the rest of your hair could still be dry.If you're not interested in natural hair masks, you should still consider a commercial hair mask once per week for correcting bleach damage. Apply the commercial mask according to label instructions.

, If possible, allow your hair to air dry instead of using a hair dryer. Heat will dry your hair out further, making the damage worse. If you cannot skip the hair dryer completely, let your hair air dry mostly, then touch it up by drying the remaining moisture with the cool heat setting of your dryer.Consider misting your hair with a heat protecting spray before drying it.
Even if you blow dry your hair, it's vital that you completely skip the flat iron and curling iron while restoring the health of bleached hair.

Evaluate your true hair color.,
Determine your target shade.,
Take your color for a test drive.,
Set aside time for the coloring process.",How to Color Hair Naturally1," The natural pigment that gives your hair its base color will influence how easy or hard it is for you to naturally color your hair. Generally, it is easier to go from light to dark than the other way around. This being the case, if you have very dark hair, you might not be able to significantly change it without strong dyes or the use of chemicals.;

If your veins look like they are green, then your undertone is warm.

, If you have trouble seeing your veins or just want to double check your results, try the paper test. Get several pieces of colored paper. You will need a piece of paper in yellow, red, white, green, silver and blue. One at a time, hold each piece of paper next to your face.If your skin looks better with the red and yellow sheets of paper, then you are more warm toned.
If your skin looks better with the white, green, silver, and blue sheets of paper, then you are more cool toned.

, Eye hair color and hair color go hand in hand, so it is also important to consider your eye color before you decide on a hair color. If you are unsure, talk to your hairstylist about what colors will compliment your eyes.


If you have brown or hazel eyes, darker shades of brown will look great on you. Try a chocolate brown or a rich espresso brown.If you have blue or grey eyes, hair colors with cooler tones like light gold or ash work well. Try a light golden blond or ash blond."

Consider a shade of brown.,
Consider a shade of red.,
Consider a shade of blond.,
Consider a shade of black.,
Keep your color type in mind as you consider shades.",How to Choose the Right Hair Colour3," Unlike red, blond, and black, there is a shade of brown to suit every skin type. Brown is great if you want a low-maintenance color. The upkeep for brown is minimal and the kits for brown hair color that can be bought over the counter are almost impossible to mess up. Brown is also great if your hair is damaged. Browns reflect well in light and minimizes breakages and tresses.If you have light skin, opt for a medium brown or brown with red tones. Steer clear of dark browns unless you have naturally dark brown hair. Otherwise the color might cause you to look too pale.
If you have medium skin, opt for a medium brown, like a caramel or auburn. Steer clear of neutral shades and blondish shades.
If you have dark skin, opt for dark shades of brown like an espresso. Steer clear of shades that are more than two shades lighter than your natural color.

, Red is a versatile colour and there's usually a shade to suit anyone. Keep in mind that certain shades of red will look better on you depending on your skin tone.If you have light skin opt, for a lighter red like a strawberry blond or copper red. Steer clear of darker shades of red like burgundy because they may wash you out.
If you have medium skin, choose a medium shade like medium copper or auburn. Steer clear of purple hues like eggplant because they may make your skin look yellowish.
If you have dark skin, go for a medium auburn or chestnut brown. Steer clear of ultra-red hues because they may make your skin look greenish.

, Maybe you want to lighten or brighten your blond hair or you are considering going blond for the first time. Blond hair is a great choice if you have a light or medium skin tone.Just keep in mind that if you are not a natural blond, maintaining your color will be expensive. You will need regular root touch-ups and toning products to make the color last longer without turning brassy.If you have light skin, opt for a light or golden blond. Steer clear of shades that are white, ash, or reddish because they may wash you out.
If you have medium skin, opt for a medium toned blond like a golden or beige. Steer clear of ashy or orangey blonds though because they may wash you out.
If you have dark skin, opt for darker shades of blond like caramel. Or you can just add some highlights. Steer clear of blonds that are white, platinum, or orange because they can make your hair look fake.

, Black hair is dramatic and beautiful. Dark and medium skin tones work best with black, but if you have light skin there are some lighter shades that may work for you. Keep in mind that black is very difficult to remove, so be sure that you really want black hair before you commit. If you have light skin, opt for a brownish shade of black or a dark brown. Steer clear of ultra-black shades because they can make you seem unnaturally pale and even make your skin look reddish.
If you have medium skin, opt for a dark brown or almost black. Steer clear of blacks that have red tones because it can make your skin appear yellowish.
If you have dark skin, opt for a dark, jet black. Steer clear of any blacks with blue tones because this can cause your skin to look greenish.

, Brown, red, blond, and black come in a wide variety of shades, so you will need to pick one that suits you. Remember to choose a shade that complements your coloring type.Choose a cool shade if your natural coloring is warm.

Choose the right formula.,
Find the right shade for you.,
Avoid washing your hair 24 to 48 hours before coloring it.,
Section your hair.,
Read the instructions carefully and prepare the dye.,
Apply the color to your hair.,
Wait the recommended amount of time.,
Rinse out the dye with lukewarm water.",How to Color Hair1," Boxed hair dyes have evolved in recent years and the traditional liquid formulas are no longer your only options. Now there are foam, mousse and crème formulas, too. If your goal is to cover grays, a crème formula is the best option. Mousse formulas are best for touch-ups and foam formulas are ideal for those who want all-over color, but don’t dye their hair often. The traditional liquid formulas work well for everyone.A mousse formula is a great option for someone with sensitive skin. It doesn’t drip as much as liquid formulas do.
If you have very thick and/or curly hair, opt for a liquid formula.;
, Use the hair color chart provided on the box of dye to determine what level and shade your current hair color is. Then choose a box of color that is within two levels of that – either two levels lighter or two levels darker. Anything more drastic is best left to a professional. Keep your skin tone in mind, as well, and choose a color that flatters it.


Cool skin tones look best in neutral shades.
Warm skin tones should choose tones like golden, honey and chestnut.
If you are a blonde or brunette with cool tones, choose an “ash” shade., Unwashed hair will have plenty of natural oils in it, and these oils can protect your scalp and roots from irritation.Even better, the dye will be able to penetrate the hair shaft better if it’s a little dirty. Unwashed hair is easier to work with when it comes to sectioning it before the actual dyeing takes place, as well., Properly sectioning your hair before you begin will help you get the most even coverage.Divide your hair into four even sections. Use a hair clip to pin up each of these sections.Keep several additional hair clips nearby, especially if you have very thick hair. You may need a little extra reinforcement once the dye is applied and your hair becomes heavier.









Unless your dye brand instructed otherwise, your hair should be dry when you dye it.

, Before you start mixing up the dye, go over the instructions. Every brand will have slightly different directions and processing times, so it’s important to review this information before you get started.Put on the provided gloves and follow the instructions for mixing and developing the dye.









Secure an old towel around your shoulders to protect your skin.
Apply a layer of petroleum jelly or coconut oil around your hairline to protect the dye from staining your face., Unclip one of the four sections of hair. Use an applicator brush to apply the dye to the first section. Paint the dye onto your hair and make sure you saturate it from root to tip. Use a hand mirror to help you see the roots at the back of your head. Once you’ve completed the first section, carefully clip the hair back into place.









Unclip the next section and repeat the same process. Continue in this manner until you’ve finished all four sections.Try to work quickly but make sure you're not leaving anything out.

, As soon as you’ve completed the application process, set a timer for the manufacturer’s recommended processing time.Keep a towel around your shoulders as you wait to protect your skin from drips. This is a good time to clean up and dispose of your dyeing materials. If you’ve dripped any dye on your counter or floor, clean it up now to prevent permanent staining.

, Keep rinsing until the water runs clear. Most boxed dyes will come with a tube of conditioner meant to be used after the rinse-out. Apply the conditioner generously to your hair from root to tip. Run a wide-toothed comb through your hair to ensure even distribution of the conditioner. Give the conditioner at least two minutes to really penetrate your hair, then rinse.









For future washings, make sure you use a color-safe shampoo and conditioner.

Choose your henna shade.,
Be aware of what henna cannot do.,
Protect your skin, clothing and work area.,
Section your hair.,
Read the instructions and mix up the henna paste.,
Apply the henna paste to clean, dry hair.,
Wrap your hair with plastic wrap or a plastic bag.,
Wait at least one hour and then rinse out the paste.",How to Color Hair2," Henna is an all-natural hair dye with none of the harsh chemicals that commercial dyes have. Since henna is natural, there isn’t a vast shade selection to choose from. Essentially, henna makes it possible to achieve various shades of red through very dark brown to black.Each brand’s line is different, but generally there is a dark brown option, an auburn option, a chestnut brown option and a near-black option.


Brunettes and dark blondes will get the best results from henna.
Do not use henna on your hair if you’ve used commercial hair dye in the last two months., Unfortunately, henna cannot lighten your hair or lift color. It can only add pigment. For instance, you can’t use henna to go from brunette to blonde. Henna also can’t even out your current hair color. If you currently have roots or two-toned highlights, these will still be visible after you color your hair with henna.


The henna will alter the color of these lighter sections, but overall the darkest hair will still be darker than the highlights., Henna is very messy and it will stain everything, including your skin. Wear an old t-shirt and keep several old towels nearby. Cover all work surfaces and the floor with newspaper. You must wear gloves or you will end up with stained hands and nails for several days.Apply Ultra balm or petroleum jelly around your hairline, on the back of your neck and around your ears to protect these areas from accidental staining., Sectioning your hair into manageable bunches will ensure that you get even coverage during the application process. Divide your hair into four or more sections. Use a hair clip to pin up each of these sections. Make sure the clip is secure. Keep several additional hair clips nearby, in case you need additional ones after you begin., Your product will come with instructions – read them carefully. If your henna is in block form, break it into chunks and put it into a bain-marie or heatproof bowl situated over a saucepan of hot water. For best results, you’ll need to keep the henna warm throughout the entire process.


Boil the recommended amount of water and pour it over the henna.
Stir the mixture. It will have the consistency of melted chocolate or mud. , Start with the sections at the back of your head and work your way toward the front. Release one section at a time and apply the paste to your hair. Start at your roots and work down to the tips.Be sure to saturate your hair completely with the paste.Clip the completed section back up and move on to the next section.


Continue until you’ve finished all of the sections.
Be sure to keep your henna paste hot throughout the process.

, A shower cap will work, too. Make sure all of your hair is covered securely with your chosen kind of wrap. For extra security, wrap a towel around everything, on top of the plastic. If you like, you can use a heated towel, since henna works best when kept warm., Try to make it up to two hours, if you can. Since henna is chemical-free, the processing time is going to be much longer than that of a commercial hair dye. One hour is usually the minimum. When you’re ready, rinse the paste out of your hair with lukewarm water.


If you’re having trouble getting it all out, use a very small amount of shampoo to help you complete the job.
Results should last four to six weeks. At that point, you may need to touch some areas up with a new application.

Try dyeing your hair with Kool-Aid.,
Use hair chalk.,
Buy a temporary spray-on hair color.,
Add color with washable markers.",How to Color Hair3," This is an extremely inexpensive method to try and, since it’s chemical-free, it’s also is safe for you and the environment. Depending on your current hair color and the shade of Kool-aid you choose, this color can last up to a couple of weeks.


The Kool-Aid powder is dissolved in water before applying.
The rest of the application process is very similar to that of commercial hair dye., You can buy hair chalk at most beauty supply stores and sometimes costume shops, as well. You can even buy high quality pastel chalk from an art supply store and use that. Chalk color will be temporary – it will probably only last one day. If you have light blonde hair, it may last a few days. This is a fun way to try out wild colors or see what streaks of color look like on you before dyeing your hair permanently.


Application is simple – saturate small sections of hair with water and then rub the chalk directly onto your hair.
Allow the chalk to dry in your hair and then style as usual., You can get spray on color at beauty supply stores. These products come in all kinds of bright colors. They are fun to experiment with, especially because they’re commitment-free. Spray-on color usually washes out after one or two shampoos. If you’re light blonde, it may last a few additional days.To apply, simply spray the product wherever you want to add color in your hair.You should protect your work area with newspaper or towels first., Washable markers offer a fast and easy way to temporarily dye your hair. There are different methods of application, with the easiest being coloring directly onto your hair with the marker ink. You can also create a liquid dye from the marker ink. Washable markers will be temporary and relatively commitment free.


The color from washable markers can last anywhere from one week to one month in your hair."

Think about your goals for hair coloring.,
Know that, as your hair loses pigment, you skin does as well.,
Talk to your hair stylist about your hair.,
Know that you can mix and match dyes.,
Consider dye combs for salt-and pepper hair.",How to Color Grey Hair1," Do you want a little salt and pepper, or do you want to color out the gray entirely? Light treatment is quick and lasts a longer, as you can keep a little gray around, but a full coloring will need to be reapplied every 4-6 weeks to prevent unsightly gray roots.;
, This is a natural part of aging. What it means for you, however, is that a complete switch to a bright, vibrant hair color will likely look odd and unnatural. Try to complement your skin with a color that is slightly lighter and duller than your natural hair color.


Highlights may be a way to keep some bright, youthful color in your hair without looking unnaturally shiny.

, They will have specific recommendations for products to use and colors to sample. Gray hair is coarser than young hair, which means it is more resistant to taking color than it once was. As such, you may need to get a specialty color for your hair, and your barber will have the best solutions for you.

, Often times the best color for you is not the one sold in stores. Try mixing and matching your ""natural"" (the one you had as a kid) color with a lighter shade, allowing you to have perfect mixture that fits your skin tone.


For example, you might try mixing a 6A light golden brown with a 6C.

, Companies make specific products that leave a little grey in and require minimal effort to apply. Oftentimes they come with small combs pre-loaded with dyes, and they have a variety of shades and colors. You can find them in the Beauty section of most pharmacies and big-box stores for men and women.

Bleach or lighten you hair first if you want a full coloring.,
Wash your hair to remove any chemicals and dirt.,
Comb the knots out of your hair.,
Separate long hair into sections.,
Apply the dye with a brush, as if you were painting.,
Treat your dyed hair according to the directions on the bottle.",How to Color Grey Hair2," If you are trying to get a consistent, even hair color, but you are currently salt and peppered, you likely need to lighten you hair first. This is especially important if you hair is dark in patches. Use a bleach or blonde hair dye first and let it set in before moving on to your desired color.


Know, however, that bleaching your hair causes damage. Although, you will not need to bleach it with every coloring.

, Use a gentle shampoo and rinse off your hair well. Check your specific dye to see if you should dry your hair as well -- some require damp hair to start.


Let your hair air dry if possible -- this prevents damage to the hair that could lead to a more difficult coloring.

, Make sure you hair is straight and free of tangles, as this will make it easier to apply the dye.

, Use a bobby pin or your comb to break your hair off into at least 3 small sections. This makes it easier to apply the dye evenly and consistently, and prevents you from missing any sections.

, Once you've mixed together your dye, use the brush to apply it to each section of hair. Go slowly, being sure to coat each bit of hair evenly. This is when the sections come in handy -- more sections ensures you get every bit evenly.


If you needed to use bleach or blonde dye before dying your hair, put it in and let it set for 5-10 minutes, then rinse it out and begin with your desired color.

, At the very least, buy shampoo and conditioner specifically formulated for ""Dyed or Treated Hair."" This ensures that your color is long lasting and your hair is healthy. Immediately after applying the dye, you will likely need to wait as it sets in, then rinse it out to see how it looks.

Cover hair with a shower cap, plastic wrap or a plastic grocery bag.,
Rinse with warm water.",How to Make an Olive Oil Hair Mask1," You'll need about a 1/2 cup of olive oil. Extra virgin olive oil is a little more expensive than other types, but it has a much nicer fragrance and more antioxidants and vitamins that will give your hair strength and shine.


To add pleasant fragrance and additional benefits, you can allow a sprig of dried rosemary or lavender to soak in the olive oil bottle several days prior to making your mask. These fragrances are excellent for relaxation.;
, Honey is a natural humectant (meaning it helps seal in moisture) and contains antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds. These properties make honey ideal for restoring dry and damaged hair and split ends. Raw honey has more of these properties than processed honey.Using a whisk, incorporate the olive oil.


Mason jars with resealable lids are great for this (and for storing any extra), but you can use any clean glass container.
If your mask becomes too sticky, dilute it by adding more olive oil and continuing to whisk.

, You can find liquid-filled Vitamin E capsules at most grocery stores and pharmacies. The additional Vitamin E will not only help repair damaged hair, it has anti-inflammatory properties that will soothe your scalp.Whisk mixture until the consistency is smooth and manageable. The mixture shouldn't be overly sticky.

, Concentrate on the ends, which tend to be the most dry and damaged. Make sure the mixture is distributed evenly throughout your hair.

, If you have long hair, you may want to twist your hair loosely on top of your head and secure with a clip before you wrap it. Wait for 90 minutes to allow the oil and honey mixture to fully permeate your hair.


The heat that gets trapped inside the plastic will help the olive oil and honey absorb into the hair.

, Rinse your hair thoroughly with warm, not hot, water. Your hair may feel stiff or sticky; continue rinsing until your hair feels loose and supple. Use a gentle shampoo to wash your hair and follow with conditioner.

Apply oil mixture to your hair.,
Wrap your hair.,
Leave in overnight.",How to Make an Olive Oil Hair Mask2," ""Extra virgin"" coconut oil is best, but any oil without added fragrances, flavorings, or colorings will do.Coconut oil is especially good for damaged hair because its fatty acid composition penetrates the hair shaft much more efficiently than most other oils.It's also an excellent treatment for dandruff and dry, itchy scalp and is a natural anti-fungal agent.


If you can afford it, raw organic coconut oil is the most effective oil to use on hair. Like raw honey, raw coconut oil may solidify in the jar; if so, microwave it for 10-20 seconds until liquified.Because this mask is so lightweight, it's perfect for fine or thin hair.

, Stir these oils together in a resealable glass jar. If you have short hair, 2 tablespoons of coconut oil and 1 tablespoon of olive oil should be plenty, but adjust the quantities as necessary according to your hair's length and thickness.

, Using your hands, massage the oil through your hair. Focus on the ends, as these tend to be the driest and most damaged. Comb through with a wide-tooth comb or your fingers.

, If you have long hair, put it in a ponytail or loose bun, then wrap with a shower cap, plastic wrap, or grocery bag.

, Leaving the coconut oil mixture in your hair overnight gives it plenty of time to penetrate even the most damaged hair shafts. In the morning, rinse out with warm water. Follow with a gentle shampoo and conditioner.

, Whisk vigorously until the mixture is fairly smooth. You may have some small lumps of banana remaining; that's all right. Just try to break down any large chunks.


You can also puree the banana and olive oil in a food processor or blender, if you have one. This technique will create a more thoroughly emulsified mixture.

, Raw organic honey is best for this, because it is highest in antioxidants, but any honey will work. Make sure the mixture is thoroughly combined.

Rinse thoroughly with warm water.",How to Make an Olive Oil Hair Mask4," Press near the stem tip; if the avocado gives slightly, it's ripe. Avocados are rich in vitamins A and E and monounsaturated fat, which will provide moisture and shine. The oils in avocado are very close to the natural oils in human skin and hair, which makes this mask ideal for dry or frizzy hair.Because of its very high levels of monounsaturated fatty acids, avocado is particularly good for natural hair, which can require extra moisturizing. This mask is also great for very thick, coarse, or curly hair. However, it may be too bulky for people with very fine or thin hair.

, Using a fork, mash the avocado into a paste in a medium bowl. A jar will not work as well for this mask because you have to have room to fully mash the avocado.

, Mix until thoroughly combined. The color should turn a light green and the texture should be as smooth as possible.


You can get a more thoroughly emulsified mask if you have a food processor, blender, or hand-mixer. Whip until smooth and airy.

, Focus on the ends, where damage is usually greatest. If you have oily roots, avoid putting the mask on them. You can use your fingers or a basting/paint brush to spread the mask onto your hair.

, If you have long hair, put it into a ponytail or loose bun, or secure with a clip before wrapping. Wrap your hair with plastic wrap, a shower cap, or a grocery bag.

Start by filling the bottle with 6 ounces (177 ml) of distilled or filtered water.

, Once you’ve added the water to the bottle, mix in 24 to 36 drops of avocado oil. Add more oil if you have thick, coarse hair and less oil if you have fine or thin hair.The ratio of oil to water for the spray is 4 to 6 drops for every ounce (30 ml) of water. You can adjust the recipe to make as much or as little of the protectant spray as you need.
You can substitute other oils for the avocado. Sunflower, argan, and macadamia nut oil are other options to consider.

Consider your skin's shade.,
Find your skin tone.,
Think about your skin's undertones.",How to Choose Hair Color for Skin Tone1," Broadly speaking, the shade of your skin is most likely pale, medium, olive, or dark/deep. This should be fairly obvious, but helpful in choosing a hair color. You won't want your hair color to exactly match your skin's shade and tone or your hair color will look washed out., Regardless of your skin's shade, you need to determine what your skin's undertone is: warm, cool, or neutral. Wear a white shirt and stand in front of the mirror. Stand in natural light or bright incandescent lights if possible. Look at the veins on the underside of your wrist to determine the undertone.


If the veins are predominantly blue-purple, you've got cool undertones. If they're mainly green, you've got warm undertones, and if they're a mix between the two, you have neutral undertones.

, If you're having trouble determining your skin's undertones, ask yourself a few simple questions. Do you look better in gold or silver? If gold, you've got warm undertones. If silver, you have cool undertones. What color are your eyes? If they're green, brown, or hazel, you've got warm undertones. If blue, grey, or green eyes, you've probably got cool undertones.One of the easiest ways to determine skin undertone is to consider how easily you burn. If you burn, rather than tan, you're cool, whereas if you tan easily, you're warm."
"
Balance any warm tones.,
Warm up any cool tones in your skin.,
Adjusting a golden tone.",How to Choose Hair Color for Skin Tone2," If you have a warm undertone, choose a hair color that has rich chestnut or cinnamon shades. This will help balance out any of the yellow or warm undertone in your skin.If your skin has red undertones and is a lighter shade, choose a medium to dark brown, black, or blue-black hair color.If your skin has warm red undertones, but is darker, choose a darker rich color and avoid lighter browns.

, If you have cool undertones, pick a hair color with some warm highlights to brighten your hair. You want a warmer shade to add some dimension to your hair, especially if it's already dark brown or black., If you have a warm golden undertone and lighter dark skin, you can really choose most any hair color, from light to dark browns or reds and blondes. Highlights that contain a red base can help accent golden undertones."
"
Choose a deep rich base for your hair color.,
Choose a medium color base for your hair color.,
Choose an intense color base for your hair.",How to Choose Hair Color for Skin Tone3," If you have warm undertones with yellow, pick a hair color that leans towards like chestnut, dark golden brown, auburn and mahogany. Then highlight using a red base, such as cinnamon or copper.If you choose a blonde base or blonde highlights, you may end up overemphasizing your yellow undertone.

, If you have warm undertones with red, avoid choosing a red or auburn hair color. Instead, use a honey brown or golden base color and add caramel low-lights. This will downplay the redness in your skin's undertones., If you have cool tones with a pink or blue undertone, look for an intense brown, red, or blonde base. Then, pick highlights that have a honey-wheat or ash look. This will help contrast your cool undertones.


Choose burgundy, cherry, or garnet hair color for dark skin with cool undertones. You can use these as a base color or highlight color. The cool red tones in this hair color give your skin a smooth even look.

For example, choose a honey blonde, auburn, chestnut, or mocha color.If doing highlights, try a warm red color to really bring out the warmth of your skin tone.

, If you have olive skin with a cool undertone, as most olive skinned people do, pick a hair color that highlights these cool tones. For example, pick an ash, platinum, copper, or violet red.If you have dark olive skin with cool undertones, avoid choosing a light ashy blonde or something similar that will starkly contrast.

, If you have a warm eye color, such as hazel, brown, or green, consider choosing a color that will highlight your eyes. For example, if your hazel eyes have some flecks of red, choose a hair color that has a reddish hue in order to bring out your eyes."

Leave the hydrogen peroxide in your hair for about 30 minutes.Depending on how dark your hair is, how light you want it, and how much irritation the chemical may cause, you'll want to experiment and play around with it.,
Rinse your hair thoroughly with cold water and apply conditioner.,
Repeat the process to lighten your hair further.,
Apply gentle heat to speed up the process.,
Wash your hair less often.,
Cut back on heat treatments.,
Handle your hair gently.",How to Bleach Your Hair With Hydrogen Peroxide," Don't dye or otherwise process your hair in the weeks leading up to the bleaching. Bleaching your hair will work better and cause less damage if your hair is strong and unprocessed. If your hair is damaged or processed, then you are better off going to a salon.Strengthen your hair in the following ways:


Use a natural shampoo and conditioner. Avoid products containing sulfates, which dry out your hair.
Avoid chemical-laden hair sprays, gels, straightening products, and other hair products.
Don't apply heat to your hair with a straight iron, blow dryer, or other heating appliance.;
, To bleach your hair with peroxide, you'll need the following materials. Gather them together and set them up on a table in your kitchen or bathroom:A 3% hydrogen peroxide solution. Any higher than 3% and you risk hair loss when applying. Not fun!
A clean, empty spray bottle. You can buy a new one at the drugstore, or use an old one. If you use an old one, wash it out thoroughly. If you're going to store the peroxide, keep it in a dark bottle and away from light.
Hair clips.
Cotton balls.
A towel.
Gloves.
Aluminum foil, if you plan to do highlights.
Shower cap, if you plan to bleach your whole head of hair.

, On the day you plan to bleach your hair, wash and condition it as normal to make sure the oils and grime caused by natural wear and styling products don't interfere with the peroxide.Condition well with a good natural conditioner. Bleaching your hair with peroxide can dry it out, and conditioner will protect it during the process.
Let your hair air-dry instead of blow drying it. Pat it dry with a towel to keep it from dripping, comb it out gently, and let it dry for about thirty minutes. Hair that is a little wet will take the hydrogen peroxide better.

, Take a small section from the underside of your hair and use a cotton ball to apply peroxide. Let it sit for a few minutes, then check it. You can leave it in for up to 30 minutes if desired, but rinse it out with cold water when it reaches your desired color. Make sure to pay attention to how much time it takes to reach the desired color and use this time to help you determine how long to leave the peroxide on the rest of your hair.


Is it is important to do a strand test because hydrogen peroxide may result in damage to your hair or an orangey, brassy color that is not desirable., Once your hair is reasonably dry, section off parts of hair you want bleached with claw clips. Sectioning your hair will help you make sure you treat every last lock with peroxide.If you want a very even bleach, the claw clip method is highly recommended. It takes more time, but it looks more professional and it offers more even highlights.
Leave the first section of hair that you want to treat down. You'll unclip further sections as you go.

, For bringing out natural highlights, apply peroxide with a cotton ball. Pour some peroxide on a cotton ball and smooth it over the sections of hair that you want to lighten. Start at the roots and stroke down to the tips with the cotton ball.Wrap each hair section in a piece of tin foil to keep the peroxide from getting onto the rest of your hair.
Repeat this process with multiple sections of your hair for all over highlights, or just do a few sections towards the front of your face for face framing highlights.

, If you want an ombre look, start applying the peroxide near the ends of your hair. Use a cotton ball to apply peroxide to the bottom half of your hair all around your head.You can go as far up the strands of hair as you want, but make sure to begin the application at your ends. This way the tips will be a brighter blonde and the color will fade to a darker shade as you move up towards your roots.

, To bleach all of your hair, use a spray bottle to spray the entire section of hair you left down. Spray it thoroughly and run a comb through your hair multiple times. Repeat with the remaining clipped sections of your hair.After you have finished applying the peroxide, put on a shower cap to keep the peroxide from dripping or touching your clothes.

,


Use your strand test to help you determine how long to leave the peroxide in your hair. You may only need a few minutes, or you may need the full 30 minutes.
When you are ready to rinse, remove the tin foil or shower cap if you used them.

, The cool water will remove the peroxide and add shine. The conditioner will help to restore some of the lost moisture.


Add another coat of deep conditioner to your hair. Massage it into your scalp to ease any dryness or irritation the peroxide might have caused. Rinse it out with cool water.
Allow your hair to air dry, then style as desired.

, The first time you use the peroxide treatment, your hair may get just a little lighter. If you want to lighten your hair more, then you'll have to repeat the treatment one or more times.


Your hair will become much lighter if you repeat this process in smaller doses every day for a week than if you use a whole bottle of hydrogen peroxide on your hair one night.
The final color also depends on what color your hair was to start out with.
If your hair is red or has a reddish tone, your peroxide-saturated hair might seem a bit more orange at first. Keep continuing the treatment and your hair should seem blonder.

, Using a hair dryer on a low setting to gently heat your hair can help to speed up the lightening process. Turn on your hair dryer to a low heat setting and move it from root to strand all over your head. Do this until your hair reaches the desired lightness.

It is best to use heat if you have bleached your hair with peroxide before and have a good idea of how it will turn out. If you are not sure, then avoid using a hair dryer. Go slow instead and see how the peroxide affects your hair as it air dries., Don't wash your hair every day. Washing your hair daily strips out natural oils that protect your hair from breaking. Try shampooing your hair only once or twice per week and use a dry shampoo (a powder you comb into your hair) to keep it looking fresh between washes.

, Don't blow dry or straighten your hair too much. These heating tools can exacerbate the damage caused by the peroxide, so only use them once a week or less. Try using heat free styling methods, or use a hair dryer on a lower setting., Let your hair air dry as often as possible, and don't wring it out or rub it with a towel after showering. Just give your hair a gentle squeeze with the towel, and then leave it be for a while. Also, make sure that when you brush your hair, you start from the ends and go slow to avoid breaking your strands."

Heat (do not boil) the mixture on your stove and stir it a few times until the salt has dissolved completely.Allow the solution to cool to room temperature and then add this solution to the lemon juice that you've already measured out and put in the spray bottle.

, Put the chamomile tea bag in an ordinary mug and pour the boiling water over it. Soak the tea bag in the water until it has cooled to room temperature (which will take about 30 minutes).The result will be a strong brew of chamomile tea.
Take the bag out of the water and throw it away after the 30 minutes have passed.

, Then measure out 1 teaspoon cinnamon and 1 teaspoon honey and put those into the spray bottle, as well. Put the nozzle onto the spray bottle and tighten it.

1/2 cup dried chamomile flowers;
30-40 drops cinnamon essential oil;
30-40 drops lemon essential oil;
15-20 drops cassia essential oil.

Enjoy your awesome, DIY chalk dye!

",How to Chalk Dye Your Hair1," Know that people with lighter-colored hair may have success with all types of chalk colors; those with darker hair may need brighter colors (neons come to mind) in order to truly have the chalk color stand out.


When choosing chalk, avoid:

Sidewalk chalk, as these are often too dusty
Oil-based pastel chalks, as these can stain clothing


Chalk dyeing won't be great for dyeing large portions of your hair. If you want to dip-dye your ends, or accentuate your hair with a little bit of color, chalk is the way to go. If you want to dye larger portions of your hair, know that it will take a lot of time and may not have the same effect as just doing highlights. Try these guides instead, or skip to the bottom section:

Traditional dyeing
Dyeing hair a bright or unnatural color
Dyeing hair using natural products

;
, You won't be able to style your hair after applying the chalk, so it's best to do that now.

, You don't need a lot of water; the more water, the less vibrant the chalk color in your hair will ultimately be.

,, Dip a small piece of chalk in the lukewarm water. Take your paintbrush, dip it in the water on onto the wet chalk, soaking up water and color, and begin to paint the section of the hair you want dyed.









Smaller pieces of chalk work best, as you'll grab onto the chalk later on and run it through your hair. If you choose a small piece of chalk, remember to choose a small amount of water as well.

, Take the wet chalk and work it into the primed patches of hair you want dyed. The more you go over the area with the chalk, the brighter and more intense the color will get.









If you're dyeing entire strands of your hair, start at the root and work your way out to the ends.

, Dip-dye small amounts of your ends for a nice accent, or go for larger amounts of hair. Do whatever suits you best!








, Your chalk-dyed hair will stay vibrant until your next shower, and will not have damaged your hair. At the same time, be mindful of a few things:









Avoid brushing or combing, as this will remove much of the color.
Avoid wearing light-colored or expensive (or valued) tops with chalk-dyed hair; although most chalk will wash away just fine, some chalk may cause stains.

, If you want the color to stay in for a bit longer, straightening may be good. Before you straighten, however, blow-dry your hair lightly first and make sure your hair isn't too damp.

Style your hair the way you want it.,
Drape a towel around your neck to keep from getting chalk color on your clothes.

,
Prime the hair by getting it wet.,
Starting at the root and working outwards, work a wet piece of chalk into strands of hair.,
Continue rubbing the chalk into your hair until your entire head is covered.",How to Chalk Dye Your Hair2," You won't be able to style your hair after applying the chalk, so it's best to get that done before you apply the chalk.

,, Since the chalk absorbs better when the hair is wet, start by getting your hair wet in sections. Dyeing your whole hair is going to take a while, so only wet a section of the hair you'll be working with — one section at a time.








, Do this is the same way you would while highlighting. Again, the more chalk you rub into your hair, the more intense the color of the dye is going to be.








, Wet a section with water and rub a piece of wet chalk into it — lightly for a transparent color, firmly and repeatedly for a darker, more vibrant color. If you want some ideas of which colors to use, consider the following:









Try a rainbow effect using 4 or 5 different colors, arranged in a gradient.
Try some neon colors in lighter hair for a vibrant effect.
Try segmenting your hair into two portions and dyeing one portion one color, and the other portion another color.

You can bleach darker hair, but it will require some patience, and the damage will inevitably be greater. You will also need go through the bleaching process several times in order to see the results you want.Professional colorists recommend spacing out bleachings by a few weeks. If you bleach too frequently, you could damage your hair to the extent that it will begin to fall out. If you can't wait, visit a salon.;
, Bleach can really strip your hair of its body and texture, so take a few proactive steps to keep your hair from turning dry and frizzy.


Use lots of conditioning masks for two weeks before you bleach. This will build up your hair's strength.Skip a couple of hair washes a few days before the treatment. Freshly washed hair can cause the bleach to irritate the scalp., There's quite a list so you'll want to make sure you have everything before you start the bleaching process.


Most importantly, you'll need to purchase a powder bleach and a developer, preferably of the same brand as the bleach. L’Oréal Quick Blue is the cheapest and most trusted option.The developer is the liquid that reacts with the powder bleach to strip the color out of your hair. Developer comes in different volumes, such as 20, 30, 40, etc. The higher the volume, the greater the strength of the bleach. For example, you'd have to leave a developer of 20 on your hair for quite a while to cause significant damage, whereas a 40 will burn your hair pretty fast. On the other hand, a 40-strength developer will also lift the color without turning your hair bright orange or needing to repeat the process multiple times.If you’re nervous, use a 30-volume developer; it’s better to not have the exact color you want than to fry your hair.off.
You'll also need to get a toner and deep conditioner, as well as instruments, including a plastic mixing bowl (don't use metal!), a plastic spatula, a plastic rat-tail end brush, and gloves.
All of these items are readily available at beauty supply stores like Sally or Ricky's. It should cost you anywhere between $40-$50 and you should be able to get a few bleaching jobs out of it.Be sure to also grab some old towels and old clothes that you don't mind getting ruined with bleach.

, You'll need assistance getting those hard-to-reach areas, unless you are insanely flexible. Very few people can bleach all of their own hair themselves.


Don't take any chances doing it on your own until you've done it several times and feel confident in your ability.

, Put on the old clothes you've located. Put a towel around your neck. Put gloves on.

, You might want to lay a tablecloth or rag down on the table. Lay out all of your materials so that you have everything you need when you begin to mix the solutions.

, Follow the instructions on whatever brand of both items you have purchased. Quick Blue, for example, calls for 1 scoop of bleach powder to 1.5-2oz developer.If you want to make sure you have enough for all of your hair, double the mixing amounts.Pour the developer in the mixing bowl first since you’ll need to measure it using the graduated lines on the bowl, which can be challenging if there’s already powder in there. Instead, add the powder to the developer.

, It should reach a mousse-like texture.

, If you have a friend with you, get them to follow the next few steps. If you feel confident that you can apply the bleach yourself, then go for it.

, Then, use the brush end to apply the mixture. Sections should be very thin to ensure even application – think of how this looks at the salon when they do this with aluminum foil.Make a small part in the hair, spread the bleach on it in both directions, and then create another part directly behind the one you just made. You'll probably need to lift the hair up to do this.
Think of it like the pages of a book. You are turning the page and the two already bleached 'pages' will touch and you will move on to the next fresh ""untouched"" section.
If you are doing more than an inch of roots, the hair closest to your scalp will bleach quicker and become a few shades lighter than the rest because bleach is activated by heat. So, if you're bleaching more than just your roots, apply the bleach everywhere but the roots for the first 20 minutes and then go back.

, Work down through the sides, front, and back. Do the same thing on each section, bleach both sides., ""Lift"" is the hair professional word for ""lighten."" This is when you should be adding bleach to the roots if you haven't touched them yet. Blend into where you already applied. This also lets you see parts that aren't lifting as quickly or spots that you missed. You can thus fix any mistakes as you go.

, Once the bleach has been sufficiently applied, you will need to wait around 30-45 minutes while it does its magic.Your head will be very itchy and should feel hot because the chemical reaction produces heat.


However, if you are in pain or feel too much of a burning sensation, move to the next step. It's better that you get it done professionally or fixed up in a salon than burn your scalp.
You could also use a foil-lined cap or heat to speed things up, but this isn't recommended until you've become more experienced at bleaching and know how your head and hair react to the process.

, You can see as it lightens and gets to the level you want.


The hair will remain yellow. Focus instead on the lightness, not on the color, since you'll be toning it shortly. That said, yellow is what you're looking for, not orange.If your natural colour doesn’t lift enough after 45 minutes or so and is still an orange color, wash it out, deep condition, and either go to a salon and get it fixed OR deep condition for a few days and then try again. Do not try to leave the bleach on for longer and do not try to repeat the process immediately after a failed attempt; this will seriously damage your hair.

, Rinse the bleach out and wash your hair with a mild shampoo. Then condition, rinse, and towel-dry your hair.

, Your hair will probably be quite light now, but very yellow-y. Use the toner to get the color you want. This is the most important step.Put on another pair of gloves, and slather the toner solution over your hair, but not on the roots quite yet.
Once applied, comb the toner through to the roots and ends with a wide-tooth comb. This too should turn into a mousse-like texture.
Follow any instructions that may be on your toner.

, Keep checking the color. Rinse again and then deep condition again., Be sure to do some upkeep and maintenance.Use a mask or deep conditioning treatment once a week to keep hair healthy.Use a shampoo specifically for blondes and condition frequently.
Re-tone (without bleaching) if you find the color is going yellowy after a week or two,
If you missed any spots, wait a couple of days and make up a little batch of bleach to touch up the problem spots, You should only leave the bleach on for 15 minutes or so. Then, rinse, condition, and tone all over again.

Some stylists won't bleach hair that has already been color-treated or processed. Check with your hairdresser in advance to avoid disaster., Bleaching dark hair to blonde, especially platinum blonde or white, requires repeating the bleaching process multiple times with several days of rest in between.Don't expect to have gorgeous blonde locks immediately: you'll need to do this gradually.


Since there will be intermediate stages when your hair is orange-tinged, coppery, or other not-quite-blonde colors, be ready to offset or mask these shades with hats, scarves, and other hair accessories.

, There are several choices in hair dye, and it is important that you choose the right one for your hair color.


Look for a bleach kit, which contains bleach powder and liquid peroxide. This is a stronger formula suitable for dark hair.
Peroxide comes in different strengths, ranging from 10 volume to 40 volume. Note that 40 volume is too strong for general bleaching as it could burn the scalp. It is only used for tipping dark hair, in which case it does not come in contact with the skin. 30 volume will work more quickly than either 20 or 10 volume. , This is crucial: it lets you see how long you need to let the dye sit in your hair to achieve the desired shade. Always read and follow the manufacturer's instructions for a strand-test included in the bleach kit. In general the steps are as follows:


Snip a few strands of hair from an inconspicuous place at the back of the head. Tie the strands together with a bit of string or tape them together at one end.
Mix a small amount of the bleach powder and liquid peroxide per manufacturer's instructions.
Dip the strands into the bleaching mix so that they are completely saturated.
Set a timer or keep track of how much time passes during the test.
Every five minutes, check the strands by wiping away the bleach with an old cloth.
Reapply the bleach again, and repeat the process until you have the desired shade of blonde. Now you know how long to leave the bleach in your hair. , Before you bleach, massage unrefined coconut oil into your hair and scalp. This helps protect your hair from excess damage during the bleaching process. Leave it in for 14 hours for maximum benefit.You don't need to rinse the oil out before bleaching.


To protect your pillow from oil stains, wrap a towel around your hair or braid it and put on a shower cap.

, Use the pointed end of the tint brush to make a part from the center of your forehead to the nape of your neck. Next, divide each section in half from the tip of each ear to the top of your head.


It’s important to use non-metallic pins or clips to secure each of the four sections. This is so the clips don’t react with the chemicals in the bleach., You’ll want to use basic precautions when working with bleach. Put on plastic gloves and protect your eyes with goggles. Also, wear old clothes and consider putting something on the floor to protect from spills.


You can also rub a thin layer of petroleum jelly onto your forehead, ears and neck. Petroleum jelly isn't necessary for bleaching in the same way it is for dyes, to avoid stains. But it can protect against irritation in case the bleach gets on the forehead, ears, and neck.

, In a non-metallic mixing bowl, combine equal amounts of lightening powder and developer. Mix until creamy.

, With your tint brush, starting 1/4-1/2 inch (about 1 cm) away from the scalp, begin applying bleach mixture.


First do one thin section from one of the back quarters, making sure it is totally saturated before moving on to the next. Clip the section back into place before moving on to the next one.
Do the two back quarters first, then the front quarters.
Work in the direction of hair growth, i.e. from roots to ends.
Work as quickly as possible: you want the hair to bleach roughly the same amount of time to achieve an even result. You can use different volumes to achieve this, as well: for example, using the quicker 30 volume up front and a 20 volume developer in back.
Once hair is saturated, put on the processing cap.

, Check every 10 minutes until the desired result is reached.


Check the color by removing the bleach from a small section with an old cloth. If you choose to continue, remember to re-saturate this section with bleach first.
It may help to set a timer for 10 minutes to ensure consistency.

, Do note, however, that any heating process is likely to increase damage, so don't do this unless you're in a hurry.


This isn't recommended if it's your first time bleaching, when it's important to get a sense of how long the process takes on its own. If you choose to repeat, you can try to speed it up with heat., The hair at the roots process faster than the rest because of the heat of your scalp, so the bleach will work faster - so if you're opting to dye your roots, it's best to do so towards the end of the process. Use the same sectioning technique described above, this time adding the mixture to the roots only., Once your hair has reached the pale yellow stage - or you've left the product in for the maximum time recommended by the manufacturer - rinse your hair of all bleach with lukewarm water.


Shampoo lightly, preferably with a shampoo specifically formulated for bleached hair. A shampoo that contains purple toner, for example, will help eliminate brassiness and yellow tones.Towel dry your hair and style as usual. If you can, avoid using heat products to style, as they will increase the stress and damage to your hair.

, Only when your hair has dried completely will you be able to really see how well the bleaching session has gone. Remember, it's probably going to take at least two or three sessions within a month to transform dark hair into pale blonde or white.

, Bleaching is tough on your hair. Resist the urge to bleach again immediately if you don't like what you see! Instead, use a toner after each session (see below) to balance out your color as it gradually makes its way from dark to pale., This is a crucial step for achieving a beautiful, balanced finish. Bleaching removes the color from hair's pigment, and eventually what remains is a yellow tinge - this is the natural color of keratin, or the hair's protein.Most of the time, this is not what we're after. That's where toners come in: these colors help balance out undesired tones, adding subtle nuances to your hair color and helping you get just the blonde you want.Dark hair usually has red or orange undertones, so bleaching tends to turn it orange. Blue toners balance orange, violet toners balance yellow, and blue-violet balance orange-yellow. In short, you want a toner that contains the color opposite to your undertones on the color wheel in order to neutralize. If in doubt, take a look at a color wheel to see where you fall.For white hair, choose a toner that is specified for white. You cannot bleach your hair white: you have to tone it.If you have any question about which toner to pick, you may want to go to a beauty supply store for professional advice, or consult a hairdresser.

, The following are general guidelines, but be sure to follow manufacturer's instructions.


Mix 1 part toner to 2 parts 10 or 20 volume developer. If you have black hair consider using 40 volume; however, keep in mind that the strength of 40 volume developer may be very harsh, and will severely burn if it touches your skin. Please seek medical attention if you receive a chemical burn!
Apply toner evenly from root to tip, using the same sectioning technique described above for bleaching.
Many toners require only 10 minutes, so apply as quickly as possible and keep close track of time.Check your progress every 5 to 10 minutes using the same strand technique described above for bleaching.
Be careful not to overtone white hair, which can result in yellowish or grey color.

, Shampoo and condition, then style as usual.


Remember to discard any unused bleach and toning mixture when you're finished.

Rock your new blonde locks.",How to Bleach Your Hair Platinum Blonde," If you buy ingredients separately rather than in a kit, it is cheap. You can bleach your hair, then mix small amounts of the chemicals later to touch up your roots.;
, You can get some hair from your hairbrush and going through the bleaching process with it to test how it will go. It's better to test it out first; that way, there won't be any surprise you'll have to grow out!

, Don't use styling products that may cause buildup. Leaving your natural oils on your head helps to protect your scalp and hair.

, The night before you intend to bleach, soak your hair in coconut oil and leave it in overnight. Again, this helps protect your hair and scalp from damage.

, Once you begin, you must work quickly to avoid burns, so having it all there helps.

, Put on your goggles and gloves! Add tape around them to protect your eyes.


Note: You should wear a button down shirt or a loose fitting top so that you can take off your shirt to rinse your hair without getting bleach all over your clothes.

, Liberally smear around your hairline, ears and neck with Vaseline to provide a barrier between the bleach and your skin.

, Add 2 ounces (60 ml) of bleaching powder (or 1 scoop of clear developer and 1 scoop of bleach), in a room with windows. Remember that you will get a higher lift if you use 30 or 40 volume. They also have a higher risk of burning your scalp.

, Then commence mixing the bleach and developer mixture. Prepare to apply the mixture.

, DO NOT start at your roots, unless you want to come out with lighter roots and darker ends.


You can put foil under a section of hair, paint on the bleach, then wrap up that section in foil if you like. Make sure it is hairdressing foil and not tin foil from the grocery store or you could damage your hair.

, Keep 1 1⁄2 inches (3.8 cm) away from your roots initially. After you have finished the rest of your hair, apply the bleach mix to your roots, being careful not to massage it into your scalp too much.


Avoid putting the bleach directly onto your scalp. If you do, it will sting or burn a little bit, and it will hurt a bit. If it burns a lot, this is a chemical burn. Rinse it out immediately.

, You may wish to put more bleach, earlier, on whichever part of your hair is darker. So if your roots are dark and the rest of your hair has been bleached before, bleach the roots for 15 or 30 minutes longer than the rest of your hair. If your roots are light or blonde and the rest of your hair is darker, paint the dark bits first.

, Put a shower cap, aluminum foil, or clear/white plastic bag over your hair. Make sure it's not covering your face, but is over all of your hair. Then tie it at the nape of your neck, making sure all of your hair is tucked underneath the bag.


If you want a higher lift, use aluminum foil instead of a plastic bag.
If you are using a grocery bag, make sure the side with printing on it is NOT against your head, or you will wind up with the color of the print processed into your hair a bit.

, Check your timer. If you leave it on for longer, it won't get any lighter, it will only damage your hair more.


Check the color all the time. Once at a pale yellow, you must wash off the bleach. Don't leave bleach on for over an hour. Don't bleach once at pale yellow or hair will break.
If not at pale yellow then rinse it out, tone your hair and wait a month to re-bleach your hair. (See Following Up with More Bleaching.)







, Wash out with a PH neutralizing shampoo. This will stop any further acidic or basic chemical reactions from occurring on your head. This will formally end the bleaching process.


You ‘’must’’ wash out the bleach mixture completely, or else you will damage your hair. After a while, the developer and powder stop reacting and your hair won't bleach any more, only become more damaged. If you over-bleach, your hair might end up feeling a little bit straw-like and brittle. If you're in doubt, rinse it out.






Make sure to use a shampoo and conditioner designed for bleached blonde hair to eliminate any yellow and make your hair bright platinum and white. Any purple shampoo is fine. Remember purple counteracts yellow, makes it white, and eliminates brassiness.







, Once hair is pale yellow, it is time to tone or color, if desired. Toner is semi-permanent hair dye that can counteract some of the unwanted hues from bleaching.For a natural platinum look, dye it with a natural blonde mixture with 20 developer, since hair is already bleached. Leave on 25 minutes.
For pale silver platinum, use a platinum dye with 20 developer, and leave on for 25 minutes.
For yellowish-white, leave it the way it is after completely stripping all the color with the bleach. Use a lot of purple shampoo to eliminate and dull yellow or dye it a level 12 color. Leave on 25 minutes.
For white blonde or white use a white blonde toner, and leave on 25 minutes. Many of these toners are semi permanent, so color will fade and you can redo the toner the following week.

, Make sure your hair gets repair treatment and keratin protein and softening treatments. User a deep conditioning at least once a week

, Bleaching weakens your hair a lot, so adding protein will make it stronger and less susceptible to breakage. This takes a few hours to harden and about half an hour to wash out, so you must allow time to do it properly if you choose it.

, If you under-bleach, and your hair is an orange tone, you must wait a month in order to avoid damage to your hair and skin and then bleach it once more.

, Apply once a month, until your hair is a light yellowish color. Use the same process as above: shampoo with a pH balancing shampoo, apply toner as desired, and be generous with conditioning treatments.

,, Do not bleach or dye your hair for more than an hour at a time, and always leave a month in between for processing time for your hair and scalp to heal. Otherwise, your hair will be damaged, dull, frizzy. Hair will become brittle and tend to break and there's a possibility your head will be covered in scabs, which will develop into bald spots. Always condition in between! Be patient.

, Make sure you keep up the good care of your hair, since bleaching can be a rough process. Condition often and use protein treatments to strengthen your hair and prevent breakage.

Take care of your hair.",How to Bleach Your Hair1," Find some photos of hair colors that you want to create with bleach and go online to look up what those colors are called and what products work best for creating them. Also consider what hair color you’re starting with.

Consider looking up something like: “What hair products work best for bleaching black hair?” or “How to bleach red hair platinum blonde.”;
, To properly bleach your hair with professional supplies, you will need to buy a number of products. Each of these is important and will be crucial at different stages of the bleaching process. These products include:


Bleach powder: this comes in either packets or tubs.
Crème developer: choose this product according to the color of your natural hair. If your hair is already blonde or light brown, use a 10 or 20 volume (10V or 20V) developer. If your hair is dark brown or black, you’ll need to use 20V developer and give it more time to process. Talk with a sales clerk to get their opinion on what you should purchase for your hair.
Many professionals use 30V or 40V because it processes the bleach faster. Refrain from doing this alone at home because it can cause more damage than lower volumes.
Toners even out the color of bleached hair and neutralize unwanted tones and brassiness. Buy this if you’re going for more of a platinum look. Some toners make hair white, and some give a silvery effect.
Add red gold corrector to the bleach powder to increase its effectiveness so you don't have to bleach twice.
You can use “purple shampoo” to remove brassiness and yellow tones. Don’t use it often or it may stain your hair purple.
Buy a tint brush, a bowl, and plastic wrap.
Buy an extra package of bleach and developer so you have extra in case you run out midstream. Some people’s hair will absorb the bleach mixture more quickly than others, and having extra bleach mixture on hand will save you the trouble of running out. You don’t want to be halfway through your hair and find you don’t have any more bleach mixture.

, No matter what bleaching method you use, it’s going to cause your hair to become drier and more fragile than normal. Starting with healthy hair prevents excessive damage from the bleaching process. Don't dye or otherwise process your hair for about a month before you plan to bleach it. Use gentle products, like shampoo and conditioner made from all natural ingredients, to make sure your hair is as healthy as possible before bleaching.

, Use a deep conditioner a day or two before bleaching your hair to help build up moisture in your hair. There are many types of deep conditioners, from less expensive ($5-$8) to more expensive ($30+) store-bought ones to more natural, DIY ones. There are recipes to make your own deep conditioner, which typically use foods as their base. Search online for “deep conditioner recipes” for suggestions using bananas, avocados, mayonnaise, yogurt, eggs, coconut oil, or other foods.This step will help minimize ending up with extremely dry and brittle hair after you bleach it by increasing your hair’s moisture and elasticity. , This step seems time-consuming, especially when you want to get started on bleaching your hair. But it is an important step that will save you a serious skin rash (or worse) if you happen to be allergic to the bleach or any of the other ingredients. To do a patch allergy test, apply a dab of bleach solution on a patch of skin behind your ear. Leave the bleach on for 24-48 hours and check for any allergic reaction, such as a rash, itching or burning on that spot. If you do have an allergic reaction, however mild, you should try a different method for bleaching your hair.

, Read the instructions that came with the bleach powder to find out exactly how much to use. Usually, you mix one part bleach with two parts toner, but the instructions will give you precise measurements. Mix these in an old bowl with an old spoon or spatula that you will not be putting back into your kitchen. The mixture will be blue or bluish-white.Add the red gold color corrector if you’re going for a more platinum look. Pay close attention to the instructions on the label to ensure your measurements and proportions are exact.

, Peroxide can stain clothing and can be irritating to skin, so take care to cover yourself properly. Wear gloves and cover your clothes with an old towel. Apply a small amount of petroleum jelly along your hairline and neckline to protect your skin.


Never apply bleach without gloves; the chemicals can burn your skin.

, Gather up a small hunk of hair from the nape of your neck. Spray the peroxide onto this strand, starting at the roots and working it towards the ends. Leave it in for about 20-30 minutes. Rinse out the peroxide and check the color against a white towel. This will enable you to check if you like the color before dousing your entire head in peroxide. It will also help you gauge how much time to leave in the peroxide., Divide your hair into a few sections and twist the sections up. Clip these sections into easily removable hair clips; it’s best to use hair clips you can put in and take out with only one hand, especially after you start the bleaching process. Don’t clip the first section you plan to bleach.

, Make sure your hair is completely dry before you begin. Use the tint brush to apply the bleach. Keep the hair that has not been bleached separate from the hair that has been bleached, so you can keep track of where you’re at. Use clips or squares of foil to separate sections of your hair.


Depending on the style you’re going for, you can use use the tint brush to apply the bleach in different ways, including: roots to tips, tips to roots, etc.
Don't rub the bleach into your head, since the chemicals can burn your scalp.
To get salon quality highlights, separate out small sections of your hair that are less than an inch wide. Place foil squares under these sections to protect the rest of your hair from receiving any of the peroxide spray. Spray these sections and wrap them in the foil sheets to keep them from touching the rest of your hair while you let the peroxide sit in your hair. Highlighting your hair is probably easiest to do with a friend helping you.
It can be a good idea to just apply bleach to the front section of your hair, allow it to process, and rinse, before doing the back section. Putting the bleach mixture over your whole head takes time, and you may not have enough time to finish the back section before the front section needs to be rinsed out., Cover your hair with plastic wrap. Let the bleach start working on your hair. The longer you leave it in, the lighter your hair will be. Keep checking a strand of hair every 10 minutes until you're satisfied with the color of your hair. Don't leave the bleach in your hair for more than 45 minutes total.


Several factors, including the volume of your developer and the darkness of your hair, influence how long it will take for the bleach to lift your hair color to the lightness you desire.

, Rinse out all of the bleach with cool water. Then use the special shampoo for bleached hair. Dry your hair and check out the color. If you like the color, you can stop there. Style your hair normally.


Be aware of the different hues that a bleach job will give you, depending on your hair color. Dark brown hair will lighten to chestnut brown, but too much peroxide may result in an orange-brown color. Medium brown will turn to light brown; light brown will turn dark blond; red hair will turn orange, and with enough bleaching, will become strawberry blond; dark blond will turn light blond., Some people will need to tone their hair to achieve a nice white blond color, or to even out some of the color imperfections that their hair has after bleaching. This may not work for everyone, however, and can result in white-gray hair that you may not like.The stage for adding toner comes in after you have fully bleached your hair and you will not be trying to bleach your hair further. You should have also already washed and dried your hair so that you can assess the color that your hair has become.

, Use an old mixing bowl and old spatula and put in the correct parts toner, developer and red gold corrector. Be sure to check the instructions on the box to get the correct proportions and measurements.

, Dry your hair at least a little bit with a towel. Use a clean tinting brush to apply toner to your hair in sections, using clips or pieces of tin foil to separate sections that have toner on them from those that still need an application. Applying the toner is not as time-sensitive as the bleach application stage, so you can take your time a little more now.

, This varies depending on the product you are using, but 30 minutes is about the norm. Wait until the toner turns a dark purple in your hair. Check your hair after about 15 minutes to see how it looks by wiping off some of the purple toner. Keep checking every 10 minutes until you have reached the color you want.

, Rinse your hair under cool water until all traces of the toner are gone. Cool water is better than warm water since it stops the developing process, which will stop the chemicals from removing more color from your hair.

, Purple shampoo is a type of toning shampoo that is used to help distribute purple pigment to counteract brassy hues in your hair. By adding a little bit of purple pigment to your hair, you neutralize some of the reds and yellows in bleached hair, bringing out some blue hues and making your hair a slightly cooler color. Rinse your hair in hot water briefly so that the hair shafts open and are ready to absorb more of the purple hue. Apply shampoo liberally to your hair, let it sit for up to 5 minutes, and then rinse with cool water. The cool water will seal up the hair shafts and help retain the purple tones in your hair.Make sure you rinse it out completely, however, because it will stain towels and it can potentially leave your hair a lavender color if you have white blond hair.


There are several different brands and prices for these, from Clairol Professional Shimmer Lights Shampoo for about $10 per bottle to Unite Blonda Toning Shampoo for about $30. Your best bet is to purchase this type of shampoo at a beauty supplies store. Talk to a sales clerk for advice on the best shampoo for your hair.

, Your hair will be brittle and dry after this treatment and will need deep conditioning to restore some moisture and elasticity. Use a deep conditioner (store-bought or natural) at least once a week, leaving it in your hair for 20-30 minutes and then rinsing it out. Results can be improved by heating up your hair with a hair dryer while the deep conditioner is in place. If you have made your own deep conditioner with food, check to make sure it hasn’t gone bad. If it’s been mixed up for longer than a few days (or a week if kept in the refrigerator), throw it away and mix up a new batch.

, Use a clean spray bottle or a recycled one that has been thoroughly washed and dried. This will help you aim your spray more evenly and accurately when applying it to your hair. Gather some cotton balls to aid in a more precise application. Do a few test squirts to make sure the spray bottle is functioning properly.

, Peroxide can stain clothing and can be irritating to skin, so take care to cover yourself properly. Wear gloves and cover your clothes with an old towel. Apply a small amount of petroleum jelly along your hairline and neckline to protect your skin.

, Wet your hair with lukewarm water and pat it dry with a towel. Let it air dry for a few minutes until it's still damp, but not dripping wet. Use hair clips to section your hair. Divide your hair into a few sections and twist the sections up. Clip these sections into easily removable hair clips; it’s best to use hair clips you can put in and take out with only one hand, especially after you start the bleaching process. Don’t clip the first section you plan to bleach.


You can also apply melted coconut oil to your hair before bleaching to help protect your hair. To melt the coconut oil, place the sealed jar into hot water. This will liquefy the oil. Pour the oil all over your head and rub it into your hair. Wrap your hair in a plastic cap and let the oil soak into your hair for a few hours (overnight is best). Do not rinse your hair before applying the bleach., Gather up a small hunk of hair from the nape of your neck.

Make sure to spray it from all sides. The more peroxide solution you use on your hair, the lighter your hair will get. Be careful to only spray directly onto your hair, not your scalp; the peroxide may irritate your skin. Go slowly, paying careful attention to how your hair is reacting to the peroxide as you progress.


When the first section is damp, unclip a second section and spray it with peroxide. Repeat until all of your hair has been treated.
If you want to highlight a few strands of hair rather than spraying your entire head, dip a cotton ball in the peroxide and rub it on the strands you wish to die.
To bleach streaks in your hair, separate out the chunks that you want to bleach. Place foil squares under these chunks to protect the rest of your hair from receiving any of the peroxide spray. Spray these chunks and wrap them in the foil sheets to keep them from touching the rest of your hair while you let the peroxide sit in your hair. Streaking your hair is probably easiest to do with a friend helping you.

, The longer you leave the peroxide in, the brighter your hair will become. Be careful not to let the peroxide sit in your hair for more than 45 minutes. If the peroxide begins irritating your scalp, wash it out right away.


Using a hair dryer on your hair or another heater during this process may speed up the time it takes to reach your desired color. Even though the hair dryer will speed the process, be aware that the heat can damage your hair and could cause hair damage.This is not necessary, however, and if you are not sure how your hair reacts to peroxide, you should skip this heating step.

, Use cool water to remove all traces of peroxide from your hair, then use a deep conditioner to restore its moisture. Allow your hair to dry, then style as usual.

, If this first round has not left you with the color that you’re aiming for, you can bleach your hair with peroxide again.

Take care of your hair.",How to Bleach Your Hair3," Most hairstylists are trained in how to properly bleach hair, but some may be more skilled at it than others. Schedule a brief consultation with your hairstylist so you can strategize how you might want to bleach your hair. Ask your hairstylist how often they’ve bleached hair, how they’ve handled different types of hair, etc. Also ask for their recommendations on how to handle your hair and how they think your hair will react to the bleaching process.


You should also ask if your hair is healthy enough to bleach. Some colorists won’t bleach hair that has already been color-treated, because it is such a damaging process., Bleached hair does still have variety in terms of hues. You can choose white hair, white blond, platinum blond, or a few other hues. Bring in a picture of someone with the same shade of hair that you’d like. This will help your hairstylist figure out the best approach to bleaching your hair.

, The bleaching process is a slow process and does not happen instantly. The hairstylist needs time to wash your hair, mix up the bleach solution, and apply it to your hair. It needs to sit in your hair for a while (30 minutes or so). Then your hairstylist needs to wash it out and dry your hair.


You may need to schedule a second session with your hairstylist if you have very dark hair and you want to go white blond.Your hairstylist is also skilled at bleaching highlights into your hair. It is also much easier for another person to do this process, rather than trying to do it yourself. They can see your head from above and can apply bleaching solution evenly over your head.

, Your hair will be brittle and dry after this treatment and will need deep conditioning to restore some moisture and elasticity. Use a deep conditioner (store-bought or natural) at least once a week, leaving it in your hair for 20-30 minutes and then rinsing it out. Results can be improved by heating up your hair with a hair dryer while the deep conditioner is in place. If you have made your own deep conditioner with food items, check to make sure it hasn’t gone bad.

Starting with healthy hair prevents excessive damage from the bleaching process. Don't dye or otherwise process your hair for about a month before you plan to bleach it. Use gentle products, like shampoo and conditioner made from all natural ingredients, to make sure your hair is as healthy as possible before bleaching.

, Use a deep conditioner a day or two before bleaching your hair to help build up moisture in your hair. There are many types of deep conditioners, from less expensive ($5-$8) to more expensive ($30+) store-bought ones to more natural, DIY ones. There are recipes to make your own deep conditioner, which typically use foods as their base. Search online for “deep conditioner recipes” for suggestions using bananas, avocados, mayonnaise, yogurt, eggs, coconut oil, or other foods.This step will help minimize ending up with extremely dry and brittle hair after you bleach it by increasing your hair’s moisture and elasticity. , Depending on how long your hair is and how much of it you want to bleach, you'll need the juice of 2 to 5 lemons. Cut the lemons in half and use a juicer or your hands to squeeze their juice into a bowl. Strain the seeds when you're finished juicing.


Don't use lemon juice that comes in a bottle. It contains preservatives that may damage your hair.

, Pouring full-strength lemon juice on your hair can really dry it out, so it's important to dilute the juice with water. Add an amount of water to the bowl that's equal to the amount of lemon juice.

, It's best to use a new spray bottle, which can be purchased at most drug stores, but you can also recycle one you already have at home. If you're using a recycled spray bottle, make sure it is completely clean. Wash it out with soap and water before you fill it with the lemon juice solution. Shake the lemon juice solution well, and do a few test squirts to make sure the spray bottle is functioning properly.

, Spray the area you want to bleach liberally with lemon juice solution, making sure the area is completely damp. Spray more lemon juice in the areas that you want to lighten the most. The more lemon juice you use, the lighter it will get.


If you want to highlight a few strands of hair instead of bleaching it all over, use a cotton ball to rub lemon juice solution on the parts that you do want to bleach.

, The sun will react with the lemon juice and cause your hair to lighten. Wait for all the lemon juice solution to completely dry in your hair for about 30 minutes. Be sure to cover yourself with sunscreen and clothing to protect yourself from the sun's rays as you bleach your hair. Remember that this process can dry out your hair. Sitting in the sun for a long time will help your hair get lighter, but it will also cause some damage.

, After the lemon juice solution has dried, wash it out with shampoo and then condition your hair with a good moisturizing conditioner. Style it as usual.


Once your hair is dry, take a look at the color. If you want it to be even lighter, repeat the process again in a few days. Don't bleach your hair with lemon juice more often than once every two or three weeks.

Take the exam.,
Get listed as a board certified hair colorist.,

Display your certificate.,
Grow your client base.,
Practice your skills.",How to Become a Hair Color Specialist," How long you need to be in cosmetology school depends mainly on how many hours are required by your individual U.S. state. You should determine how many hours of training and practice that you will need in order to qualify for a cosmetology certificate.For example, Montana requires 2000 hours, while New Mexico requires 1600 hours.
If you move to another state, you will need to transfer your license. Some states allow you to keep your license no matter the differences between state requirements, while others require that you get more hours or even take their exam.
The number of hours varies by specialty, such as nails or braiding. If your long-term goal is to be a haircolorist, you will need a basic cosmetology license, which can take a little longer.;
, You should find a good cosmetology school (also called a beauty school) in your area that is in your price range. Also make sure their curriculum fulfills the number of hours you need to get licensed in your state. Ask people you know for school recommendations or look online for beauty schools in your area.


You can find websites that compile beauty school directories for easier internet searches., Beauty school can be expensive, but that should not stop you from pursuing your education. You can find scholarships to help pay for school just as you might find for college.It is also helpful to save up money for materials while you are in school.


You may often find that vocational schools and community colleges have cosmetology programs, which can save you a lot of money. The tradeoff is that these schools don’t always have the reputation that beauty schools have., Once you have selected a few schools you’d like to attend, send in your application. Most beauty schools require a high school diploma or GED. If you are under age 18, you might need your parents’ approval (most schools require you to be at least 16). Be prepared to give letters of recommendation, although this isn’t always required.Some schools may also want you to submit written essays, aptitude tests, even video essays.
Visit the website of each individual school and read about their admission requirements. You may be able to submit an application online.
If there is no school website, or the website lacks an option for applying, contact the school for admission requirements. Either mail in your application or deliver it in person.

, Most cosmetology programs last between 12 and 14 months, even when the state requires a high number of hours.Upon completion of your beauty school program, you should take a cosmetology licensing exam that will most likely include three parts: a written standardized test on procedures, a practical exam, and a written exam on rules and laws for your state.You will need a basic understanding of subjects like anatomy, chemistry, electricity, nutrition, and infection control.
Keep your license up to date by researching the state requirements. Most states require a renewal every two years., The Board of Directors for the American Board of Certified Haircolorists (ABCH) has eliminated all prerequisites for becoming a hair color specialist, so you can move from getting your cosmetology license directly to taking the hair colorist exam.However, in order to pass the exam, you must know the content. Getting hands-on training and studying first is highly recommended.


Find a job where you can work closely with a licensed hair color specialist, such as an apprenticeship at a salon.
The exam is usually offered in only a few locations in the U.S. Choose the one that is nearest to you. For example, in fall of 2016, the exams were scheduled for Boston, Massachusetts; Washington, DC; and Atlanta, Georgia. , You will need several items for your exam. You should locate a test mannequin with its own small stand as well as hair bundles for making swatches. You can also purchase a “study portfolio” from the Board that has all the guidelines you need for two of the three parts of the exam.A basic exam fee is $375. If you want the Board to supply your testing materials, the package is $600 for both exam and materials., Just as with the cosmetology exam, the haircolorist exam requires studying. You can find a sample exam and practice exams on the Board’s website to assist your studies. You can take these exams 100 times, and you are given 20 minutes to finish each.Be prepared for the three sections: performance, written, and the interactive assessment at the end.The written exam has 250 multiple choice and true/false questions.

, Arrive at your scheduled exam with all your materials, ready for a day-long test. The written exam is timed at one hour and 45 minutes, the performance exam is one and a half hours long, and the interactive assessment is conducted at the end of the day after the take down.You will be on one of two teams, the blue team or red team. The two teams alternate sections at different times throughout the day.
After the exam, you must wait one week to find out the results.If you fail one section of the test, this means you only have to re-take that one section, not the entire thing.
You have one year from your failure date to re-take it; otherwise you must re-take the entire exam., In order to gain experience working as a certified haircolorist, advertise your certification. Get your name listed on the certified hair color specialist’s website. The American Board of Certified Haircolorists offers this to help students promote themselves.Having your name on this website gives you credibility, potentially leading to more clients and positions at higher-end salons.

, Once you have become a certified haircolorist, look for a salon that could use your skills. Advertise that you are now board certified. Look for salons that have the type of clientele that benefits from someone who knows a lot about hair coloring.


You may already work at a salon, but want to advance to a busier or higher-end salon once you have your haircolorist certification.
Talk to salon managers about their need for a haircolorist on staff.
Keep in mind that cosmetologists work for themselves even when they work at a salon with other cosmetologists. They usually pay chair rental fees, all their own taxes, etc.

, When you get a position at a salon, display your board certification on the wall by your chair. Once you pass the haircolorist exam, you should receive a framed certificate from the Board. Keeping your certificate visible will inspire the confidence of your clients and the clients of cosmetologists who sit near you.The Board will also offer you postcards and press kits to help you advertise your certification and get more clients.

, As a cosmetologist before you were a certified haircolorist, you probably grew your client base bit by bit. You probably handed out your business card to new clients, who sent their friends to you. Your salon might have assisted you in this process. Now that you’re a certified haircolorist, you are doing the same thing. But this time, focus your attention on clients who want hair coloring.


Ask your current regulars if they want a discount on a hair coloring to display your new skills.
Take pictures of your work and post them around your chair, or make a photo album for clients to look through while they wait.
Give your business card to friends and ask them to pass it out to anyone they know needing hair coloring work done.

, Even though you’ve received the ultimate recognition in hair coloring technique, that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t keep up your skills with practice. For example, if you lack clients who want hair coloring for a period of time, you may get rusty. Find people you can practice on, even if it means doing the work for less money.


If you start to lose hair coloring clients or you can’t find them in the first place, try asking around to find a cosmetologist you can work with. See if they will pass along some of their work for a reduced rate so that you can practice.
Find apprenticeships to advance your skills even more."

Buy the correct bleach!,
Prepare your hair.,
Wear old clothing.,
Wear gloves.,
Mix your bleach and peroxide.,
Put it on.,
Time it.,
Rinse it.,
Take very good care of your hair for the first few days or so.",How to Bleach Brown Hair," Go to a supplier and buy bleach powder and peroxide. For a darker brown/brown black, you will need a higher volume peroxide, like a 30vol 9% peroxide. If your hair is dark brown or black, still use 30vol but leave it on until the desired shade is achieved. For a lighter or medium shade of brown, follow the times on the box as lighter hair doesn't withstand the damage caused by bleach. Do not use supermarket bleaching kits. They are generally inexpensive but cause unnecessary damage and can cause brassy tones.;
, Buy a deep conditioner or repair treatment for use afterwards. You are not to condition your hair prior to bleaching as the particles from the conditioner get in the way of the oxidation of the melanin in your hair.


If you don't plan to colour your hair after lightening, buy ""Provoke silver shampoo"" it will seal the hair and remove unwanted brassiness.

, Bleach will stain (remove the colour from) the majority of clothing and cause the fabric to weaken, so it is important to wear something you don't mind getting wrecked. Be careful if you wear shorts or short sleeves, as bleach can affect your skin if you spill some on it.

, Bleach is rather harsh on skin. You do not want to get it on your hands. Gloves are cheap, so buy some.

, You will need to weigh out your bleach and peroxide to achieve the correct ratio. Kitchen scales are useful. A proper mixing tub and application brush are also essential to achieve the best results. After weighing, mix until smooth then leave for 1 minute so that the mixture can combine correctly.

, Evenly distribute the mixture onto hair. It is easier if you section your hair first. Start by applying to the ENDS first and then apply to the roots and smooth all over. Your roots will bleach faster because they are so close to your scalp and therefore much warmer. Heat speeds up the bleaching process.

, The instructions should outline a correct timing. If not, most bleach takes between 20 - 50 minutes to achieve its highest level of lift.


If in doubt, let the bleach sit on the hair for 15 minutes, then check a very small strand by gently wiping it off with a warm washcloth. If it is not as light as you want it, wipe the bleach back onto it and wait another 15 minutes. Repeat this until the hair appears as light as you desire it.

, Using warm water, gently rinse all residue from the hair. Do not use shampoo, just condition your hair with a product of your choice. Generally, conditioning the hair, drying and then going back and washing in your normal way leaves it very manageable.

, Do not use a lot of heat tools or styling products on hair. This can cause excessive damage and breakage. Let hair air dry, rather than blow drying it for a few days. Deep condition it daily for a few consecutive days. It should begin to regain it's softness and sheen soon if it was in good condition before you bleached.

Choose a shade.,
Dye your hair.",How to Be a Redhead1," The two most popular red dye brands are Schwarzkopf and L'oreal, but a trip to your local drugstore beauty aisle will reveal dozens of reliable and affordable dyes. This step can be overwhelming since there are so many options. Read the descriptions on boxes that grab your attention.


Decide if you want semi-permanent dye or permanent dye. Semi-permanent dye lasts about 4 weeks, and permanent dye lasts about 6.
If you have trouble deciding, try looking up different brands on Google. Who has the best reviews?
Watch out for allergies. Some people may be allergic at-home dye, so if you’ve never dyed your hair before, place a small drop of dye on your skin before dyeing your hair. If there is no reaction, you’re good to go.;

The rule of thumb is the darker your skin, the darker your shade of red should be, but it is really up to your personal style.If you’re already a redhead, choose a color that is different from your natural color. This way, the difference is noticeable. If you’re strawberry blonde, go more ginger. If you’re deep red, try auburn.
Brunettes will have a hard time going lighter than their natural hair color.If you have brunette hair and do not want to bleach it, choose a shade of red just as dark or darker than your natural color.
If you have lots of white hair, consider going to a salon instead of using an at-home dye.Each red pigment attaches differently to each white hair, and only a professional can make this into an even color.
At-home dyes look especially natural on those with blonde hair., Follow the instructions on the box. The steps for dyeing your hair will vary from brand to brand, so read and follow the instructions carefully.At-home dyes often come with all the materials you need, such as gloves. They should also include anything you need to mix with the dye itself. Gather a few old sheets or towels to cover your clothes and floor just in case dye drips anywhere.

Ask your hairdresser what each shade will look like with your natural hair color. For example, brunettes may need to bleach their hair if they want a neon red, but blondes may not. Any hairstylist can give you more information on what the dye will look like once it is applied.
Bring pictures of cuts and colors that you like.

Dry: looks dull, has split ends, damages easily, breaks easily. This could be due to damage or just lack of oil production.

Oily: becomes greasy if not washed daily, looses its shine and ""swish"" throughout the day.

Combination: oily at the roots, but dry and damaged towards the ends. This is often due to over-styling and brushing.

Start with healthy hair.,
Buy bleach powder.,
Choose a developer strength.,
Buy permanent toner.,
Ventilate the area.",How to Bleach Hair Blonde1," Don't dye or otherwise process your hair in the months leading up to the bleaching. Bleaching your hair will work much better if your hair is relatively strong and unprocessed. Your hair will withstand the rigorous bleaching process better, too.


Use natural shampoo and conditioner for strong hair. Avoid products containing sulfates and alcohol, which dry out your hair.
Avoid chemical-laden hair sprays, gels, serums, and other products.
Use heat-styling tools as little as possible.;
, Decide what shade you're aiming for, then head to your local beauty store. Bleach powder comes in either packets or tubs; it can be more economical to buy a tub if you're planning on bleaching your hair more than once.

If your lemons aren't yielding much juice, trying poking at the membranes with a fork.;
, Decide which sections of your hair you want to highlight. Usually, you want to focus on the top layer of hair — the layer that is visible when your hair is down. Do you want to create highlights all around your head, or do you only want highlights that frame your face? Use clips to separate the hair you want to highlight from the hair you wish to keep your normal base color.


You might want to pull the remaining hair into a braid or low ponytail, so it doesn’t mix too much with the hair you’re trying to highlight.

, Dip an old toothbrush that you don’t need to use anymore into the lemon juice, and use it to transfer the juice to the hair that you want to highlight. Make sure you apply the juice along all the hair you wish to highlight — you might want to highlight the entire strand, or you might want to have your hair highlighted toward the crown, then taper back into your natural color toward the bottom.


Undo the clip holding back each section of hair, and only work one section of hair at a time.
When you’ve finished applying the lemon juice, pull the hair back up into a clip. This is to keep the lemon juice from getting onto the hair you wish to keep your natural color.
Work your way through all the sections of hair you wish to highlight.

, Before moving on to the next step, the lemon juice needs to dry completely in your hair. If you’re in a hurry, you can speed up the process by blow-drying your hair on hot. However, if you have time and want the best possible results, go sit outside in the sun and let the lemon juice air-dry in your hair.


The longer you sit out in the sun, the lighter your highlights will grow.

Avocado: avocado is one of nature's greatest moisturizers, rich in vitamins such as E & B and nutrients. Its natural oils will give your hair the moisture it's lacking. Use about half an avocado, mash it, use on it's own or with other ingredients.

Banana: rich in vitamins and oils, especially good for improving hair elasticity, therefore preventing split ends and breakage, and also good for dandruff. Mash about half a banana, use on its own or with other ingredients. Freezing and thawing the banana before use can help to reduce lumps, which are difficult to wash out of hair.

Honey: honey is moisturizing and a humectant (has the ability to cling onto moisture) making it suitable for dry hair. Be aware that it also lightens the colour of your hair (bleaching effect). Use as much as necessary (not too much or you'll be left with sticky hair), can be mixed into other ingredients such as the avocado or banana. Apply to damp hair.

Mayonnaise: sounds disgusting, but mayonnaise is made of eggs, vinegar and oil, all three of which have been used for many years to give volume, shine and hydration to hair. For dry and damaged hair it's best used mixed with avocado, although it can be used alone.

Olive oil: try to use extra virgin olive oil for best results, this has been used for centuries for hair and skin moisturizing as it is nourishing and strengthening, perfect for dry and damaged hair!

Wrap either a warm towel or a plastic bag over your hair and leave for 20 minutes, then rinse.

Coconut Oil: not surprisingly, coconut oil is good for dry or damaged hair because it soaks into the hair shaft and coats the hair with it's nutrients. Coconut oil is also good for all parts of your body, so while you leave it in (You can use it on it's own, or as part of a hair mask), you can put some on your face or nails - or even your feet! - to help keep them soft and shiny. To use, you can wet your hair - but preferably leave it dry - then leave in for twenty minutes to an hour, after that, shampoo a few times - once or twice - to get all of the grease out of your hair (Or you can leave some on and sleep with it, and wash it out in the morning, for extra shine) and then, if you'd like to, condition as normal.

Eggs: commonly used due to their high levels of Omega-3 fatty acids, xanthophylls, immunoglobulins, vitamins and other micro-nutrients, eggs are good for strengthening the hair and hair follicles meaning that they are ideal for damaged hair. Can be used alone or mixed into other ingredients, in particular olive oil for a super moisturizing hair mask. If you do not like the smell of eggs in your hair, try a ready egg oil available in the market or online.

Gelatin: If allowed to set on hair, unflavored gelatin can provide a protective protein coating to the hair. Combine with water, vinegar, and a humectant, and deep condition afterwards for best results.

Glycerin: A strong humectant like honey, but without its bleaching properties. Always mix it with water before use.;

Mash a few up and apply to hair either alone or with other ingredients of your choice. You may choose to mix with a lightly moisturizing ingredient such as mayonnaise to prevent over-drying. Leave on for just 10 minutes.

Baking soda: this is an effective ingredient for removing build up of cosmetic products, grease and dirt from the hair. A tablespoon could be added to a moderately moisturizing ingredient, (eg. mayonnaise or yoghurt), or it can be mixed with water to make a paste and used in place of shampoo.

Lemon juice: a well known astringent, it closes the pores on your scalp, reducing oil production. Be warned that lemon juice may lighten hair colour if used regularly, especially if you go in the sun with it still on your hair.

Unless your hair is extremely greasy, it's best to only use these a maximum of once a month to avoid taking away too much oil which can cause the scalp to overproduce oil, (making it worse), otherwise try to use them with moisturizing things, either from the dry hair section, or combination hair section to ensure that the hair isn't being over-dried.

"
"
Use these suggestions if you have combination hair.,
Experiment.",How to Make a Hair Mask4," For the purposes of this article, combination hair is defined as hair that has both oil and damage problems. Most of the suggestions below aim to give the best combination of ingredients mentioned in the previous two methods, seeking to fix both issues.



Yogurt: probiotic, natural yogurt provides essential nutrients and moisture, including protein which is important as protein is the building-blocks of hair. It encourages hair growth and repair, but also helps to rinse away build up and grease making it ideal for combination hair. It's easily combined with other ingredients such as avocado if you wanted extra moisture, or strawberries if you need more oil regulation.

Mayonnaise and strawberries: mayonnaise provides moisture and nutrients to help moisturize and repair the dry areas of your hair, while the strawberries regulate oil production, and give a boost of vitamin C to the hair. Try using three mashed strawberries mixed into two or three tbsp mayonnaise.

Eggs and apple cider vinegar: eggs provide protein which is essential for repairing any damaged areas of the hair, as well as giving the hair nutrients and moisture without being too heavy. The apple cider vinegar would get rid of any dullness, rinse away any build up of grease and cosmetic product residue while being kind to the scalp by regulating it's pH and helping with dandruff. Try mixing 1 or 2 tablespoon (14.8 or 29.6 ml) apple cider vinegar into two beaten eggs.

Baking soda and yogurt: baking soda loosens any dirt, grime, grease or build up from the hair and scalp, while the yogurt would ensure that the hair receives all the nutrients and moisture it needs. Try mixing a teaspoon of baking soda into two tablespoons of yogurt.

, To find what works for your hair, and what doesn't, try different combinations of ingredients which you think might work for your hair type, adjust the length of time to leave it on your hair (generally between 10 and 20 minutes is fine), and the quantities of each ingredient in the mixture you use. Everybody's hair is different, so your ideal recipe will be unique too.

Combine the bleach powder and developer to create the mixture.,
Apply the bleach to completely dry hair.,
Cover your hair with a sheet of plastic wrap.,
Keep checking until your hair is sufficiently light.,
Rinse the bleach from your hair with cold water.,
Towel your hair and allow it to air try.",How to Bleach Hair Blonde2," Follow the instructions that came with the bleach powder, which will tell you how much of each to use. Then put the powder in a mixing bowl. Mix in the correct ratio of developer using a spatula or spoon.








The mixture will not look blonde; it should be blueish white or blue.
If you're using it, now is the time to mix in the red gold color corrector. Follow the instructions on the bottle.

, Use the tinting brush to paint on the mixture, one section at a time. Really saturate your hair with the mixture. Work from the ends of your hair up to within a few inches of the roots. To avoid hot roots, do not put bleach near your scalp while working with the ends of your hair.









If you have dark hair, wait 20 minutes after applying the bleach to your ends before putting it on the roots.
Keep a towel nearby to wipe bleach off your face or arms.

, Set a timer for 15 minutes to start. Check your hair's color by using a towel to wipe the bleach from a section in the front. If your hair still looks dark, reapply a little bleach to the section you wiped off, and let the bleach sit in your hair for another 10 minutes.









The bleach will cause your head to feel warm; it may sting. If it gets painful, wash it out immediately.

, Go in 10 minutes intervals until you reach your desired shade. Do not let the bleach sit for for more than an hour. It won't make your hair any lighter, and could cause serious damage to your hair and scalp.








, Keep rinsing until the water runs clear.Do not use a shampoo, since you just stripped your hair of all oils. Follow up with a deep conditioner or hair masque.









Avoid shampooing for 24 to 48 hours, if possible.

, Avoid blow drying it right after bleaching, as further damage may occur. Your hair should now be a yellow blonde color. It's fine to stop there if you like the results. If you want to make it platinum, you must also tone it.

, Use a clean tinting brush to cover your hair in toner in sections, exactly the same way you applied the bleach mixture. If you ended up with hot roots, pay special attention to those.








, Check the instructions on the bottle to determine exactly how long the toner should stay in your hair. It's usually approximately 30 minutes.







, Run your hair under water until the water runs clear. Use a shampoo made for bleached hair to make sure all the toner is removed.








, Use a deep conditioner for color treated hair. For the next few weeks, treat your hair carefully. Don't use too much heat, and avoid excess chemicals."

Create your hair-lightening mixture.In a bowl, create a mixture out of 2 cups of distilled vinegar, 1 cup of raw honey, 1 tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil, and 1 tablespoon of either ground cardamom or ground cinnamon.,
Dampen your hair.,
Portion off the hair to be highlighted.,
Apply the mixture to your hair.,
Secure and cover your hair.,
Let it sit overnight.,
Wash your hair in the morning.",How to Bring out Natural Red and Blond Highlights2," Beat it well with a spoon so all the ingredients are evenly spread throughout the mixture.


Although this method will work well on all hair colors, people with darker hair should increase the amount of cinnamon they use to ensure a noticeable lightening of the highlighted hair.

, You don’t want your hair to be soaking wet, so don’t take a full shower. Using your hands, splash water into your hair to get it just slightly wet throughout, all along the length of your hair.

, Just as in the previous method, decide which sections of your hair you want to highlight and section them off with clips.


You might want to pull the remaining hair into a braid or low ponytail, so it doesn’t mix too much with the hair you’re trying to highlight.
Because this method requires long-term soaking of the product into your hair, make sure you have good clips that will keep the treated hair in place.

, Dip an old toothbrush into the mixture you’ve made, and use it to apply the mixture to the hair that you want to highlight.


Undo the clip holding back each section of hair, and only work one section of hair at a time.
When you’ve finished applying the mixture, pull the hair back up into a clip.
Work your way through all the sections of hair you wish to highlight.

, Make sure the clips you’re using to keep your treated hair separate are securely in place. Reinforce them with bobby pins and hair ties if necessary; just make sure your hair won’t come down and get mixed with the un-highlighted hair.


Cover the top of your head (the highlighted section) with something secure; you might use plastic wrap, a tightly-fitted shower cap or swimming cap, or a towel pulled into a turban for drying your hair.
Make sure that the un-highlighted hair does not get pulled up into this wrap.

, Once your hair is covered, forget about it for at least eight hours. Your best bet is to begin this procedure in the evening, then sleep with the mixture soaking into your hair.


Cover your pillow with a towel if you’re worried about getting it dirty.

, Shampoo and condition your hair with high quality products, making sure all of the mixture has been rinsed. Repeat your shampoo and conditioning routine an extra time if you have trouble getting your hair clean.

Use the right kind of tea.,
Brew the tea.,
Make a hair mask.In a bowl, mix the cooled cup of tea with about two tablespoons of plain yogurt.,
Portion off the hair to be highlighted.,
Apply the mask to your hair.,
Secure and cover your hair.,
Let it sit for at least an hour.,
Wash your hair.,
Repeat once a week.",How to Bring out Natural Red and Blond Highlights3," Teas come in many different varieties and have different chemical makeups; chamomile tea is the type that’s commonly used as a natural hair-lightening product.

, Steep four bags of chamomile tea in 1 cup of hot water for at least 15-20 minutes. The stronger the tea, the better your results will be when you apply it to your hair.


Let the tea cool down to room temperature.

, Depending on how long or short your hair is, you might need more or less yogurt to make enough mask to thoroughly coat your hair.


The mixture should come together into a paste that will stick to your hair.
If it’s too runny with excessive tea, add more yogurt.

, Just as in the previous methods, decide which sections of your hair you want to highlight and section them off with clips.


Pull the un-highlighted hair into a braid or ponytail to separate it from the treated hair.

, Using your hands, work the mixture into the hair that you wish to highlight. Work section by section, making sure to keep treated hair separate from untreated hair.

, Make sure the clips you’re using to keep your treated hair separate are securely in place, reinforce them with bobby pins and hair ties if necessary. Cover the treated hair with plastic wrap, a shower or swimming cap, or a towel.

, The longer you let the mixture sit in your hair, the more distinct the effects will be. Note that the darker your hair, the longer you’ll have to leave the mask in to achieve a noticeable highlight. If you have darker hair — red, or dirty blonde, for example — leave the mask in for two hours rather than one.

, Take a shower, shampoo and condition as regular until the mask has been completely rinsed from your hair. Reapply shampoo and conditioner as necessary to ensure all the yogurt and tea is washed away.

, This is a temporary method of highlighting your hair that will fade within the space of about a week. For sustained results, apply this mask every week, preferably on the same schedule — every Saturday, for example.


This method works best on lighter hair colors. Blond and light brown and red hair will lighten slightly, giving the effect of natural highlights. Darker hair tones will not respond to this method.

Collect your ingredients.,
Slice and scoop out the avocado.,
Add two tablespoons of olive oil.,
Add an optional ingredient to the mixture.,
Treat your hair with a tablespoon of honey.,
Smash up some banana and rub it in your tresses.,
Apply a beaten egg to your hair.,
Rub some yogurt into your hair.,
Rinse your hair with some diluted apple cider vinegar.,
Dampen your hair.,
Coat hair with the hair mask.,
Leave the mask on for twenty minutes.,
Rinse the mask off and wash your hair like normal.",How to Make a Hair Mask for Super Silky Hair," You'll need an avocado and olive oil to form the base of your mask. When it comes to adding moisture back to your hair, the avocado works great on all hair types. It’s packed with vitamins– A, D, and E, to name a few– and contains fats and oils that nourish every strand of hair.Olive oil is a powerful natural conditioner, and it will make your hair shiny and smooth. If you don't have olive oil on hand, try coconut oil.
You may also add honey, lemon juice, or banana to your mask. You can do this hair mask every week, so you can try different mixtures of ingredients to see which works best on your hair type. Luckily, there is no risk of damage with any of these natural ingredients.;
, Using a knife, cut the avocado in half. Because of the pit in the middle, you’ll have to rotate the avocado to cut all the way around it. After you remove the pit, scoop out the inside. Because you’ll be mashing the avocado anyways, you don’t need to worry about removing the center in neat little slices. Put the avocado in a bowl and throw away the peel. The easiest way to remove the pit is by wedging your knife into it, and then pulling it out of the avocado half. If you don’t feel comfortable stabbing the pit with your knife, you can scoop out the pit with your spoon.
Don’t worry if there are brown spots inside the avocado. They wouldn't taste good, but they will be great for your hair.

, If you don’t have a tablespoon, you can certainly just eyeball this step. Using a spoon or fork, mash up the avocado as you mix the olive oil into it. Add enough oil so that you’ve created a consistency that will easily coat your hair. Continue mixing until there are no chunks of avocado, and the mixture is nice and smooth.

, Add a tablespoon of the honey or lemon juice, and mix. If you choose to add a banana, you may need to add a bit more olive oil in order to get an easily spreadable consistency. Whatever you choose to add, mix until everything is blended thoroughly. You can also skip the optional ingredient all together, if you only have an avocado and olive oil at your disposal.


Honey adds extra shine, so it's great for dull hair.
Lemon juice clarifies hair and can create pretty highlights.
Banana adds extra moisture, creating a glossy look.

, If you don't have time to create a deep-conditioning mask and want something you can apply quickly before a shower, try honey! Honey actually helps your hair retain moisture. It will also help soften your hair, leaving it looking sleek., Bananas are natural moisturizers. Not only will they smooth and soften your hair, they’ll also help to protect against breakage and frizz by improving your hair’s elasticity.They smell pretty good too!

, Eggs actually have multiple benefits for your hair. They're packed with vitamins, so they help moisturize your hair. They help make your hair look shiny and sleek. Additionally, they can stimulate hair growth and prevent dandruff. , Both the protein and acidity in the yogurt make it an excellent conditioner. The protein helps to repair your hair, helping to fight breakage and split ends. The acidity in the yogurt, like the acidity mentioned in the lemon juice, helps to smooth down the cuticle of the hair. This makes it appear sleek and smooth., This is a cheap and effective way to remove the buildup on your hair that accumulates from hair products. By removing the buildup, your hair will look less dull. It also makes your hair feel smoother and softer, which will keep it from tangling. Apply the vinegar and water combination after shampooing, wash it out, and you'll have shiny, beautiful hair.

, You can apply the mask after the shower, or you can wet your hair with a spray bottle. Because you’ll be shampooing your hair after you do the hair mask, don’t shampoo your hair directly before applying it. Shampoo can dry out your hair by removing the natural oils, so shampooing twice in one day isn’t recommended.If you’re applying the mask after the shower, let your hair air dry a bit before starting. Your hair should be damp, but not soaking wet.

, If you struggle with an oily scalp, start coating your hair an inch or so below the root.Embrace messy hands, because there isn’t a neat way to apply this mask. Run your fingers through your hair as you apply it, massaging the hair to ensure the mask coats the hair from all sides and you don’t miss any sections.

, By leaving it on for a bit, you give the mask time to penetrate the hair cuticle. In twenty minutes, your hair has time to suck up all of that moisture, and get the maximum benefit from the mask.Paint your nails, sip on some tea, or watch some TV while your hair becomes silky and beautiful.

, In the shower, wash your hair thoroughly. Once you’ve ensured that your hair is clean, shampoo and condition like normal (or use whatever products you typically use).For the best effect, let your hair air-dry. You will have shiny, soft, silky hair, from completely natural ingredients.

Ask friends.,
Call salons to find someone with experience.,
Schedule a consultation with a hair stylist.,
Ask questions.,
Make your first appointment.",How to Become Platinum Blonde Without Too Much Damage1," If you have a friend who recently went platinum or underwent another dramatic hair color change, ask for the name of her hair stylist. You can also ask friends and family for recommendations on hair salons and stylists who they think might be able to make you a platinum blonde without too much damage.You can also check out reviews of salons online to narrow your choices down. Look for salons that have high ratings from their customers.
If you get some recommendations, check out the stylists Instagram or other social media feeds where they post photos of their work.;
, If your regular stylist has experience with platinum blonde coloring, then you might simply go for a consultation with them. However, if you do not currently have a stylist or your stylist has expressed discomfort with taking you to this color, then call around to find someone who has experience turning people into platinum blondes.


Try saying something like, “I want to go platinum blonde without too much damage to my hair, and my current hair color is ____. Do any of your stylists have experience with this type of situation?”

, After you find someone who has experience, you can make a consultation appointment. Sometimes you can just drop into the salon and see the stylist between clients, but it is best to ask first.


Try saying something like, “I would like to stop in and talk with the stylist before I make an appointment. Do I need to make a consultation appointment, or can I just stop by when the stylist is working?”
Make sure to bring picture with you to your consultation so you can show the stylist what you want your hair to look like., Before you decide to make your first hair appointment with a stylist, it is a good idea to ask questions. This will help you to get a sense of how much experience the stylist has and how comfortable you feel trusting your hair to them.How many times have you taken someone from a shade similar to mine to a platinum blonde shade?
What process did you use to get the desired color without causing too much damage?
How many appointments do you think it would take to get me to a platinum blonde shade?
Do you have any photos of your work?

, If you feel comfortable with the stylist, then you can make an appointment with them. Be aware that you may not leave the appointment as a platinum blonde, but this is a safer route than trying to go platinum blonde in a day. Try to be patient with the process.


Keep in mind that going platinum with a professional can cost upwards of $300, and you also have to maintain it with regular root touch-ups and special brass banishing shampoo and conditioners. However, getting your hair done professionally will likely yield better results and it is also safer."

Gather your materials.,
Start with unwashed hair.,
Put on an old t-shirt and gloves.,
Mix the bleach powder and developer.,
Section your hair.,
Apply the bleach from roots to ends.,
Allow your hair to process.,
Rinse your hair thoroughly.,
Shampoo your hair twice.,
Apply toner if desired.",How to Become Platinum Blonde Without Too Much Damage2," Bleaching your hair on your own can be risky. However, if you use the right products and do not leave the bleach on for too long, then you may be able to get platinum blonde hair at home with little damage. Before you get started, you will need:


High quality powder bleach.
Lower volume developer, such as level 30.
Toner, such as Wella T18.Deep conditioning treatment.
Latex or vinyl gloves.
An old t-shirt or a smock to protect your clothes.
A towel.
A mixing bowl.
A color application brush.
A sink or shower to rinse your hair.

, Avoid shampooing your hair for two days before bleaching it. This will help to ensure that your hair and scalp have enough moisture to take the bleach. Otherwise, the chance of damage may be greater. You can also do a deep conditioning treatment a couple of days before bleaching your hair for added protection.

, Before you start mixing up the bleach, put on something that you don’t mind getting bleach on. An old t-shirt is a good option, but you can also wear a smock over your clothes if you have one. Also, put on a pair of gloves to protect your hands from the bleach.

, Read the instructions that come with the bleach you have purchased. The packaging should indicate the bleach to developer ratio for your formula. Using a small whisk, whip the bleach and the developer together until they are creamy. Only fill your color bowl about three quarters full because the bleach will expand while you are applying it.


Some bleaches, such as Wella Multi Blonde, are flexible with the amount of developer you can use to achieve your desired results. In this case, mix equal parts bleach and developer until your formula has the cream-like consistency you desire.
If the bleach you have purchased is more specific about the ratio of bleach to developer, such as Igora Vario Blond, which uses 1:2 parts bleach to developer, use a measuring cup from your kitchen to weigh your formula.

, Before applying any bleach to your hair, pull your hair into four sections. This will make it easier for you to manage the application. Part your hair down the center down to the nape of your neck. On each side, divide the top and bottom halves of your hair, and clip them in a way that keeps them secure and out of your way until you are ready to apply the bleach.If you have especially thick hair, you may need to divide your hair into more than four sections.

, Starting with the back of your head, apply the bleach using your color brush in thin layers. Gradually continue applying until this entire section of hair is covered, and then move on to the next section. Work in smalls sections going from the back of your head to the front.


Do not apply the bleach to your scalp. Just apply it to the roots of your hair near your scalp.
Remember to wear gloves and try not to get any bleach on your skin.
If you have previously bleached your hair and your roots are a darker color, do not apply bleach to your roots and ends at the same time. This will result in “hot roots,” which will not match the rest of your hair. In this case, apply bleach only to the roots of the hair.

, You may need to let the bleach sit on your hair for up to 45 minutes. Check the package to determine how long to leave it on. While the bleach is processing, make sure to check it every 5 to 10 minutes.There is no specific amount of processing time that will work for everyone. If the bleach has lifted enough color out after 10 minutes, rinse it immediately to prevent the bleach from processing further.
Do not allow your hair to process for more than one hour, even if you have not achieved your desired shade of blonde. At this point, the bleach will not lift any more color, and leaving it on is only causing damage to your hair., Rinse your hair with lukewarm water until you have gotten all of the bleach out of your hair. Do this before you use shampoo, as any bleach that is left on the hair after you shampoo will continue to process and may cause damage and have a drying effect on your hair., Once you have completely removed all of the bleach from your hair with a cool rinse, shampoo your hair. Whether you are using toning shampoo or hydrating shampoo, massage your scalp and hair as you wash to remove any remaining bleach residue. Repeat this process at least one time.


Do not use conditioner if you plan to use a toner after you shampoo. If you are using a toning shampoo to finish your color, you can use conditioner after you shampoo.

, While your hair is still wet, you can use a toner to finish your color. Use a purple toner to negate any yellow or brassy tones in your hair, and a blue toner to negate any orange tones.


If you are using a cream based toner, apply the toner in the same way that you applied your bleach, using a color brush.
If you are using a liquid toner, use a bottle to evenly pour the solution over your hair and massaged in thoroughly.
Leave your toner on for about 10 minutes and then rinse.However, for some toners, you may only need to leave them on for about 5 minutes. Check the recommendations on the bottle.
Keep in mind that toner is optional. If you are happy with the tone of your blonde, then you do not need to use a toner.

Go slow.,
Use protein treatments.,
Choose a sulfate-free shampoo.,
Consider skipping your roots.",How to Become Platinum Blonde Without Too Much Damage3," You might be able to achieve a platinum blonde shade in one go if your hair is naturally blonde already. However, going from a dark brown to platinum blonde can multiple treatments spread out over several weeks, especially if you have dyed your hair in the past.If you decide to bleach your hair on your own, try to be patient and go slow to reduce the damage.If you see a professional to go platinum, then your hair stylist will likely recommend that you break the bleaching sessions into at least two or three appointments.

, Protein treatments can help to rebuild hair after you have bleached it.These treatments are similar to leave in conditioners and you can purchase them in beauty supply stores. Try to use a protein treatment between each of your hair bleaching sessions and after any touch ups as well.

, It is important to reduce the harsh chemicals that you introduce to your hair, so switch to a sulfate-free shampoo if you have not done so already. Sulfates can dry out your hair, which will already be dry after bleaching it multiple times.Cut back on how often you wash your hair as well. Try to wash your hair only once or twice per week.Always follow your shampoo with a conditioner and use a deep conditioner about once or twice per week.

, Applying bleach to the hair near your scalp will probably burn. By skipping your roots, you will also ensure that the hair follicles close to your head stay healthy, which may help to reduce breakage.Some people like the way that dark roots look with platinum blonde hair. Try it out and see if you like it.

Add 1/4 cup of honey to 1/4 cup of olive oil and stir until well combined. Use your hands to work the sticky mixture into damp hair, ensuring even coverage. Cover your hair with a plastic shower cap or some cling wrap.
Leave the honey and olive oil mixture to sit in your hair for at least 30 minutes -- the longer you leave the mixture, the lighter your hair will be. When you're ready, rinse the mixture out in the shower -- it make take a couple of shampoos to get the sticky honey out of your hair.

, Chamomile flowers contain natural compounds that help to lighten blonde hair, making chamomile tea an easy and effective treatment.


Boil a pot of water, then place five chamomile teabags to steep in the pot. When the water has cooled completely, remove the teabags and pour the cold tea over your hair (preferably in the shower).
Allow the chamomile tea to sit in your hair for about half an hour before rinsing. Like with the lemon juice, the chamomile will work more effectively if you sit in the sun for a while as it dries into your hair.

, To add some caramel blonde tones to your hair, you can use cinnamon in a nourishing and delicious-smelling treatment.


Take a teaspoon of cinnamon (from a new jar to ensure it hasn't gone stale) and mix it with a generous handful of your regular conditioner. Work the conditioner through your hair, using a comb to ensure that it's evenly distributed.
Cover your hair with a plastic shower cap or some cling wrap and leave the cinnamon condition to sit in your hair for several hours, or overnight if possible. Wash the cinnamon out in the shower with shampoo.

, Rhubarb adds a yellowish tint to hair, which is good for people with darker blonde hair. It's best to use fresh, in-season rhubarb during the summer months.


Take two stalks of rhubarb, wash them, then roughly chop them into small chunks. Add the rhubarb chunks to a pot of cold water, then bring the pot of water to the boil over a medium heat. Once boiled, remove the pot from the heat and allow the water to cool completely.
Once the water has cooled, strain the out the rhubarb piece, then pour the water over your hair. Leave the rhubarb water to sit in your hair for 10 to 15 minutes (while sitting in the sun, if you like) then rinse out with fresh water.

, Baking soda can be used to strip chemical build-up from the hair while also helping to lighten blonde hair over time.


Take the baking soda into the shower and sprinkle it over your hair once it's wet. Use your fingers to work the baking soda into the hair. It should form a paste-like consistency when mixed with water.
Use this baking soda treatment to clean your hair (instead of using shampoo) at least once a week. Your hair will gradually lighten over time.

,


Take 5 to 10 tablets from a bottle of vitamin C supplements and crush them up using a pestle and mortar until they form a fine powder.
Add this vitamin C powder to your regular shampoo and wash your hair as normal. Do this once a week to gradually lighten your hair over time., Vinegar has been discovered as an effective hair lightener -- apple cider vinegar in particular.


Although it's possible to apply vinegar to your hair straight from the bottle, this can be very drying and damaging for your hair. Therefore, it's better to dilute the vinegar to half strength with water first.
Pour the diluted vinegar over your hair and leave to sit for at least 15 minutes before rinsing out and shampooing. Repeat once a week for a gradual lightening effect.

Start with ""dirty hair."",
Prepare your hair.,
Gather your poof.,
Tease the back section.,
Use hairspray.,
Divide the front section in two.","How to Make a ""Perfect"" Poof1"," Hair styles are easier to achieve with ""dirty"" hair.Dirty hair simply means hair that has been styled previously or has not been washed for a couple of days. The reason for this is that clean hair is harder to manipulate: it can have static and slip away more easily. ""Dirty"" hair, on the other hand, is more pliable and has the added benefit of being free of frizziness.;
, Brush your hair with a natural-bristle brush. It is softer than synthetic bristles and bends more easily, which means less hair breakage.Brush it until you're certain that it's free of tangles and snares.








, Separate a section of hair at the top of your head. Trace along the ""crown,"" where a crown or tiara would rest, and gather all of the hair in that area.









Make sure that you have equal portions from both sides.
Divide the section into two, with the back section containing one third of the hair.
Tie off the front section with a rubber band and push it forward or bend it to the side so that it is out of the way.

, Holding it straight up with one hand, tease the hair in the back section with a brisk up and down motion. Teasing creates volume, which you will need to get your poof to the perfect height. You can use almost any comb, but a thin-toothed long tail combworks best. The reason for this is that the close-set tines of the comb help you tease the hair from the roots, and the long tail makes sectioning off pieces of hair easier.








, Spray the front and back of the teased section of hair. Allow a couple of seconds for drying. Use a hairspray that has plenty of hold but that is also flexible. You don't want your hair to appear too stiff. Lay this section down as it becomes the base of your poof.








, Fasten the front section off again and move it out of the way. Repeat the previous two steps with the new back section. Keep dividing, sectioning off, teasing, and spraying until you reach the final section.









Lightly tease the bottom of the final section and lay it back.
Spray it in place, then use the tail of your comb to round out the shape of your poof.

Use Sun-In.,
Use peroxide.,
Use lemon vodka.,
Use a lightening shampoo.,
Use blonde hair dye.",How to Lighten Blonde Hair2," Sun-In is a classic hair-lightening product that became popular in the 90s. It is a very cheap and effect way to lighten blonde to medium brown hair, although the results tend to look more golden yellow than white blonde.


Sun-In can be purchased in most drug stores and online. It should be spritzed into damp hair, then worked through with a comb (this will prevent the color from developing unevenly).
Once the color is in, you should sit in the sun to activate the lightening agents. Alternatively, the heat from a hair dryer will also work. The more often you use Sun-In, the lighter your hair will be., Peroxide will effectively bleach your hair, leaving it a lighter shade of blonde. However, peroxide is also quite damaging for your hair, so it's best not to repeat this treatment too frequently.


Bottles of hydrogen peroxide can be purchased at the drugstore. Mix one part hydrogen peroxide with one part water and pour it into a clean spray bottle. Apply the peroxide solution evenly over your entire head of hair, but try to avoid your scalp as it is easily irritated by the peroxide.
Leave the peroxide solution in your hair for 20 to 40 minutes -- the longer you leave it, the lighter your hair will become. Just don't leave the peroxide in for any longer than 40 minutes, as it can severely dry out your hair.
Shampoo your hair twice to remove all traces of the peroxide and apply a deep conditioning treatment to your hair.

, Some sources recommend using lemon-flavored vodka to lighten blonde hair. The alcohol combined with lemon juice helps to strip pigment from the hair.


Pour the lemon vodka over your hair and use a comb to distribute it evenly. If you want more of a highlighted effect, dip a cotton ball in the alcohol and use it soak individual strands of hair, from the roots to the tips.
Sit in the sun for up to 30 minutes to intensify the bleaching effect of the alcohol, then rinse thoroughly and wash with shampoo.

, If you're looking for a less damaging option that will still effectively lighten your blonde hair over time, you should use a lightening shampoo and conditioner combo -- such as John Frieda's ""Go Blonder"" range.These lightening shampoos and conditioners use a combination of lightening ingredients that includes chamomile and citrus. They can be substituted for your regular hair care products and used on a daily basis.
They work best on hair that is already a light to medium shade of blonde, though darker blondes will still notice a gradual lightening effect over time.

, Of course, if you want lighter blonde hair in a hurry and you're willing to spend a little more money, you can always use hair dye.


Most store-bought kits will do a pretty good job of lightening hair (provided you follow the instructions), though the results can differ depending on your natural hair color.
All-over dyes are probably the simplest option, but if you are significantly changing the color of your hair the regrowth will be quite obvious, so you will have to reapply the dye every couple of months or so.
Alternatively, you can buy an at-home highlighting kit, where you only apply the color to strands of hair on top of your head and around your face (where the sun would naturally hit). These are a little trickier to apply, but don't require quite as much maintenance.If you don't feel comfortable putting color in your hair at home, see a professional stylist instead -- just be prepared to pay a lot of money for blonder hair!

Protect lightened hair from the sun.,
Be careful with salt water and chlorine.,
Don't over-wash your hair.The detergents in most store-bought shampoos and conditioners can strip the blonde color from your hair over time.,
Deep condition your hair at least once a week.",How to Lighten Blonde Hair3," Once your hair has been lightened, it tends to be a little more sensitive to sunlight. Blonde hair in particular can become brassy, yellow or faded by the sun.


Therefore, it's important that you protect your lightened hair by wearing a sunhat or by spritzing your hair with hairspray containing UV protection when outdoors.

, Salt water can fade and damage blonde hair, while chlorine dries it out and causes it to take on a green tinge.


You can prevent this from happening by rinsing your hair with fresh water before and directly after you go swimming.
You can also buy special protective hair masks which you apply to your hair before swimming to shield it from salt and chlorine.,


Therefore, you should avoid washing your hair every day -- most hair types don't even need it. Try to cut back to once every two or three days -- you can use a dry shampoo in between washings if necessary.
When you do wash your hair, try to use a sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner as these are kinder to hair.

, Lightened or dyed blonde hair is more susceptible to damage and color fading than other hair types.


Therefore, it is important to keep your hair well-conditioned in order to keep the color looking as luminous as possible. You can do this by deep conditioning your hair once or twice per week.
Use a store-bought deep conditioning product, a natural oil such as coconut or argan oil, or use a homemade hair mask using ingredients from your kitchen.

Build your poof.,
Brush the section of hair flat.,
Tie the section back.,
Loosen the hair slightly and push it forward.,
Secure your poof with bobby pins.,
Finished.

","How to Make a ""Perfect"" Poof2"," Gather the hair at the top of your head and separate it from the rest of your hair. Make sure that you've taken equal amounts of hair from each side. Just as in the previous method, you can imagine a crown resting on your head and grab the hair within the crown's circle.

, This is very important for getting the perfect poof with this method. If your hair isn't flat, it won't come out right. Having ""dirty hair"" will help with accomplishing this, since it tends not to be frizzy or wayward, as is freshly-washed hair.








, Hold it back with a small rubber band. For the health of your hair, avoid rubber bands that are just bare rubber. You want at least some type of covering to shield your hair from snagging. The size of rubber band depends on the thickness of your hair. However, since you'll be working with a relatively small amount of hair, it's fine to use a smaller rubber band.








, This method is great because it is very flexible. How far you push it forward depends on the size of poof you want. For a taller poof with more volume, push it farther forward. For a smaller poof, push it further back.








, Carefully place enough bobby pins in your hair to keep it place. After you're satisfied with how it looks, add a spritz of hairspray for a bit more hold. Finally, run a sheet of tissue paper over the top to smooth any fly-aways.

Dye your hair to achieve a darker shade, not a lighter one.,
Avoid washing your hair before dyeing.,
Perform a strand test first.,
Apply dye to the middle of the hair first.,
Avoid staining your scalp with dye.,
Stick to the instructed time.,
Rinse out according to instructions.",How to Avoid Common Hair Dye Mistakes1," While you can subtly lighten your hair by one or two shades with dye at home, generally a darker shade will take better to your hair. Avoid trying to make a drastic change by sticking to a color that is just one or two shades away from your natural hair.If you try to change your color dramatically, you might be tempted to dye your eyebrows to match. This is something you should never do, as it is unsafe to use dye so close to your eyes.
If you do want a much lighter shade than your own, go to a salon. You can bleach hair on your own, but it’s much easier to get consistent results from a professional. You shouldn’t try to go too dark, either. A good rule of thumb for a darker shade is one that is no darker than your eyebrows.If you’re trying to get your own highlights, they might turn out an unintentionally brassy orange. Try a toner or gloss in an ash shade a few weeks after the dye.Try mixing two hair colors that are one shade away from each other, or variants on the same shade, in order to create a more natural color change from your current shade.;
, Don’t shampoo your hair the same day you dye it. Leave some natural oil in your hair to protect your scalp and help the dye take to your hair better.If you need to clean your hair between shampooing and dyeing, just use some conditioner and rinse with water so you don’t strip away the protective oils. Your hair should be free of product buildup or dirt, otherwise color can become uneven., Test what your hair will look like once dyed by applying the dye to just one strand first. Let it dry completely to check the color and adjust the shade if needed.


Choose a strand of hair in an inconspicuous place so that it won’t be seen, or even cut a small strand away to dye it.
A strand test will also help you check for any allergic reactions you may have to the dye ingredients. You should also perform a patch test by placing a small dot of the dye on your inner elbow and waiting 48 hours to observe if there is any redness, itching, or discomfort., Try applying hair dye to the middle portion of each strand of hair before you do all the roots and ends. Dye usually processes faster at the roots due to the heat from your scalp, and can appear stronger at the ends if they are dry or damaged.If you have leftover color in your hair from a previous dye, apply dye first to the roots and down to where the leftover color begins in your hair.
Applying dye to one section of each strand first before going back through to do the rest gives that section a little more time with the dye on, which could compensate for any differences in color processing.

, Apply dye at your roots as close to the scalp as possible without rubbing it into the scalp, which can stain the skin and expose it to the harsh chemicals in the dye.


Try to lift up each strand of hair you are applying dye to so that the hair is away from your head.
Protect your hairline by dabbing on a small amount of baby oil, olive oil, or petroleum jelly to the edge of your face and neck where your hairline ends so that the dye won’t stick there.

, Follow the instructions that came with your dye as to how long to leave the color in your hair before rinsing it out. You can end up with no difference in your hair if it’s not left in long enough, or color that is way too strong and even damaging if you leave it in for too long.


If you’ve done a strand test, or more than one, and determined that the color looks best if left in for slightly less or more time, you can follow that timing for your full dye. Just make sure to rinse it out if you start feeling burning or itching.
Covering gray hair can require extra time. Consider purchasing a dye that’s specially meant for gray coverage, and follow any dye instructions about covering grays carefully.

, Follow your specific dye instructions on how to rinse out the dye from your hair after the allotted time. Generally, you should rinse with warm or cool water until the water runs clear.


Don’t skip the step in many dye instructions that says to add a small amount of water and work the dye in your hair into a lather before rinsing. This can help distribute the color and make the dye easier to wash out.Make sure all dye is gone from your hair and face after the rinse, and use an old towel just in case it gets stained with dye residue.
Moisturize your hair with your own rich conditioner or the small bottle that some dye kits come with.

Cover your workspace.,
Wear gloves.,
Protect your skin and clothes.,
Spray dye spots with bleach.",How to Avoid Common Hair Dye Mistakes2," Lay down old towels, rags, or drop cloths over the floor and surfaces on which you’ll be standing or sitting, laying down materials, or rinsing off.


The bathroom is a good spot to avoid dye messes because you have close access to a sink and a shower for the rinsing process. However, you should make sure you get good ventilation in your bathroom to avoid the chemical fumes.
Remember that you will have time to wait while the dye sits on your hair to process. Protect your hair and any other surfaces where you go during this time from coming in contact with one another.

, Always wear the plastic gloves provided to you in your dye kit, or purchase disposable gloves from the store, to protect your hands from the dye.


Wear gloves throughout the duration of your dyeing process, from mixing the dye to applying it. You can even keep the gloves on to rinse your hair out until the water runs clear.
Even if you have the gloves included with your dye, it’s a good idea to have other disposable ones nearby, in case the first pair breaks or it’s hard to apply the dye in the typically too-big, generic size that comes in your kit.

, Wear clothes you don’t mind getting ruined and cover your shoulders with a rag towel for extra protection. Dab petroleum jelly or oil around your hairline, ears, and neck to make it easy to wipe away dye from those areas later.


If you do get dye on your neck and ears, try using clarifying shampoo and a wet towel to dab away the stains after you rinse out the dye from your hair.You can also try baby oil, olive oil, or a gentle dish soap or laundry detergent to remove stains from skin., If your hair dye gets on the sink or counter or another surface nearby, spray the spot with bleach and let it sit for 10 to 15 minutes before wiping it away.If the dye got on clothes or other fabrics, you may be able to spot-treat it with bleach also, but these stains are very difficult to remove.

Use clarifying shampoo.,
Use a color reducer product.,
Add a little detergent or dish soap.,
Use vitamin C. Crush up effervescent or chewable vitamin C tablets and add the powder to your normal shampoo.,
Mix baking soda and lemon juice.,
Do a hot oil treatment.,
Go to a salon rather than keep re-treating.",How to Avoid Common Hair Dye Mistakes3," If your hair color ended up too dark after dyeing it, wash it immediately with a clarifying shampoo or one meant for dandruff control. Repeat washes frequently to start seeing less color.


Make sure you use a good, rich conditioner after every wash with a clarifying or dandruff shampoo, as these can be drying and strip good oils from your scalp and hair., Purchase a color reducer from many of the same brands that carry hair dye to help get rid of some of your dye color.


Note that there may be some difference between a color remover and a color reducer. A remover may contain bleaches that are harsher on your hair and could affect your natural color, not just the dye color. Reducers are more gentle at helping strip just the dye, so these should be favored.Be sure to follow the directions that come with the product carefully just as you would with hair dye instructions.

, Add a small amount of mild dish soap or laundry detergent to regular shampoo to help strip color out.


Note that this method is very drying, and you should condition hair well to help replace oils lost.

, Work this through all of your hair, cover it, and leave it on for 20-60 minutes to help lighten the color.Note that vitamin C can be too harsh or irritating on some scalps, so you should remove it right away if it’s bothering you.

, Try a natural treatment of fresh lemon juice and baking soda to pull some color out. Mix equal amounts of each together and let it sit in your hair for just a few minutes before rinsing it out.


Be careful not to leave this treatment in too long, as it is very drying and potentially damaging if left in.
Use this treatment to remove dye stains from skin, too., Apply hot oil to your hair and cover it for an hour to help pull out dye color.


Use this treatment if you don’t want to dry out your hair, or have already dried it out using other removal methods and want to regain some moisture. This method will actually nourish hair in the process.

, If your color is not coming out or looking how you want it too, try another shade in a few days or weeks. However, avoid re-treating your hair multiple times with home dye if you’re not getting it right. See a professional to fix it correctly.The more you dye your hair, the more damage you do to it and the harder it is for a professional to fix it. Save the money you’d spend on multiple hair dye kits and go to the salon instead.
Ask a colorist to do a very mild lightening bath on your hair, which uses a small amount of bleach and water, and careful monitoring. This is much gentler and less expensive than other extensive color removal processes."

Leave the mask on for 20 minutes.",How to Make a Ginger Hair Mask," Making a ginger hair mask is simple, but it does require some special ingredients and tools. To make a basic ginger hair mask, you will need:








fresh ginger
coconut oil
a vegetable peeler
a bowl
a grater
a sieve or colander
a spoon
cotton balls
a shower cap or plastic wrap;
, To help you extract the juice from the ginger, you will need to peel and grate it. Use a vegetable peeler to peel the ginger and discard the peels. Then, use the fine side of a box grater to grate the ginger directly into your sieve.








Place the bowl under the sieve to collect any juice that runs out as you are grating the ginger.

, Use your spoon to press the ginger against the bottom of the sieve. Keep pressing different spots until you have pressed most of the juice out of the ginger. After you have gotten plenty of juice into your bowl, you can discard the ginger pulp or use it for something else.







, Pour in a generous amount of coconut oil. Make sure that you use more coconut oil than ginger. Stir the oil and ginger together until they are well-combined.








Aim for two or three parts coconut oil and one part ginger juice. If there is more ginger than oil, then the ginger may sting your scalp.
If your coconut oil is solid, then warm it slightly to liquefy it, but do not allow it to get hot. Placing your coconut oil in a pan over low heat should be enough to turn it into a liquid.

, While ginger and coconut oil make a great simple hair mask, you may also consider adding some boosters to make your mask even more effective. Some ingredients that seem to promote hair growth and health include:



Green tea. Green tea may help to stimulate hair growth.Try adding a cup of fresh brewed green tea to your mixture.

Onion juice. Onion juice has been shown to promote hair growth in people with hair loss.Try grating an onion and adding the juice to your mixture.

Garlic. Garlic has been shown to stimulate hair growth as well.Try peeling and grating a few garlic cloves and adding them to your mask mixture.

, Before you put the ginger mask all over your scalp, you should test it on a small area of your scalp or on your inner wrist. After you apply the ginger, wait about 30 minutes and then check the area.









If you notice any redness or irritation, then do not use the ginger mask on your scalp. You may be allergic or at least sensitive to the ginger.

, If your skin looked and felt fine after your spot test, then go ahead and use the cotton balls to apply the ginger mask to your entire scalp. Soak a cotton ball in the mask and then press the cotton ball against your scalp. Keep soaking and pressing until your entire scalp is covered in the mask.







, After your scalp is coated in the ginger mask, use your fingertips to give yourself a three minute scalp massage.To massage your scalp, press your finger pads (not your nails) into your scalp and rub your scalp with small circular motions.








Do not scratch your scalp when you have the ginger mask on your skin. Scraping your skin while you have ginger on it will hurt.

, After you finish your scalp massage, put on the shower cap, plastic bag or plastic wrap. Make sure that the plastic covers your entire scalp and all of your hair as well. Otherwise, ginger and oil may drip onto your clothes while you wait.







, Allow the mask to stay on your scalp for 20 minutes so that it can fully penetrate into your scalp. Set a timer and relax.








If the mask starts to burn, itch, or irritate your scalp, then wash it off your scalp right away.
After your time is up, rinse, shampoo and condition your hair as you normally would.

Be careful not to get any on your hands or clothes., If the hair you are coloring has been permed, relaxed, or previously dyed, wait for only 10 minutes. If the hair you are testing has not been chemically treated, wait for 15 minutes. Use a kitchen timer or set a timer on your phone., Take the swatch of hair out of the bowl, and using a paper towel, wipe the color rinse solution away. Dampen your paper towel with a tiny bit of water, and wipe it a second time., If you are not yet satisfied with the intensity of the color, return the swatch of hair to the coloring product left in the bowl.

This is the length of time you will color the rest of your hair.In general, you should only about 20 more minutes.
However for stubborn gray hair, this could take up to 45 minutes.

, Shampoo your hair 12 to 24 hours before doing the color rinse. This will remove any build-up from styling products and allow for a nice even color. For best results, use a clarifying shampoo (such as Neutrogena Clarifying Shampoo) to remove build-up., Hair should be completely dry when applying color to it. Wash your hair with enough time to allow it to air dry (thus inflicting less damage on your hair), or if you are short on time, use a blow dryer., Any type of hair dye, including a color rinse, can seriously damage your clothes.

Store or dispose of leftover conditioner.",How to Make a Great Deep Conditioning Treatment1," You will want your conditioner to contain a mild detergent (like shikakai), an emollient (like olive oil), a protein or polymer source (like avocados or eggs) and thickeners (like avocado, bananas, or honey) in your conditioner. Have an acid like vinegar on hand to adjust the pH of the conditioner and pH paper. A variety of oils and botanical extracts can improve the scent, consistency, and add medicinal properties to your conditioner.


Neem, gandana, roman chamomile, ghikumar and amla are alternatives to using shikakai.;
, Incorporate the ingredients slowly, adding them to water. Make sure your conditioner is of the desired thickness and that it smells pleasant, as you are coating your hair with this material and will smell like it. Use any fragrance or essential oil you enjoy.


A natural option is the seed of the muscadine plant, which can be powdered and used for a musky scent.

, Add slowly, drop by drop, until the conditioner is at your desired pH. Measure using pH paper. Hair is naturally acidic, so test your conditioner to make sure it falls between 5.5 and 7 on the pH scale and does not damage your hair or scalp. Use soapy water to make the solution more basic if you overshoot and it becomes too acidic.

, Start with the tips and working toward the scalp (since conditioner is not used to cleanse or treat the scalp, but rather damaged hair fibers) then put on a shower cap. Wait for 20-30 minutes for a deep condition. You can heat the product beforehand to improve adsorption of the materials onto your hair cuticle. , Your hair should feel smoother and silkier as you rinse it. No film should build up, but if it does, perform a second rinse. The mineral content or “hardness” of your water will impact the coating and residue left behind on your hair. , Store it in the refrigerator or freezer for up to a day or two; these are highly perishable ingredients. Rubbing rancid fat or spoiled produce through your hair will not produce the desired results. Multiple conditionings in a few days are unlikely to be needed, unless you wash your hair every day.

, Use a blender or a food processor to combine your ingredients into a thick fluid. Make sure it is at the desired consistency, as your only fluid is your emollient, so add it sparingly to avoid making too much or too thin a conditioner. Add any botanical extracts or products you like to improve the smell and conditioning.

, Make sure your conditioner is as close to pH 7 as possible to avoid altering the consistency or texture of your hair overmuch. Add vinegar, drop by drop, and test with pH paper, until it is in the desired range. Add soapy water in small amounts if the solution is too acidic.

, Massage in from the tips toward the roots. Keep it in your hair for approximately 20 minutes, but effects should be visible within five to ten minutes. This conditioner is extremely gentle on the hair, but time beyond 20 minutes is unlikely to yield additional benefits.

, This conditioner will likely take several hot rinses to fully remove. It should leave hair shiny and more manageable than before, without altering your hair’s curl. Repeat the treatment if desired, and experiment with different emollients and thickeners like coconut oil or shea butter and honey or carnauba wax.

, You can store it in the refrigerator or freezer for a day or two, as these are highly perishable ingredients. Rubbing rancid fat or spoiled produce through your hair will not produce the desired results. Multiple conditionings in a few days are unlikely to be needed, unless you wash your hair every day.

Apply the conditioner.,
Rinse thoroughly.,
Store or dispose of excess conditioner.",How to Make a Great Deep Conditioning Treatment3," Avoid the use of a detergent, as this can damage the hair cuticle further. Maximize your use of protein sources to provide polymers to help repair damaged hair fibers. Consider using avocados and eggs as thickeners and polymer sources. Use mild emollients like shea butter or coconut oil.

, Make sure your ingredients are blending well. If you are using an emollient that is solid at room temperature, warm it up first. Add your thickeners, scents, and any additional botanicals you would like to add to the conditioner.

, Add vinegar or soapy water drop by drop to acidify or basify the conditioner. Use pH paper to measure the pH of the conditioner. Make sure it falls within an acceptable range of 5.5 to 7, trying to hew closer to neutral.

, Spread it evenly throughout your damp, untangled hair, from your tips toward your roots. Cover your head, and let it sit for approximately 20 minutes. Heating the conditioner can help spread it and help compounds in the conditioner bond with your hair.

, This conditioner should reduce damage to the hair cuticle or make some effect toward repairing it, reducing frizz, improving overall manageability, and produce smoother, more resilient hair. Repeat the treatment if you’d like.

, Store it in the refrigerator or freezer for a day or two because these are highly perishable ingredients. Rubbing rancid fat or spoiled produce through your hair will accomplish nothing good. Multiple conditionings in a few days are unlikely to be needed, unless you wash your hair every day.

Wash your hair less frequently.",How to Avoid Hair Color That Ages You," Work on enhancing and enriching your natural hair color instead of introducing an entirely new color. For example, dark brunettes should keep their rich tones and warm blondes should stick to golden tones. These tones compliment your skin’s complexion, helping you look younger and more natural.Making a drastic hair color change tends to be aging.
A drastic color change can end up looking brassy, as well.;
, Warm tones can brighten up your complexion and help you look more youthful. The warmer the shade, the more youthful it tends to appear. If you are blonde, avoid icy and ashy tones. Opt for warm, golden shades of blonde. Brunettes should stick to caramel and honey tones. Avoid ash brown shades. If you’re a redhead, opt for copper tones and avoid burgundy.


Cool tones can appear ""frosty"" and make you look older., Very dark hair colors can wash out your complexion. They can also make your hair look one-dimensional and flat, and the opaqueness will emphasize greys and regrowth. If you’re determined to have dark hair, go for a medium or dark chestnut brown. If you’re unsure which shade you should choose, go one shade lighter than the color you want. It’s better to err on the side of lighter color rather than going too dark.When coloring your hair at home, don't leave the dye on too long.
If you’re getting a professional dye job, ask for a single-process color close to your natural shade and subtle highlights one shade lighter than your natural shade.

, Very light blonde dyes can make your hair look nearly gray, especially if they are cool-toned ashy shades. They can also make your complexion look dull and washed out. Stick to warm, buttery blonde shades, which tend to look the most youthful. Don’t go more than two shades lighter than your natural hair color. Anything beyond that can have a very aging effect.Make sure there’s some contrast between your skin tone and hair color. For example, if you’re very pale, avoid dyeing your hair a similarly pale shade.

, Avoid experimenting with extreme colors like bright pinks, blues and purples as you get older. The older you are, the harder these colors can be to pull off. Extreme hair color dyes are usually made with very strong chemicals and often require a bleaching process before the bright color can be added.


Since hair becomes more delicate and dry with age, processing your hair with extreme colors can severely damage it., Doing this will keep your hair color looking natural and youthful. Since the fine hairs around your hairline soak up dye quickly, you could end up with a stark, wig-like line around your face if you don’t go a little lighter.


Whatever the shade is at the back of your head, use a dye that’s two shades lighter for your hairline.
Your hairline is the fine hair closest to your face and stretches from ear to ear., One-dimensional, monotone hair color is unflattering and aging, regardless of the hue. Multidimensional hair color looks youthful and more natural. Adding subtle highlights can give your hair more dimension. Go for warm, buttery and caramel tones, not cool or ashy tones, to create a sun-kissed, youthful look.Avoid stripy, conspicuous highlights, which look very unnatural.Super light highlights should also be avoided, since these can create a “frosty” effect and add years to your appearance.

, Lowlighting is the exact opposite of highlighting – the process involves dyeing darker streaks into your hair, which creates even more dimension. A good approach is to have the majority of your hair dyed a very rich hue that’s close to your natural color. Then add highlights that are one shade lighter than that hue and lowlights that are one shade darker.Lowlights should be done by an experienced hair stylist, since the process isn’t easy to replicate at home.
If you aren’t sure how to choose the right highlights and lowlights, bring three pictures of hair color you like to your next salon appointment. Your stylist can work with you to choose the right shades.

, Highlights and lowlights will add lots of dimension to your hair, but for best results they should be placed strategically. The brightest highlights should frame your face and “kiss” the top of your head. The darkest color needs to be underneath the majority of your hair.


Face-framing highlights will look more youthful because they add brightness and warmth to your complexion. They also look very natural., Brittle, thin hair that’s been damaged by over-processing can be extremely aging. If you’ve been coloring your hair frequently and it is starting to feel a bit like brittle straw, skip your next color session. Give your hair a few weeks of recovery time before coloring it again.


In the meantime, use plenty of hydrating hair products and protein treatments to get your hair’s strength back up., These can severely damage color-treated hair, especially professional-grade tools. Try to limit the use of heating tools to three times per week. Whenever you do use these tools, always use heat protection hair products along with them. Invest in a good heat protection spray, which should be applied before you use the heating tool.Hold your blow dryer no closer than 24 inches from your head during use.
Consider buying an ionic blow dryer, which can dry your hair very quickly and cause less damage then a traditional one.
Avoid wet-to-dry straightening irons, which are very damaging.

, Use sulfate-free shampoos and conditioners, since these ingredients can damage the hair cuticle, especially color-treated hair. Avoid alcohol-based hair products completely, since these are very drying.Use deeply hydrating products to keep your hair moisturized and in good shape.


Look for products with hydrating ingredients like glycerin, keratin, Argan oil, coconut oil, vitamin E, Moroccan oil and avocado oil.Use a deep conditioner or hair mask at least once a week., Each time you shampoo and condition your hair, color and moisture are being stripped out of it. The less you wash color-treated hair, the better. Try to make it a day or two in between washings to extend your hair color. Invest in a good dry shampoo, which you can use on the days you don’t wash your hair.Dry shampoo wicks away oil and leaves hair lightly scented.
Avoid dry shampoos with a powdery finish. These can leave a visible film on your hair, especially if you have dark hair.

For more dramatic results, go for shades two to four shades darker. If this is your first time dyeing your hair, you may want to try using temporary or semi-permanent dye rather than permanent dye.


Temporary dyes tend to diminish after 6 to 12 shampoos.
Semi-permanent dyes will wash out after 20 to 26 shampoos.
Permanent dyes last longer and will generally remain in your hair for six to eight weeks, but can sometimes remain longer.;
, Highlights are essentially the opposite of lowlights. Highlight colors should be one to two shades lighter than your natural hair color. For more dramatic results, go for shades three to four shades darker.

You may need to bleach your hair to highlight it, which is best done in a salon.

, Make sure your five sections are roughly even. There should be one section on the top of your head. Then, on either side of your head, separate the hair into two sections. When you're done, you should be left with one section of hair on top and four sections on the sides. Use rubber bands or hair clips to secure your hair., Let down one of the sections. Starting at the top of the section, insert the end of your comb through your hair. Only a very thin section of hair should be on top of the end of the comb. For highlight and lowlights, you apply dye to very thin chunks of hair., Wrap a towel you are comfortable getting dye on around your shoulders. The towel will catch any dye drips and you can use it to dry your hair after the rinsing phase of the dyeing process. Secure the towel in place in front of your neck with a clip or safety pin.

, Dyeing kits generally come with gloves, but if yours doesn’t come with gloves, you can just wear normal latex or rubber gloves. Wearing gloves ensures that you don’t dye your fingers and nails along with your hair., Take a piece of foil. Slide it underneath the section you just secured. Let the hair rest on top of the foil. The foil should create a barrier between the strand you pulled out using the comb and the rest of the hair in the section you're working with., You will apply your highlights and lowlights in a consistent pattern throughout your head. You can start with one highlight, and then move to two lowlights, and repeat this pattern throughout the section, for example. Choose whatever pattern you prefer depending on the ratio of highlights to lowlights you want.Highlighting means coloring strands lighter than your natural hair color while low lighting means coloring strands darker than your natural color.

, Use the brush that came with your dye kit. Dip your brush in a small amount of the highlight dye. Then, brush down the hair above the foil in the dye so it's covered from root to tip in dye. As you brush, the hair should become plastered to your foil.You can leave the hair for now as you continue to apply foils/dye. You will fold up the foils when you're done with the section.

, Repeat the same process you did with the tail comb before, moving downward through the section of hair. Just below the hair you just died, slip the end of the comb under a small strand of hair. Place a piece of foil under that strand to create a barrier between this new strand and the remaining hair in the section., You should add your lowlight dye to this section to create variation. This is the exact same process as before. Gently paint the dye on the hair using the brush that came with your kit, moving from root to tip. Again, the hair will become plastered to the foil., Keep moving from your highlight and lowlight shades, using the ratio you want. Continue the pattern until the entire section is dyed and separated by foils., Gently fold the pieces of foil around each section of hair. Do not press too hard to avoid getting a folded crease in your dye. The ends of the foil should be near the roots of your hair when you're done. Folding the foil helps it stay in place while you dye the remaining sections., For every section, repeat the exact same pattern to highlight or lowlight your hair. Separate your hair into small strands, using the foil as a barrier, and then paint dye on each strand. Vary between your highlight and lowlight shade. Once every strand is dyed, wrap the foil around the strands.Remember, you may have to bleach your hair first in the sections you're highlighting. This is usually best done at a salon and should be done before you start the highlight/lowlight process.

, Refer to the instructions on your dye to figure how long to let it sit in. Times will vary depending on the type of dye you're using. Do not leave the dye in longer than recommended, as this can damage your hair., Remove the foils from the bottom to the top. Use cool water to rinse out the excess dye. Continue to rinse your hair until the water coming off your head runs clear.


It is totally natural to have a whole lot of color run in the shower. Do not panic if this happens. It does not mean your hair did not dye properly. It's a normal part of the process.

, Your kit should come with this conditioner, but if it did not, you can purchase conditioner made for dyed hair at a drugstore. Do not wash your hair with shampoo or normal conditioner. You should avoid washing your hair with these things for 24 to 48 hours so that the dye has time to really into your hair shaft."

Cut and juice your lemons.,
Dilute your lemon juice with water.,
Apply the mixture to your hair.,
Head out into the sun.",How to Lighten or Brighten Dark Hair With Lemon Juice1," Slice your lemon in half. If you have a hand juicer, you can use it to speed up this step, otherwise simply squeezing the lemon by hand works fine. Over a cup or other container, squeeze the lemon until all of the juice is thoroughly drained. You may accidentally get a few seeds in your cup, but that’s OK.;
, Because lemon juice is acidic, you run the risk of damaging your hair if you apply it directly.Instead, create a mixture of one part lemon juice three parts water.You can add the water directly to the cup, or make it even easier by combining both ingredients in a clean, empty spray bottle. This will make applying it to your hair even easier. Stir or shake the lemon juice and water together.

, If you are using a spray bottle, you can spritz it throughout your tresses or focus on the top layer to get sun-kissed highlights. If your lemon juice and water is in a cup, use a pastry brush or hair color brush to apply the mixture wherever you’d like to lighten. You can focus on your ends for a gentle ombre effect, or paint the mixture in streaks for highlights. If you have enough mixture, you can coat your entire head of hair in it!

, Think of sunlight as the lemon juice activator. When your lemon juice-coated hair warms up in the sun, the lemon juice opens the cuticle and fades pigment.Apply this treatment to your hair every time you know you’ll be spending a few hours outside, and watch as your hair gradually lightens!

Use a toner after bleaching.,
Find purple toner in a drugstore.,
Mix it with red gold corrector (optional).,
Mix with a creme developer.,
Apply according to label instructions.",How to Whiten Yellow Hair1," Dark hair often ends up with orange or yellow tones after bleaching. The right toner will cancel out these brassy tones and makes your hair closer to white or platinum blonde.;
, Just about any pharmacy should carry toner, and you might even find it in the hair product aisle of a supermarket. Pick a purple or violet toner to remove yellow tones.

, If you also have undesired reddish tones in your hair, buy red gold corrector from a salon or online. Mix this with the toner according to label instructions.


Green or blue toner will cancel out reddish or orange tones without the need for a corrector, but will leave your hair yellow, not white.

, Choose a developer with 30 volume or less. High volume developers may make bleached hair weak or even cause it to fall out.

, Check the toner label to find out how long you need to leave it on your hair. Leaving it in too long can make your hair purple, so don't overdo it.


Alternatively, a very easy option is to simply book an appointment with a hairdresser for a toner to be put in. It takes less than half an hour, and can be as cheap as about $20.

Apply to your hair before exposing it to sunlight.",How to Lighten or Brighten Dark Hair With Lemon Juice2," Boil about one cup (240 mL) of water and then add two bags of chamomile tea. Allow it to steep, becoming a potent tea.Chamomile, like lemon juice, has the ability to naturally lighten hair. Because it is not acidic, it is more gradual and less damaging to your hair., For this recipe, you’ll want to juice three large lemons. Slice them into halves and squeeze them over a container. Watch for any seeds that fall into the juice, and remove them.If you have a hand juicer, you can use it to make this step a bit easier.

, By adding one tablespoon (14.79 mL) of coconut oil or almond oil to your lemon juice, you’ll help protect your hair against damage. The oil provides moisture and nourishment, which will help counteract the drying properties of lemon juice. Then, mix in one teaspoon (4.93 mL) of cinnamon. Cinnamon has lightening properties, so it will work with the chamomile and lemon juice to lighten up those strands., The best way to do this is to pour everything into a spray bottle and shake. If you do not have an empty spray bottle to use, you can simply mix everything together in a bowl. Stir thoroughly.

, Only put it on the areas of hair you wish to lighten. You can spray it all over your head, or select strands to highlight. Apply it before you head outdoors, and the sunshine will activate the lighteners, helping to lift pigment and lighten your hair. The oil will help to keep your hair hydrated and healthy."

Select a purple shampoo for regular upkeep.,
Wash your hair with purple shampoo.,
Repeat every two or three washes.",How to Whiten Yellow Hair2," A purple color-correcting shampoo will counteract the yellow tones and make your hair appear brighter and blonder. This is not as strong as toner, since it is intended for regular use. Here are a few examples of purple or violet shampoos:


Tressa Watercolors Violet Washe Shampoo
John Frieda Sheer Blonde Color Renew Tone-Correcting
Clairol Shimmer Lights
Pravana Pure Light Brightening Shampoo for Blonde, Silver, or Highlighted Hair
Any shampoo with ""D&C Violet"" or ""Extract Violet"" in the ingredients list

Repeat up to three times a week.",How to Naturally Darken Your Hair1," You should be able to find it at a specialty spice shop or a grocery store that carries Indian and South Asian food products. Be sure to the purchase the cooking oil (preferably cold-pressed), not the essential oil: essential mustard oil can irritate the skin.


Stop using the oil immediately if your experience any skin irritation. You may even want to perform a patch test (placing a coin-sized amount of the oil behind your ear) 48 hours before using the oil.
You might also find mustard oil in the international foods aisle at your local grocery store.;
, Mustard oil is banned for edible consumption in the EU, USA, and Canada. The oil is high in erucic acid, which can cause heart problems, anemia, and increase the risk of lung cancer., Before placing the oil on your hair, place it in a small bowl and warm it up slightly in the microwave or in a small pot on the stovetop. Be careful not to heat it up too much: just slightly warmer than room temperature is fine.


If you didn’t warm the oil up in a bowl, transfer it to one after you’ve warmed it up and bring it over to where you’ll be applying the oil to your hair.

, The oil could stain your clothes, skin and work area. Take the following precautions:


Be sure that you’re wearing old clothes or at least a towel over your shoulders to protect your clothes.
Wear gloves to protect your hands from being stained by the oil.
Apply a layer of petroleum jelly or a thick moisturizer over your neck, ears and hairline to protect them from being stained.
Cover your work area in newspaper or old towels.

, Start with the ends of your hair. Once your ends are saturated with oil, work your way up towards your roots. Ensure that the oil is evenly applied to your hair as you go by gently massaging the strands between your fingers and/or hands.


You can apply the oil with your hands, with a hair dye application brush, or with a bottle applicator, which is made for runny products. You can purchase a hair dyeing brush or a bottle applicator at a drugstore or beauty supplies shop.

, Once you’ve reached your roots, give yourself a scalp massage. This will help moisturize your scalp. Many people claim that rubbing mustard oil into your scalp can also promote hair growth, but there is little to no scientific evidence for this., Work your hands through your hair to make sure that all of your hair is evenly covered with oil. Running a wide-toothed comb through your hair will help ensure even distribution.

, In a pinch you can also fashion a plastic grocery bag into a cap around your hair., The oil needs time to soak into your hair. You can even leave it on overnight.

, Wash your hair with a mild shampoo. You may need to wash it twice to get the oily feeling out. As your hair will likely still have some oil in it, you may want to forget the conditioner lest it make your hair look greasy.

If you really want to use conditioner, apply only a small amount to the bottom half of your hair.

, You can apply mustard oil to your hair up to three times each week.

Mix some of the dye into your normal conditioner.",How to Achieve Pastel Hair," If your hair is not platinum blonde or white, you will need to bleach your hair. If this is your first time bleaching your hair, start with a bleach kit. The kit contains dye and peroxide to bleach your hair.


Bleach kits will be labeled as white, blue, or purple. Blue and purple add in cool tones to help combat brassy-ness. Blue is more ideal for canceling out orange hair, and purple is best for yellow. White bleach is normal, with no added tones.
If this is your first time bleaching or dyeing your hair at home, you may want to seriously consider going to a hair salon to get your hair bleached. Bleaching is the hardest part of this whole pastel hair process and improperly bleached hair can end up looking really fried and dead. Consider going to a hair salon to get your hair bleached and they do the pastel dyeing yourself (or have them do the whole thing).;
, Bleach will irritate your skin when it comes in contact with your scalp. To avoid this, or at least lessen the irritation, you should not wash your hair for several days before you plan on bleaching it. The natural oils of your hair will help to reduce the irritation caused by the bleach.


Using a toner over already yellowy-blonde hair may be enough to lighten your hair. Try this before using bleach. Virgin Snow by Manic Panic is a great toner and won't set you back too much cash.
Alternatively, if the toner just doesn't cut it you may use a bleaching method such as this. A less harmful way to lighten your hair is a bleach bath. (a bleach bath is a mixture of half bleach, half shampoo)

, The developer (peroxide) comes in either 10, 20, 30, or 40 volume. Bleach kits will not contain 10 volume, however, because it is not meant for this use. Do not use a kit with 40 volume developer, it is too strong and can damage your hair badly.If your hair is already light blonde, use a 10 volume developer. While you may find it odd to bleach your hair when you are already blonde, using a 10 volume developer will help to open up your hair and make it more receptive to the pastel dye.
If your hair is light to medium brown or strawberry blonde, use a 20 volume developer.
If your hair is dark brown or black, use a 30 volume developer.
Keep in mind, the higher the volume of developer, when you use it with bleach, or determines how FAST it processes. NOT how light your hair will get.

, Strand tests will help you to see how long you need to process your hair. Snip a few strands of hair at the base of your neck (in an area where no one will notice) and use a piece of tape to wrap the strands together. Mix one spoonful of the bleaching powder from your kit with one spoonful of the peroxide developer.Dip your hair strands in the mixture. Wait five minutes and then wipe the dye off with a cloth. Continue dipping the strands and waiting five minutes until the strands are the color you want your hair to be. This amount of time will be how long your need to bleach your whole head of hair for.
Do not rely on the results of your strand test too heavily. Different areas of hair will process at different speeds, and might even have different chemicals on them.

, This will be the same area you dye your hair in. Lay old towels (ones that you don’t mind staining) down on any of the surfaces near where you will be working, as dye has a tendency to stain everything it touches (that is the purpose of dye after all). You will also need a tint brush with a pointed handle, some latex (or rubber) gloves, and a non-metallic bowl. You should also place an old towel around your shoulders.


If possible, ask a friend to help you with the actual bleaching process, as it can get a little tricky to just do by yourself.
If your bleaching kit did not come with a tint brush, you can buy one at any beauty supply store.

, Follow the directions on the bleach kit box to properly mix up the bleach. You will want to use a bowl that you do not care about or that is white, as bleach can suck the color right out of ceramics. Plastic bowls are the best for mixing dyes.

, Use the pointy handle of your tint brush to divide your hair down the middle of your head so that your part is directly in the middle of your hair. Then divide your hair from ear to ear so that you have four sections of hair. Use clips to hold these sections in place.

, If you have a friend around, now is the time to ask for their assistance. If not, make sure you are standing in front of a mirror so you can see what you are doing. Take a thin section of hair from the top of one of the back quarters. ‘Paint’ that strand with the dye, starting one centimeter away from your root and going all the way down to the bottom of the strands. Brush your hair with the dye from top to bottom (the direction that your hair grows) leaving that one centimeter at the top uncovered (you will dye it later.), Repeat the same process with the strand below each dyed later, continuing to flip each dyed layer over to reveal the next layer of undyed hair. You will have to work quickly, as bleach starts working almost immediately. When you are done with one quarter, move onto the next until all of the quarters of hair are dyed.

, Do this when that quarter of hair has turned golden blonde. This time, run the tint brush from the root of your hair all the way to the end of each strand. Repeat this process with each section of hair.

, When your dyed hair has reached a pale blonde color (that is more white than blonde) its time to rinse the bleach out. Wash it out with shampoo. In preparation for the dyeing process, you should use a pre-color shampoo. Do not use conditioner, as it will make the dye job uneven. Rinse your head thoroughly.

Your hair may or may not be platinum when you are done. The instructions on your bleach will likely say you can leave it on for 50 minutes. That is a bad idea. If your hair is still dark (or very orange) after 30 minutes, you may need to bleach again. It's better to bleach two times for 30 minutes than to do it once for nearly an hour.
It is not common for hair to bleach white! The lightest you need to have your hair when bleaching is a pale yellow. Once your hair has reached the pale yellow point, you need to use a high lift blonde permanent color, or a toner, to make it white. Bleaching past white is dangerous, as once it is white, there is no more pigment left and will break (fry, melt, fall off) if chemically processed much further.







, If you can stand to, blow dry your hair to speed up the dyeing process--blow drying your hair with high heat will help your hair absorb the dye.

, It is absolutely essential that the conditioner be white. The conditioner acts as the base that you will mix the dye with. Once you have pour the conditioner into a mixing bowl, add the color.


The best color dyes to work with when making pastel dye include Manic Panic, Pravana, Crazy Color, and Special Effects, among others. (Splat is not suggested)

, Mix these two ingredients together so that the color is thoroughly worked into the conditioner. As a general rule, the color you see in the bowl will be the color that your hair gets dyed. Continue to mix in the dye until the color in the bowl is the color you want your hair to be.If you are concerned about the dye washing out of your hair, add enough dye that the mixture becomes one shade darker than you ultimately want your head ot be.

, Start at the roots of your hair and work the dye from the roots to the ends of your hair. You can choose to use either an applicator, brush or your hands to do this. Sometimes, your glove-covered hands will actually work the best. If you have a friend around, ask them to look for any spots you may have missed, or have them apply the dye to your hair for you.

, Putting your hair in a shower cap while you wait for the dye to process is essential. The shower cap ensures that the dye does not dry out (thus resulting in a patchy dye job). The processing time depends on how dark you want your hair to be--generally for a normal (versus light or dark) pastel color, you will want to let the dye process for 30 to 45 minutes. However, the length of time is up to you--keep an eye on your color while it is processing., After 20 minutes or so, wash one strand of your hair and check to see if it is the color you want. If it is too light, let the dye continue to process. Continue to check every 5 to 10 minutes to ensure that the color does not become too dark.

, Once your hair has reached the desired color, rinse it out with cool water. You do not need (and should not use) shampoo or conditioner. Don’t be alarmed that color will wash off your head and down the drain--this is natural and will not affect your dye job.

, Wet hair always looks darker than dry hair, so it is important to let your hair dry before you freak out. Use a blow dryer and dry your hair thoroughly.

, If you find that one section of your hair is lighter than another (and you don’t want it to look that way) re-apply dye to that spot and let it process again. Make sure to check on it often to make sure it doesn’t become darker than the rest of your head.

, If you want to keep up your new color, adding some of the dye to your conditioner will help to keep your color from fading.

Add the mixture to your hair.,
Leave the mixture on for 30 to 90 minutes.,
Wash your hair.,
Repeat once a week.",How to Naturally Darken Your Hair2," Amla powder — a powder made from Indian gooseberries — is easy to find for online, but may be more difficult to find in your local shops. If you would prefer to buy it in person, you may be able to find it in shops that carry Indian products or natural/herbal products., Place 2 teaspoons (9.86 ml) of amla into a bowl. Then, add 1 teaspoon (4.92 ml) of any oil to the bowl— many people use coconut oil. Next, add 1 teaspoon (4.92 ml) of water to cover the amla and oil — hot water is recommended. Stir the ingredients together so that the mixture is smooth.

, Measure out 3 teaspoons (14.8 ml) of conditioner and add it to the mixture. If you have very long hair, you might want to double or even triple the amla-oil-water-conditioner recipe. Use a ratio of 2 parts amla, 1 part oil, 1 part water, and 2 parts conditioner.

, As amla does have darkening properties, wear clothes that you don’t mind being stained. You can also just put a towel over your shoulders if you’re confident that you won’t spill any of the mixture on your pants or socks.

, If you've washed your hair in the last 48 hours, then you needn’t wash your hair, as you’ll be shampooing the mixture out afterward.


If it's been more than 48 hours since you've washed your hair, then your natural oils can prevent the amla from absorbing.

, Spread the amla-conditioner mixture into your hair as you would a conditioning treatment. Ensure that it’s evenly distributed, paying special attention to your scalp and the ends of your hair.


Amla has strong antioxidant qualities that make it very good for your scalp, so take time to give yourself a bit of a scalp massage while the mixture is on your head!, You may want to put a shower cap or plastic bag over your hair to protect your furniture and clothes.

, Use lukewarm water to cleanse away the mixture. Hot water can remove some of the color.

Gather your other materials.,
Protect your clothes, skin and work area.,
Make a paste with the henna powder.,
Divide your hair into sections.,
Apply the henna paste to your hair.,
Wrap your head.,
Wait.,
Wash it out.,
Be careful of staining.,
Avoid overuse of henna.",How to Naturally Darken Your Hair3," You can purchase henna hair dye from a number of retailers — both in person and online. Most natural foods stores and even some drugstores will carry henna hair dye. Many people swear by the hennas sold at shops that carry Indian products as these are believed to be purer.


If you buy henna from a natural foods or drugstore, read the ingredients to ensure that it only contains natural ingredients. Some manufacturers combine henna with the harmful chemicals commonly found in regular hair dyes.
Note that pure henna powder will dye your hair a reddish brown color. If you’re looking to go dark brown or black, it will likely have other plants (for example, indigo) in it. Just be sure to read the label to make sure that all of the ingredients in the package are natural!
If you want to use henna, remember that it is a vegetable dye, so it cannot be removed from your hair or lightened with bleach or other dyes.

, You’ll need a stain-proof bowl to mix the henna paste in, plus a whisk to mix the henna paste with. You’ll also need hair clips to section off your hair as you apply the paste, gloves to protect your hands, and a hair dye application brush.


You will also need something to cover your hair once the henna is on: shrink wrap is a popular choice, but a shower cap or plastic bag will also do.

, Dyeing your hair with henna can be quite messy. Wear clothes that you don’t mind getting stained. At the very least, cover your shoulders with an old towel. To prevent the henna from staining your skin, rub petroleum jelly or a thick moisturizer around your forehead, neck, and ears. Protect your workspace with some newspapers or old towels.

, How you make this paste will depend upon the manufacturer’s instructions, how much henna you need, and what color you’re going for.









Common ingredients for a basic henna paste are boiling hot water, lemon juice, and the henna powder. The texture you want is similar to mashed potatoes.Some henna manufacturers require that you let the paste sit for several hours before applying. Read the instructions that came with your henna package to see if you need to let it sit.

, Use hair clips to divide your hair into sections. How many sections you need to divide your hair in depends on your hair’s thickness and length. Aim for at least six: two at the nape of your neck, two near the center of your head, and two at the top.








, With your gloves on and starting at the base of your neck, apply the henna paste to your hair. With each section of hair, start at the ends and work up to the roots. Once you’ve applied the paste to a section, clip the section back up so that it’s out of the way of the other sections of hair.









Be sure that you add a lot of paste to each section of hair. You want your hair to be fully saturated.
You might find it helpful to apply the henna with a hair dye application brush. If it’s too chunky for the brush, don’t worry! It’s also okay to apply it with your (gloved!) hands.

, Many people recommend using plastic wrap to cover the henna after it’s been applied. If you don’t feel comfortable doing this, you can also use a shower cap or a plastic grocery bag. The key is to ensure that your hair is covered and close to your head.









Wrapping your head is very important because it will keep the henna from drying out, which would make it stop working.

, How long you let the henna sit on your hair will depend on the manufacturer's instructions and how intense you want your color to be. You will likely need at least a couple of hours. Some people even leave it on overnight.








, Make sure that you’re wearing gloves for this part, otherwise your hands will get stained. Once you’ve rinsed all of the henna out of your hair, you can shampoo and condition it as normal.


You might find it more effective to wash your hair in the sink or under the faucet in the bathtub. It will be pretty messy as chunks of henna come out of your hair, which is why many people prefer not to do it as they shower.

, In the first few days after you’ve dyed your hair with henna, the color may rub off on pillow cases and clothes, so be careful about where you put your head until you’ve washed your hair a few times!

, If you use henna too often, it can dry out your hair and will build up on your ends, making them very dark and dull. Instead of doing an all-over application, just touch up your roots."

You could also add some cinnamon and conditioner for extra highlighting.

Avoid using bottled lemon juice. It contains preservatives that aren't good for your hair.
The precise amount of lemons you'll need varies depending on how long your hair is.;

, Concentrate on the parts you want to lighten. You can coat your hair all over or focus on a few strands, depending on what you're trying to achieve.

Highlight your hair with chalk.",How to Highlight Hair," For highlights, you’ll either need to use bleach or a dye that’s lighter than your hair color, depending on your hair’s color and condition. It's best to aim for a color that is one to two shades lighter than your base color. Going too light can create an unnatural, stripy effect. If you have the option, go for a box that comes with a toner. That's the stuff that can take care of harsh tones, making them appear more natural.


It's best if you find a dye that is conditioning and drip-free (it'll say on the box if it is). Dyeing your hair is bad for it -- so if you can retain any moisture at all, you'll be much better off.
If you have dark hair, make sure you match your natural shade with the shade on the box. That'll be how your hair takes color.
If you’ve dyed your hair before, your hair will only lighten with bleach. If your hair has been colored with henna or vegetable dyes, it won't lighten at all.;
, Wrap a towel around your shoulders or cut a hole in a plastic garbage bag and pull it over your head. Wear the gloves that come with your kit to protect your hands from the bleach. The last thing you want is a bathroom covered in dye.


As for your hairline, cover it with vaseline if you'd like. You'll then be able to skip the step of getting the dye off your ears and neck. Just make sure not to get any in your roots!

, Most highlighting kits come with an applicator tool that can be a bit cumbersome if you're new to the dyeing club. If you have the time, use it with your normal conditioner for practice. You'll see how it can sometimes be a bit splotchy or gloopy if you don't get it just so.


If it's too big (which often it is), buy a baby toothbrush and use that instead. Sometimes the brush is so big it creates chunky streaks that are less than desirable.

, What it all comes down to is that you should follow the directions on the box. These things (and often companies) have been around for years and the process has been refined and can be trusted. So read the directions. Then read them again. Just to be sure!


The only thing you should consider not doing is using the cap. If you have really long or thick hair, the cap can be more of a nuisance than not. If you're worried about getting the dye places you don't want it, you can put cotton balls/wipes or paper towels underneath the sections when you're finished with them.

, Before coloring your entire head, test the dye out on one strand of your hair to ensure that you’ll like the finished results. Choose a strand that’s on the underside of hair and process for the full recommended time in order to accurately assess the result., Follow the instructions that come with your box kit to determine how the color should be mixed. Don't freak out if it's white, blue, or purple -- that's totally normal.


If you’ve never dyed your hair, omit bleach and use a permanent dye instead.This will damage your hair less and can lift your hair color up to three shades.
Don’t use bleach if you’re going for a more natural look.
If you’re using bleach, pour it into a small bowl so that you can easily dip the brush into it.

, At least. If you'd like to divide into 12, that wouldn't be a terrible idea. Use hair clips or rubber hair ties to keep your hair in place. You don't want your post-dyed sections to mesh with the sections you haven't done yet.


If you have time, do a strand test to make sure you have chosen the right shade and to determine how long to leave the bleach in. It could save you from a hair disaster. A disast-hair? Nah.

, Start a couple of inches away from your roots and apply the bleach from that point to the ends in very thin stripes. The thinner the highlights, the more natural the color will look, whereas thick highlights will create a zebra-stripe effect.When the brush is almost dry and contains very little color, feather up towards the root. This will produce a softer, more natural effect and prevent any spots or splotches.


Don't start applying at your root. You risk getting it on hair you don't want to get it on and starting out with a big glob and too much dye -- definitely not a good thing.

, If you’re using dye to create highlights, keep the color on your hair for as long as the box instructions recommend. Leaving it on for more time won't get you a richer color. If you’re using bleach, keep an eye on your hair to make sure that the highlights don't get too light.


If you use bleach, rinse it out the moment you see that it has lifted your highlight color to your preferred lightness. When bleach is left on too long, it can cause severe damage to your hair.
If you are not sure how long to leave the dye on, always go with a conservative estimate. If the highlights aren't light enough, you can always go back and redo them.
Remember that highlights continue to get lighter with sun exposure and continued washing.

, Some at-home highlighting kits include a toning solution, which will help blend the highlights in with the rest of your hair. This is a very good idea. It can give you a more natural, shinier tone. In fact, if yours didn't come with one, you can buy one separately.


As with everything else, just follow the directions. They'll be fairly straightforward.

, Shampoo your hair twice and then condition your hair in the shower, using the special conditioner that comes with your box, if there is one. Rinse it thoroughly, making sure all the dye has come out.


Bleach can dry out hair (if you're dyeing your hair a lighter shade, it's bleach), so leave the conditioner in for 2-3 minutes before rinsing to help restore moisture. Hydration is key right now.

, Check the final result in a mirror using natural light. And don't freak out! If it's a little off, give it a couple days. That initial wash or two could tone it down.


If you really, really don't like it, consider going to a professional. You don't want to damage your hair any more than you need to. The process can be done twice, but if you can avoid it, do so.

, Lemon juice has natural bleaching properties that can add subtle highlights to hair without the damaging effects of bleach. It's like the sun in fruit form.


Squeeze the juice of several lemons into a small bowl. Apply the juice to the strands of your hair from root to ends using a paintbrush, your fingers, or by dipping your strands into the bowl. Sit out in the sun for 20-30 minutes to activate the bleaching effect.
This method works best on light hair, as darker hair may turn orange or brassy.

, If you want to add some colored streaks to your hair, you need look no further than your kitchen pantry! Kool-aid can be used to achieve purple, red, pink, and green highlights.


Boil water in a medium-sized pot. Add 4-5 packets of sugar free Kool-Aid and mix until the powder dissolves. Apply the Kool-Aid to your hair in streaks using either a paintbrush, your fingers, or by dipping your hair into the pot.
Leave the color in for 10-15 minutes before rinsing.

, If you're brunette and just looking for a some lighter tones for dimension, consider rinsing your hair in chamomile tea until you see the desired effect. Just brew a pot, leave it to cool, and use it to rinse your normal conditioner out of your hair. Then go relax in the sun!


This won't drastically change the color of your hair -- it'll just add some natural, sun-kissed tones. It should take about a week.

, If you're looking for a temporary, fun color, you can ""dye"" your hair with chalk. It's easier with lighter hair, but darker hair can take on a more subtle, is-it-or-isn't-it-look that's fun, too. It's super temporary, of course!


If you have very light hair, the tint can last through a wash or two. If it doesn't come out completely immediately, it will come out within the next few washes.

Give your hair a rest for a while.",How to Go from Black Hair to Bright Blonde," Removing all that black pigment from your hair is going to be a potentially damaging process, so if your hair is ""over-processed""; i.e, frizzy and dry with breakage from over-coloring, straightening, or blow-drying, you need a deep conditioning treatment. Turn any conditioner into a deep conditioner by following these instructions:


Wet your hair and shampoo, rinse and towel dry.
Apply enough conditioner to your hair to completely saturate it. You can add a teaspoon full of olive oil if your hair is particularly dry or prone to flyaway.
Then wrap your hair in saran wrap or cling wrap, covering all your head. You can use a shower cap if you have one.
Wrap your plastic-covered head in a towel and let the conditioner sit on for 10 to 15 minutes. The heat from your scalp will open up the hair shaft and allow the conditioner to deeply penetrate into the follicles.
After the time is up, rinse your hair with cold water.
You may want to take a week or two and do several deep conditioning treatments.
If your hair is still too damaged, you shouldn't proceed.;
, This process can take several hours. It's not something that can be rushed. It can take 4-8 hours in a salon under the best circumstances.


Don't do this at night if there's a chance you will fall asleep, get distracted or not monitor the process with 100% of your attention.
Set a kitchen timer to sound when you should check your hair.
Plan your bleaching session on a day when you don't have plans. Try to do it when the beauty supply store is still open. You may need to make a rush trip back to purchase additional supplies.
Don't bleach on freshly-washed hair. Your natural oils help protect your scalp.
Don't do this before an important event. You may need to make an emergency appointment with a local salon to cut breaking ends or fix problems with your color (purple hair, orange hair, etc.) Many things can go wrong. Allow a few days to get to a salon or to retreat your hair. Doing this for a special event tomorrow may not allow you enough time to undo any problems.

, The best and pretty much only way to get that black off your hair is to use bleach. Go to your local beauty supply store and get two packets of powder bleach and at least a two ounce container of 40 vol. developer. Make sure you buy enough to get the job done. Buy more if you have longer hair. You will also need: a plastic or glass, definitely non-metal, color mixing bowl, a color brush, a processing cap and gloves. You can find these all at a beauty supply store.


Choose your color carefully. You will need to recolor your hair with a blonde shade, after you have removed the color from it with the bleach. You won't want to leave your hair bright yellow, which is probably where you'll end up if you start out with black. This is when the laws of color apply. Do you want to be icy platinum? Then you need to cancel out those yellow tones by using a violet based shade of blonde in the 10 to 12 level area, and perhaps add a violet intensifier. If you are looking for a more neutral shade of blonde, choose a color that says ""N"" or Natural. You probably shouldn't go for an ash, because that means the base color in the formula is green. Either way, violet cancels out yellow on the color scale, and blue cancels out coppery orange. Any color with a violet/blue base will take out the yellow and give you that bright blonde you are looking for.

, You can leave it unparted if short.

, If a few inches of your natural color is showing through, you will need to leave those unbleached until the black hair has begun to process. If all your hair is black, naturally or through coloring, you can bleach it all at one time. Remember however, to leave the hair closest to the scalp unbleached until you are done with the mid-shaft and ends of the hair, because the heat from your scalp will cause it to process faster.

, Stir until lumps are dissolved and a creamy consistency is achieved. Make sure you are wearing your gloves during the bleaching process.

, Make sure to thoroughly saturate and don't let any section get dry. If your hair is dry, it is no longer processing. Most bleach mixes appear violet or blue. Rest assured this is not the color your hair is going to be.

, Once bleach is applied to all mid-strand and end pieces, go back through and apply to root area., Make sure to keep a constant watch. Check your hair after 10 minutes, then every 5 to see how it goes. Black hair goes through stages of red, brown and yellow in succession before turning blonde. If your hair is red, just be patient, make sure the bleach isn't dry, and wait. To check each section for its true color, you must take a towel and rub off a bit of the bleach. If it isn't as light as you want it, reapply the bleach to the wiped section and wait.

, You don't want bleach on your hair for more than 30 minutes, really. It's a very strong chemical and it may take you more than one application to get it to platinum, if that's how blonde you want to be. When you have reached a point where all areas on your head are a consistent shade of buttery yellow, you probably need to rinse it all out. Make sure to rinse very well!

, Depending on how fragile your hair is, now might be the time to recondition your hair, before putting any toners on it to change the shade of blonde from yellow to neutral or ash. If that is the case, repeat the instructions for deep conditioning the hair. Apply conditioner and cover with saran wrap/shower cap, followed by towel. Leave on for 10 minutes. Rinse. Don't use conditioners that contain tint, such as those made for brunettes.

, Once it is on, you will probably not need to let it sit for very long, as your hair is already very porous from the bleaching. 10 minutes is usually sufficient. 15 at the max, if you feel like the color isn't lifting enough, for those of you using 40. Once again, heat from your scalp will be magnified, speeding up the coloring process, if you wear a processing cap/shower cap, or cover your head in saran wrap.

, Then condition, condition, condition. Heck, you could probably use another deep conditioning, but a leave in conditioner in addition to a silkening treatment will suffice if you cannot stand to rinse your hair any more for one day.

, That's enough chemical processing to satisfy anyone for one round. Remember these things when caring for your newly blonde locks in the future:


Blonde hair is more sensitive to sun and heat damage. Always spray on a thermal protectant before you blow dry, and again before you flat iron. There are some hair serums and sprays you can apply to dry hair that contain UV protection, so use them!
To maintain the health of your hair through chemical processes such as this one, use a deep conditioner at least once a week and a leave in conditioner or silkening treatment; Moroccan oil, Biosilk's Silk Therapy, or Chi's Silk Infusion, after showering. Do a deep conditioning with a quality deep conditioner in addition to the daily conditioner you use following shampoo. Deep conditioners are often found in tubs (not bottles).
Don't go in the pool for a few weeks. The chlorine can mess up your color.
Be good to your hair and it will be good to you! If you feel like you need more color, consider adding highlights through clip-in or glue in extensions, for a temporary change, or a demi-permanent color or glaze, for less damaging colors that eventually fade, leaving you freedom to play.

, For full coverage, spray the mixture over all your hair and give it a few light brushes.


Add highlights, if desired. Soak a cotton ball in the lemon and orange mixture and slide it down the strands you want highlighted. Try to keep track of which strands were lightened, because the process takes a while and you'll have to reapply the lightener several times for it to take effect.
If using the lemon conditioner mixture for dry hair, take a pastry brush or similar item and brush the hair you want lightened with the mixture. This mixture will have more body and be slicker than the lemon-orange-water mixture, so it will be harder to get highlights with it.

, You will need to sit outside in direct sunlight for at least an hour to an hour and a half to begin seeing any color change.

Touch up your hair regularly.",How to Dye Your Hair Green," During the dyeing process, and the bleaching process that often takes place before dyeing, it's likely that dye will transfer to your clothing. Due to this, you should only wear clothes when bleaching or dyeing that you don't mind getting ruined.


If you don't have any clothing that you're OK getting dye on, you should consider using a poncho or a hair styling cape to cover yourself and block any spattered or dripped dye. However, this solution does not guarantee that dye won't somehow still get onto your clothes.;
, The darkness of your natural hair color will determine whether or not you'll need to bleach your hair first. Natural blondes may be able to apply hair dye directly to their hair with good results, but if your hair is tinted or tinged, like strawberry blonde, for example, this will influence the outcome of the dye job.


It may help you to use a hair color wheel to better determine how much the base color of your hair will affect your dye job.This resource can be found easily online through a keyword search for ""hair color wheel.""
It's very likely that if you're a brunette, redhead, or even a darker shade of dirty blonde, you'll need to bleach your hair before applying any dye to it.

, Bleach is a harsh chemical. If used improperly, it can cause serious damage to your hair. Because of this, you may want to consider having your hair bleached by a professional or by a friend/relative who has previous experience bleaching hair.


Hair bleach should be mixed and applied according to its directions. Generally, this involves mixing a powder with water in a squirt bottle or bowl, and applying the mixture directly to your hair with either the squirt bottle or a brush applicator.
Avoid washing your hair before bleaching it. That oils that build up in your hair naturally over time will help protect your hair from the harshness of the bleach. To this end, you may want to soak your hair in coconut oil over night before bleaching.You may want to give you hair as much as five to seven days without washing before attempting to bleach it.
Dye can also be harsh on your hair. To prevent your hair from getting damaged, you may want to wait one to three months if you've recently dyed your hair before attempting to bleach.
If you have a lot of hair or especially thick hair, you'll likely want to buy a second bleach kit. This way, if you run out of bleach partway through the process, you have more bleach on hand., The longer you allow the bleach to stay in your hair, the more powerful its color stripping effect, but also the more damage it will do to your hair. You should always follow the directions that came with your hair bleach for best results, but generally you can expect that light shades of hair will bleach in 15 minutes, while darker shades may take 30 minutes or several applications.


For most kinds of bleach, it is recommended that you cover you head with a shower cap while the bleach sets in. This way the bleach saturates your hair, resulting in a uniform end color., To most effectively protect your hair and remove the bleach from it, you'll want to use a PH neutralizing shampoo while rinsing.You be sure to rinse your hair very thoroughly with cool or cold water, as bleach remaining in your hair will continue to lighten it and do damage to it.


The low temperature water during your rinse will prevent additional heat damage to your already chemical treated hair.
Depending on the darkness of your hair, you may need to bleach you hair several times to reach the lightness necessary for your dye to work effectively. You should wait about two weeks between each application of bleach.

, As there are many different kinds of hair dye, there are many different methods of preparation you may have to follow for it. For the brightest green, a straight green dye will likely be your best bet. Follow the directions on the packaging for best results. Generally, you'll want to use the mixing bowl that came with your dye to prepare it.If your dye did not come with a mixing bowl, a plastic bowl or small tupperware container may work. However, the dye may permanently stain your mixing container, so only use those you're comfortable staining/tinting green.You may want to blend two separate dyes, one blue and one green, together to modify the hue of your green dye. The more blue you add, the more the intensity of your green will be diminished.Be thorough in your dye mixing, whether mixing a single color or two separate ones. If you fail to mix the dye thoroughly throughout, your hair may end up being dyed inconsistently.

, Different dyes will have different instructions for application, and you should follow these to get the best color from your product. In most cases, your hair should be sectioned into parts to ensure a thorough dyeing, and an applicator or a dye applicator brush should be used to spread the dye onto your hair.Have whoever is applying the dye massage the product into your hair to ensure the dye saturates your hair and dyes it consistently throughout.
Be sure whoever is applying the dye to your hair is wearing latex, rubber, or vinyl gloves when dyeing. Hair dye can sometimes take many days to fade from your skin.
To prevent dye from staining the skin along your hairline or around your ears, you may want to spread Vaseline or lip balm along these parts. This will make the dye easier to remove.

, Depending on the dye you have used, you may need to wait 30 minutes for the dye to work its magic, or you may need to wait several hours. Most kinds of dye show up more intensely if you allow more time for the dye to set, but you should be careful not to wait too long. The chemicals in the dye could end up damaging your hair., These directions will most often instruct you to use cold water and conditioner. In many cases, using shampoo, especially when the dye is still fresh, can strip the color from your hair. You should be careful when doing this, since rinsing dye out can cause it to spatter and stain surfaces.You should use an old towel or one that you don't mind getting dye on. Residual dye will likely stain your towel when drying.

, If this is your first time dyeing, you may find that your color is a little bit off or, in the worst case scenario, completely wrong. Although you'll have to wait some time before your hair is ready for another treatment, another round of bleach can strip your hair of that color and a fresh application of dye can get you to the shade of green that you desire.


To prevent damage to your hair from frequent exposure to chemicals, you should give your hair two weeks minimum before bleaching. For color applications, you may want to wait as long as a month.
Each person's hair is different, and some hair holds up to chemical treatments better than others. If you are unsure your hair is ready for another treatment, you may want to consult a professional., Blow drying and hot water can strip the color from your hair, leaving your dyed locks looking faded or tired. If you live in a region that has hot weather and bright, sunny days, you may also want to wear hats to protect your hair from the sun, which can bleach color from it., Even ""permanent"" hair dyes won't last forever. Eventually that color is going to fade, though with a color like green, there will likely always be some remaining tinge to your hair until you cut it. Infrequent washings will help protect the color of your hair and make it last longer.You should also avoid chlorinated pools. This chemical can sometimes alter the hue of your hair color or cause it to fade rapidly.
You may want to try using dry shampoo so that your hair feels clean but is spared the color sapping effects of water.
When you do wash your hair, you should use cold water to prevent dye from leeching from your hair as much as possible.
You may also want to change your shampoo to one that is formulated to protect color after dyeing. These can be found at most salons or pharmacies., To keep your dye-job looking fresh, you may want to use leftover dye to touch up your hair every two to four weeks. In some cases, you may be able to mix in your coloring agent with your conditioner to freshen it up without having to go through the trouble of the whole redyeing process.


Touching up your hair with conditioner and remaining dye works best with intense and vibrant colors. Pastel colors don't usually stick very well when only washed through your hair."

Pick a color scheme.,
Prepare your dyes.,
Cut several sticks of celery at their thickest sections.",How to Dye Hair with Leopard Spots1," You’ll need to choose three colors: one base color, one border color, and one fill color.


Keep in mind that it is easiest to do a lighter base color and darker border/fill colors.






The typical combination for realistic leopard spots is a yellow/blonde base color, a black border color, and a lighter pink, red, or brown fill color.





;
, Place your border and fill colors in their own individual cups or bowls. If the dye box has specific instructions for preparing your dyes, follow them at this time.

, Make sure to cut them flatly and evenly.


For varying spot sizes, cut some of the celery thinner than others. You will be using this celery to make the actual spots.

Go out in the sun.,
Swim in salt water.,
Swim in a pool.",How to Fade Hair Dye2," The sun is a natural hair lightener and color fader. Exposing your hair to sunlight will help it turn a few shades lighter over time.

, The salt helps to loosen the dye from your hair. If you swim in the ocean a few days a week, you'll notice your hair color fading in time., The chlorine acts as a color remover, fading your hair after prolonged exposure. This isn't great for your hair, though, so don't rely on this method if you have others at your disposal. Chlorine makes hair straw-like and brittle in addition to fading color.

Use a chemical dye remover.,
Try baking soda.,
Make a homemade color stripper.",How to Fade Hair Dye3," This should be a last resort, since the chemicals are tough on hair and could cause brittleness and split ends to occur. If you dyed your hair a dark color, chemical dye remover can lighten it up. Follow the instructions on the package to treat your hair with dye remover, then rinse it out and examine the results. Repeat if necessary.


Test the dye remover on a discreet lock of hair before using it on your whole head.
Chemical dye remover doesn't work on hair that has been dyed lighter; it only works to remove darker colors.
Do a deep conditioning treatment on your hair to restore it to health after using a dye remover.

, This is a natural way to remove dark color from your hair. Make a paste with 1/2 cup of baking soda and 1/2 cup water. Massage it into your hair and let it sit for 15 minutes, then rinse with hot water. Repeat as many times as you'd like until you've achieved the color you want.


Condition your hair well after using baking soda, since it strips your hair of its natural oils.

, This must be used within 30 minutes of the color application.


Mix together 1 tablespoon bleach powder, 25 milliliters (0.85  fl oz) 40 vol/6% peroxide, and a bit of shampoo.
Apply the color stripper to wet hair. Use as you'd use normal shampoo.
Emulsify and rub the hair for approximately 3 to 5 minutes. Take great care not to get it in your eyes!
Use a mirror and check to see the color lifting.
Rinse well. Towel dry. Apply conditioner or treatment.

Find a good salon.,
Bring a photo.,
Have realistic expectations.,
Set aside a decent chunk of time.",How to Get Silver Blonde Hair2," Attempting to dye your hair platinum blonde by yourself is a bad idea.The process tends to be very long, and involves a lot of chemicals that can seriously damage your hair if you don’t know what you’re doing. You may be able to go blonde out of a box, but to achieve truly silver hair you should enlist a stylist’s help. This can get expensive, but it’s not something you want to skimp on unless you want to risk ending up with fried, orange hair, and a burning scalp.If you have very light blonde hair to begin with, you may be an exception to this rule. In this case, a quality toner applied to your hair may be enough to get silver hair. Even so, if you have never used toner before, it is highly recommended that you go to a stylist the first time around, so they can show you the ropes., You might be surprised at how many shades of white and silver there are. Bringing in a photograph to show your stylist will help ensure you get exactly what you want., It will probably take a few sessions to get your hair truly silver. This is especially true if you have naturally dark hair or have colored your hair before. You should also be prepared for the process to be painful, as the bleach often creates a burning sensation on the scalp., Don’t expect to be in and out of the salon in an hour. Keep your schedule free on the day of your appointment, and be prepared for it to take a while.Don’t panic if you don’t see ideal results the first time. You may need to lighten your hair to a darker blonde first, then gradually lift to silver.

Consider carefully.,
Get your supplies.,
Mix the bleach.,
Apply the bleach with your rat tail end brush.,
Let the bleach do its thing.,
Apply toner.",How to Get Silver Blonde Hair3," If your hair is short, straight, light in color, undamaged, and neither very thick nor very fine, you may be able to successfully bleach it at home. If your hair does not meet all these criteria, you can certainly attempt to bleach it yourself, but you should be aware that the odds are significantly against you, particularly if you have never bleached hair before. Whatever kind of hair you have, if you decide to bleach it at home, you should be prepared for the possibility that it will go very wrong. If having fried, yellow hair for a while would make you feel awful, it’s best not to attempt this.

, You will need a powder bleach (like L’oreal Quickblue), developer (ideally the same brand as the bleach), toner (Manic Panic is a popular brand), a plastic mixing bowl, a plastic spatula, a plastic rat tail end brush, deep conditioner, a few pairs of rubber gloves, some cotton strips, and a friend to help you.







, There is no universal rule and you’ll need to follow the instructions on the bleach you purchased. Usually, though, the ratio is between 2:1 to 3:1 of developer to bleach. Use 10 or 20-volume peroxide developer for the best results. Higher volume developers will not lighten your hair better – just faster – and cause more damage.









Be sure to mix the bleach thoroughly. Use a whisk and mix till no powder clumps remain.

, Use the tail end to section off very thin segments of hair, and the brush end to spread bleach onto both sides of your hair. Start at the crown and work down through the sides and back.








Start about 1 inch away from the scalp and work to the ends, saturating very thoroughly. Apply the bleach to thin sections of hair and put cotton strips at the roots – this will stop bleach from running toward the scalp.
The parts of your hair that already have bleach on them will begin to lighten as you work. If you notice any spots you missed, reapply bleach to those areas.

, Consult the instructions that came with the bleach to determine how long you need to wait. Check your hair as you go. It will not be platinum blonde yet, as you have not yet applied toner. The important thing to look for is lightness. You don’t want orange hair, but yellow is fine. If you do wind up with orange hair, it’s time for an appointment at a salon. When your hair is pale yellow, hop in the shower, rinse out the bleach, shampoo, and deep condition your hair.









You will feel itching and burning on your scalp. This is natural, but if you are in serious pain you should rinse it out and make an appointment at a salon, rather than burning your scalp.
If your hair is still quite yellow, it hasn’t been lightened enough and may turn green or brownish when toned.

, There are many brands you can buy and the application will vary based on which one you select. In general, though, you’ll need to towel dry your hair, apply the toner, and then comb it into your hair and let it sit for a while. When the right amount of time has elapsed, hop back into the shower and deep condition again.

Use purple shampoo and conditioner.,
Touch it up with toner.,
Baby your hair.",How to Get Silver Blonde Hair4," These often smell a little funky, and the color can be scary at first, but purple shampoo and conditioner will help keep your hair that striking white color, without developing brassy tones. The concept is similar to when people with blotchy skin use green face powder to reduce the redness of their complexion; because purple is the opposite of yellow, it counteracts those unwanted hues, and keeps your hair looking silver.You can use these once or twice a week. Don’t overdo it – everyday use will give you too strong a hue.

, This will help keep your hair that pristine white color. Some toners are also purple, like shampoos and conditioners designed for bleached hairs. The application process will be different for different toners, so follow the instructions on the box.


Again, be sure not to overdo it. Touch up with toner every couple of weeks at most. More than that and your color might start to look drab and flat.
Consider having this done professionally the first time around if you have never done it before. Your stylist can teach you some tricks to make sure you are comfortable doing it on your own., Bleaching does an incredible amount of damage. It will need to be treated with extra care.


Only wash it a 3 or 4 times a week, and apply a hair mask every time you do.Blow dry and curl it as infrequently as possible, and use products designed to protect hair from heat when you do.
Use only sulfite-free products, to avoid damaging and yellowing your hair.Once or twice a month, apply liquid coconut oil to the ends of your hair, wrap it in a towel, and let it sit for a few hours."

Try adding a ""helper"" or ""enhancer"" lightener to the above lemon juice and water solution.",How to Dye Your Hair With Lemon Juice2," In combination, one of these methods can produce stronger results.









Try lightening your hair with Cassia Obovata. Cassia is a plant that contains a faint golden or slight yellow dye. It's known also as ""neutral henna"" and will give your hair a golden tone.
Spritz on chamomile tea to lighten to your hair. Chamomile tea works best on light brown or blonde hair. Spray it in the same way you would lemon juice or hydrogen peroxide.
Drench with diluted hydrogen peroxide. It may not be ""natural"", but it certainly works. (Lightening your hair with lemons, even though they are ""natural"" still causes damage to your hair in much the same way hydrogen peroxide does.)
Try a bit of cinnamon to lighten those locks! Cinnamon works nicely on dark hair and it sure smells better than hydrogen peroxide. Give it a try!
Sweeten that color with a bit of honey. Honey is another good lightening agent. It's natural, doesn't dry your hair like lemon or peroxide and it works!
Combine lemon with honey and cinnamon for an excellent conditioning hair lightener. Follow the above lemon water method, only also add cinnamon and honey to the lemon water.

Start with clean, damp, tangle-free hair.,
Pull your hair up into a bun, with the bottom layer loose.,
Consider massaging some light-hold styling mousse into the bottom layer.,

Tie the braid off with a mini hair elastic and tuck the end unto the elastic.,
Keep braiding in ½ to 1 inch (1.27 to 2.54 centimeters) wide sections until you reach the other side of your head.,

Keep braiding and letting down layers until you have no more hair left to braid.,
Consider adding a light mist of hair spray.,
Let your hair dry.,
Remove the braids when your hair is completely dry.,
Style your hair as desired, but do not brush it.",How to Crimp Hair Without Heat1," If you have not already, shampoo and condition your hair. Let it air dry partway before continuing; it will be easier to braid. Make sure that your hair is completely tangle-free. Run a wide-toothed comb through it, if necessary.;
, This will make it easier to work with. For a tighter crimp, pull the top three-quarters of your hair into the bun and leave the bottom fourth loose. For a looser crimp, pull only half of your hair up into the bun, and leave the bottom half loose. This will be the first layer you will be working with.

, This will help your hair hold the crimp better, especially if your hair is very straight or does not hold a curl well. If you do this, you will need to do it for each layer of hair that you work with.

, Take a section of hair closest to your face. Try to keep the braid tight. The smaller section of hair you braid with, the tighter crimp you will get.

, When you get to the very end of your hair, tie a mini hair elastic around the braid ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) from the bottom. Loop the tail end of the braid into the hair elastic. This will help keep the ends looking crimped and prevent them from appearing too straight., Try to keep the braids as even as possible.

, Once you finish the row, undo the bun at the top of your head, and let down another layer of hair. If you are working with more than two layers for a tighter crimp, pull the rest of your hair up into the bun.


If you applied mousse into the bottom layer earlier, be sure to apply more mousse to this new layer.

, When you finish the end of a row, let down some hair. You want to end up with four rows of braids for a tight crimp, and two rows for a loose crimp.

, This will help give your hair some extra holding power., This can take anywhere between two to four hours. If you are going to sleep with the braids in, then consider wrapping your hair with a head scarf or sleeping on a satin pillowcase. This will help reduce friction and prevent frizz.

, Start with the bottom layer first, then work your way to the top. If you aren't certain whether or not your hair is dry, press your fingers into one of the braids. If the hair inside the braid feels dry, the braids are safe to undo. If the hair inside the braid feels damp, let your hair dry longer.

, Brushing crimped hair will make it turn frizzy. You can leave your hair loose, or you can part it off to one side. You can even wrap a headband around your head or pull your hair up into a high ponytail.


If the crimps aren't fluffy enough, you can soften them by gently running your fingers through your hair.

Apply the mixture to damp hair.,
Let the mask soak in for 20 minutes.,
Shampoo your hair with cool water.,
Dry your hair as normal.",How to Create an Egg and Olive Oil Hair Mask1," To make a mask for dry hair, you only need the yolk, not the white. Egg yolks contain fat and protein that help moisturize and rejuvenate dry, lifeless hair. Separate the yolks from the whites and place the yolks in a small bowl.To easily separate an egg, crack the egg on the rim of the bowl. Hold the egg upright over a bowl and carefully lift the top half of the shell. Pass the yolk back and forth between the shell halves and let the white drop into the bowl, then place the yolk in a separate bowl. Alternatively, you may also use egg oil.;
, Pour the olive oil into the bowl with the yolks and whisk until the mixture is smooth and creamy. You should end up with about half a cup of mask mixture, enough to coat medium-length hair.









If your hair is very thick and long, add an extra tablespoon of olive oil.
If your hair is short, reduce the olive oil by a tablespoon.

, If your hair is a little wet, it will be easier to distribute the mask from your roots to your tips. Use a wide-toothed comb to comb the mask through your hair, making sure it coats every strand.









If you tend to have extra dry ends, use more mask mixture on your tips than on your roots.
If you end up with more of the mixture than you need, store it in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to a week.

, To keep things neat, you might want to put your hair up in a loose bun and cover it with a shower cap. Wait patiently while the mask goes to work on your dry hair.

, The shampoo will remove excess oil and egg, leaving your hair shiny and soft with no buildup. Be sure to use cool or lukewarm water so the egg doesn't ""cook"" in your hair.

, Either let air dry or use a hair dyer. Your newly moisturized hair should look softer and healthier now.

Determine the best and worst colors for warm skin tones.",How to Choose an Unnatural Color to Dye Your Hair1," This can affect how well a dye will take to your hair. Cool categories are based on your skin tone, eyes, and natural hair color.People in the cool category will have deep brown eyes, hazel eyes, gray-blue, or dark blue eyes.
The cool category includes both light and dark skin tones. Very dark skin and olive skin tones are included in the cool category. Medium skin tones, both with color and without color in the cheeks, and medium skin with golden undertones, are also considered cool. Pale skin with pink undertones, or pale skin with no color in the cheeks, puts you in the cool category. If your skin gets brown or bronze when you tan, you may be in the cool category.
In the cool category, your natural hair would be blue-black, very deep brown, medium ash brown, golden brown, dish water blond, salt and pepper, or white.;
, Warm categories are determined by the same factors as cool categories. Consider your natural hair color, skin tone, and eye color.


Golden brown, green, green-blue, turquoise, and hazel eyes with gold or brown flecks are considered warm.
Brown skin with pink undertones, brown skin with golden undertones, pale skin with peach or gold undertones, freckled skin, and ruddy skin are part of the warm category.
Deep brown hair with gold or red highlights, red hair, strawberry blond hair, gray hair with a yellow cast, and natural golden blonde hair are all considered warm hair types.

, If you've determined you fall into the cool category, not every hair color will work for you. While you may be able to get around this issue with the right stylist, understand some colors will be more difficult. Other colors, however, would work more easily with your hair.Gold, yellow, red, and bronze tones in the hair are hard to achieve with cool hair colors. They may not come out well, and have a tendency to make you look somewhat sallow.
Shiny black hairs, ash browns, and cool blonds work well with a warm complexion. They also may be easier to dye over your natural hair color.

, Some colors may look bad, given your complexion and skin tone. Other colors would compliment your skin tone and complexion.Blue, violet, and ash-based colors can make your skin tone look washed out.
Darker colors work best. Warm browns, chestnuts, auburn shades, golden browns, gold and red highlights, and golden blond colors would compliment your skin tone and eye color well.

For thinner hair, try 3 to 5 sections.
For thicker hair, try 3 to 10 sections.

, Try to keep the braids as tight as possible. A regular braid will result in straighter hair at top, and crimped hair at the bottom. A French braid will result in an all-over crimp.


Be sure to braid your hair all the way to the ends. Tie the braid off with a hair tie about ½ to 1 inch (1.27 to 2.54 centimeters) from the ends. Loop the tail end of the braid into the hair elastic. This will help create that all-over crimped look, and prevent any straight ends.

, The hairspray will help your hair keep the crimp longer.

If you end up with more of the mixture than you need, store it in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to a week.

, To keep things neat, you might want to put your hair up in a loose bun and cover it with a shower cap. Wait patiently while the mask goes to work on your dry hair.

Learn how the color wheel affects hair dye.,
See a professional for blond hair.,
Consider professional lightning for darker hair.,
Weigh your options if your hair is gray or graying.",How to Choose an Unnatural Color to Dye Your Hair2," You probably had to learn about the color wheel in elementary school. Google a copy of the color wheel to figure out how the wheel can affect your chosen hair color.Complimentary colors fall on opposite ends of the color wheel. If you dye your hair a complimentary color, you may end up with a totally different color than you expected. For example, say you have golden blonde hair. If you try to dye your hair blue, a color found on the opposite side of the color wheel, these colors will combine. You could end up with green hair.
Instead, pick a color that would compliment your hair. If you have undertones you want gone, you'll have to pick a color to neutralize these tones. For example, if you have red undertones, they can be neutralized with an ashy, greenish shade.

, Blonde hair is tricky to dye. It often has a variety of undertones that can affect how a dye will take. Blondes are at a greater risk of ending up with greenish hair during the dyeing process. A professional stylist, who knows how to work the color wheel to bring out the best shade, should be consulted prior to dyeing your hair., Darker hair is also more difficult to dye. Often, you will need to bleach or lighten the hair prior to the dyeing process. This can be tricky to do alone, especially if you don't have any professional training. See a stylist if your hair is naturally dark. He or she can figure out how to lighten your hair appropriately to get the right shade for you., With gray hair, any color you choose will come out very bright. A dark blue dye, for example, can come out bright blue.Therefore, you may want to select a color that's slightly darker than you want prior to dyeing your hair.

"
"
Know you may have to bleach to get an unconventional color.,
Think about your professional appearance.,
Factor in cost.",How to Choose an Unnatural Color to Dye Your Hair3," If your hair is naturally very light blonde, you may be able to get by without bleaching. For the most part, however, bleached hair is necessary to have an unconventional color, like red or pink, show up in your hair.The vast majority of unconventional hair colors are semi-permanent. This means they will not lift the color in your natural hair. You have to change the color yourself via bleaching.
For bleaching, it's a good idea to go to a salon. This is especially important if you want to dye your whole hair an unconventional color. Bleaching can damage your hair, so it's a good call to have professional assessment prior to bleaching.
However, you may be able to bleach at home using a kit if you're only doing strands of color. Be careful to follow all instructions carefully when applying color to your hair.

, Not all hair colors are appropriate for work and school. Hair colors will last awhile, so think carefully about whether your color is appropriate for all situations.


Colors that are found in natural hair, like reds and blondes, are generally appropriate for most situations. If you intend to dye your hair in a natural shade, you probably do not have to worry about your professional appearance.
However, a more dramatic color, like hot pink, may not be appropriate everywhere. With certain creative jobs, an unconventional hair color may not be a concern. However, if you work in a highly professional setting, you may want to avoid dramatic shades.

, If you believe you need a professional stylist, understand this will not be cheap. Professional hair dyeing may cost over $100. Spend some time considering whether you have the money to dye your hair professionally.


If you're unsure if you can afford a professional dye job right now, you can try to put some money aside. You can also look into dyeing your hair a color that will take more easily to your natural shade. These colors will be easier to dye on your own.

Dye your hair for the summer.,
Choose a color based on autumn.,
Choose a winter hair color.,
Dye your hair for spring.,
Choose a color based on a city.,
Stand out in a small town.,
Remember your hair and skin tone.",How to Choose an Unnatural Color to Dye Your Hair4," Summer is the brightest season and is known for a lack of heavy clothing. Many people tend to go for the obvious colors: orange and blonde. These are warm colors, but they don’t fully represent the “bright” spectrum. Shades of blue can work well for the sunny season. A majority of color people experience in the summer is found in the light blue of the sky. Here’s a list of colors associated with summer that would work well as a hair color:


Red
Pink
Bright Blue
Light Magenta
Green, Autumn is the season where all the lush greenery prepares and dies for winter. During this natural process of death, nature produces an array of stunning colors. Autumn colors can better be labelled as muted warm colors.You can see this in effect on a cool autumn day. Here is a list of warm cool colors of autumn:


Rust
Teal
Salmon
Brick Red
Beige

, Winter is the time of the year when nothing grows and nature is in hibernation. The sky is typically grey and therefore your hair can reflect this with grey tinted colors. The colors of this drab season are muted but enticing. Just because a color has a tint of grey, doesn’t mean it can’t warm you up. Essentially any pastel color or “icy” color can work during this season. Here is a list of “muted cool” colors of winter:


Slate Blue
Winter White
Charcoal
Mauve
Burgundy, Spring is the season of birth where everyone begins to feel the warmth again. This season is notorious for having incredible colors because of new foliage. The color pattern is similar to summer, but the tint of each color isn’t as bright as summer. This is the season of baby colors. These colors all look great in hair because they do not pop out to the eye as much. Here is a brief set of example colors you could choose:


Coral
Turquoise
Peach
Cobalt Blue
Chinese Red

, The city is a great place to base your color palette. Whether you live in a small city or New York City, there is a unique color you can find to fit your needs. Many cities tend to be tinted with streaks of grey, like London. A city like Chicago has tints of green throughout downtown because of the natural green tint of the Chicago river. Look around your neighborhood and attempt to pick out a color you see often.


You can also dye your hair a combination of colors based on your environment.
Be as bold as you want. The city is a big place and you should feel free to express yourself through color.

, Small towns can have a plethora of colors. Small towns typically are settled more firmly into a natural setting such as a mountain, farm, beach, or plain. Take inspiration from whichever scene you see on a daily basis. A town like Boone, NC, for example, is situated at the top of a mountain and subsequently has an extreme variety of colors.


You will stand out and become easily noticed after dying your hair a unique color in a small town.
Consider the reaction from your community before going forward with this type of change.

, As you consider colors based on season, always come back to your hair and skin tone. You may love the idea of burgundy hair for the fall, but will it work for you? Consider how a burgundy shade will show up, given your skin tone and hair color. You may have to go with a different choice if burgundy does not work well for your hair.

Consider your options before buying hair serum.,
Apply a few squirts of serum to your hair before washing it.,
Wash and condition your hair before you style.",How to Apply Serum to Your Hair1," Check the labels and compare the hair serums to find one that fits your hair needs. There are different types of hair serum you can use depending on your hair type and preference. If you have thin hair, you may want to try a thickening serum. Or if you have fine hair, there are also lightweight serums for people whose hair does not require as much moisture. If you style your hair often, there are hair serums that also protect against damage due to heat. There are also specifically designed serums to enhance the curls in curly and wavy hair, those that add high gloss, and on the other side, there are hair serums used to create a more natural looking hairstyles.You can find a range of hair serums at any department store or pharmacy.;
, This is an optional step. Some people find that adding serum to the ends of their hair before they wash helps to fight the frizzing and drying caused by the chemicals in shampoos. To protect your hair while you wash, use more serum in your hair than normal. Apply 3-4 squirts of serum to the midsection and especially the ends of your hair.








Wash and rinse your hair as normal, making sure to wash all of the soap out of your hair.

, Another way to use serum requires that you apply the serum to soaking wet hair. When you shower, it is a good idea to use a moisturizing shampoo and conditioner that are good for dry hair. Or if you have wavy or curly hair, you can buy anti-frizz shampoo and conditioner or shampoo and conditioner for curly/wavy hair hair.









Consider doing a “no-poo” routine for cleansing wavy and curly hair. If you are trying to create more natural waves, there are shampoos without cleaning agents that rough up the cuticle and create frizz.
If you are planning on only applying the serum to your styled hair, you can skip this step.

Remove the hair from the brush.,
Shampoo your brush in the shower.,
Rinse the brush.,
Dry the brush.",How to Clean Hairbrushes1," Taking out the old hair is always a good idea, since dirt and skin particles tend to stick to it as it builds up in your brush. Reach in and pinch the hair with your fingers, then pull it out from around the bristles. Keep doing this until you've extracted all of the hair from the brush, then throw the hair away.









If your brush's bristles are made from natural fibers, take care not to yank them out with the hair. Don't bend or break the bristles as you clean the brush.
You can use a pair of tweezers to help you lift the hair from the base of the brush and make it easier to pull off.;
, If your brush just needs to be freshened up quickly, this is the best way to get it clean with very little trouble. While your hair is conditioning in the shower, squirt some shampoo on your brush and use your fingers to gently rub it into the surface of the brush between the bristles.









If you don't want to use up your shampoo, a cheap body wash will work fine for this purpose.
Avoid using conditioner or solid soap, since these will stick to the brush and may be hard to remove.

, When you've finished giving it a light scrub, hold the brush under the stream of running water from the showerhead until it's thoroughly rinsed off. Make sure to get every last bit of soap, since you don't want it to stay on the brush and cause your hair to get sticky later when you brush it.








, You can use the cool setting on your blow dryer to dry the brush, or simply set it out on a towel and let it dry overnight. When the brush is completely dry, it's ready to use again.









Don't use a hot hair dryer to dry the brush. This could damage the base of the brush and its bristles.
Avoid using the brush when it's still wet, especially if it's made with natural bristles. This could cause them to bend and break.

Make an all-purpose essential oil mix.",How to Add Essential Oils to Shampoo," This is especially important if you're using a new essential oil for the first time, because you want to make sure you aren't allergic to it. To do a patch test:


Mix three drops of the oil you plan to use with ½ teaspoon (3 ml) of carrier oil, such as jojoba, almond, or walnut oil.
Place a couple drops on your inner forearm, just below your elbow. Cover the area with an adhesive bandage.
Keep the bandage on and don’t wash the area for 48 hours. After that time, remove the bandage and check for irritation, such as redness, itching, blisters, or swelling. If none of these symptoms appear, you aren't allergic to the oil and it’s safe to use in your shampoo.Some essential oils shouldn’t be used on children under five, including basil, cinnamon lemongrass, thyme, bergamot, nutmeg, peppermint, rosemary, and sage.Be careful not to get essential oils in your eyes, as they can cause irritation.;
, To add essential oils to your shampoo, you will need a few things on top of your shampoo and the essential oils of your choice. Also gather a measuring cup, funnel, small mixing bowl, and dark glass or plastic bottle with a tight fitting lid.


Store your shampoo and essential oil mixtures in a dark bottle with a tight lid because light, heat, and oxygen can destroy the aromas and properties of the oils.Always put the lid back on tightly after you’ve used essential oils or your shampoo.Some essential oils in their concentrated forms can degrade plastics, so you should always store concentrated oils and blends in glass bottles.

, A good rule of thumb is to use about 20 drops of essential oil per ½ cup (120 ml or 4 oz) of shampoo.Measure out the shampoo and pour it into your mixing bottle. Stick the funnel into the mouth of the mixing bottle before pouring in the shampoo to prevent spills.Start with ½ cup (120 ml or 4 oz) of shampoo if you haven't done this before, just in case you don’t like the smell or effect of the oils you use.
If you want to use a full bottle of shampoo, look at how many ounces or milliliters are in the bottle to determine how many drops of oil to use. You can add oils directly to the bottle of shampoo if you're adding the same oils to the entire bottle.

, In a small mixing bowl, blend about 20 drops of different essential oils, or 20 drops of a single oil if you prefer. Stir them with a spoon or swirl them around the bowl to blend them together, and then smell the oil combination.


Remember to increase the amount of oil you use based on the quantity of shampoo. Many shampoo bottles contain between 12 and 16 ounces (355 to 473 ml) of shampoo, so if you're adding essential oils to an entire bottle, you'll need between 60 and 80 drops of oil.

, When you're happy with the result of your essential oil mixture, pour it into the mixing bottle with the shampoo. Use the funnel to avoid spills.


Stir the oils into the shampoo if you have a long and narrow stir stick or spoon that will fit into the bottle. Otherwise, give it a gentle shake.
Always shake the shampoo before using it, to redistribute the oils throughout the shampoo.

, Essential oils have different fragrances and properties, so some are better for treating different hair types and hair care problems than others. If you have normal hair that isn't prone to dryness and isn't overly oily, some of the best essential oils for your hair include:Rosemary
Lavender
Geranium
Lemon
Clary Sage
Cedarwood
Thyme
Chamomile

, There are a variety of essential oils that help with oily hair, because they either help slow oil production or are simply better at cleaning the scalp of oil. If you have oily hair, experiment with oils such as:Lemongrass
Ylang-ylang
Cedarwood
Lemon
Tea Tree
Rosemary

, Dry hair is characterized by tangles, split ends, and dullness. It can be caused by a lack of oil from the scalp, too many damaging hair treatments, and overuse of heat tools and hair styling products. You can add some moisture back to your hair with oils such as:Geranium
Lavender
Rosemary
Sandalwood
Cedarwood
Peppermint
Tea tree

, Dandruff can be caused by a number of different things, but there are a few essential oils that can help with minor flakes and itchy scalps. These include:Tea tree
Thyme
Rosemary
Lavender
Eucalyptus
Cedarwood
Ylang-ylang

, Whether your problem is dryness, flakes, or damage, you can make an essential oil blend for your shampoo that will help to moisturize and nourish your hair, and fight flakes. A few good recipes are:


10 drops each of lemon, rosemary, tea tree, and lavender, mixed with 1 ¼ cup (300 ml) of shampoo.20 drops of clary sage, plus 15 drops each of wild orange and lavender, mixed with about 1 cup (240 ml) of shampoo.10 drops each of lavender, cedarwood, rosemary, and peppermint, mixed with 1 cup (240 ml) of shampoo.

, Most essential oils smell great on their own, but blending them together can be tricky. A few essential oils that are good for hair and smell wonderful include basil, bergamot, lavender, ylang-ylang, and mint. For a few essential oil blends that smell fantastic and promote healthy hair, try:25 drops of lemongrass, 10 drops of lemon, and 15 drops of lavender, mixed with 1 ¼ cup (300 ml) of shampoo.
30 drops of wild orange and 20 drops of lavender, mixed with 1 ¼ cup (300 ml) of shampoo.
30 drops of lavender and 20 drops of peppermint, mixed with 1 ¼ cup (300 ml) of shampoo.

Choose a color that you love.,
Choose a color that you wear a lot.,
Choose a color that complements your eyes.,
Choose a color based on your personality.,
Keep your hair and skin tone in mind.",How to Choose an Unnatural Color to Dye Your Hair5," You know what colors you like and dislike. Treat yourself by dying your hair your favorite color. If you like blue, dye your hair a unique shade of blue that stands out to you. The same can be said if you like the color red and its varieties. Hair dye isn’t permanent and if you feel strongly towards a color, go for it.

, This works well if you like a monochromatic look. For example, if you love to wear green, choose a shade of green that is slightly different from your clothing. This way your hair won’t fully match the outfits you like to wear, but your hair will match your style.Sort through your wardrobe for inspiration. Look at your favorite outfits and decide if you love them based off their colors.

, Blue eyed people could go with yellow, orange, or blue. Green eyed people could go with blue, purple, or green. Brown/hazel eyed people could go with red, pink, or green. Unnatural hair looks good with any eye color.


Take suggestions for what colors complement your eyes from your peers.
Some people’s eye color changes based off what they are wearing. Other people’s eyes don’t change color as often.

, If you are loud and bold, you could go with a bright color such as red, orange, aqua, yellow, or neon green. If you are creative and artistic you could choose a variety of green, orange, blue, or purple. If you are smart and studious, muted colors such as baby pink, dark blue, or dark purple might work for you.

, Remember, not all hair colors work on all types of hair and skin tone. A blue tone can come out as yellow or green when applied to the wrong hair color, for example. Remember factors like the color wheel, your natural hair color, and your skin tone when finding a shade based on your personality. You may have to go with your second or third choice.

Expect your hair will need touch-ups when it fades.,
Take steps to make your hair last longer.",How to Choose an Unnatural Color to Dye Your Hair6," How long your color will stay in depends on whether it's permanent or semi-permanent. Many people think semi-permanent dye will fade, while permanent color will last. However, often a combination works best. The two colors act differently on your hair, and using permanent color throughout your hair may cause unnecessary damage.Permanent dye is more powerful, and may change hair color more dramatically. It's best to use it on your roots, which will come out in your original hair color.
It's a good idea to use semi-permanent dye, in a gloss form, on the rest of your hair. This hair probably retains some of its original color, so it only needs to be lightly lifted with a semi-permanent dye.

, All colors are not created equal. Certain shades will be more difficult to maintain, and you may have to take extra efforts to maintain those shades.Red hair is one of the most difficult colors to maintain. It tends to fade very fast. You can try not washing your hair for a week after getting it dyed red. This can help the color set.
Blonde dye will be hardest on your hair's health, as a lot of lifting and lightening is used. You will want to use a lot of moisturizing products and do deep conditioning treatments after dyeing.

, Hair dye fades. Even if you used permanent dye, your hair will fade over time. You may like the color it fades into. You may end up with a tone lighter than your original, but your hair will continue to fade until you're left with your original color.Some colors need touch ups more often. Red hair, for example, requires a touch up every 4 to 6 weeks.
You can get a touch up done in a salon, but this can get pricey. You can also consider touching up your hair yourself at home. Just make sure you carefully read the instructions manual for any products you purchase.

, To avoid continual touch ups, you can slow the fading of your hair. There are several ways to maintain color more long term.Stay out of the sun as much as you can. Prolonged exposure to the sun can lighten hair.
Add some hair dye to your conditioner. This way, you're dyeing your hair a little bit each time you shower.
Wash your hair cold and do not shampoo too often. If you can, limit shampooing to once a week.

, If you have been very careful not to over apply serum, you may need to add a little more to your hair. If your hair still looks a little dry, apply another drop to your hand, and, again, rub it between your palms well. Apply it now to the sides and front of your hair. The serum should make your hair less frizzy, more flexible and more vibrant.








, After you have blotted your hair with the serum and it has the shine you want, your hair might be due for a last little volume boost. If your hair is a little flat, go back and re-curl/style your hair to re-energize it.








, If after a couple hours or a day your hair serum is leaving your hair greasy and heavy, consider shopping for another hair serum. You may have picked a serum that doesn’t suit your hair type. It is common with hair products that trial and error is necessary before you have success.

Dry the brush.",How to Clean Hairbrushes2," If you have thick hair and you've gone months without cleaning it, you may have a matted layer of hair to remove from your brush. The easiest way to take care of this issue is with a sharp pair of scissors. Insert the tip of the scissors at the edge of the mat of hair and carefully snip in a straight line through the bristles and across the brush. Do this a few more times so that you've separated the mat into sections. Use your fingers to lift the individual sections from the brush, then discard them.

Before You Shop, Get on the internet and start asking questions through Google not on forum boards where many are endlessly searching for the perfect products.,
Be aware how 'honest' people will be.,
Understand that All Hair Products Are Water Soluble.,
Save Money on Hair Products.",How to Choose the Best Hair Products and Save Money," Once you have found a product that draws your interest, look up their ingredients. When you have the information, find out through experts (not hair product manufactures), if it will enhances what your hair does naturally. In the beginning, it's a little time consuming but once you have gathered the information, knowing how to search and understanding ingredients will make your future searches easier.;
, Professionals and Novices Only Recommend From Their Own Perspective: Professional stylists have very little experience regarding the truths about what hair products can and can't do. Once you leave the salon, you are on your own. Stylists are fed the same hype as novices but from professional sales people. The buck stops with the CEO of product companies. They know they are selling hope in a bottle. Make it smell good, creamy, smooth with hot packaging then sprinkle in great marketing and magnifique.

, Water soluble products are easier to work with and shampoo out easily. The problem is they are subject to moisture, which dilutes them or the lack of moisture, which makes them dissipate, both affecting their performance. This being true, forces some women with frizzy hair to multi-layer products to make up for what one product should accomplish. This is the perfect environment for hair product manufactures, to have the consumer purchase more than one product at a time.

, Find one that will do the job of many. You can save money on the initial purchase by purchasing cheap products but eventually more and more products are needed to make them effective. Over time women end up spending more by trying to save less with cheaper products. Women purchase emotionally instead of researching prior to purchase. A man likes his toys and a women likes the look, feel, smell and color of a product. Both man and woman end up with the same result, something that is emotionally purchased that ends up in the trash or stacked in the garage. There are only three non-water soluble product that I know of, especially for frizzy hair, Lok & Blok, Moisture Block and Finisher. All three are made by Sabino Hair Solutions. These are products that will prevent frizzy hair reversion, maintain volume and control moderately dry hair from shampoo to shampoo, saving you money.

Decide how many oils to use.,
Choose a carrier/base oil.,
Choose an essential oil.",How to Oil Your Hair1," You can use just one oil on your hair, or two to three oils. It all depends on how much money you want to spend and how intensive you want your oil treatment to be.


The two basic types of oils are carrier oils and essential oils.
Carrier oils are used as a base into which the more concentrated essential oils are mixed.
Many people choose to use carrier oil alone on their hair. You don’t need to use essential oil if you don’t want to.
Essential oils are more highly concentrated. After diluting them with a carrier oil, you apply them to the scalp and roots only.;
, Whether or not you decide to dilute an essential oil into a base oil, you will need a base oil. There are a wide variety of options to choose from, each offering different benefits and drawbacks.


Almond oil: Almond oil is rich in vitamin E and healthy fats that does wonders to the hair.
Argan oil: Argan oil is a Moroccan product rich in antioxidants. Although users swear it produces dramatic improvements to both hair and skin, it can be pricey. Any inexpensive Argan oil you find on the market is likely inauthentic and not worth the money.
Avocado oil: Avocado hair is a favorite among African Americans who wear their hair naturally. It’s loved for its super-moisturizing power, and it’s inexpensive to boot!
Castor oil:Castor oil is thought to stimulate hair growth and decrease hair loss, treat dry scalps, prevent split ends, and increase shine. However, it’s a thick, gloopy oil that many don’t like the feeling of. If you use it, you should dilute it with a thinner oil, like grapeseed oil.
Coconut oil: In addition to adding moisture to hair and scalp, coconut oil is also rich in protein. This can help heal damaged hair, which is composed largely of protein itself. One drawback is that coconut oil stays in a solid state in all but the hottest temperatures. Some people don’t like the added work of having to heat it up to apply it.
Extra virgin olive oil: EVOO is thought to prevent hair loss, treat dry scalp, and improve moisture and shine. It also has antibacterial and antifungal qualities that protect the scalp from problems like dandruff. However, it may be too heavy for thin hair.
Grapeseed oil: Grapeseed oil is a lighter oil that might most useful for people who don’t need a big boost of moisture. If you have otherwise healthy hair, use it as a balancing moisturizer.

,


Rosemary essential oil: Rosemary oil has a wide variety of uses, but it’s known to stimulate blood flow. Applying it to the scalp improves follicle and root health. Rosemary is also a known source of compounds that are frequently found in Minoxidil, it can be useful in treating and preventing hair loss. A tingling sensation is normal when applied to the scalp. Rosemary oil is also one of the few natural oil that actually provide a real moisturizing effect on your hair.
Grapefruit essential oil: This fragrant essential oil is used to stimulate hair growth and balance out oily hair.
Rose essential oil: Rose essential is used to strengthen hair roots and prevent hair loss. Plus, it smells wonderful!

Groom unruly eyebrows with wax.,
Style your mustache with wax.",How to Apply Hair Wax2," Comb your eyebrows so that the hairs run in the same direction, then spread a tiny amount of wax along each eyebrow with the tip of your finger. Waxing is ideal for naturally dark or bushy brows that grow back quickly after shaving.







, You can use standard hair wax, but you may also use a dedicated mustache wax product. These are often harder and less goopy than standard wax products. Rub the wax between your fingers until it is warm, smooth, and clump-free.









For a more natural look, work a moderate amount of wax into your mustache and do not twist the ends. Try using a mustache comb to work it in. Blow-dry the wax on a high-heat, low speed to blend it in.
For a more ostentatious look—say, a handlebar mustache—apply more product and twist the tips of your mustache into points. If you have a particularly long or bushy mustache, consider grabbing the hairs at the base of your mustache as you twist so that you don't rip any out. When the mustache is thoroughly waxed, work the tips into curls until they hold."

Purchase hair wax.,
Apply hair wax to dry or slightly-damp hair.,
Make sure that you are fully-clothed when you apply the wax.,
Scoop out a bit of wax with your index, middle, and ring finger.,
Rub the wax between the tips of your fingers.,
Restyle your wax when necessary.,
Wash the wax out of your hair.",How to Apply Hair Wax3," Read reviews of a wax product before you buy it. Some waxes are better for short hair; some are explicitly water-soluble; some are designed to be used on mustaches. Many commercial waxes are petroleum-based, although you can use natural products like beeswax, carnauba wax, and vegetable wax. Decide what you need from your hair wax and find an appropriate product.


Many hair wax products leave behind a sticky, hard-to-remove residue. Many low-residue products, however, do not hold your hair in place as well as the stickier products. Look for a wax with a good balance of hair-molding capability and low-residue depositing.You can find hair wax in pharmacies, salons, and anywhere that sells hair-care products. You can usually order these products online. Make sure to compare prices and read the reviews before you make your purchase.
Consider using a ""natural"" wax. Carnauba wax is extracted from the leaves of the carnauba palm tree, and beeswax taken from the hives of honey bees. Japan wax—also known as vegetable wax—is extracted from the berries of a type of sumac bush. In contrast, waxes derived from petroleum are called ""mineral waxes"" or ""cerosin waxes"", and they tend to be colorless and odorless.

, Wet your hair and towel it dry. As you dry your hair, try to shape it into an approximation of the hairstyle that you want. This will give you a base style that you can emphasize with the wax. When your hair is dry, you are ready to apply the wax.








Depending on the texture and length of your hair, putting wax on wet hair can cause the outline, form, and flow of the hair to change when it dries. If you apply wax when your roots are wet, you may lose hair volume.
Hair wax is drier than many other hair-styling products, and it may hold better when you apply it to slightly damp hair. If you do dampen your hair, it should be almost completely dry when you spread the wax.

, If you try to dress yourself after spreading wax through your hair, you risk rubbing your hair against a shirt or dress and ruining your hairstyle. Furthermore, you might rub wax off onto your clothing. If you must dress yourself after applying the wax, be exceedingly careful not to brush your hair against anything.

, You don't need much: a pea-sized amount of wax—about as large as the nail on your little finger—is usually enough for medium-length hair. If you apply too much wax at once, the wax will spread unevenly, making it hard for the wax to bond well with all of your hair. If you find that you need more wax, you can always scoop more.









You can apply wax with one hand, or two. You may find it useful to keep one hand clean and wax-free, but you be able to cover more hair more quickly if you deploy wax with both hands.
The wax may stick to your fingers more easily if you wet them beforehand. You should, however, avoid dripping too much water into the wax tin.

, Knead the wax until it emulsifies: the wax should be warmed and melted by the heat of your fingers, and there should be no remaining clumps. When the wax is smooth and clump-free, it is ready to spread into your hair.








, As the wax dries out, it may lose its hold on your hair. If your hair falls out of place during the day, simply wet your fingers and restyle it. Do not wash the wax out of your hair; simply moisturize the wax to the point that you can re-shape it.









If the problem recurs, consider carrying a small tin of wax with you for quick retouching sessions. You can fit portable wax tins into your purse, bag, or pocket, and you can restyle your hair anywhere with a mirror and a sink.

, You cannot brush styling wax out of your hair; you need to wash it out thoroughly with shampoo. If you've been walking around with wax in your hair all day, wash your hair before you go to bed. You don't want to sleep with clumps of wax in your hair. Furthermore, wax may clump and flake onto your pillow throughout the night.

Prepare your hair.,
Protect the area from oil splatter.,
Treat the roots and scalp.,
Section your hair into two parts.,
Treat the length of your hair.",How to Oil Your Hair2," The only general rule to oiling your hair is that you should comb through it to prevent tangling and messy oil application. Beyond that, there's debate over whether hair should be clean when oiled. Some swear that oiling works better when the hair is already a little bit oily and dirty — say two or three days after your last shampooing. Others insist that oiling works best soon after you've shampooed your hair — when it’s clean and bare. Try it both ways to decide what you prefer.

, Especially if you’re new to oiling your hair, there’s a good chance you’re going to make a mess.


Spread old towels or paper towels around the area where you’re going to work. This includes table surfaces and floors.
Have an extra hand rag available for spot-cleaning drippy messes.
If you’re going to sleep with oil in your hair, protect your pillows with plastic pillowcase coverings.

, Pour one teaspoon of oil into the palm of your hand. Rub your hands together to spread the oil. You’ll be applying the oil mainly with your fingertips, so focus on spreading it there.









Using your fingertips, work the oils into your scalp.
Use a massaging motion to both work the oil in and stimulate the scalp. (Plus, it feels great!)
Make sure you cover the entire scalp area, including the back of your head, just above the neck, and behind your ears.

, Split it right down the middle of your scalp, and pull one section over your left shoulder and the other over your right shoulder. This will make it easier to apply the base oil to the shafts of your hair.









You might tie one section into a piggy tail to keep it out of the way while you’re working on the other section.

, If you have long hair, you might be tempted to pour a large amount of oil into your hands. This will always result in a dripping mess, though. No matter how much hair you’re working with, pour one teaspoon of oil into your palm at a time, adding more oil when you need it.









Run your hands through the length of your hair.
Don’t neglect the hair on the back of your head.

"
"
Prepare your hair and work area.,
Mix your carrier and essential oil.,
Rub the mixture into your roots and scalp.,
Comb through your hair again and section it into two parts.,
Apply the base/carrier oil to the length of your hair.",How to Oil Your Hair3," Just as you would for a straightforward base oil application, comb through dry hair to work out any tangles. You hair can be just-washed or on its second or third day out from your last shampooing. Spread old towels or paper towels around to protect against oil splatter.

, Essential oils are too strong to apply in large amounts directly to the scalp. Even with this diluted delivery system, you may feel a strange tingling sensation in your scalp. Don’t worry — it’s perfectly normal. It just means the essential oil is doing its work!


Pour a teaspoon of your chosen carrier oil into the palm of your hand.
Add 2-3 drops of your chosen essential oil.
Rub your hands together to mix the oils and spread them over your palms and fingertips.

, The essential oils won’t be useful on the shaft and ends of your hair. You should target your scalp, follicles, and hair roots with them.


Using your fingertips, massage the oils into your scalp.
Remember to treat the entire scalp, not just the top of your head.

, Using a wide-tooth comb, comb through your hair to both detangle it. This will also spread the oil through any hairs that didn’t get treated by your fingers. Split your hand down the middle so you can work with your hair in two sections, rather than tackling it all at once.

, Pour a teaspoon of your base/carrier oil into the palm of your hand. Rub your hands together again to spread it out over your palms and fingertips.


If you are using castor oil, mix ½ teaspoon of castor oil with ½ teaspoon of a thinner, lighter oil (like grapeseed oil). Castor oil is thick and gloopy on its own.
Run your fingers and palms through your hair to transfer the oil.
Begin where the essential and carrier oil treatment ends, closer to your scalp.
Run your hands down to the ends of your hair.
Work your way all the way through one section of hair, remembering to pay attention to the hair on the back of your head.
Give the second section of hair the same treatment.

Oil your hair lightly for daily treatment.,
Spray oil onto your hair as a daily leave-in treatment.,
Use the oil as a leave-in conditioner.Once a week or once every two weeks, you should do a deep-conditioning mask treatment with your oil.,
Oil particularly brittle hair when it’s damp.",How to Oil Your Hair4," If you have particularly dry hair, you may need daily oiling. For example, many African Americans with natural hair find daily oiling beneficial. It increases the hair's moisture and shine.


Don’t apply oil to the scalp every day. The scalp produces its own oils, so the hair closest to it is usually fairly healthy. Applying extra oil on a daily basis might hurt more than it helps by causing oily hair at the roots.
Apply a thin layer of oil to the shafts of your hair, focusing on the tips. The oil from your scalp works its way from the root down to the tip of your hair. It's a longer trip for people with long hair, though, so the ends are often dry and brittle. Curly hair also tends to dry out at the bottom because the curls and kinks stop oil from working down the strands.
Don’t over-oil your hair if you’re applying it on a daily basis. You hair should not be completely saturated. You don’t want to walk around with flat, greasy hair all the time!

, Buy a small spray bottle that will allow you to diffuse the oil over a wide area of hair. This will give you a fine mist instead of the thick coat from your fingers. Dilute the oil with water so it won’t clog up the spray nozzle.









Spritz the oil and water mixture throughout your hair immediately after your daily shower. Your hair should still be damp.
Comb through your hair to work out tangles and spread the oil throughout the strands.
Let your hair air-dry, and go about your day.

,


Saturate your hair with the oil. For daily oiling, you might just use a light coating of oil, but for a leave-in treatment, you want your hair thick with it.
Tie your hair up into a bun. This will protect the shoulders and back of your clothing from the oil.
Cover your hair with a shower cap if you’d like. This is especially useful if you don’t have a plastic cover for your pillowcase.
If you don’t use a shower cap, cover your pillow with either a vinyl case or with two layers of old towels to protect it from oil stains.
Leave the oil in for at least eight hours, or until you take a shower the next day.

, Many find that dry, brittle hair benefits most from oiling when the oil is applied to damp hair. Apply a base oil in place of your normal conditioner twice a week, immediately after you’ve rinsed the shampoo from your hair. Shampoo strips the hair of its natural oils, leaving it dry. This is a good time for a moisture boost.


Shampoo and apply the oil as soon as you begin your shower. Let the oil soak into your hair for the rest of your shower, as you go on with the rest of your shower routine.
Try to leave the oil in from 5-10 minutes.
Placing a shower cap over your hair to protect it from the water will help prevent washing it out before you’re ready.
Be careful applying oil in the shower. When you rinse it out of your hair, the tub can get very slippery.

Isolate a section of hair at the top of the head.,
Create the right side and left side sections.,
Make a clean part across the back of your head.,
Divide the crown section into the right crown and left crown.,
Use the remaining hair across the back of your head for the nape sections.,
Let out a half-inch strip along your hairline.",How to Section Hair1," The standard parting method taught in cosmetology schools requires diving the scalp into seven sections: top, right side, left side, right crown, left crown, right nape and left nape.You'll also pull out a half-inch band of hair around the perimeter of the hair line.;
, Use a comb or pick to part your hair beginning at the point on top of one hear, and part across the top of your head to the same point above the other ear. Comb the section forward to separate it from the rest of your hair.

, Separate the top third of the hair you just combed forward.


Fasten the section by twisting it up into a knot and securing it with a medium-sized butterfly clip.

, Clip the remaining right and left thirds of the hair you combed forward.

, Start at the point just behind your ear on one side and part across to the same point behind the opposite ear. The top layer of hair will be used for your crown sections.

, Part the crown section straight down the middle of your head. Clip each half separately.

, Extend the crown part down the middle of your head to divide the nape into right and left sections. Clip each section separately.

, Using your comb or pick, release the strip of hair from one section at a time, around the perimeter of your head. Be sure to follow the perimeter around the front, the sides and under your hair.


Cut the hair. The order you will cut the sections will vary based on the style you are trying to achieve. Some require you to cut from the back up, while others may dictate you cut from the front to the back.

Start with storebought or homemade conditioner.,
Mix in more oil.,
Bottle your mixture.,
Detangle.,
Adjust the amounts.",How to Make a Spray Detangler1," Leave-in or rinse-out conditioner will work for this purpose. A quality conditioner adds oils to your hair, helping them slide past each other without tangling.


To make your own conditioner, try ½ cup (120mL) Greek yogurt, 3 tbsp (45mL) honey, and 5 tbsp (75mL) natural oil. A light or medium oil such as grapeseed or olive oil works best, since you'll leave this mixture sitting in your hair.;
, Although you can use conditioner on its own, oil gives the mixture more ""slip,"" which makes curly hair much easier to detangle without breaking. Add the oil about a tablespoon (15mL) at a time, mixing well. Test it on your hair after each spoonful, detangling with your fingers. Keep adding oil until the hair strands glide past each other seamlessly.


While you can use any type of oil, a heavy oil can leave your hair feeling greasy and limp. Try grapeseed oil or olive oil instead.
Each person's hair requires different amounts of oil. If you rarely have issues with dry hair, you may even be able to skip this step.

, Look for a heavy-duty, reusable spray bottle, or rinse out another bottle and attach a spray top. Cheap spray bottles wear down quickly, making them more expensive and tiresome in the long run.

, Spray your hair with the detangler. Gently detangle with your fingers, a wide-toothed comb, or a rubber-bristled brush. When finished, just leave the spray in your hair. This will keep your curls shiny and bouncy, and avoid damage from excessive rinsing.


If your hair feels too greasy after detangling, try making the spray with a lighter oil.

, Depending on the length and thickness of your hair, you may need more or less detangler spray than you bottled. Homemade conditioner goes bad within one or two weeks. If using it as the basis of our spray, only make enough to last one or two sittings.

Look online for inspiration, and read reviews for different types of lightening and coloring products. Depending on the route you choose to go, your results may be permanent, so it's important to plan carefully!


You might choose to match your eyes or use another color that flatters your skin.
Alternatively, if there's a color you've always loved but that doesn't really flatter you, a dip-dye can be a great way to enjoy it without using it to frame your face. Just make sure you don't dip too deeply--keep it at the tips of your hair.;
, If you have dark hair and want to achieve light-colored tips, this is a necessary step. You will need to bleach the dark color from your hair so the colored dye will take later in the process. If you already have very light hair, or if you don't mind layering a color over your natural color, you can skip this step.Colored hair dyes sit on top of your natural hair color. For example, if you apply a pastel pink hair dye to very light blonde hair, it will show up pastel pink. However, it will be much more subtle and dark when layered on top of dark hair. , You can find all sorts of funky colors online, and you can find most “normal” colors at your local pharmacy or beauty supply store.You can even look at reviews online to see what other people have to say about the product, and how it looks on different colors and textures of hair.


Buy more hair dye than you think you will need. You do not want to run out with half of your hair left to dye.
Purchase some gloves as well. Hair dye will stain your fingers, so it’s best to keep them covered during this process.

, It's easiest to keep your hair down while dip dying it, so you can see exactly where the color is going. This means that the dye will certainly get on whatever shirt you’re wearing, so make sure you wear an old one that you don’t care about. If you have a hairdressing gown or poncho of some sort, that will work as well. Wrap your neck with an old hand towel so you avoid staining your neck as much as possible.

, It’s easiest to dip dye your hair in your bathroom, because it has everything you need: a counter, water, and a mirror. You may want to cover up your counter, especially if it is a light color, to avoid any staining from the hair dye.

, You can dip dye only the very ends of your hair, or you can bring the dye three-quarters of the way up the shaft. It is completely up to you how much you want to color – just make sure you have enough dye! You can tie up any strands that you don’t want to dye in order to make the process easier.


Make sure you comb your hair thoroughly before starting.
Make sure that your hair is parted where it normally will be. The most foolproof way to dip dye your hair is to work with dry hair that is styled how it typically will be styled in your day-to-day.

, If you want your final color to be lighter than your natural color, you will need to bleach first. Bleaching your hair removes your natural pigment, so it will also create a more vibrant, bold finished color. Follow the instructions on your particular product you've purchased. Apply it only to the sections that you want to color.


For more thorough step-by-step instructions regarding the bleaching process, click here.
Bleaching your hair will dry it out. After you're finished bleaching it, deep condition it to replenish some of the lost moisture., Some hair dyes, like Manic Panic, can be applied to the hair directly out of the package.Other dyes may need to be mixed. If you have a bold color and want to make it lighter, you can always add a conditioner to dilute the color.If you want a color that you can’t find, you can always create it by mixing two different colored dyes.

, You can use a brush to paint it on the section, or you can “dip” it into the dye, spreading it along the section of hair with your gloved hand. Concentrate the majority of the dye on the ends of your hair, making sure the tips are fully saturated. As you bring the dye upwards, use less dye so that it gradually fades into your natural color.Do this all over your head, being careful to dye the same length of sections. You want the color to be even around your entire head.


Blending the color into your natural hair is important. Apply the dye thickly to the ends of your hair to create a bold, solid color. When you're nearing the area of hair where the dyed hair will blend into your natural hair, use your finger tips to softly pull some of the dye up the strand, without saturating the hair. This will help the color slowly lighten, and it will help you avoid a stark line between the colored hair and your natural hair.

, This will heat up your hair and speed up the dying process. It will also prevent you from making a mess as the dye sits on your hair. However, this step is completely optional., Check the color periodically to see if it is bright enough. With many colored dyes, the longer you let it sit, the brighter it will be. Just make sure to check the packaging for directions for your specific product. Remember, some dyes will fade gradually with washes, so if you don’t let it sit very long, you will get a paler color that washes out faster., Once you’ve let the dye sit for the required amount of time, you can rinse it out. Use cold water to remove all traces of the dye, and apply a conditioner to give your hair some moisture and shine. Don’t wash with shampoo, because it will be more likely to strip some of the dye out of your hair and lighten it. The less you wash your hair, the longer your dip dye will last!, Like shampoos, heat products can cause the color to fade more quickly. When possible, avoid using blow dryers, flat irons, and curling irons. If you do use them, make sure to use a heat protectant. Have fun styling your new dyed hair, experimenting with fun new styles to show it off.

Divide your hair into three layers for best straightening results.,
Section the top of your hair.,
Grab the second layer of hair.,
Leave the bottom layer of hair hanging loose.,
Straighten hair by separating 1/2 to 2-inch-sections of each layer.",How to Section Hair3," Sections are the easiest way to ensure you don't miss any strands with your flat iron.The thicker the hair, the more layers you'll want to section. Those with very thick hair can divide hair into four, five or six layers. Extra sections are added in the same method described below, but you will divide your head into four, five or six layers instead of three.

, Place your thumbs behind your ears and pull the hair up, gliding your thumbs across the back of your head until they meet in the middle. Twist and clip the section to create the top layer.

, Scoop up the remaining loose hair above your ears into a single section. Secure the layer with a hair tie or butterfly clip.

, The layer just above the nape of your neck will be first section you straighten.

, Begin with the bottom layer and smooth straightener from about a half-inch away from your scalp steadily down your hair shaft.When the bottom layer is finished, continue separating small sections of hair in the middle layer. Smooth hair with the flat iron from a half-inch away from your scalp down the hair shaft.
Lift hair from your scalp when straightening the top layer. After separating small sections of your top layer of hair, place the flat iron as close to your roots as possible. Press the iron firmly closed and draw it down the hair shaft outward from your head.
For pin-straight, divide each layer into small sections. Glide the straightener only a few times over each section before moving along.If your prefer smoother hair, divide it into larger sections. Then clamp the flat iron tightly and run it over each part slowly, ensuring the heat penetrates each section but with less direct contact.

Retouch the dye every 6-8 weeks.",How to Dye Bleached Hair1," After you have bleached your hair, you need to decide which color you want to have. The cuticle layers of your hair strands have been disrupted in the bleaching process, which allows hydrogen peroxide (a key ingredient in hair bleach) to penetrate the hair strand and strip out color. Depending on your hair's natural color and how long you left in the bleach, your hair now might be yellow, white or reddish. Your hair is now ready to take on color, and will often take color much more quickly and deeply than if you hadn't bleached your hair. You might choose to dye your hair a natural color, such as shades of brown, black, red or blond. You might also choose a color like cherry red, blue, purple, pink, and so on. For more natural color effects, stay within 1-3 shades within your own natural color.


Consider the base color of your hair after bleaching and the base color of the dye you are going to use. These might conflict and give you the wrong color. If your bleached hair is yellowish, and your dye has a blue base color, you might end up with greenish hair. Using a dye with a violet base color, however, will offset the yellow in your hair, giving you better results. Use a hair color wheel to select the right shade.To figure out your dye's base color, check the dye manufacturer's website for a ""palette list"" or similar, which categorizes colors into warm, neutral and cool shades. You can also buy different components of a hair dye kit at a beauty supply store. These products will indicate their base color on their package (i.e., blue, blue-violet, violet, violet-red, red, etc.).Paying attention to the color palette of hair dye will help reduce the risk of ending up with the wrong color in your hair.
Look at your hair in childhood photos. This will help you determine how your hair will react to certain colors. If your hair was a warmer color (honey blonde or similar), your hair will likely react with a warmer color now. Similarly, if your hair was a cooler color (ash blonde, brunette), your hair will likely have cooler undertones when you dye it now.Be sure to consider your work environment when choosing a color; many workplaces consider bright, unnatural hair color to be unprofessional.;
, There are numerous types of store-bought dyes available, including permanent, semi-permanent, and color rinses. Each of these lasts a different length of time in your hair. These can be purchased at beauty supply stores, drug stores, grocery stores, and box stores like Target or Walmart.


Permanent dyes are long-lasting and can produce very natural-looking colors. They can also produce very strong or dramatic colors. Because they are very strong, however, they can damage your hair, since they need to be left on your hair for a longer period of time when dyeing.
Demi-permanent dyes are a step down from permanent and typically last about 20-25 washes. These can dye your hair 1-2 shades darker and also can add striking highlights.
Even shorter lasting temporary hair-color dyes are also available.
Semi-permanent dyes are temporary, are more natural-looking, and typically last about 10 shampoos. They do not need to be pre-mixed and can instead be used straight out of the box. These dyes fade progressively, particularly with exposure to air and shampooing. They typically do not contain ammonia or peroxide and are therefore better to use on fragile or already-damaged hair.
Temporary color dyes are useful for touch-ups and experimentation with different hair colors. These include rinses, mousses, sprays, chalks and hair color crayons. They typically coat the hair, rather than color the core of the hair strand. As a result, these types of dyes rinse out within 1-3 washes. You may experience an unwanted color in your hair after the temporary dye fades. For example, if you bleach your hair and use a temporary blue dye, you might get green hair after the blue fades.

, Used a day or two before dyeing your bleached hair, a deep conditioner will help build up moisture in your hair, which was likely damaged in the bleaching process. There is a wide variety of types of deep conditioners, from less expensive ($5-$8) to more expensive ($30+) store-bought ones to more natural, DIY ones. There are recipes to make your own deep conditioner, which typically use foods as their base. Search online for “deep conditioner recipes” for suggestions using bananas, avocados, mayonnaise, yogurt, eggs, coconut oil, or other foods.This step will help minimize ending up with extremely dry and brittle hair after you dye it by increasing your hair’s moisture and elasticity, the hair’s ability to return to its natural shape. Ideally, you would have pre-conditioned your hair before bleaching it, but if not, you should still use a deep conditioner on your hair before you dye it again., The protein filler will help fill in gaps in your hair so that color will go on more evenly, and they also will help add color back into your hair. Protein filler can also be added to the hair dye. To add protein filler directly to your hair, put a small amount in the palm of your hand and spread throughout your hair. You don't need to rinse this out before applying the dye. Alternately, add the protein filler to your hair dye by adding a very small amount (if you add too much, it will make the hair dye too runny and therefore really messy).


To help adjust the color of your hair, add protein filler. For example, if you want to dye your hair from bleached blonde to a warm brown color, you need to have all three primary colors (red, yellow, blue) going into your hair color. Your bleached blonde hair, for example, provides the yellow color. Use a red protein filler along with an ash-toned brown color, which has blue undertones. Together, these will result in the correct color., This step seems time-consuming, especially when you want to get started on dyeing your hair. But it is an important step that will save you a serious skin rash (or worse) if you happen to be allergic to any of the dye’s ingredients. To do a patch allergy test, apply a dab of dye on a patch of skin behind your ear. Leave the dye on for 24-48 hours and check for any allergic reaction, such as a rash, itching or burning on that spot. If you do have an allergic reaction, however mild, you should try a different brand. Be sure to test the new brand for any allergic reactions as well.

, Chemical-based hair dyes can easily stain your skin and hands, so take care to cover yourself properly. Wear gloves and cover your clothes with an old towel. Apply a small amount of petroleum jelly along your hairline and neckline to prevent stains.Have a bottle of alcohol-based facial toner nearby to remove dye from your skin, countertops and floors.

, If you have purchased permanent dye, you will likely need to mix up the color with a developer in order to attain the correct color. Follow the instructions on the box to mix the color properly.

, Gather up a small hunk of hair from the nape of your neck. Brush the dye onto this strand, starting at the roots and working it towards the ends. Set your timer for the allotted time recommended by the box’s instructions (around 20 minutes). Rinse out or wipe off the dye and check the color against a white towel. This will enable you to check if you like the color before dousing your entire head in it. It will also help you gauge how much time to leave on the dye., Divide your hair into four sections. Pin back three of these sections while you apply color to the fourth section. Work the dye into your hair in about 1 inch (2.5 cm) sections, starting at the roots and working towards the ends with your hands to ensure full saturation. When you’ve applied to all four sections, rub the dye all over your hair as though you were shampooing your hair. Be sure to read the instructions on the box for applying the dye to your hair.

, Be sure to read the instructions on the box for timing recommendations. Typically, you will leave hair dye in for about 20 minutes or more, starting when you have put color in the last section of hair.


Some dyes may even recommend a heated dryer to help the color process more effectively.

, Gently rinse your hair with warm water to rinse out the leftover dye. Rinse until the water runs clear. Use the packet of conditioner that came with the dye, rubbing it into your hair. Leave it in for the amount of time recommended by the box’s instructions and then rinse it out.

, Blow drying your hair will just dry out your hair even more and can severely damage your hair while it is in this fragile state. Be sure not to judge your new color until your hair is dry. The color of wet hair almost always looks darker than the actual color.

, Water, soap and heat can lessen the dye’s hold on your hair and cause it to escape. Leaving your hair alone for three days will enable the dye to sink into the cuticles of your hair, which opened during the color process.If, after washing, the hair dye hasn't held, you can try to dye it again, but you will risk damaging it further. If you're finding that your bleached hair isn't holding color, you should probably visit a hairstylist to get it corrected professionally.

, Your hair will be brittle and dry after this color treatment and will need deep conditioning to restore some moisture and elasticity. Use a deep conditioner (store-bought or natural) at least once a week, leaving it in your hair for 20-30 minutes and then rinsing it out. Results can be improved by heating up your hair with a hair dryer while the deep conditioner is in place. If you have made your own deep conditioner with food, check to make sure it hasn’t gone bad. If it’s been mixed up for longer than a few days (or a week if kept in the refrigerator), throw it away and mix up a new batch.

, If you like the color effect you’ve achieved with this dye job, you may want to continue with this color. Even if you choose permanent dye, it will start to fade and grow out of your hair within 6-8 weeks. You do not need to completely re-dye your hair, however. Just focus on dyeing your roots, applying dye at the base of your scalp and combing it through the rest of your hair just before you’ve reached the time limit to have the dye in your hair.For the most effective touch ups, apply dye to the new growth, stopping where it meets the pre-colored hair.

Check the label and ingredients before you buy a product. Make sure it’s certified organic and labelled as “pure.”


If it lists any chemical names or alcohol as ingredients, look for a different brand.
You can buy aloe vera gel at most grocery stores, but these tend to be the less pure versions. A health or natural medicine shop is the best place to obtain pure aloe vera gel that is certified organic.;
, Harvesting the fresh gel from an aloe plant will provide the most beneficial results. If you don’t grow aloe vera in your home, consider buying a few plants. To harvest the gel, start by cutting off one full leaf from the plant. Slice the leaf open length-wise and pull apart the two halves. Scoop out the thick, translucent gel with a spoon.Spoon the fresh gel into a clean bowl nearby.
You only need 2 tablespoons (30 milliliters) of fresh gel, which you can harvest quickly and easily. It will only take a few aloe vera leaves to provide that amount.

, You can use any combination of the following dried herbs, as needed, as long as you don’t use more than 2 ounces (56 grams) total.


For dry hair use nettle, burdock, rosemary or calendula.
For oily hair use yarrow, lavender, lemon balm or mint.
If you have blonde hair try calendula or chamomile.
If you have dark hair try sage or comfrey.
To combat dandruff try rosemary, thyme or any of the herbs for dry hair., Essential oils are concentrated extracts from natural plants. Many of them smell nice and others may have medicinal properties. There are quite a few essential oils that can benefit the health of your hair and scalp. You can use any combination of the following oils in your shampoo, but do not use more than 50 drops total.For normal hair use lavender, clary sage or chamomile.
For oily hair use lemon, tea tree or ylang-ylang.
For dry hair try rosemary, myrrh or peppermint.
To combat dandruff try tea tree, patchouli or lavender.Never use essential oils directly on your scalp, since they are highly concentrated and extremely potent. In this case, the other ingredients in the shampoo will safely dilute the oils.

, Measure out 2 cups (475 milliliters) of distilled water. Pour the water into a pot. Place the pot on a stove burner over high heat. Bring the water to a rolling boil.If you're not using dried herbs, there is no need to boil the distilled water. You will mix the ingredients together as is.

, If you’re using any dried herbs in your shampoo, measure them out now. Remember, don’t use more than 2 ounces (56 grams) total. When the water begins to boil, carefully add the herbs to the pot., After you add the dried herbs, put a lid on the pot. Reduce the heat to low. This will infuse the water with the herbs. Allow the herbs to steep in the simmering water for 15 to 20 minutes., Turn off the burner and remove the lid from the pot. Be careful, since hot steam will probably rise up after you remove the lid. Place a large bowl beneath a strainer.

, The spent herbs will remain behind as the infused water goes into the bowl. After you strain the spent herbs out of the water, discard the remains.

, Measure out 6 ounces (180 milliliters) of liquid castile soap. Slowly pour the soap into the bowl with the infused water. Mix the substances together gently as you pour in the soap. The water is probably still very hot, so be careful not to splash., Measure out and add 2 tablespoons (30 milliliters) of aloe vera gel and ½ teaspoon (2.5 milliliters) of jojoba oil. Carefully add them to the bowl one at a time, stirring constantly. Mix the ingredients together well.


If you are using essential oils, add them now. Remember, don’t use more than 40 to 50 drops of the essential oils. Stir well., Use a funnel to carefully pour the shampoo mixture into a plastic or glass container that will hold about 3 cups (710 milliliters or 24 fluid ounces) of liquid. If you used plain water and did not infuse the shampoo with dried herbs, you can safely store the entire bottle in your shower., If you infused the water with dried herbs, you must store the bottle in the refrigerator. It will go bad if left out at room temperature for more than one or two days. It will last for about 10 days in the refrigerator. Around the 10 day mark, be sure to smell the mixture before using it.If it smells sour, throw it out and make a new batch. If it smells good, the shampoo is still usable.
For convenience, you can transfer some of the shampoo to a small bottle and keep that in your shower for one or two days without it going bad.

, Aloe vera shampoo is gentle enough to use every time you wash your hair. Always shake the bottle gently before you use the shampoo, since the ingredients can settle over time. Pour a quarter-sized amount into your palm and massage it into your hair and scalp. Rinse thoroughly."

Depending on your hair's natural color and how long you left in the bleach, your hair now might be yellow, white or reddish. Food coloring typically comes in four colors (red, yellow, green and blue), each of which can be mixed with another to achieve a spectrum of color choices. Red and green make brown, for example, while yellow and red make orange, and blue and red make purple.


Take into consideration the color of your bleached hair. This will act as an additional color in your overall color mixture.

, Mix drops of food coloring with shampoo in an empty shampoo bottle. Add 6 drops of coloring to every ounce of shampoo. Mix up enough shampoo to cover the amount of hair you want to color. Tightly seal the bottle and shake until the contents are completely mixed. Add 1 tablespoon of water and reseal the bottle. Shake for another 2 minutes. Your color is now ready to use.

This is easier than dyeing your entire head with Kool-Aid, which is harder to control than regular hair dye (because it is a liquid instead of a cream). It can get messy quickly and easily stain your skin.

, Choose an unsweetened flavor of Kool-Aid that will give you your desired color. Tropical punch will give you a brighter red, Cherry gives a deeper red, and Black Cherry mixed with Strawberry achieves a bright red.Take into consideration the color of your bleached hair. This will act as an additional color in your overall color mixture. Fill a bowl with 1 cup warm or hot water. Mix in 3 packages of Kool-Aid crystals, along with 2 tablespoons of white vinegar, and stir, making sure all the crystals fully dissolve., Gather up a small hunk of hair from the nape of your neck. Dip a strand of hair into the Kool-Aid dye. Set your timer for 20 minutes and check the color. Add more time if it seems like the color is not quite where you’d like it to be. Rinse out or wipe off the dye and check the color against a white towel. This will enable you to check if you like the color before dousing your entire head in it. It will also help you gauge how much time to leave your hair in the Kool-Aid mixture.

, Put your hair in a ponytail and dip the entire ponytail into the Kool-Aid.

, Use a brush or comb to detangle your hair, and make sure that there are no styling products (gel, hairspray, etc.) in your hair prior to coloring.

,, Place the pot on the stove and bring the mixture to a boil.


Kool-Aid is available in a variety of colors. Try red (cherry), pink (raspberry), blue (mixed berry) and purple (grape). For a more faded color, dilute the mixture with extra water. For a more vibrant result, use less water and/or more Kool Aid.

, Put Kool-Aid into mug or bowl. Dip the ends of your hair into the liquid. Hold the ends in the colored mix for 3 to 5 minutes, and up to 10, if hair is really thick. This will allow the color to set.


Determine how much of your hair you want to color. For just the tips, submerge 1–2 inches (2.5–5.1 cm) of hair in the liquid. For a more dramatic look, try dipping 4–5 inches (10.2–12.7 cm) of your hair.

, You can either use paper towels or a bath towel that you don't mind staining (color will leak onto the towel).

, Enjoy your new look!


Remember that some Kool-Aid contains sugar, so after it dries, rinse your hair promptly to get rid of stickiness and avoid attracting bugs.

, The dye will eventually fade over time, depending on the number of washes it goes through. You can slow down the fading process by washing your hair less often than you normally do.

, Use a shampoo made specifically for color-treated hair, or switch to an all natural shampoo that does not contain sulfates or other chemicals that may damage hair or speed up color fading.

, Prolonged exposure to the sun will cause hair color to fade more rapidly. Protect your hair from the sun by using hair products that contain sunscreen, a scarf or a hat.

, Kool-Aid dye can take between one month to three months to wash out, depending on your natural hair color. You can speed up this process by washing your hair more often than you normally do, using any kind of shampoo.

, Fill a large pot with water, making sure to use enough water to submerge your dyed hair into. Once the water is boiling, add 1 tablespoon of baking soda. Remove the pot from heat. Carefully, dip the dyed ends of your hair in and out of the water for about 1 minute. Avoid scalding (hot water burning) your hands, arms, scalp, face, etc.


The water will make a fizzing noise, and the color will drain from your hair into the pot. This method will remove most of the color within a few minutes.
Discard the baking soda water, then wash your hair immediately. Be sure to use conditioner to restore moisture.

, Mix 1 tablespoon of vinegar with 1 cup of warm water. Pour this mixture over your hair in the shower, letting it sit for a few minutes before rinsing. Follow with shampoo and conditioner.

This will help remove split ends, which can keep your hair healthy in the long run., In the weeks leading up to coloring your hair, go for a more aggressive conditioning regimen. An extra hydrating conditioner can help prevent future damage to you hair. Use an extra hydrating conditioner daily, a deep conditioner once a week, and use a leave-in conditioner on hot days to prevent your hair from drying out in the sun., Protein treatments can help strengthen and replenish damaged hair. You can get protein treatments done at a salon or buy protein treatments to do at home. You should only do protein treatments every one to two weeks. Otherwise, they could make your hair more brittle.Protein treatments are similar to hair masks. You saturated the hair with the protein treatment, let it sit for a set period of time, and then wash it out., The day before coloring your hair, purchase a deep conditioning hair mask from a salon or department store. Apply the mask to your hair and leave it in for the recommended time frame before washing it out. This will ensure your hair is adequately hydrated prior to dyeing, minimizing further damage.If you're getting your hair done at a salon, ask your stylist for a recommendation for a hair mask. They will probably have some experience working with damaged hair and can give you a good recommendation depending on the kind of dye job you're getting.
Natural ingredients that are good for the hair include things like olive oil, milk, honey, and coconut oil., Look for hair colors that are specifically designed for use on damaged hair. Look for ammonia-free products that have nourishing additives like royal jelly. Moisturizing dyes are also great for damaged hair.Demi-permanent is also generally better than permanent for damaged hair., If you're dyeing damaged hair, do not attempt to lighten it. Going from something like brunette to blonde requires a lot of damage to the cuticle. Go for shades darker than your natural hair or simply try to cover grays and roots. It is never a good idea to lighten damaged hair., The day before you color your hair, refrain from shampooing. Shampoo can dry out your hair, which is no good for hair that's already damaged. Stick to rinsing out your hair and applying a conditioner before getting it colored., If your hair has already been dyed, focus only on touching up the roots. Avoid applying dye throughout your hair, as hair that's already damaged may dry out further with excess dye. In general, the less coloring the better when dealing with damaged hair., While many people can use box hair colors successfully, treating damaged hair of any kind is tricky. As color always causes damage, it's a good idea to see a stylist if you're going to be coloring damaged hair. A stylist will know how to best minimize further damage when coloring hair., Invest in a quality renewal mask after dyeing your hair. Once a week, apply the mask throughout your hair and leave it in for the recommended timeframe before washing it out. This will help re-hydrate your hair, minimizing damage done by coloring.If you got your hair colored at a salon, ask your stylist to recommend a renewal mask.

, After dyeing your hair, use only a color preserving shampoo to avoid stripping away the dye. The better you protect your color, the less often you'll need to touch up your hair. As dyeing always causes damage, it's always a good idea to dye damaged hair as little as possible., Infrequent shampooing can also keep your hair color intact longer. Only shampoo every other day and no more than two to three times per week. This will minimize your need for follow up treatments, preventing further damage from excessive dyeing."

Do it while the hair is wet and use conditioner, setting lotion, hair spray or any other hair products that set and hold curls. If you can, let your curls set in rollers overnight so your hair completely dries without the use of your hair dryer.If you want really short, bouncy curls, let your hair dry naturally. When you let your hair air dry, it dries at a slower rate and your finished hairstyle turns out with much more defined curls that have a tighter hold, which makes your hair look shorter.

, Part your hair from ear to ear in a headband shape. Keep the parts about 1 centimeter (0.4 in) wide. Use an elastic band to keep each part out the way.


Split the rest of your hair into four or five sections. Bring the first section up so that it drapes over your face. Bobby pin it, then flip it back over to your shoulders and bobby pin it.Repeat with the rest of the sections. Part the ""headband"" you started with, then pin it back over your head over the bobby pins. Try to hide them and bobby pin the cover piece in place.

, If you have layered hair, clip the bottom of your hair like as in the ""bobby pin method."" Roll the longest layers, then clip them at the base of your neck so that they appear shorter. Then let the top layers of hair cascade over the bottom. It will appear as if your top layers are your longest layers.

This will keep your bun secured because it catches bun hair, then scalp hair, then bun hair.









You will want to use a hairpin rather than a bobby pin for this hairstyle. Hairpins are stronger and will keep your bun in place even if you find yourself in the middle of a major dance party. You can buy these at hair supply stores or dance stores (as they are favored by ballerinas who definitely have to keep their hair in place.)

, As listed above, you will want to place four hairpins into your bun--one on the top left, top right, bottom left, and bottom right. Doing this will guarantee that your hair stays where its supposed to.








, Even when using very sturdy hairpins, chignons have a tendency to get a little while after a couple of hours. By spraying your chignon with hairspray, your hairstyle will last a good while longer. Use a strong formula for the best effects.

If your hair is freshly washed and a little slippery, chopstick styles can be a little difficult to manage. Many women think that chopstick hairstyles work best on hair that hasn’t been washed in at least 2 days, but it really just depends on your hair.

Some people will only be able to do it once, others will be able to twist it several times around. Once you start feeling your hair pull a little at your scalp, stop twisting.Hold on to the ends of your hair as tightly as you can throughout the remainder of the process, since the twist won’t be fully secure until the final step.

Continue this motion until the pointy end is facing down, and the blunt end facing up.Once you’ve done this, the pointy end of the stick should be nestled about 2 inches deep at the very top of the twist.

, Stop pushing once you have approximately the same length of stick poking out of the top and the bottom. The stick should pass through the twist itself, as well as the hair directly below the twist.

, It may take a couple of attempts before you get it just right, but after a little practice you’ll be able to do this easily.

Start rolling one section of hair.,
Remove the roller.,
Pin the hair roll.,

Arrange the back section of hair as you wish.,
Use hairspray on the hair rolls.",How to Make a Hair Roll1," Before rolling hair, apply a generous amount of mousse, about the size of a ping pong ball, to your hair or the hair of the person you’re styling. This will make hair easier to shape and style. If you skip this step, the hair will be more likely to fall out of the roll.





;
, Use a comb to part the hair down the middle. Then part the hair from ear to ear, so that you have two sections of hair framing the face, and one section of hair in the back. Put the back section of hair into a bun or ponytail to keep if from mixing with the front sections.







, Use hairspray to spray the two front portions of hair. Then take one of the front sections of hair, hold it straight up, and tease it by backcombing through your hair from tips to roots. This gives the hair the volume needed to rock this hairstyle.







, Take one of the two free sections of hair and pull it straight out to the side of your head at a 90 degree angle. Take a foam roller and put it to the tips of the section of hair you're holding. Hold the tips of your hair to the roller with your fingers and then begin rolling inward toward your part so that more and more hair is wrapped around the roller. Roll until the roller is a few inches from your head.








, When your hair roll is about three inches from your head, remove the roller from your hair roll, making sure not to undo the roll. Finish rolling your hair until the hair roll is piled on top of your head on one side of your part.








Make sure that you are rolling your hair inward toward your part as opposed to out away from it.

, After you have finished rolling the first section of hair, use bobby pins to pin up the hair roll. Put one prong of the bobby pin inside the roll, and slide the other prong through the hair close to the scalp, so that the roll will stay in place. Repeat with several other pins to make sure your hair stays in place.







, Using the same process, roll the other section of hair inward towards your part and clip with bobby pins. This should give you two tall hair rolls on the top of your head. This style is called a Victory Roll, and was popular in the 1940’s.








, One way you can deal with the back portion of hair is to create additional rolls on the back of your head, below the top rolls.









You may decide to do a half-up look with the hair rolls, and leave the hair in back down. Use a curling iron to curl this hair if you wish.
You can also clip the back section of hair up. Rather than making additional rolls, just clip this hair up under the rolls for a sleek look.

, Take hairspray and spray, focusing on the hair rolls. This will set the hairstyle and make it less likely that there will be flyaways or major mishaps.

Use a round, tube-shaped brush, not a paddle brush.

, Turn the hair dryer on, and start sliding both it and the hairbrush down towards the middle of your hair. Make sure that you slide both the brush and hair dryer down at the same time. Stop when you are half-way down the hair shaft.

, Twist the brush towards you if you want your hair to flip inward. If you want your hair to flip outward, switch the positions of the brush and the hair dryer: place the nozzle of the hair dryer under your hair, and the hairbrush over your hair. Twist the brush up and away from you as you slowly bring both down.

, Take a small section of hair and position the flat iron about half-way down. Start straightening your hair. Instead of bringing the iron straight down, however, rotate it inwards/outwards as you reach the ends of your hair.


Remember to use a heat protecting spray before using the flat iron. Flat irons get much hotter than a hair dryer and can cause more damage.

, There should be equal amounts of hair to either side of your finger. Also, make sure that your finger is sticking up, from under your hair.


Some people find it easier to use a special loop made for flipping ponytails. You can also bend a pipe cleaner in half, and use that instead.

, The easiest way to do this is to make a hook shape with your finger. If you are using a special loop or pipe cleaner, slip the ponytail through the loop. Make sure that the ends of your hair are facing your forehead.

, Tug your fingers/loop down through the hole, along with the ponytail. Tug it down as far as you can, but not so much that the hair tie goes through the hole too. If that happens, you have pulled too much.


If you are having troubles getting the ponytail through the hole, try widening the hole a little bit by inserting your first two fingers and spreading them. You can also try pushing the ponytail through the hole.

, Be gentle, however. If you brush or comb the hair too hard, it may pull your ponytail all the way through the hole—including the hair tie.

, This is not necessary, but it can add that final touch to your hairstyle.

Instead of pointing the end of the comb straight back, consider angling it slightly towards the center-back of your head.

, Think of it as lifting your hair and turning it like a page in a book.

, Use the comb part to smooth down any stray hairs, and to even up the part.

, Depending on how thick or stiff your hair is, this may not be necessary. If you find that your hair won't ""hold"" the part easily, smooth it down and spray it with a lightweight hairspray.

, Start with a part of your hair draped over your shoulder. Place the back of your hand against your hair, and quickly flick your hand back at the wrist. This will cause your hair to flip over your shoulder.


This works best with hair that falls somewhere between your shoulders and your elbows. If your hair is too long or too short, it may not be as effective
Use a small, less dramatic motion. This will help make it look more natural. If you try to make a huge show of your hair flip, and make a large gesture, you will look overly-dramatic and unnatural.

, This was work with just about any length of ponytail, but it will be most effective with tails that reach your shoulder. Simply turn your head towards one shoulder, and very quickly sweep your head towards the other shoulder. To make your flick even more effective, try to dip your head down slightly as you reach the middle of your ""turn."" This creates a dip or curve that causes your ponytail to flip even more.


Depending on the length of your hair, you might end up catching someone in the face.

, Hair flipping is often associated with sass and confidence. You can make yourself appear more confident by standing tall with your back straight and your head held high.

You can wear a center part or a part that is slightly off center, whichever you prefer. In order to part your hair, use the end of a comb and run the end along the part line. Then move each hair to the proper side of the part.

When you massage your scalp, the increased blood flow stimulates your hair follicles to grow. Scalp massage is a simple and easy technique for helping your hair grow in healthy and fast.Try massaging your scalp every time you take a shower. Use the tips of your fingers to gently rub your scalp in a circular motion. Be sure to cover the front, back and sides of your head.
Repeat the process as much as you like. It has the added benefit of reducing tension and helping you feel calm.;
, Certain essential oils have been shown to help stimulate new hair growth. Increase the benefits of your scalp massage by working in a small amount of essential oil. Pour five to ten drops of oil over your fingertips and massage the oil all over your scalp. Try one of these essential oils:Peppermint, which improves circulation.
Tea tree oil, which soothes the scalp and helps improve dandruff.
Lemon oil, which promotes healthy hair growth.

, This serves the dual purpose of helping promote hair growth and keeping the hair you have strong and soft. Coconut oil, almond oil and castor oil are all thought to help hair grow in thick and strong. To do a conditioning treatment, follow these steps:Wet your hair and massage one to two tablespoons of oil into your scalp for five minutes.
Run your fingers through your hair to distribute the oil from your roots to the tips of your hair. You can also use a wide-tooth comb.
Cover your hair with a shower cap and let the oil soak in for one to two hours.
Shampoo your hair as normal. You may have to wash it twice to remove excess oil.

, If your hair is dry or thin, treating it with a nutritious mask can help restore its luster. A restorative hair mask may not help your hair grow quickly, but by protecting the hair you have, it will keep you from having to trim off split ends and take a step backward on your journey to having longer hair. Here's how to make a hair mask:Crack one egg into a bowl and beat it lightly.
Mix in two tablespoons of plain yogurt and one tablespoon of honey.
Apply to wet hair and let it sit for 20 minutes.
Shampoo your hair as normal to wash out the mask.

, This is a special type of brush made with natural fibers that closely resemble the texture of human hair. It is used to pull sebum, the natural oil secreted by your scalp, all the way to the tips of your hair. This protects your hair from roots to tips and keeps it healthy and strong. Here's how to use one:Place the brush against your scalp and rub it back and forth to massage your head and pick up your natural oil.
In one long stroke, pull the brush from your roots to the tips of your hair. Keep stroking the same section of hair until it looks glossy and smooth.
Continue this process section by section until you have massaged your entire scalp and brushed out all of your hair.
Make sure you get a boar bristle brush. This doesn't work with plastic or metal brushes.

, When your goal is to grow your hair out fast, it's important to pay attention to the products you use. Many products contain chemicals that can damage your hair and cause it to be dry and brittle. Aim to use products that are composed of mainly natural ingredients. Avoid products that contain the following:Sulfates: found in shampoo, these are harsh cleansers that strip your hair of natural oils and dry it out.
Silicones: found in conditioner, these build up in your hair and cause it to look weighed down and dull.
Alcohols: found in hairspray, gel and other styling products, these dry out your hair and cause it to get brittle.

, Hair is mostly composed of protein, making it the most important component of a hair-healthy diet. Examine your diet and make sure you're getting plenty of protein every day. When your diet is protein deficient, your body doesn't produce as much hair.Eat lean meats, fish, eggs and dairy products high in protein.
Beans, leafy greens and tofu are good sources of protein for vegetarians.

, This is a B vitamin essential for hair growth. Since it is mostly found in animal products, vegetarians and vegans often find that they have a b vitamin deficiency. To make sure you get plenty of b vitamins in your diet, eat the following foods:Eggs, nuts, salmon, avocados, meat products and wheat bran.
If you feel you aren't able to meet your b vitamin needs with food alone, consider taking a biotin supplement.

, When you aren't getting enough vitamin A or C, your hair can become weak and dull. Make sure you're eating plenty of the following:


Sweet potatoes, carrots, kale, butternut squash and pumpkin, which are all rich in Vitamin A.
Broccoli, leafy greens, peppers, and citrus fruits, which contain high amounts of Vitamin C.

, These ""good"" fats support your scalp's health and promote healthy growth of hair and skin cells. Omega 3 fatty acid is found in salmon, sardines, mackerel, flax seeds and walnuts. You can take fish or flax seed oil supplements if you don't enjoy eating foods that are rich in omega 3s.

, When your body is dehydrated, it shows in your hair. Your hair can become dry, brittle and more prone to breakage. When your hair breaks and frays, it's more difficult to grow it into the longer style you're after. Make sure you stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water every day.


Try replacing coffee, soda and alcoholic drinks with water whenever possible.
Carry a water bottle with you throughout the day so you'll never have to go thirsty.

, Sometimes hair loss or extremely slow growth has an underlying cause that can't be fixed using at-home methods. If you believe that your hair loss may be a symptom of a more serious illness, make an appointment with your doctor right away. Once you get the underlying problem treated, your hair should start to grow faster. Here are a few conditions that cause hair loss:Scalp infections or skin disorders
Alopecia areata, a disorder that causes patchy hair loss
Trichotillomania, a disorder that leads you to pull out your hair
Certain medications cause hair loss
Hormonal changes can cause hair loss

, Washing your hair every day can cause it to get dry and brittle. Each time you shampoo your hair, you wash away the protective oil that keeps it healthy and strong. When you're trying to grow your hair fast, it's best to wash your hair no more than once or twice a week.In between washes, use dry shampoo to keep your roots from looking oily.
When you wash your hair, handle it gently. Don't scrub it or wring it out. Rinse with lukewarm or cool water instead of hot.

, Air drying is really the healthiest choice when it comes to growing out your hair. Drying your hair with a hair dryer eventually weakens the hair shaft and leads to damage. The same goes for other heat styling tools like curling irons, flat irons and hot rollers.After your shower, pat your hair dry with a towel. Don't roughly towel it dry.
Comb it out with a wide tooth comb. Apply product, such as leave-in conditioner, then let it fully air dry.

, When your hair is wet, it stretches and breaks much more easily than when it is dry. That's why brushing your hair when it's wet is so damaging. It leads to breakage, frizz and split ends. Instead, use a wide tooth comb to gently detangle your hair. Start near the tips and work your way up to the roots, rather than dragging the comb down through your hair to pull out tangles.

, Dyeing, bleaching, and chemically straightening your hair can cause a lot of damage. It's better to leave your hair in its natural state while you're trying to grow it out. You should also avoid hair styles that can pull out the hair, like tight weaves or braids.


If you're determined to lighten or color your hair, use a natural method that doesn't cause damage. Try lightening your hair with honey or dyeing it with henna.
Learn to love your natural look. If your hair is curly or kinky, there's no natural method that will make it look perfectly straight. Fast-growing, free-flowing hair is beautiful.

, The sun, air pollution, and pool chlorine are among the environmental elements that can damage your hair. If your hair is particularly fragile, it's a good idea to protect it, just as you would your skin.


When you go out in strong sun, wear a hat to cover your hair.
If you live in a place with high air pollution, cover your hair with a scarf or hat while you're out on the city streets.
When you swim in pools, wear a swim cap to protect your hair from chlorine."

Moisturize your lips.,
Wash your face with soapy water.,
Exfoliate on occasion.,
Use lemon juice with caution.,
Resist the urge to pop zits.,
Treat dark, puffy eyes.,
Stay hydrated.,
Try a home remedy.",How to Brighten Skin Naturally," Mouths draw a lot of attention, and dry lips can take a toll on your overall appearance. This is an easy place to start: apply moisturizing lip balm to seal in moisture. If your lips have dry, peeling skin, exfoliate by rubbing this same product on with a soft-bristled toothbrush.


Licking, biting, wind exposure, and excessive salt can damage your lips.
If your lips are chronically dry and balm does not fix the problem, try these other treatments.;
, The pores on your cheeks can easily clog due to skin oils, sweat, or makeup. Wash them once or twice a day with warm, soapy water, or a facial cleanser.


There's no need to scrub hard for everyday washes. Overdoing the pressure can rub your cheeks raw or trigger an acne break out.

, Gentle exfoliation once or twice a week can brighten your skin and clean out pores before zits can develop. You can use an exfoliating facial brush, or just apply cleansing soap with a soft-bristled toothbrush. You can also try many home exfoliation recipes, from coffee grounds to oatmeal.


If using an exfoliation product, make sure to pick one intended for the face.

, Lemon juice does lighten skin, but its acidity can cause a reaction on sensitive skin. Worse, citrus makes your skin photosensitive, meaning your face could break out into blisters or rashes when exposed to sunlight. If you do use lemon juice, apply it in tiny amount to dark spots and freckles with a toothpick. Test it on one corner for the first day to check if you get a reaction, and minimize time in the sun.

, It may feel satisfying to get rid of them, but most of the time popping just reopens the wound and invites the zit to come back worse next time. Unless it's a fashion emergency, it's best to let it heal on its own, or to apply acne medication.


In the meantime, conceal the acne with non-comedogenic makeup.

, Dark bags under your eyes are usually caused by lack of sleep or lack of hydration. For a short term solution, apply a chilled spoon, cucumber slices, or just a splash of cold water onto your eyes to reduce swelling and darkness.


When applying eye makeup, take care not to darken your overall appearance more than you would like. For a brighter face, limit the eye makeup mostly to the upper lid and the corners of your eyes.

, You don't need to count glasses of water, but you should be drinking water whenever you feel thirsty. Dehydration can lead to dull, flaky skin.

, There are many home remedies for brightening skin, most of which use harmless food ingredients — so why not try them? Here's one from the nation of India:

Rinse the comb, comb the brush!",How to Get Natural Volume in Your Hair Without Shampoo or Conditioner," If you have used shampoo, or other fat-dissolving substance, then you've also given your scalp a pretty big shock. You wash away its natural protection, and your scalp's defense is to produce lots of oil to compensate. You'll notice this change, especially the first two weeks. You will thus probably have dramatically oilier hair and scalp .


Many people think they are doing wrong, and that the hair's own oil is a disgusting and weird thing. This is where most people give up. But that oil is a good thing!
Your body gives you exactly what your hair needs, now you just need to know what to do with it! That is, distribute it in your hair.;
, The secret to healthy hair without shampoo is to brush and comb it. Very often!

""Huh? But! Wait, isn't that a myth! I've read in a lot of places that you should not do that! The hair breaks! Isn't that right? "" Yes, and no! This advice is found in many books and on many websites that recommend shampoo. And they are absolutely right! If you do this when using shampoo, it breaks. Shampoo makes the hair to become porous and brittle, breaking easily. Therefore, it's usually supplemented with a conditioner, artificial chemicals, or vegetable oil, to fill in the cracks and adding a protective layer on top .
However, without shampoo, brushing helps distribute your body's own protective sebum over the hair, making it stronger and shinier.

, You can compare it to a wooden floor! If you have untreated wooden floors as you continually clean with, say dishwashing liquid, then it will crack. The dishwashing liquid is fat-dissolving and removes what natural wax and oils remaining in the wood. It becomes dry and rough. If you want to save it, you can try rubbing in, say, mineral oil or petroleum jelly (paraffin, petroleum jelly and a whole range of other mineral oil based products ) in the wood. It fills it up nicely for a while, but it also dries the wood out and makes the cracks grow larger.


Know that, similarly, mineral / vegetable oil and hair are not best friends. The same applies to the hair. If you clean your hair with shampoo every day, it's like using dishwashing liquid on a wooden floor, whether your shampoo is based on petroleum or plant products.

, What should you do then? When it comes to wooden floors, you can rub it with green soap, a product that more or less consists of wood oil. The wood can absorb the soap excellent. In time it will disappear as well, but the wood is not dried out or cracking up more. But sooner or later, you will always end up with dust on a floor. Sweep your floor, and vacuum it to remove dirt.


Know that hair oil and hair are, similarly, best friends! When it comes to your hair so you can still rub it with tallow - the fat coming out of your scalp! Imagine your hairbrush as an ordinary brush , and your comb like a vacuum cleaner. Brush and comb your hair to remove dirt, while distributing the new grease! The first six weeks, you'll probably feel that your hair is extremely oily. It is because your scalp attack produces lots of sebum, to protect your hair.

, Brush your hair instead, daily. Several times! Use a dense brush, brush or comb through it morning, noon and night. All the way from the scalp to ends ! That way you will get an even layer of sebum over the hair strand, and a shiny, strong and beautiful hair.

, It may well be that your hair is getting fat and stringy. It is the first sign that you have not brushed it sufficient enough. Do you want to clean it a bit extra?

, Know that hot water opens the hair strand and cold water closes the hair strand. When you want to wash your hair:


Open: So your natural fat from the scalp enters the hair strand more smoothly.
Comb through hair thoroughly. Distribute your sebum all the way to the ends!
Shower your hair with as cool water as you can. Tilt your head and rinse only the hair itself, so you don't have to be cold.
Comb through it again, to get get rid of any excess fat.

, When you use this method, you will see that the comb and the brush, except the hairs you shed naturally, will gather a small layer of white stuff. It is the excess oil from your hair.


Do not forget to wash your comb. Rinse it with warm water. Is it really hard to remove; use a mild soap and rinse.
Also make sure to keep your brush clean. You can comb away shed hair and excess oil from your brush with the comb. If that does not help, wash it the same way as you did with the comb. Just make sure it is properly dried, and that no soap residue remains. The soap dehydrates the brushes and makes them brittle, just like shampoo does with your hair.

Invest in an ionic blow dryer.The ion technology behind these hair dryers allows them to dry your hair much faster with the least amount of damage.,
Get a high-quality ceramic flat iron.,
Buy a hair brush with boar hair bristles.,
Get a flat paddle hair brush.These are the ideal brushes to use on your hair when you’re in the process of blow drying it.,
Obtain smoothing shampoo and conditioner.Look for products that advertise as being “smoothing” and frizz-reducing and that contain hydrating ingredients, proteins and nourishing oils.,
Invest in a smoothing serum.These products are a must for those with dry or frizzy hair, but anyone trying to achieve a sleek look should get a good one.,
Buy a thermal protectant.,

Reapply a small amount of serum and set your hair with hairspray.Sparingly use a tiny amount of serum to smooth down any fly-aways or roughness.",How to Get Sleek Hair," The negative ions the dryer emits cause your hair cuticle to lay flat, which smooths out frizz and coarseness, resulting in straighter, shinier hair.Ionic blow dryers tend to be on the pricy side, but there are affordable versions out there.
Be sure to get one that comes with a nozzle attachment.
Look for one that is at least 1500 watts.;
, Ceramic-plated flat irons straighten hair faster and more efficiently than other types of irons, and they are also the most gentle on hair.Look for one that’s no wider than an inch and a half, since anything wider isn’t ideal for straightening hair (the wider ones are better for styling hair).Ceramic flat irons are the best choice for those who have fine to normal hair.
If you have thick, curly hair, opt for a gold or titanium-plated flat iron.Some companies make flat irons plated with a blend of ceramic and titanium – these are excellent choices for coarse hair.

, For general hair brushing (not blow drying), a boar bristle brush is the ideal choice because it's very gentle on your hair. Boar bristles also add shine and sleekness by redistributing the natural oil in your hair as you brush through it.Avoid hair brushes with nylon or plastic bristles for general hair brushing. These tend to cause breakage and hair damage.

These will help preserve the color., Serums smooth the hair cuticle, add shine, and protect your strands from environmental damage.Look for serums with Argan or Moroccan oil and avoid those that have a high percentage of alcohol in them. Alcohol can be very drying.
Use sparingly, especially since people with thin hair will need to use far less serum on their hair than those with thick hair., Blow drying and flat ironing your hair can cause significant heat damage if you aren’t using a product to protect it. These products often come in spray bottles and require that you spritz them on before using heated tools on your hair.Sometimes thermal protectants are advertised as “heat activated” products, but they are essentially the same thing – they are designed to protect your hair from heat damage.Look for thermal products that will also help to protect against humidity and tame frizzy strands.

, Many of the “shine” finishing sprays on the market contain silicon, which is harmful, so look for versions that are silicon-free.


Hairspray with a light hold functions well as a finishing spray, especially if you can’t find a silicon-free finishing product.

, Use your smoothing shampoo and conditioner to prep your hair for best results. Shampoo gently. After you apply the conditioner, comb through your hair with a paddle brush to evenly and thoroughly distribute it before rinsing it out.If you have long hair and want to avoid washing your hair daily, use dry shampoo in between washings to keep your locks fresh.

, Pat your hair gently with a towel, working downward.Rough towel drying can encourage hair to curl up, especially if you already have a natural wave to it. Allow your hair to air dry until it’s about 80% dry before blow drying it.


Blow drying wet hair is extremely damaging and it can also cause your hair to become frizzy., This is the same direction as the hair cuticle, so applying it that way will ensure that you get the sleekest results.,


Once your hair is dry, use the cool setting on the hair dryer to blast it with cool air for about 60 seconds for an additional shine boost., If you have thick or long hair, it may be easier for you to tie most of it up and bring it down a section at a time to straighten it.

Work slowly and steadily and don’t iron over the same section of hair more than 2-3 times.

Make sure your hair is completely dry before you begin – if you hear a sizzle, stop and use your blow dryer for a few more minutes before resuming.Adjust the heat setting on your flat iron to suit your hair type.If you have fine or damaged hair, set the temperature at 300 to 350 degrees.
Normal hair can use the 350 to 400 degree setting and if you have coarse hair, use the 400 degree setting.

, Don’t neglect the ends of your hair, which tend to dry out the most when subjected to heating tools. Then allow your hair to cool down completely before applying a light might of hairspray or finishing spray all over your hairstyle to set it.


If you don’t wait for your hair to cool down before applying hairspray, you may hear some sizzling, which means you’re damaging your hair.
Instead of misting, try spraying your mixed nylon and boar bristle brush with the hairspray and then running it through your hair to avoid stiffness or stickiness."

Take care of your hair.",How to Dye Hair Sherbet Colors," How much you bleach your hair depends on the color and thickness of your hair. Some hair types can get very pale, while others won't. Do not over-process your hair.If you already bleached your hair, then you may only need to bleach the roots.


Keep your hair covered with a shower cap as it is bleaching. This helps make it whiter.;
, Dye is translucent. This means that is mixes with whatever color is underneath. If your bleached hair has yellowish tints in it, and you try to add pink to it, you may end up with orange. You want your hair to be as white or silvery as possible. If you hair tuned out too yellow or brassy, apply a toner to it to help neutralize it.Each bleach toner is a little different, so be sure to follow the instructions on the bottle.

, Each type of dye is different. Some recommend that you wash your hair with both shampoo and conditioner before hand, while others recommend using just shampoo. Make sure that your hair is dry before you move on to the next step, however., The most popular colors for sherbet are: bright pink, bright orange, yellow, and neon/lime green. Raspberry, strawberry, and orange is another popular combination. You can also base your hair color off of your favorite sherbet color instead.


The yellow and green should be similar in hue, otherwise the green will stand out too much. You can also just use a greenish-yellow instead of those two colors.

, If you don't have an old shirt to spare, put on a dark-colored shirt inside. Drape a towel or hair-dyeing cape over your shoulders. Consider applying petroleum jelly to your hairline and neck as well. This is not absolutely necessary, but it will keep your skin during the dyeing process., Some types of dye are ready to go while others have to be mixed in with a developer. Prepare each color separately in its own plastic bowl using a separate utensil.


Don't be afraid to mix dyes to get a specific shade., Use a rattail comb to divide your hair into evenly-sized, vertical sections that are at least 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) wide. Twist and clip the sections out of the way. You can have as many or as few sections as you want; 6 to 9 sections would be ideal. Have all of the sections come to the same point at the top of your head.


If you don't have a rattail comb, section off your hair with the pointy end of a dye applicator brush instead.If you don't have enough clips, use hair ties instead., Unclip and untwist the first section. Use a dye applicator brush to apply the dye into your hair. Start from the roots and work your way down., Use your fingers to massage the dye into that section of hair. Make sure that you get the dye between every strand., Wrap a sheet of plastic wrap around your dyed hair. You can also twist your dyed hair and clip it back into place.If you don't have plastic wrap, you can use aluminum foil instead.

, This is very important. If you don't do this step, you will end up transferring your first color into your second color.If you are really worried about this, take the gloves off, and put on a new set of gloves.

, Move onto the next color. Apply it using the same technique, making sure to start from the roots. Work the dye into your hair, then cover it with plastic wrap, or twist and clip it out of the way.


Do not use the same applicator for the next color. Use a new applicator.

, You will need to repeat your color order once you use your last color. Remember to wipe your hands clean between each section, or switch to a new set of gloves. Twist and clip the sections out of the way as you finish them, or cover them with plastic wrap.

Continue mixing until the consistency is similar to yogurt. If you’re not using the mask right away, keep it in an air-tight container for no more than a week.You can use a food processor, blender, or a non-metal bowl to mix the ingredients together. If you use a bowl, choose a whisking tool that is not made of metal. Coming in contact with metal can lessen the effectiveness of the clay.

",How to Dry Your Hair Fast," Conditioner locks in moisture and helps repel water to prevent your hair from absorbing more water than necessary following a bath or shower.;
, This speeds up the drying process and prevents your hair from being soaking wet immediately following a shower.


Separate your hair into multiple sections and squeeze each section to wring out excess water.
Flip your head upside down and run fingers through your hair to shake out droplets of water.

, Microfiber towels are soft and super absorbent, and can soak up more water than other towels without damaging your hair cuticles.


Separate your hair into multiple sections and blot each section using a dry towel for the best results., The ends of your hair often dry faster than its roots, which tend to finish drying last. When blotting your hair dry using a towel, spend more time on the roots to speed up drying.

, A microfiber brush has the ability to absorb moisture while you brush, whereas wide-tooth combs separate your hair and promote better airflow.

, This allows your hair to dry as much as possible while you’re getting ready and saves time with blow-drying and styling. For example, wash your hair immediately after waking up, then apply makeup, get dressed, and eat breakfast before blow-drying and styling your hair.

, Many commercial hair products such as mousse, lotions, and primers now contain heat-conducting polymers that wick moisture away from your hair. Apply these products to your hair as directed prior to blow-drying or air-drying your hair., Ionic hair dryers with a wattage between 1800 and 1850 can speed up the drying process by as much as 70 percent., Wearing a towel turban while getting ready allows the towel to absorb excess water and moisture from your hair. Replace with a new towel when your existing towel turban becomes heavy and wet.

, This prevents the top layers from soaking up excess water after they’ve already dried, especially when combing or brushing your hair. Flip your head over, then blow-dry the bottom layers before moving on to the top layers.,"

Proper hydration is not only essential for the growth of your hair, but it will also ensure that your body functions properly. Aim to drink six to eight cups of water per day.


Replace one to two caffeinated beverages with water every day.
Set an alarm to remind you when it is time for your next glass of water.;
, Proteins, specifically keratin, are the building blocks of hair. To encourage hair growth, eat a diet rich in nuts, lentils, and lean meats. To improve your scalp’s health, consume foods that are naturally rich in vitamin A (dark leafy greens and sweet potatoes), vitamin C (citrus fruits), iron (lean red meats), and omega-3 fatty acids (avocados).Avoid risky fad diets. Your hair won't grow if it thinks you body is in trouble. The nutrients and vitamins you need to produce luscious locks will be diverted from your hair follicles and used to maintain necessary functions. In some extreme cases, your hair may even fall out.
Eggs, bananas, raisins, and olive oil are also rich in the vitamins and nutrients you need to grow strong hair and maintain a healthy scalp.
Consuming too much salt, carbonated beverages, sugar, alcohol, and white flour may inhibit hair growth.

, Getting plenty of sleep is essential to leading a healthy, balanced life. Anxiety and stress can decrease your stomach acids, inhibiting the proper digestion and assimilation of the proteins, vitamins, and nutrients that encourage hair growth. Occasionally, too much stress can alter your hormone levels, disrupt your hair’s growth cycle, and ultimately cause your hair to fall out. Sleeping reduces stress and promotes cell growth, as well as cell repair.Leave your phone, tablet or computer on the bedside table when it is time to sleep.

, Read the labels of all of your hair products carefully. Look for shampoos and conditioners that contain vitamins A, B, C, and or E. These vitamins will nourish and hydrate your hair. Avoid products that contain two or more detergents, such as sodium lauryl sulfate and ammonium lauryl sulfate. This product will strip your hair of its natural oils and cause more damage.Don’t over wash your hair. Try switching to a regiment of shampooing your hair one day and using conditioner the following day.When shampooing your hair, apply the product directly to your scalp. Lather it in and let it run down your hair.
If you have an oily scalp, only apply conditioner to the ends of your hair., Applying a deep conditioner to your hair once a week can repair, replenish, and rehydrate damaged hair from the root all the way down to the ends of your tresses. You can either purchase a deep conditioner from your favorite beauty store or use natural ingredients to make your own deep conditioner at home., Brushing your hair with a boar hair bristle brush will result in a healthy, shinny mane. These brushes stimulate your scalp and naturally condition your hair, while reducing frizz and improving the texture of your hair. After using a boar hair bristle brush, your need for styling products will decrease and you will have to wash your hair less frequently.When brushing your hair, concentrate on spreading your hair’s natural oils. A boar hair bristle brush works great for this.
Avoid using brushes with metal or plastic bristles.
When detangling wet hair, use a wide-toothed comb to get the snarls out!, Trimming your hair on a regular basis—about every 6 to 8 weeks—will keep your hair looking and feeling healthy. It won’t prevent hair growth. Growth happens at the roots, not the ends., Certain hairstyles pull on your roots and can actually slow hair growth. Hairstyles that pull on your scalp, like cornrows, braids, and high ponytails, can also cause hair breakage. Teasing also pulls on your roots and wreaks havoc on your ends.

, Instead of wearing a tight up-do that can damage your hair and roots, wear your hair down and natural. When pulling your hair back, style it in a loose braid. Going for a run? Pull your mane back in a low, loose ponytail.


Just need your hair out of your eyes? Try a cute headband or a rolled up bandana.

, When you blow-dry your locks, straighten your mane, or curl your hair, prevent further damage with a heat protectant. Apply the heat protectant, which you can purchase at any drug store, prior to styling your hair.

, Applying unnecessary heat to already damaged hair will only lead to further breakage. Instead of blow-drying your hair, let it air-dry.


Always use a heat protectant when blow-drying your hair!If you have a diffuser, use it! This tool that attaches to the tip of your blow-dryer helps spread the heat evenly throughout your hair.

, Like blow-drying, curling or straightening already damaged hair will only result in additional damage. If you do curl or straighten your hair, don’t blow-dry your hair before styling it. Let it air-dry instead.


When curling or straightening your hair, always use a heat protectant!
Use a curling iron or flat iron that shows you the temperature of the barrel or plates. Turn the tools to the lowest heat possible.

, When massaging your scalp, you can use a variety of oils. Pick from jojoba, coconut, olive, castor or egg oil. You could also try a variety of essential oils, including almond, lavender, or cedar wood oils.

, Pour or scoop about one tablespoon of the oil of your choice into small dish. Dip your fingertips in the oil. Shake of any excess oil over the dish.








, Using your fingertips, massage your scalp to stimulate the roots. Rub your scalp for approximately ten minutes. Dip your fingertips into the dish of oil as needed.









If you have an oily scalp, don’t overdo the oil. Use it sparingly.

, Brush your hair from root to tip with a boar hair bristle brush. This will spread the oil and your natural hair oil through your hair. Don’t use a brush with metal or plastic bristles.








, If you have oily or normal hair, let the oil soak into your hair for a few hours. If you have dry hair, let the oil soak into your damaged locks overnight. Wrap your hair in a soft towel or place a shower cap over your hair to prevent frizz (and stains on your pillowcase if you are going to bed).

, After completing the hair treatment, rinse out your hair with shampoo and water. You may need to wash a couple times to remove the oil.


Don’t use conditioner after this treatment.

, Towel your hair. Brush out the snarls with a boar hair bristle brush. Let your hair air-dry. If you choose to blow-dry your hair, use a heat protectant. Leave your hair down, plait it into a loose braid, or pull it back in a loose pony tail."

Choose your rub.",How to Remove the Smell of Bleach from Your Hands1," Neutralize bleach’s base chemical make-up with foods high in natural acids. Combining an edible liquid acid with bleach is a great way to even out the overall pH and eliminate that unpleasant odor. Use any one of the following foods to neutralize the bleach:


Lemon, lime, orange, or grapefruit juice (also lime – any citrus fruit, really)
Vinegar
Tomatoes (tomato sauce, puree, or paste work as well);
, Rub it in well. It’s best to do this for at least a minute as it gives you time to make sure you’ve covered everything. This also allows the liquid to soak in and neutralize the bleach.

, Voila! The smell will hopefully be gone.

, If washing your hands doesn’t work, or you don’t wish to use straight liquid on your hands, dilute these acidic foods 1:1 with water. Then let your hands soak in this mixture for 2-3 minutes.

, Combining a food that is both dry and high in acid content with bleach is a great way to even out the overall Ph and eliminate that unpleasant odor as well. Use one of these dry acids as a rub to neutralize the base:


Baking soda
Coffee grounds

, Take the rub of your choice and do just that: rub it all over your hands. Take your time and rub it in well, much like an exfoliant scrub. Do this for one minute. Wipe off the excess into a trashcan and rinse with hot water. This will allow the rub to penetrate deeply into your pores. If you don’t like the smell of coffee, of course, opt for using baking soda.

Go for a mask that aims at hydrating dry hair if your hair is frizzy., Thin or flat hair can benefit from added protein. If your hair is on the thinner side, look for a mask that has a lot of protein. Protein-based masks can help replenish thin, flat hair., If you have oily hair, talk to a stylist instead of applying a hair mask yourself. Oily hair may be made worse by a hair mask. A stylist can help think of a specific solution for your hair in that case., Certain ingredients benefit hair more or less. You want a hair mask that has ingredients that help with general hair strength. Oils like olive oil, jojoba oil, and argan oil help with hair strength. You can also opt for with wheat proteins. The ingredient keravis increases hair strength and protects hair from further damage due to heat.Henna can also be a nourishing ingredient, but tends to build up over time. This can result in it altering the color of your hair. If you color your hair frequently, it's best to avoid henna.

, Consult the ingredients label for precise instructions. Most commercial masks, however, are applied after you shampoo your hair and dry it lightly with a towel. You apply them from the roots to the tips and then secure your hair with a shower cap. Most masks are left on for 20 to 30 minutes before you wash them out.Make sure to read the instructions on your specific masks. Some masks may be left on for longer or shorter periods.

Inquire about surgical intervention.",How to Remove Corns from Your Toes," Corns result from pressure and friction on your toes, and tight or uncomfortable shoes can be one of the culprits behind their appearance. One of the most important things you can do to prevent corns from developing and to reduce the severity of any corns you may already have is to stay away from shoes that put pressure on your toes.


Ideally, you should mostly wear shoes that you can wear socks with. Socks can cushion your toes, thereby minimizing the friction that can cause and worsen corns.
Completely avoid high heels, especially those with narrow fronts.;
, Once you get home and kick your shoes off, you can further minimize the pressure on your toes by wedging a foam pedicure comb in between your toes.


You could also try slipping on a pair of foam pedicure slippers or sandals. This footwear places wedges in between your toes, separating them and preventing them from rubbing together as you move around.

, As a result, the corns on your toes are less likely to become irritated or inflamed.


Sprinkle the foot powder over and in between your toes before slipping on your socks and shoes in the morning. You can also reapply the foot powder throughout the day as needed if you sense that the skin in between your toes is getting sweaty.

, Soak your feet in lukewarm, soapy water for about 20 minutes to soften the skin. After that, gently scrub the corn with a pumice stone to remove some of the toughest skin on the top surface of the corn.Alternatively, try using an emery board instead of a pumice stone.When a corn develops in between toes, it can be difficult to scrub it with a pumice stone. An emery board or nail file should be used in these instances.

, If swelling and discomfort continue, you can can apply a cold pack or ice pack to the area for a few minutes to numb away discomfort and minimize swelling.


The ice will not help heal the corn itself, but it can be used to treat the pain associated with severe corns.

, Most over-the-counter treatments contain a minimal concentration of salicylic acid, which dissolves the keratin protein responsible for making up the corn and the thick, crusty layer of skin on top of it.One disadvantage about over-the-counter treatments is that the acids can also damage healthy skin as well as skin affected by corns, so if you use these treatments too readily, you may end up causing more damage than good.
Acids should not be used by diabetics, those with impaired sensation, or those with thin skin.
Always follow the instructions on the label when applying an ointment or other topical treatment.

, These treatments stick on like an adhesive bandage, thereby cushioning the corn on your toes, but they also contain a small concentration of salicylic acid to treat the corn as it remains on.


The best corn pads and plasters are ring-shaped. They provide cushioning to the corn while holding in enough moisture to keep the corn soft, thereby easing discomfort.
Since many of these pads contain an acid treatment, you should not use them with other treatments. If you need to cover the corns after applying another treatment, make sure that you use a corn pad or plaster without salicylic acid in it or a plain adhesive bandage.

, By softening the corn on your toes, you can minimize any pain or discomfort associated with it and making the area affected by the corn easier to exfoliate.


Apply the castor oil using a cotton ball. Leave the oil on your corns for 3 to 4 minutes before rinsing it off and exfoliating the area.
Repeat this up to three times daily.

, Instead of soaking your toes in a normal water bath, mixing in a little Epsom salt or coarse salt can help hasten the softening process.


Coarse salt is also a mild abrasive, so soaking your feet in salt water can soften them while exfoliating some of the dead, dry skin on the surface of your corns.
Dissolve about 1/2 cup (125 ml) of Epsom salt in 2 gallons (8 L) of warm water inside of a large bucket. Soak your feet in this salt water for 20 to 30 minutes.
When done, scrub the corns with a pumice stone to exfoliate away as much of the dead skin as possible.

, Aspirin is a source of salicylic acid. You can crush the aspirin and apply it to the corn topically to dissolve some of the protein making up the corn and the layer of dead skin on top of it.


Crush a single aspirin and mix it with a few drops of water, just enough to form a grainy paste.
Apply this paste to the corns on your toes. Let it sit for 5 to 10 minutes before rinsing off with warm water and drying.

, A paste made from baking soda, lime juice, and water can help hasten the recovery process for a corn on your toes.Combine a few drops of lime juice with a little water and about 1 tsp (5 ml) of baking soda. Mix until a paste forms and apply the paste to your corns. Cover with a bandage and rinse the paste off in the morning. Within 4 to 6 days, the corn should dry off on its own.
Alternatively, mix 2 to 3 Tbsp (30 to 45 ml) of baking soda into a tub of warm water. Soak your feet for 15 to 20 minutes before rubbing the corns on your toes with a pumice stone.
You could also mix the baking soda with a few drops of water to form a paste. Apply this paste to the corns, cover the corns with a bandage, and let sit overnight. Wash the mixture off in the morning.

, Chamomile can soothe the discomfort you feel while drying the sweat in between your toes and altering the pH of your skin, thereby speeding up recovery.


You can apply a wet, warm tea bag of chamomile tea to the corns on your toes for 1 to 3 hours.
Alternatively, let your feet soak in a small bucket of diluted chamomile tea for 15 to 20 minutes.
When done with either method, you can try removing some of the corn with a pumice stone or emery board.

, Vinegar is an astringent, so applying it can cause more of the skin to dry up and die, giving you the opportunity to scrub it away with a pumice stone or emery board.


Dilute the vinegar by a ratio of 1 part vinegar to 3 parts water.
Apply this vinegar solution to the corns and cover the corns with adhesive bandages or pads. Let sit overnight.
It the morning, exfoliate the thickened skin with a pumice stone or emery board.

, Papaya can ease any pain or discomfort associated with corns, and oftentimes, it helps the corn to dry up and fall off faster.


Slice a papaya and use a fork to mash some of the flesh. Apply this mashed papaya directly to the corns on your toes, cover with an adhesive bandage or bad, and let stay overnight.
In the morning, the corn can be exfoliated again. Following this treatment can even occasionally cause corns to fall off on their own.

, Green fig juice can soften the corns, making them easier to remove, and mustard oil can help kill any bacteria that may otherwise cause infections.


Apply the green fig juice first. Dab a small amount on with a cotton ball and let it dry on your skin.
After the green fig juice has dried, you can apply a dab of mustard oil with a cotton ball, as well. This should help stop bacterial infections that could result if the exfoliating process leaves your skin cracked and cut.

, This mixture will soften the skin on your toes affected by the corn, making the corn easier to remove as a result.Turmeric is an anti-inflammatory that can ease discomfort, aloe has healing properties, and bromelain is an extract taken from pineapples that has astringent properties. If you do not have bromelian, you could substitute tea tree oil, instead.
Mix equal parts ground turmeric, aloe gel, and bromelian to form a paste. Apply this paste to the corns on your toes, cover it with a bandage, and leave the mixture on overnight. In the morning, rinse the mixture off and use a pumice stone on your corns.

, Professionally fitted shoe inserts can provide just the right amount of cushioning and protection for your feet, thereby helping corns on your toes to heal faster and preventing more corns from developing.


You could use standard gel inserts purchased from the store, but customized inserts will be much more effective. Talk to a podiatrist about where and how to purchase prescription show inserts custom-fit for your foot.

, Prescription remedies often use higher concentrations of salicylic acid than their over-the-counter counterparts, and some prescription remedies also use other, stronger combinations of acids to accomplish the same purpose.


Acids should not be used by diabetics, those with impaired sensation, or those with thin skin.
Other acids that can be used to treat corns include trichloroacetic acid and a combination of salicylic acid, lactic acids, and collodion.Follow the instructions carefully when given a medication to prevent accidental damage to the skin around the corn.

, If corns on your toes become infected, you may need to ask your doctor for an antibiotic to treat the infection as the corn heals.


Note that an oral or topical antibiotic will only be prescribed if the corn gets infected. Antibiotics will have no effect on the corn itself and will only treat the infection.

, While you should not shave or cut off a corn on your own, a professional foot doctor, or podiatrist, is often able to do so safely if the circumstances warrant it.


The podiatrist will numb the area and carefully slice the thickened part of the corn off with a very sharp, thin blade. The procedure is painless and safe when done by a professional, and it can reduce overall discomfort while speeding up the healing process., If you develop corns on your toes frequently, a podiatrist may recommend a surgical procedure that can correct the positioning of the bones in your toes. This, in turn, eases the pressure put on your toes and makes the development of corns far less likely to occur.


Corns can develop in between your toes when the bones in your toes grow at angles that cause the toes to naturally rub up against each other. Surgery can actually realign these bones, making them straighter and less likely to collide.

Aloe Vera lotion: make sure the lotion is high in Aloe Vera as that will make a huge difference in its effectiveness
Tea tree oil lotion: like Aloe Vera, a higher concentrate will do a better job
Citrus based lotions
Citrus based soaps: there are some all-natural soaps that provide both the cleaning power of soap and the moisturizing effects of lotion. Check your local health food store to see if they have any that fit your needs and budget.

, When using oils you don’t want to overdo it. You could wind up over-oiling yourself, thus adding another step (namely, removing all that excess oil!).

, If you’re using lotion, this should be enough to coat your entire hand and give you a good idea if you need more and if the lotion you’ve chosen is doing the job.

, If you use a citrus based soap, lather up then use hot water. This helps the soap latch onto those base bleach molecules and lift them out.

The red comes from dilated blood vessels just beneath the surface of the skin. The capillaries open, and more blood flows to your hands, resulting in more fluid loss.
Stay away from hot-air hand dryers as well.

Consult a doctor about medical concerns.",How to Make Hands Look Younger," These spots, which are also called liver spots, are caused by neither age nor your liver. In fact, they are areas of hyperpigmentation caused by increased melanin production that occurs because of UV exposure.The appearance of sun spots can be reduced with:


Skin bleaching agents that contain hydroquinone.
Fading or lightening creams that contain glycolic or kojic acid, vitamin C, licorice, and mushroom extract.Laser therapy or intense pulsed light therapy.;
, As we age, the skin on our hands can become wrinkled and creped (looking like crepe paper or streamers) because of fat loss and collagen and elastin depletion. Skin can also become saggy, red, or discolored, and develop a poor texture or growths. Dryness and cracking can also make your hands look older. Regular moisturizing and the use of anti-aging creams can prevent dryness and the signs of aging.


Always moisturize your hands after you bathe or wash your hands. Pat your hands dry and apply your favorite moisturizer while they're still damp.
Make a moisturizing hand mask with one tablespoon (5.5 grams) of oat flour, and one tablespoon (0.5 ounces) each of rose water and either almond, olive, coconut, or jojoba oil. Warm the mixture on the stove and apply it to your hands. Wrap your hands in plastic wrap and rinse the mask off once it has cooled, about 10 to 15 minutes.
Look for anti-aging creams that contain ingredients such as retinol, antioxidants, and peptides.To help plump your hands up again, try a retinoid cream,a weekly collagen mask on the back of your hands,or rub into your hands an eye cream that contains hyaluronic acid., By removing dead skin cells, exfoliation can make your skin softer and brighter, and help even out the skin tone. You can exfoliate by gently rubbing your skin with kitchen remedies like coffee grounds or oats, or look for an exfoliating product that contains alpha-hydroxy acids, vitamin C, and retinoids.


Next time you’re exfoliating your face, apply the same product to your hands., Rub a small amount of olive or coconut oil into your hands before bed to help moisturize your skin and improve circulation.Add some sugar to the mix for the additional benefit of exfoliating your skin at the same time. Be gentle as you massage, and be sure to get the back of your hands, palms, fingers, and your cuticles and nails.


If you used sugar as well, rinse it off when you are finished the massage, otherwise your hands will get sticky. Be sure to moisturize again after washing your hands.

, Old manicure styles, chipped nail polish, and ignored cuticles can all make your hands look less than perfect. While professional manicures can be expensive and you run the risk of fungal infections,you can achieve many of the same results at home. Every week:


Remove existing nail polish. Trim and file your nails. Apply a cuticle oil. Once it has been on for a few minutes, push your cuticles back with a cuticle pusher.Either leave your nails bare to give them a break from the nail polish, or try a bold new color to draw attention to your nails instead of your hands.Never cut your cuticles, as this can cause bleeding and leave you vulnerable to infections., For a quick and temporary fix to make your hands look younger, rub a small amount of liquid concealer all over the back of your hands.Although the effect isn’t permanent, this will help conceal wrinkles, uneven tone and texture, sun spots, and other signs of aging.

, When you age you lose fat in your hands, and this makes the bones and veins more prominent. Fat injections and fillers are designed to plump your hands up again. If you’re going to go this route, choose a filler treatment that includes hyaluronic acid, which is a great moisturizer that helps to plump skin. There are also laser treatments you can get done that promote collagen production, which will help plump your skin up again., Since UV exposure causes age spots, the best way to prevent them is to protect your hands from the sun. Wear a sunscreen with an SPF between 30 and 50 all day, every day. And don’t forget to reapply throughout the day. Try to keep your hands out of direct and indirect sunlight as much as possible, especially during the hours between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m.

, Many of the foods that are good for our bodies also keep our skin looking younger. Eating a balanced diet that includes whole grains, fruits and vegetables of all colors, and healthy fats will help keep your skin looking radiant and youthful. And don’t forget to stay hydrated! Anytime you feel thirsty, drink a cup of water.

Let the doctor lift your toenail.,
Allow the doctor to trim a severely ingrown toenail.,
Discuss a partial nail avulsion.",How to Relieve Ingrown Toenail Pain2," If the ingrown toenail becomes severely infected, it can spread to the bone in the toe. You should be checked by a doctor if:The pain is severe.
The toe is infected and oozing pus.
The toe is red and the redness is spreading. This would suggest that the infection is spreading.
You have diabetes or another condition that reduces the circulation in your feet. This makes it more difficult for your body to heal infections in your feel and increases your risk of complications.

, If the toenail is only a little bit ingrown, the doctor may gently lift it out to help it grow over, instead of into, the surrounding skin. The doctor may insert something underneath to hold the nail above the skin. This may be:A small amount of cotton
Dental floss
A small splint

, If your toe is very red, painful, and oozing pus, the doctor may cut away the part of the nail that is digging into the skin and causing the infection.If the procedure is likely to be painful, the doctor may give you a shot of an anesthetic first.
If the toe is infected, the doctor may also prescribe antibiotics.

, This involves removing part of the nail and nail bed. This procedure would only be done if you have a history of reoccurring ingrown toenails.

A chemical called phenol
Electricity
Small surgical cuts

Trim your toenails so they are straight.,
Wear proper footwear.,
Examine your feet each day.",How to Relieve Ingrown Toenail Pain3," Curved nails are more likely to dig into the surrounding skin.Trim your toenails so they are even with the ends of your toes.

Wash your feet every day with warm water and soap.This removes dirt, sweat, and odor causing bacteria. Make sure to take special care to wash your feet when taking a bath or shower. Many times people forget to wash their feet, or do it quickly. Your feet need as much, if not more, attention as the rest of your body.


Wash between your toes and around the nail beds. These are places where bacteria can grow.
If your feet smell, try washing your feet multiple times a day. Once in the morning, once at night, and once after you work out or get extra sweaty.;
, Getting rid of the dead skin can help reduce the smell. Scrub your feet at home with an exfoliating scrub or a pumice stone, or treat yourself to a pedicure.


Also keep your toenails clean and trimmed to reduce bacteria.
Moisturize your feet with lotion to keep them soft and healthy. Try lotions with fragrances like lavender or peppermint to help combat odors.

, Foot odor is caused by bacteria, which breed and thrive in moist areas. As you wear sweaty, damp socks and shoes, bacteria grow and eventually start clinging to the feet and causing odor. By keeping your feet dry, you remove the moisture where the bacteria would live.


Dry your feet off really well after you shower. Make sure to get all of your feet, including the area between the toes.
Wipe between your toes with rubbing alcohol after drying them. The rubbing alcohol helps dry out the skin between the toes., When you can, wear socks with your shoes. Socks absorb moisture, so when you skip them, the sweat transfers to your shoes or gets trapped between your toes. When you wear boots and sneakers, always wear socks.


Socks don't work well with pumps or ballet flats. Buy the small no-show socks designed to be hidden when worn with dress shoes. These socks can be purchased at major retailers.

, The socks you wear can make a difference in the smell of your feet. Always wear a fresh pair of socks; don't rewear socks multiple days in a row. When choosing socks, choose synthetic socks.Be wary of cotton socks. They absorb moisture, which could make your feet soggy, and therefore, smelly.Try moisture-wick socks that pull moisture away from the skin, or feet-fresh athletic socks that contain ventilation. You can also purchase antibacterial socks that have ingredients that help prevent bacteria from growing.
No matter if you wear synthetic or cotton socks, make sure they are breathable fabric.
Turn your socks inside out when you wash them to clean the dead skin and moisture from the inside., Antiperspirants contain chemicals that help reduce sweating. Deodorants, on the other hand, only mask the smell, so steer away from those. Spread antiperspirant on your feet before you go to bed. This allows the product enough time to soak into your skin so it will start to work the next day. Don't forget to place it between your toes, where a lot of sweat and odor begins.You can also place antiperspirant on your feet before putting on your shoes the next morning. Just make sure not to only put it on in the morning, because if your feet start to sweat right away, it could remove the antiperspirant.

, By alternating your shoes, you allow at least 24 hours for the shoes to dry.This reduces moisture, which is where the odor causing bacteria dwells.


If you exercise daily, buy two pairs of shoes.One of the main causes of foot sweat is exercise. Athletic shoes are a common odor site. Alternate between pairs throughout the week, making sure to give each pair plenty of time to completely dry before exercising in them again.

, When you are not wearing your shoes, sprinkle baking soda or talcum powder onto the soles.


Baking soda is believed to be effective in neutralizing odors. It neutralizes the pH of sweat and reduces bacteria.It also helps absorb moisture.You can put baking soda into your shoes between wears, and even brush it on your feet before putting on your socks.
You can also brush your feet with cornstarch before wearing shoes to absorb and soak up moisture.
You might also try rubbing antibacterial cream on your feet to reduce the amount of bacteria.

, Spray some deodorizing or disinfecting spray into your shoes to cut down on the odor. You might also try washing out the soles and insides of your shoes with rubbing alcohol.

, When at home, let your feet be free. Don't wear socks or shoes unless you have to. If your feet are cold, wear clean socks that are thick and soft because they will help draw the moisture away from your feet., One major cause for foot sweating is shoes that don't breathe. When choosing shoes to wear, choose ones that breathe. Steer clear of plastic and rubber shoes because they do not breathe.


Get shoes made of leather, canvas, or mesh, which provide airflow for your feet.
Wear open-toed shoes when possible. Open-toed heels, sandals, and flip-flops allow plenty of airflow to your feet, which keeps the sweating to a minimum.

, If you have shoes that can be thrown into the washing machine, wash them every week or two. Add some baking soda to the wash to help with the odor.


Wash your socks regularly. Add baking soda or bleach to the cycle to help cut odor.
Don't dry sneakers in the dryer. Instead, place them on top of the dryer and let the heat from the dryer help dry them. You can also let them air dry.
If you can't wash your shoes, wash them out with hot water and baking soda.

, When you go out into the snow or rain, make sure to wear proper shoes to avoid soaking your shoes. If you get your shoes wet, make sure to dry them properly. Otherwise, the shoes might sour.


Dry the shoes on top of the clothes dryer, with a hair dryer, or in the sunlight. Make sure to dry them as soon as possible so they don't sour.
If you know you have to be out and can't wear water-proof shoes, think about purchasing plastic shoe covers. These shoe protectors can be purchased at major retailers.

, After washing your feet with soap and water, think about squirting antibacterial hand sanitizer on your feet. This might help keep bacteria from growing on your feet., Epsom salt helps neutralize odor and helps fight bacteria. Dissolve 1/2 cup of Epsom salt into 8 cups of warm water. Soak your feet for 30 minutes daily. Don't rinse the salt from your feet afterwards, just dry your feet thoroughly.This works well if you do it before bed and don't put socks on afterwards.

, Vinegar is an acid that creates an environment where bacteria cannot live. Mix 1/2 cup of white or apple cider vinegar with 6 cups of hot water. Soak your feet for 10-15 minutes.Wash your feet with soap and rinse well afterwards to remove the vinegar smell.

, Many people swear by the folk remedy of soaking your feet in black tea to remove foot odor. The tannic acid in tea is believed to deter bacteria by creating an unfriendly environment.


Steep 5 black tea bags in boiling water. When the tea has steeped, mix with 4 cups of cool to warm water - you want to make sure not to burn your feet. Soak your feet for 20 minutes daily.An alternative is to use green tea, which is also thought to destroy the bacteria., Cut a lime in half and rub each half over your feet before bed. Let it dry completely. The acid is believed to prevent bacteria from growing.


You can also use a lemon instead of a lime. You might consider mixing the lemon or lime with baking soda and soaking your feet instead.

, Mix 1 teaspoon of hydrogen peroxide with 1 cup of water. Place the mixture on a washcloth and wipe it over your feet. This may help eliminate some of the bacteria."

Consider less expensive play clothes.",How to Buy Clothes for Children," Children are very active, and need clothing that is relatively durable, especially for daily use. However, clothing made of good quality fabrics doesn’t have to be expensive, and expensive clothing isn’t necessarily made of good quality fabrics. Examine each article of clothing to determine fabric quality.Feel the fabric to make sure it is thick and durable.
Hold the fabric up to the light. If it looks transparent, it is probably not good quality.;
, Children won’t want to wear clothing if it is itchy or rough. Soft fabrics are especially important for babies and toddlers, who have extra sensitive skin.Cotton is a soft, breathable fabric that won’t irritate skin. Fleece works well if you need something warmer., Loose stitches and poorly finished seams are signs of a poorly made clothing item. This item probably won’t last very long, especially after a few wears and washings. For each clothing item, check that seams are tight and stitches are in place.Make sure seams are smooth. Unfinished seams can scratch kids’ sensitive skin.

, Look out for appliqués, sparkles, and other designs that might rub and irritate skin. These might look pretty, but are not very practical if they cause discomfort., Fringe or strings are strangulation hazards for toddlers and infants. Stay away from these when buying clothing for young children., Loose buttons indicate that a clothing item is probably not good quality. They can also be choking hazards for young children. Check that buttons are secure on the clothing items you consider., As a rule, if you expect the child to wear the article frequently and want it to last a while, you should opt for higher quality items. School clothes will be worn a lot, and need to last all year. Investing in good quality school clothes will prevent unnecessary trips back to the clothing store., You may want to splurge on high quality formal wear for your child, especially for events like weddings, which is perfectly fine. However, buying high quality, secondhand formal wear is a good option as well. That way, you’ll save money on items that may only be worn once or twice., Fit is always important when buying clothing. Take the child’s height and weight measurements and consult a sizing chart. Generally, children’s sizes correspond to the child’s age. An average 7 year old will wear a size 7.If the child for whom you are shopping is not your own, consult the child’s parent to determine the appropriate size.
You can bring the child with you to try on clothes, but this can be difficult with younger children.
If you are not sure of the child’s size, err on the larger side. This is especially true for babies and toddlers, who grow at a fast rate.

, Not sure what to buy for a child? Opt for basic pieces, like simple t-shirts, plain shorts, and sweaters or jackets with limited patterning. These can be mixed and matched with other items and worn again and again.Styles are changing faster than ever, so a basic piece will probably last much longer than a trendy one.

, Children are notoriously messy. Try to focus on clothes that are easy to care for and will not show stains clearly, such as dark colors and very bright shades instead of pastels.

This will increase the likelihood that you'll be able to donate, sell, and reuse clothes.

, Although children aren’t always the best judges of fashion, selecting an item that the child likes will ensure the item is used. Well-liked clothing items can make the process of getting dressed easier, particularly for younger children., This is especially important for infants and children just learning to dress themselves. Pick clothing elastic waists, large buttons or snaps, and wide neck holes that can be managed easily.If you are buying for an infant or toddler, remember that they rarely sit still. Snaps and zippers make it easier to dress a squirming child.
Young infants will need to have their clothing changed frequently. Large necks, loose arms, and onesies are key. Avoid shirts that button up the front., Children are always growing. One year of growth can result in several inches of height! Seasonal clothes, like coats or scarves, may only last one season. If possible, opt for slightly too-big sizes in seasonal clothes so they’ll last for at least two seasons., Be sure to take a look at the clearance rack to see if anything catches your eye. Everything here will be discounted.Clearance racks are usually in the back of stores.

, Thrift stores and consignment shops often carry gently used, decent quality clothing items for a reduced price. This is great for fast-growing kids, who may only be able to use an item for a few months before they grow out of it.Thrift stores and consignment shops are great options for babies and toddlers, who grow extra fast.

, If you know the child’s size, try doing some online shopping. Online shopping is fast and convenient, and online stores can offer great deals on children’s clothing.Beware—it may be hard to assess clothing quality or fit when shopping online.
Be sure to check the online store’s return policy in the event that an item doesn’t fit.

Adjust a woman's height with the features of a dress.,
Create balance when selecting dresses for women.,
Select a dress that is age appropriate.,
Consider a woman's skin and hair color when purchasing a dress for her.,
Match a dress to a woman's personality.,
Remember: Some women hate dresses.

",How to Buy Dresses for Women," If a woman has attractive legs, then choose a dress that shows them off. If her arms are toned or she has an attractive neckline, then select a dress that accentuates these physical assets. Just be careful not to highlight a feature to an extreme. For example, if a woman has a large chest, don't accentuate them so that they are the only focus on her body. In this case, opt for a v neck dress that highlights her chest, but guides the viewer's eyes to her face.;
, Just as a dress can highlight a woman's striking features, it can hide the unattractive features. Long dresses hide large calves or unattractive legs. Baby doll dresses hide large wastes and stomachs. An A-line dress can disguise large hips. Oftentimes, when you select a dress that hides 1 feature, you can balance it out by highlighting another.

, Long dresses shorten a woman, whereas a dress that stops above the knee, showing off the legs, lengthens a woman. Additionally, a solid colored dress helps lengthen a woman more than a dress with a design or pattern.

, The right dress should hide and highlight features on a woman so that her figure is well balanced. Use all the features of a dress, such as color, material, shape, length and design, to create a balanced look overall.

, Younger women can afford to wear dresses that are shorter and tighter. For an older woman, select a dress that is no shorter than knee length. Opt for simple styles for older women, rather than styles boasting bows, ruffles and frills; these elements would be more suited to younger women.

, Dark skin and hair are best dressed in lighter, more colorful dresses. Blondes and pale skin look better in darker colors, blacks and browns.

, A serious woman is best suited to a conservative style dress. Whereas, a relaxed, casual character will appreciate a dress that is brightly colored or has fun elements, such as jewels and ribbons.

Be prepared for winter runny noses.,
Decide whether you're willing to wipe with your glove.,
Consider removal nose wipe pads.",How to Wipe Your Nose on Your Hands10," Running noses are common during the winter months due to the accumulation of condensation and mucus in the nostrils.

, Since gloves and mittens are worn to keep the hands warm, they may be used as a place to wipe the nose in the same manner as bare fingers and hands. Soft materials used in winter gloves, such as leather and cotton can create a soft cushion for the nose that is being wiped.


The fabric of the glove acts as a surrogate for the wearer's skin, which without the glove would be catching and absorbing all of the snot. By allowing for a glove or mitten to catch it's wearer's snot, the wearer thus will avoid his or her hands feeling or being wet with snot. The glove acts as a convenient rag for a running nose.
In winter sports and other areas where wiping one's nose with hands or fingers would be acceptable, it is common to openly use the back of the glove for nose-wiping without embarrassment. Many gloves manufactured for winter and sporting uses often possess built-in nose wipes, pads on the thumb or index finger, specially designed for the nose to be wiped on it.

, These may be purchased and placed over the backs of the gloves. Household latex, plastic, rubber, or gloves any type may also be used as a place to wipe the nose in the same manner as bare fingers and hands. Unlike leather or cotton gloves, a latex, plastic, or rubber glove will not absorb the wearer's snot. The surfaces of these gloves may remain slippery to until the snot dries on them.

Decide if hand sanitizer is appropriate.,
Apply a dollop of hand sanitizer to one hand.,
Rub your hands together until the sanitizer evaporates.",How to Wash Your Hands2," There are some situations where you can use alcohol-based hand sanitizer instead of using soap and water to wash your hands. However, you may want to take a moment to evaluate the situation. Some things you should consider include:Whether or not your hands are visibly dirty. If you can see the dirt or grease on your hands, then it is best to use soap and water to clean them.

What you got on your hands. Alcohol-based hand sanitizer will not eliminate all of the germs on your hands and it will not remove certain substances, such as pesticides and heavy metals. In these situations, soap and water work best.

The availability of water. If no running water is available to wash your hands, then alcohol-based hand sanitizer is better than nothing. However, if you have access to soap and running water, then washing your hands this way is best.

, To use hand sanitizer to cleanse your hands, apply a dollop of hand sanitizer to one of the palms of your hands. Get about a quarter sized amount so that there will be enough to cover your entire hands.







, Rub your hands together and move the hand sanitizer around them as if you are washing your hands.Cover both sides of your hands, between your fingers, and around your wrists.









This should take about 20 seconds to do and the alcohol-based sanitizer will have dried on your hands by the time you are done.

You can mask a sideways allergic salute as a yawn, or you can integrate a sideways allergic salute into a real yawn.,
You can also integrate the sideways allergic salute into a sneeze.,
You can even motion as to rub an aching forehead.,
If you are wearing glasses or sunglasses.,
If you still are not comfortable being discreet enough, wait until nobody is looking to wipe your nose.",How to Wipe Your Nose on Your Hands11," Just utilize your palm to wipe your nose immediately after you cover your mouth.

, You can do so by integrating the act of ""covering your mouth"" into the way in which you bring your hand into position to perform the sideways allergic salute.

, As you bring your hand up to rub your forehead you can sneak a sideways allergic salute on the way. If you are only wiping your brow you can also wipe your nose on your palm as your fingers rub your forehead.

, Consider integrating nose wiping techniques into any motion where you need to adjust your glasses.


To wipe one nostril during an act to reposition glasses, use the index finger and thumb that corresponds to the running nostril to make the letter ""c"" or backwards ""כ"". While your hand is on its way to adjust the frame of your glasses, sneak a wipe with the back and interior side of your thumb.
Make others think you are pushing a sliding frame of glasses back up the bridge of your nose with the tips of your fingers as you simultaneously perform the allergic salute by wiping your nose on your palm. The act of wiping the nose itself may move glasses out of position so this technique solves both problems.

, This can easily be achieved by causing a distraction (such as asking a question that will cause others to turn from you to look at something) which can give you adequate time to wipe your running nose.

Love your look.",How to Shop for Vintage Clothing," This article presumes that ""vintage"" is at least 30 years ago (currently ruling out the 80s), thereby taking in the 1970s and anything before then. Realistically, not a lot of clothing prior to the 1920s is going to be very practical to wear nowadays, and is likely to be harder to find in good enough condition (or at a good price). In terms of quality, a lot of the clothing pre-1960 will be tailored and finished with greater care and preciseness than clothes post the 60s.This is due to the fact that mass manufacturing of cheap clothing, although already in full swing post World War II,really came into its own from the 60s and 70s, so garments from these decades on will be of varying quality and you'll need to rely on your own eye for assessing quality picks.


Beware! From the 60s on, the love for human-made fibers no matter how scratchy, icky, or heat-producing will be found in a lot of modern style clothes, so pay close attention to the quality and feel!;
, Through the decades, every era has its own particular fashion statements and focus on emphasizing different parts of the body. For most eras, and certainly from the 30s, checking out photos of the major movie stars will give you an excellent overview of the top fashions for each decade and help you to form an idea of what you like the most. Having a good 20th century fashion book in your possession is a sensible buy that will help guide your choices. As well, visit museums, look at online galleries of vintage clothing, and simply browse through stores to start getting a feel for the older fashions. Some brief major points from the 20s to the 70s include:1900-1918: Beginning of haute couture, major reforms in clothing and some severity in styles during World War I.
1920s: The flapper fashion era, focusing on a thin silhouette line, lots of beading and intricate work, longer length, and beautiful fabrics. A bit boyish/androgynous in some respects, so perfect for the tomboy. Movies start to influence fashion.
1930s: Lots of glamor and Parisian couture thanks to the movie stars getting more and more publicity, lots of evening gowns, elegant fabrics, and a focus on femininity; lots of French haute couture.
1940s: Thanks to World War II, pragmatism, improvisation, and durability influenced the clothing, with solid suits in neat cuts and durable fabrics like wool leading the way. Colors tended to focus on blue, black, and brown and clothing was often livened up with costume jewelry.1950s: With rock and roll and an increased focus on youth culture, changes were afoot in the fashion industry, from floral sundresses, full (poodle circle) skirts, fitted bodices, cocktail dresses, bolero tops, halterneck dresses, pretty cardigans, jeans, capris, and gorgeous evening wear worn by the likes of Elizabeth Taylor. And don't forget the Audrey Hepburn look; it's unique. Names from this era include Dior, Balenciaga, Balmain, Faith, Givenchy, Chanel, Norell, Claire McCardell, Mainbocher, and Galanos.Movies continue to act as a strong influence on fashion, passing on the new youth trends; and Barbie comes out in 1959.
1960s: Tailored lines are strong, with Jackie O style suits, to Twiggy mini skirts, all well made and well finished in a glorious range of colors, including oranges and pinks. Patterns are starting to take center stage, including polka dots , psychedelics, paisley, and stripes. And the hippie look is one strong element of the 60s, as the mod/pop preference for synthetics was left behind.Designers from this era include Mary Quant, Paco Rabanne, Andy Warhol, Biba, Laura Ashley, Yves St. Laurent, Chanel, Balmain, Oleg Cassini, Peter Max, etc.
1970s: The hippie era from the 60s leaves its mark on 70s clothing, with long, flowing dresses, as well as lots of amazing (often tasteless) prints and disco influenced looks. There is also punk, disco, and knitted everything. Designers include Ossie Clark, Bill Gibb, Thea Porter, Zandra Rhodes, Gina Fratini, Jean Varon, Jean Muir, Rae Spencer-Cullen, Calvin Klein, Diane von Fürstenberg, Ralph Lauren, Halston, etc. , When buying vintage, look for the quality that older clothes can bring. Vintage clothes have been worn before. That’s part of their charm. Don’t expect brand-new clothing items. But make sure you’re getting your money’s worth as well. Check the garment over for flaws or blemishes, and if you’re buying online, read the description thoroughly! If you’re unsure of the garment’s condition, talk to the seller. They should be able to help you determine whether or not it’s something you want to buy.


Check that the item is lined, cut well and structured properly. It is also very helpful if it doesn't date too much to that era but can easily blend into today's forgiving array of fashion, although it's really up to you if you don't mind standing out as someone with clothes from a specific era.
Insect damage. Moth, beetle, and other insect damage to clothing can create nasty holes that might not be recoverable. Also, you don't want to be bringing the insects back home if there are still eggs waiting to hatch on the item.

Fading of color or pattern. This isn't always fatal but it might really spoil the overall look of the garment if it's too obvious and severe.
Totality of embellishments. Are only a few minor ones missing, or are so many missing that it's really evident? Some embellishments make the outfit and might need to be there to ensure it's a really good look.
Check for odor, stains, and loose items or tears. In terms of odor, some odors that are hard to remove include mothballs and pet urine. Stains are very iffy because they'll probably have been on there for ages unless someone just upended coffee on it while browsing. Can the stain be covered? Would it matter if you scrubbed at it but it didn't come off? Is it so glaring as to render the piece unwearable? Could the item be altered to work around the stain? In terms of tears or rips, are they repairable or can something else cover the tear without ruining the look? Be ruthless in asking your internal questions because an item that is ruined won't be worn by you; if the fabric itself is so gorgeous it's to die for though, could it be turned into gloves, a scarf, a cushion cover instead? If so, ask for a reduced sale price!
Keep in mind that if it doesn't feel right or look good when you try it on, then it probably isn't the piece for you (subject to a reasonable assessment of the potential for alterations).
Be wary of the fabric's fragility. Some fabrics are more fragile than others and only increase in fragility over time. Chiffon, net, and lace are very susceptible to wear over time and should be examined carefully before purchase.Even when purchased, they should still be worn rarely in order to preserve them.

, Sizing has changed considerably over time, and varies greatly depending on which country the garment originally came from. So if you’re buying from a store, always try things on before purchasing them or you may be disappointed when you try it on at home. And many vintage stores sell ""as is"" and won't accept returns, but ask all the same before you buy if an item can be returned for not fitting or because you've changed your mind.


Note that most online vintage sellers will estimate which contemporary size the garment will fit, but you should always double-check the measurements anyway, just to be safe. And if you’re buying online, make sure you check the measurements (and know your own)! In this case, check the terms and conditions for return should the online estimate be way off.

, On the whole, vintage clothing can cost more or less than its modern, new equivalent depending on where you source it from. In particular, quality vintage designer wear will still cost a small fortune, especially for the more well-known designers, so factor that into your budget; the rule is fairly much that anything that was expensive when it was made will be correspondingly expensive as a ""collectible"" today.However, only spend a lot on such clothing if you are purchasing from a reputable vintage wear retailer.To spend a lot less on vintage clothing though, and to really have fun, hunt and discover as many possible sources for older clothing where prices are likely to be lower (such as thrift stores and garage sales), to find vintage wear at a price that's affordable (see the next step for more ideas on where to shop).


When making the most of your clothing budget, keep in mind that just a few key vintage pieces mixed in with your regular clothing will go a long way to glamming up your wardrobe.
Not all designer labels should be more expensive. If the label was made for the mass market, it doesn't deserve to come with a high price. Do some learning about the origins and purpose of the label's marketing approaches.

, Vintage clothing can be found in numerous places but the extent and quality will come down to the devotion of the seller sourcing the vintage clothing, so always start by checking out the credentials of the seller to find out how much they know about vintage clothing, as this will give you the confidence that they're selling good garments. Places to look include:


Stores specifically catering to selling vintage clothing. These can be solely clothing or they might form part of an antique store or mall-style store. Generally you should find the seller very knowledgeable about the clothing, the clothing will have been carefully selected, and there should be fitting rooms to try on the garments. Look online for recommended stores near you; there will be many lists supplied on vintage clothing sites. A visit to the local library to check out books on vintage clothing should also turn up some lists within the books, although these may be region-specific only.
Online. There are many vintage clothing stores online, both as distinct websites, or through auction sites. Don't forget to also check general sales advertisements online as sometimes families dealing with estates will get rid of entire box-loads of old clothing rather than having to deal with sorting through them. In terms of the success rate of online purchases, it will be lower than when you've personally visited a store and tried on the item. Don't be surprised if some of the things you get are not at all what you'd hoped. The safest bets for online shopping include knitwear, coats, and blouses because they fit over several sizes.Check out thrift stores and charity shops. They tend to carry a wide selection of clothing from different eras. It'll be more work searching through all the different clothes but when you find something older, what a thrill! As you become more experienced, you should be able to simply walk down an aisle of clothes and ""spot"" anything vintage without even handling the garments.
Don't dismiss local sales such as garage and yard sales, school bazaars and fairs, church charity sales, flea markets, etc. as all of these can be fun sources of unearthing vintage clothing via donations. And flea markets and the like can be a real treasure chest of vintage clothing finds!
Your own family. Don't be afraid to ask your elegant Great Aunt if there is anything in her wardrobe from decades ago that she's happy for you to wear. You can even share delightful stories of the last time she wore her beautiful evening gown from 1954...
Be aware that consignment shops tend to carry contemporary clothing unless they have enough space to also carry vintage. However, it'll depend on the quirks of the owner, so don't completely rule them out as a possible source, and they may be a good source for designer wear whatever the year.

, Although you might like the fashion of a certain era, it pays to have a broad mind when hunting for vintage clothing because you never know what you might unearth that you ""just have to have"" even if it doesn't fall within your idea of the era of vintage clothing you prefer. Browsing through it all will give you the opportunity to expand your options without being restricted by having a specific piece in mind. It also helps to think about your existing clothes and how the new items would mix in (see below for mixing the old with the new).

, Don't be afraid to alter a vintage garment, either for fit or for a totally changed look, or maybe even both. When you find the ideal print or fabric but you only like part of the garment, or you know it'd be great if only it looked ""just so"", then be prepared to alter it yourself (DIY) or to have it tailored to look the way you'd prefer. The chances are that you won't find the fabric or quality anywhere else, so it's worth the expense and effort to adapt the item.


Sometimes, a vintage garment just needs a nip here or a tuck there to fit perfectly. Tying, cutting, and pinning things are also interesting ways to get a good fit and add some character to your outfit. Borrow a good book from the library on making alterations if you are a competent sewer but need some direction.
This doesn’t mean you should turn all Project Runway if you don’t know what you’re doing. If that dress you just bought is a few inches too long and you try to hem it when you’ve never sewn before, the situation will probably end in tears. It’s best to leave the technical alterations to a friend who sews, or a tailor.

, When deciding how to wear your vintage clothing, pair the vintage with the contemporary. Clothes and accessories that you wear every day can be shifted up a notch with the addition of something gorgeous from your vintage collection, such as adding a modern bag and shoes to an old 50s fitted dress. Some of the coolest outfits out there are the ones that combine vintage pieces with modern trends; if you already love your skinny jeans, imagine how killer they could look when paired with some vintage boots. Love your new blazer? How cute will it look with a vintage mini dress!

, The final but most important part of a good vintage shop is to love your look. If you don't, get back to the mirror and keep refining until you do. All clothes, whether vintage or new, should make you look your best, so that you can feel great when you step out.


Don't neglect vintage accessories to complete the look. There are many possible additions including bags, hats, hair accessories, jewelry, scarves, and more.

Vintage shoes can also complete the look but shoes often don't wear as well in their used state. The answer is to look for modern equivalents where you can't find a decent vintage pair.

Measure your body.,
Ignore size tags.,
Read sizing charts.,
Shop for your biggest part.,
Try on the clothes.,
Ask for help.,
Go to a tailor.,
Buy custom clothing.",How to Buy Clothes That Fit1," The most accurate way is to go to a professional. This can be done at a clothing store, a lingerie store, or a tailor or seamstress. Another option is to have a friend use plastic measuring tape to get accurate measurements such as on your hips and shoulders. If you do this, be honest. Don’t try to alter the results by sucking in your belly, for instance. Inaccurate measurements lead to poorly-fitting clothes.For men, measurements include height, neck, chest, waist, hips, and inseam.For women, measurements include height, shoulders, waist, hips, and bust size.;
, This sounds counterintuitive, but the truth is that the tags on clothing aren’t helpful beyond an initial reference. Size standards vary between designers, patterns, and manufacturers. In addition, clothes are made for the standard hourglass shape when men now often have wider shoulders and women have wider hips.Some designers use vanity sizing, which puts a single-digit number on a size that is normally double digits in an attempt to appeal to your emotions.
The number-letter system (small, medium, large, extra large) has no standard, so the dimensions on these clothes vary.

, Sizing charts can be found in some stores online and offline. They’ll have it posted around the store if they have one. This is most likely in stores that don’t carry clothing from a variety of manufacturers. Getting some idea of the store’s policy helps you compare their clothes to your own measurements and determine which stores give you reliable fits.

, Remember that many men have wider shoulders and many women have bigger hips compared to the standard companies manufacture. If you have wide shoulders, for instance, you can get jackets in a bigger size and balance the non-shoulder proportions or take the clothing to a tailor to adjust those other areas.Those who differ from standard size, such as those who are tall or short, will have a harder time finding clothing. Specialty fits or tailored work are the best options.

, The more you try, the less of a gamble buying the clothing becomes. Take several different sizes and put them on in the changing room. If possible, stand before a full-body mirror and take in your entire appearance. The clothes should fit comfortably, neither tight nor loose.


Don’t worry about using a larger size. You can cut off the tags if you need to, but clothes that fit well will do more to make you forget your flaws than clothes that poorly mask them.
Don’t forget to check out your backside. Clothes that don’t fit well can squeeze your back and leave a very noticeable, unappealing roll of flesh.
Anyone who had a parent who made them walk around when trying out shoes knows how important testing is. Turn while wearing the clothes. Lift your arms and legs. Sit on a chair. Good clothes won’t feel restrictive.

, Getting an outside perspective is useful. Bring along a friend who will be honest with you or ask a store employee. Many, such as those in lingerie shops, are trained to take measurements in order to find the best fits for customers. Even if they aren’t trained, they may be able to give you an honest outsider’s opinion.


Use your judgment in evaluating these opinions. Store employees for example may be more concerned with flattering you and making sales.

, You may end up finding great clothing but the measurement is off in a key area. The clothing you buy is for now and should not be stored for a time when it does fit. Search your local listings for tailors or seamstresses. They’ll be happy to have your business and it may not cost that much.


Alternatively, you can learn to adjust clothing yourself.

, Thanks to the Internet, made-to-order clothing is becoming more common. Designers and retailers such as Indochino and eShakti will work with you to achieve the fit that you want. Some brick and mortar stores may do this too. For anyone who has trouble finding a proper fit, extra money spent here can be well worth it."

Select comfortable tops.,
Get the right bra size.,
Pick the right jacket.,
Choose comfortable pants.,
Get a form-fitting dress.,
Wear flattering swimwear.,
Get the right shoes.",How to Buy Clothes That Fit2," Whether you are wearing a t-shirt or a long-sleeved shirt, the top should fit well enough that it isn’t loose but still permits you to move freely. The shoulder seams should fall right on the edge of your shoulder to achieve a natural look. The hem should rest on the middle of your hip for the same reason. If there are sleeves, they should end on your wrists, not your palms.For button-down shirts, the fabric of both sides should meet between the buttons without leaving gaps.

, Most people have no idea that over 80% of women wear the wrong bra size. The right bra should feel natural, resting flat on your chest and back. It shouldn’t appear wrinkled on you, make you feel squeezed, or cut into your skin. If yours has adjustable straps, use these before deciding your bra isn't the right size.Don’t be afraid of getting measured in a store. Be patient with the clerk as you get fitted.

, A good jacket or blazer should allow you to move in it. The seams will fall on the edge of your shoulders without making the fabric feel tight against you. An ideal sleeve length is when the fabric reaches the end of the wrist, but this can be adjusted according to personal preference.Buttoning is optional, but it is better to choose a jacket that still feels right after buttoning up in case you want a more formal look.

, Good pants allow you to move in them. You should be able to slip two fingers between yourself and the waistband, also including a little extra room to compensate for daily changes in body size. The fabric should look smooth on your legs, neither billowing nor wrinkling. The hem should make it down to your heels and rest an inch off the floor.Avoid pants that create a “muffin top,” skin bulging out the top around the waist. This is evidence the pants don’t fit.
Pockets typically don’t keep an ideal shape when you sit. If this is a problem, have a tailor remove them.
Take time finding jeans that fit your particular body shape and keep in mind that the heat from a mechanical dryer damages the elasticity, so choose a bigger size or washing method.
Skirts follow the same guidelines, except the hem typically ends right above the knees or right below the ankles. Choose skirts according to your height and body structure in order to accentuate your hips and legs., Judge a dress by its ability to fit over your shoulders. If it doesn’t fit well there, it most likely won’t hang well on you. If it fits well on your shoulders, chances are it will also drape well on your hips since these two spots align.


Be aware of the empire waist. This is the fabric line that rests below the bust. If it runs too high on you, the dress won’t fit well and tailors won’t be able to help.

, Swimwear follows the same rules as other clothing. Search for something that fits your largest feature and accentuates the rest of your figure. Treat it like your bra. You shouldn’t be spilling out of it and it shouldn’t cut into your skin.


If you have large hips, you can choose something that covers those and runs thin at your waist, for example., There are many different styles of shoes, but they all should be capable of protecting your feet. Choose the size that matches your biggest foot. The shoe should be the same shape as your foot. Good ones will leave enough space that you can slip a finger between the shoe and your foot, but they should still feel snug.Don't try squeezing into shoes and don't choose ones that you think you'll break in or fit into later.

Find a coat that covers you.,
Choose perfect pants.,
Get the tie length right.,
Pick close-fit shoes.",How to Buy Clothes That Fit3," The seams of the shoulders should rest on the edge of your shoulder. Make sure the shirt fabric does not squeeze you nor billow. This includes when you tuck in collared shirts. Cuffs should stop at the end of your wrist and be tight enough that your thumb stops the cuff from sliding while still allowing you to move comfortably.A rule of thumb for stiff shirts is that good ones give you enough space to allow you to fit exactly two fingers under the collar.
Tucked shirts should not become undone or feel tight when you bend over or move your arms.
Choose t-shirts that end at the middle of your waist and only ride up an inch above your pants during movement.

, Whether it is a blazer or a suit jacket, it should fit over your clothing well. The shoulder seams should be on the edge of your shoulder and the material should go all the way down to the zipper of your pants. Make sure the jacket is smooth around the shoulders and does not bunch up around buttons. You should be able to flatten your hand against yourself and slip it under the lapel.A tight suit jacket leaves an x-shape on the belly where the fabric is too tight.
The armholes should be high enough that they don’t cut into your skin or restrict your movement.
For a button jacket, the second to last button should fall right above your belly button and leave enough material that the jacket covers your behind.

, Coats follow the same rules as suit jackets. The seams should rest on the edge of your shoulders. The coat itself should feel comfortable against the clothing it has to cover, not restrictive despite lying close to you and showing your figure. The sleeve should go an inch beyond your wrist in order to hide any sleeve underneath.


Like jackets, make sure the coat is long enough that it doesn’t flare out over your backside.

, The right pants won’t need a belt. They’ll rest on your hips without falling but will stay loose enough that you can move. They’ll lay close to your legs without billowing. Long pants should have no more than one crease on each leg where they fall on top of the shoe. The fabric should go all the way down the back of your legs to t the top of the soles of your shoes.Look for jeans that are slim around your thighs but straight or tapered below the knee.

, Your tie will sit under your collar and not necessitate tightening the collar. Different knots can be used to compliment your clothing, but the tie should go no further than the center of your belt., Your shoes should leave enough room in the heel to fit at least a finger but still not leave too much space between you and the shoe heel. Your toes should barely touch the front, not press against it. Of course, walking should feel comfortable and the shoe should not cut into any part of your foot.


For formal shoes, choose round-toed shoes to achieve a better appearance.

Think about storage.",How to Buy a Waterproof Jacket," Waterproof jackets are made with a waterproof membrane woven directly into the jacket. They allow small perspiration droplets to leave your body while keeping larger water droplets out, making them breathable. Water resistant jackets have no membrane, but are treated with a water repellent material designed to keep water droplets from seeping through the jacket.Waterproof jackets have all of their seams taped or otherwise covered to make sure moisture doesn’t penetrate the jacket via stitching.
Water resistant jackets will keep out most moisture, but cannot withstand heavy downpour or being submerged in water. The absence of a waterproof membrane makes them cheaper than the waterproof option.
Typically the tags on these jackets will indicate whether it is water resistant or waterproof.;
, Waterproof jackets come in a variety of different breathability levels. The level of breathability you need depends on the activity level you’re planning to use it for.


For physically intense activities like hiking, biking, or running you’ll need a jacket with high breathability. Look for jackets with a special membrane layer that allows small water molecules, in the form of sweat, to pass through, while trapping large raindrops on the outside.For less strenuous activities like walking the dog or everyday use, a less breathable jacket that is more water resistant will work fine.

, There are different layer options for waterproof jackets. 3 layer jackets (3L) have all their layers, including the lining fused together, which make for durable snow jackets. 2 layer (2L) jackets have a separated fabric lining which makes them bulkier. 2.5 layer jackets have a raised pattern on the interior designed to keep the material up off your skin.


2.5 layer jackets are usually designed to protect against very light rain., Waterproof jackets come with varying types of membrane laminates such as GORE-TEX®, Marmot's MemBrain® (Polyurethane) and SympaTex (Polyester). Coated fabrics are highly waterproof, but are less breathable than membrane laminates. They are cheaper and usually thicker than membrane laminated jackets, and are perfect for keeping you warm and dry in activities that require minimal physical exertion.If you need a durable jacket for snow you’ll want a 2 layer or 3 layer laminated fabric.

, Lightweight jackets are great for people who don’t need to wear them for extended periods of time, or in heavy downpours. If you’re going to spend the entire day out in persistent rain, look for a mid-weight jacket. If you’re planning to be out in cold, wet weather, a heavier jacket will offer more protection against the elements.


Keep in mind, a jacket that is too heavy might be difficult to move around in.

, Most soft shell jackets are like windbreakers and fall under the water-resistant category. They are very breathable and generally warmer, keeping you dry during light showers, mists, and snow, but leave you drenched after a downpour. Hard-shell jackets are usually windproof and have the waterproof coatings that are designed to keep you dry in the rain. They typically come with a hood and are more expensive, and less breathable., Seam taping or sealing is the application of a thin waterproof tape over the tiny holes left behind by the needle used to sew the jacket together. Jackets come either fully taped, or critically taped.


Fully taped means every single seam has been taped to prevent leaks.
Critically taped means only the high exposure areas of the jacket like neck, shoulders, and chest have been taped.
If your jacket is inadequately sealed, you will get wet, even in the best waterproof jacket., Once you narrow down what kind of jacket you need or want, you need to make sure it fits correctly. A waterproof jacket should fit snugly without restricting your movement. When trying one on, move around: jump up and down, wave your arms around, and twist your body. You want to make sure you have full range of movement available to you.


Make sure it’s big enough to fit two layers of clothing underneath, long enough that it never exposes your midsection, but not long enough to restrict movement., They can be used to make sure your jacket fits as perfectly as possible. They’re usually located at the bottom and waist of the jacket, as well as on the sides., Because we lose most of our heat through our heads, a jacket with a hood that fits properly is crucial. Most jackets are equipped with adjustable hoods, make sure the hood moves with your head while keeping it covered., Make sure all zips run smooth the entire length of the zipper and that the main one is easy to fasten at the bottom. If the zips are not waterproof, make sure they have storm flaps that will prevent water from getting in. You’ll also want to check that the jacket has pit zips if you’re planning to use it for physical activities, as they help with ventilation to keep you from overheating., Pockets are a convenient feature to have, how many pockets you need on your waterproof jacket depends on how you plan to use it. Make sure the jacket has enough for your needs and that the outside pocket zips are either waterproof or protected by storm flaps to keep moisture out., Mesh-lined pockets provide the added convenience of extra ventilation, making it easier for sweat to evaporate away during physical activity.

, How much do you want to spend on a water proof jacket? In general, jackets with superior waterproofing are going to be more expensive, around $100+ more than less advanced jackets.If the prices of full waterproof jackets seem a bit too steep for you and your needs, jackets with just a waterproof coating might be the way to go. They are just as effective at keeping the rain out, but they do tend to lack in the breathability category.
Many reputable manufacturers like The North Face and Patagonia sell waterproof jackets that are durable enough to last you for years for around $100-$150. This may be a good option for those wanting a light to mid-weight jacket.
If you’re buying one for extended intense exercise or activities, a cheap poorly-constructed jacket will not provide the necessary protection. Make sure you get the level of protection you need, and know that full-featured jackets can end up being a $600 investment., Light weight water resistant jackets can be easily folded or rolled up to pack away nicely. You may want to consider how you will store or pack your more durable waterproof jacket, if it can't be easily folded or made compact for traveling. This is especially important if you purchase a heavy weight, full featured waterproof jacket that is too bulky to fold.

Choose suitable footwear.",How to Dress for Arctic Weather Conditions," The Arctic covers a lot of ground, for example upper Finland, Russia and the North Pole. Look for weather forecasts from the internet or TV to see if it's going to windy, snowy or both. Even if the forecast says it will be one sort of weather though, prepare for the whole range of possibilities, as the weather changes quickly in this region.;
, The important thing in dressing warmly is that you are warm and fashion isn't the issue.

,, Some of the clothing may not be the most fashionable but be the warmest and most comfortable for the climate you are going to. That is the key to being toasty warm when in the Arctic.

, When wearing multiple layers of clothing, warm air becomes trapped between each separate item. It is imperative to select the layers carefully to fully maximise the heat and to achieve constant comfort.

, The first item garment should be fitted as close to the skin as possible for mobility and to take away excess perspiration as required. You can purchase base layer tops and bottoms that are specifically made to capture and release such fluids and are also coated with an anti-bacterial substance that will stop clothes from emitting odours.


You may find that a t-shirt plus a long-sleeved t-shirt make the best first layer.
Merino wool tops make for a good initial layer, as these are wool and the latest iterations of this fabric are usually non-itchy. The wool is warm and helps prevent sweating.
A thermal t-shirt is a good idea under a long-sleeved merino top.

, This should consist of a thick jumper or fleece, or an insulated jacket. You will find that zipped or buttoned clothes are excellent for the mid layer as they provide much needed ventilation after exerting activities. Trousers made from breathable materials are best for the second layer of clothing so air can travel around freely.

, This layer is the one that is exposed to the elements, so as well as providing warmth, it needs to be made of protective materials. A windproof, all-in-one with a hood is the perfect option, although separates can be just as effective.

, Ask questions. For example, if the clothing doesn't explain on the description what level of wind it protects against, for example, then ask the retailer for more information or check the manufacturer's website. If you can't find the needed details, keep looking for those items of clothing that are clearly explained; you don't want any errors when dressing for maximum warmth.

, Each item should be rated for the coldest environment.


It is often best to wear thinner gloves with thicker mittens over the top, for the greatest warmth.
A balaclava is ideal for the face, or a ski mask.
The scarf should stay on without having to tie it, to avoid undoing and blowing away in severe winds; an infinity scarf is a good option.
For the hat, choose something that covers the ears and forehead and will fit under the jacket's hood.

, You may find it useful to purchase an item when you arrive in a town if you see many people wearing the same jacket for winter, it's usually the warm one!

, When deciding what to wear in the Arctic, practical shoes are essential. The winter terrains will be covered in snow and ice, so good quality snow-boots.will provide both grip and protection. Ordinary walking boots will not suffice, as they are not designed for extreme weather conditions. Look for boots with thick plastic soles and insulated lining. It is advisable to wear two pairs of socks, so that your feet are as warm as possible.

Decide how much time you are going to spend on this.,

Go to a high end department store.",How to Buy Cheap Cocktail Dresses," After all, time is money.  If you just want all this done as quickly as possible, you likely won't find much.;
, If all you want is a blue dress, or ""something that looks good"", then you'll have a much easier time. If you want a pastel blue dress, with one shoulder strap that has some beading details and a sweetheart neckline, then you'll have to settle on price.

, If you have more time, start earlier and earlier in the list. If you have a full day to shop, or several evenings to shop before needing the dress, then start at step four. The earlier in the list, the more money you will likely save.

, Thrift stores have risen to fame, due to Macklemore and the like. They are still often a great choice. While they will not always have exactly what you need, they may have something that will work. The quality here will vary greatly, from high end designers to clothes that were cheap to begin with, and have been worn for decades.  If you can find the right thing, it will be very cheap compared to normal. You can find a cocktail dress for $5-10 if you know where to look.

, You can also try a department store such as Target or Walmart. These stores will often have cheaper materials, so this step is skippable if you need a very high-end piece. However, many cocktail dresses only get worn once or twice, and some dresses at these stores will hold up to hundreds of wearings. This is the first step that will (almost 100%) guarantee a dress in your size, although again, you may not find the best selection. Browsing what they have available will take a lot less time though, as they have a limited number of styles, rather than a style for each piece.


These are also better stores for plus sized or petite women, or women of varying shapes, as stores like Walmart tend to carry a larger assortment of sizes on the rack than higher end stores. The same is true for tall women, or women with large feet, or women who simply don't have the ""standard"" size many companies size for. You can find a cheap cocktail dress for $10-25 at a department store.

, Check out a store such as a Nordstrom's Rack or Fred Meyer for your dress. These stores will generally provide a higher quality (and higher priced) piece than the above stores. The shopping experience is much the same as it is in the lower-end department stores, although often the sizing will not be as varied.  If you fit into a dress size from 4-12, then you will likely have luck at these, but outside that range, they tend to have less available. You can find a cocktail dress for $25-50 at a higher end department store.

, These stores can include Nordstrom's or David's Bridal. This is where you go when you can't find anything else that works, and you need a dress that fits perfectly. With in-house tailoring at many locations, you would be hard pressed to not find something that works. That guarantee comes with a price though, which may not be what you're hoping for. You can find a cocktail dress at a high end department store for $50-100.

Consider mid-weight fleeces for layering purposes.,
Stick with mid-weight fleeces during moderate temperatures.,
Wear a heavyweight fleece jacket if you plan on performing stationary cold-weather activities.",How to Buy Fleece Jackets1," Lightweight fleeces have low bulk and allow for moderate airflow, which means that your skin can still breathe. This makes it the perfect choice for runners and other cold-weather athletes who exert high amounts of energy.;
, Hikers and individuals performing other mild aerobic activity may want to upgrade to a mid-weight fleece, especially as the temperatures really start to drop. While mid-weight jackets are not as breathable as lightweight ones, they often work well for people generating mild to moderate levels of body heat.

, These jackets are often worn as a mid-layer between base and shell layers during extremely cold weather--e.g., between a t-shirt and an outer coat.

, If you plan on wearing your jacket toward the end of autumn or the beginning of spring, when the temperatures are cold but not freezing, try wearing a mid-weight fleece for your outerwear. This thickness often provides enough airflow to prevent you from overheating, but still keeps the harshest of winds from chilling you.

, These jackets work especially well for activities like easy skiing and camping. Heavyweight fleece provides a thick layer of insulated warmth that can easily protect you against the cold as long as no precipitation is present.

Keep the wind out with tight elastic and draw cords.,
Keep your neck warm.,
Consider a fleece jacket with a hood.",How to Buy Fleece Jackets2," Windproof jackets can come in light, mid, and heavyweight fleeces, but each has a windproof membrane layered between two layers of fleece. This severely cuts down on the amount of airflow, making it suitable for use as daily outerwear. Avoid windproof fleece for athletic activities, however, since the lack of airflow may cause you to overheat when you produce high amounts of body heat.

, While many fleeces repel small drizzles of water or snow, a moderate shower will likely soak through. Water-resistant jackets have a non-breathable layer similar to the layer found in windproof jackets, and many windproof jackets can even double as water-resistant jackets. Note that even water-resistant jackets may not be enough to protect you from heavy downpours, however.

, If you layer your fleece jacket with other forms of outerwear, or if you plan on wearing it during aerobic activity, you can unzip the front once you heat up to help you regulate your body temperature.

, These strips of fabric are located beneath the zipper and add a layer of material to block the wind. Without these flaps, cool air can leak in through the zipper, reducing the amount of warmth your jacket provides.

, While pockets may not be necessary on a fleece jacket meant only for style or everyday use, they often prove helpful on jackets worn while going hiking or camping. Pockets on the waist are often deeper than pockets on the chest, and pockets with snaps or zippers will prevent your items from falling out.

, If you plan on wearing your jacket while you exercise, you can unzip your mesh pockets. This action will cause your pockets to act like vents, improving airflow and helping you keep your body temperature regulated.

, Tight elastic sewn into the wrist or the bottom hem prevent wind from slipping in beneath your jacket. Similarly, draw cords at the bottom hem allow you to control the amount of airflow that slips in through the bottom of your jacket. These elements can make your warm fleece jacket even warmer.

, Many fleece jackets have a thick collar or thicker material at the neck. The extra material prevents heat from escaping through the top of your jacket. This feature is especially important if you plan on wearing your jacket for everyday use during freezing weather.

, Most fleece jackets do not come with hoods, but a few do. Hoods can add an extra layer of protection and reduce the amount of heat that escapes from your ears and the top of your head.

Stay hydrated.,
Don’t wait until you’re thirsty to drink.,
Choose cooling foods.,
Make food without using the oven or stove.",How to Stay Cool in Warm Weather1," Water is essential for keeping you cool during hot weather. Water keeps your body cool and should be drunk even if you don't feel thirsty. It's okay to also drink commercial waters (such as Vitamin Water) or sports drinks such as Powerade or Gatorade but they're usually not necessary unless you're deliberately replenishing lost vitamins/electrolytes following a sporting activity.The best way to check your hydration level is to measure your urination color. Anything darker than straw colored is probably an indication that dehydration is on the horizon, and water is needed.Stay away from sugary drinks such as sodas(even if they are sugar-free!); they decrease the ability of your body to store water. Also, steer clear of alcoholic drinks, coffee, and caffeinated drinks, which are natural diuretics.;
, Drink plenty of water before engaging in any activities. If you wait too late, you could experience cramps, which are a sign of heat-related illness.Remind yourself to drink water frequently with one of the following options.


Purchase a durable water bottle or water pack that you can tote everywhere and refill at any safe water tap.
Freeze a bottle of water to carry around with you. It'll be solid when you leave the house, but the heat will start melting it from the moment you take it out of the freezer. Wrap it in a towel to prevent water condensation affecting other items in your bag.
Download a water drinking app onto your phone. Set reminders, daily targets, and even track when the last time you had a drink., Food can keep you cool provided you make the right choices. Choose salads, fresh raw food, vegetables and fruit. “Cool as a cucumber” is literal; it is nearly 100% water, providing hydration to keep you cool.Avoid eating meat and protein-heavy foods during the heat of the day because these can increase metabolic heat production, which can add to loss of water.


It may seem counter-intuitive, but eating spicy peppers may help cool you off. They make you sweat, which provides a cooling sensation.Smaller meals may also help keep your core temperature down. Large meals require the body to work harder breaking everything down., Find foods that don’t need to be cooked, or don’t need heat to be cooked. If you must actually cook, keep the cool air in, and the temperature down, by using the microwave instead of the stove or oven.For example, you can microwave frozen vegetables and canned soup instead of cooking them on the stovetop.


Cold soups are great in warm weather. If you haven't tried them yet, hot weather is the excuse you need! The fact they are often healthy is just an added benefit.Make popsicles, slushies, frozen fruit, frozen yogurt, and other frozen treats to help you cool down.

Stay out of the sun while it's at its hottest.,
Wear sunscreen!,
Stay in the shade.,
Splash water on your skin.",How to Stay Cool in Warm Weather2," This commonsense approach isn't always easy to adhere to when summer fun beckons, so it bears repeating. Avoid activities in the noonday sun as much as possible. It's best to limit your sun exposure between the hours of 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. each day during warmer months. When you are outside during these times, limit your exposure as best as you possibly can.


Schedule activities early in the morning or later in the afternoon
Some people are particularly vulnerable to heat and should stay in cool places during hot weather, such as children, the elderly, obese, redheads, gingers, and those who have health problems.

, While sunscreen doesn’t necessarily have a cooling effect, its protective effect is vital during warmer weather. As well as being painful and damaging, sunburn can cause a fever and various signs of dehydration.If left unchecked, sunburns can lead to heat exhaustion or heat stroke.At the minimum, use SPF 15. If you're planning on being outside for a while, SPF 30 would be a better option.
Reapply often. Every two hours is recommended, but it should be reapplied more often if you're swimming or sweating a lot.
Apply roughly a shot glass worth of sunscreen to cover the entire body., Retreat to shade as much as possible. Taking breaks under trees works doubly well because trees release water into the air that absorbs some of the heat. While shade doesn’t lower the actual temperature, the lack of sunlight exposure makes it feel like the temperature is up to 15 degrees cooler.


If a cool breeze comes by, that can feel like an additional lowering of 5 degrees in the shade., When it’s hot and sunny outside, a dip in cool water is refreshing. Jumping into a pool is not always a choice. Don’t forget low-maintenance options like sprinklers.You could also try taking showers or baths with cooler than normal water to take the edge off.Fill a spray bottle with pure water and place in the refrigerator at home or work. When you feel too hot, spray a fine mist of the cooled water over face and body to help cool you down quickly. Refill as needed and keep refrigerated.Make a game of staying cool. Gather friends and run through sprinklers. Throw water balloons. Have a squirt gun battle.

If it is light in color, it’s even better, as this will reflect the heat and sunlight better. Shorts and short sleeved shirts are good choices. Something that lets the air flow freely through, hitting the sweat on your body, works best. The following suggestions are specific ways clothing can maximize your ability to stay cool:


Cotton and linen clothing tends to keep you cool and absorb moisture.
Clothes you can hold up to the light and see through are great choices. Be sure to apply sunscreen when wearing really thin clothing, however, as the clothing doesn't provide adequate protection from the sun's harmful rays.
Synthetic clothing tends to trap moisture, which makes the fabric feel heavier, stick to your skin, and restrict air-flow.
Working in lower humidity settings with short sleeves has been shown to have a minor benefit. Weigh the options of UV exposure with your choice of clothing., Wear a wide-brimmed hat, one that sufficiently covers the top of your scalp as well as the tops of your ears. This helps to keep you cooler by providing shade. Choose a brim that is wide enough that it can also cover the back of your neck.Light-colored hats can help keep you cool.

, Depending on the activity, one shoe could be more comfortable or appropriate than another.Consider whether arch support, durability, and comfort are mandatory, and then choose the best breathable footwear for the activity.


Cotton socks are great, but moisture wicking socks help your feet stay cooler.Some running shoes are designed with the summer months in mind, providing ventilation in a variety of designs.Be careful if you decide to go barefoot. Many artificial pavements become unbearably hot during warm weather and can scald your feet., Wear fewer accessories during hotter weather. Metallic accessories can heat up considerably and less is always best when it comes to keeping cool. Other clothing accessories can weigh clothing down, trapping in heat and moisture.If you have long hair, wear it up and off your face and body, allowing the breeze to flow along your neckline."

Use fans.,
Use air conditioning.,
Close curtains and blinds.,
Minimize the effects of sunlight on your roof.,
Insulate well.",How to Stay Cool in Warm Weather4," While the efficacy of fans during extreme heat and humidity has been debated, some research suggests fans are beneficial up to 97 °F (36 °C) with 80% humidity, and 108 °F (42 °C) with nearly 50% humidity.Whether hand-held or electric, fans can keep you cool by continuously circulating air. In your home and office space, locate fans in rooms where you are working or resting to keep the air circulating freely and to reduce the mugginess of heat.


Try making your own ""swamp cooler."" These evaporative coolers can reduce temperature by significant amounts. They range from the simple (i.e. a bowl of chilled water in front of a fan) to the semi-complex. With just a few PVC pipes, a bucket, an electric fan, and a frozen gallon of water, you can create mid-40 °F (4 °C) wind.However, keep in mind that swamp coolers will not work with humid heat.
A fan should not be the primary source of cooling down in extremely hot weather.Fans work well, but only if the weather is not too hot.

, Even if your home does not have central air, placing a small window air conditioner in one room of your home may help to keep it cool during the summer. For example, you could place the air conditioner in the room where you spend the most time, such as the living room, kitchen, or your bedroom.


You can also try running the air conditioner at the highest comfortable temperature to avoid racking up a high electricity bill.Visit public buildings if you don't have adequate air-conditioning at home.A few possible locations to avoid the heat:
The library is a great place to get cool and learn new information.
Grocery stores are air conditioned well. And if it’s particularly hot, visit the freezer section and peruse for a while.

, The sun’s rays convert to heat. However possible, you should block the rays coming into your house to keep the temperature down. Closing curtains, lowering shades, or even blocking windows can significantly reduce the heat in your house and keep it cool. Awnings work as well, because they keep the direct heat off the windows without blocking out all light., Changing the color of your roof can decrease the temperature in the house. Cooler colored roofs are approximately 50 degrees lower during hot summer months. You can put a special coating on your existing roof to lighten the color, or replace the traditional darker shingles with a lighter color.If you are interested in getting a special treatment for your roof to reduce the temperature in your home, then contact a roofing professional to find out about your options. You might want to wait until you need to replace your roof to make these changes.

, Better insulation means less heat in the summer. If your house is hot, you can cool down easier with better insulation. Less crevices and avenues for the air to escape means the cool air stays inside.Ensure there is some air between insulation and roofing material.

Jackets with tails are elaborate styles of coats that are typically reserved for “white tie” events.;
, Classic black is a good choice for a versatile tuxedo that can be adapted to fit most formal events. A tuxedo is typically made from piqued wool with satin trim on the pants and lapels.Dark blue and sometimes tan or white are common colors for tuxedos as well. You can choose virtually any color, but colored tuxedos do not present the same formal presence as a standard black tux.
A grosgrain ribbed silk fabric is sometimes used for the lapel and pant legs trim. This fabric provides an elegant touch without as much flashy reflectiveness as satin trimmings.
Velour or all silk jackets are also available from some retailers. Like colors, these non traditional fabrics often appear less formal than the standard piqued wool., The collar, or lapel, around edge of the tuxedo jacket is an important element to the look of the tux. Not only is the sheen of the fabric essential to creating the formal look of the tuxedo, the way the lapels are cut contribute to the look immensely.A shawl collar is the traditional choice for a tuxedo. Shawl collars are rounded and provide an elegant minimalist look. People with round faces or figures may want to avoid the shawl collar as it may over accentuate these features.
A peak lapel has pointed corners that provide a flashy trim to your jacket. Peak lapels are good for men with a smaller frames to help the shoulders appear broader.

, When wearing a tuxedo, a man should also wear a bowtie, cummerbund or vest, and cufflinks and studs.The sheen of the bow tie’s fabric should match that of the jacket lapels. Shiny satin lapels should be accompanied by shiny satin bowties.
Cummerbunds or vests depend on the occasion or personal preference. A cummerbund often provides a more formal look while a vest can allow for more personal expression of style. When purchasing accessories, keep your color choices conservative to maximize the appropriateness and level of formality of your outfit. Black is always a safe choice.
Cufflinks and studs help complete the formal look of the tuxedo. Gold or silver cufflinks should match the metal trim of studs for a complete look.

, Tuxedo shirts vary from traditional dress shirts with the frill on breast and a different style of collar. A small tight frill with a wing collar is the best bet for a traditional look., Department stores or specialty men's clothing stores are the best bet for tuxedos. Most department stores have a men’s department and sell formalwear. Other retailers specialize in men's clothing and sell only menswear. High end stores will typically have a larger selection of tuxedos and formal wear. Ask to speak with a fitting specialist to help decide on the right size jacket and pants for your body size.
Ask about tailoring services at the time of purchase to see get the fit just right.

, You can often find tuxedo jackets and pants at highly discounted prices at local thrift stores. Because most thrift stores sell items separately, it may be difficult to find exact matches of brands or designers. If you are on a budget, this can be a good alternative to visiting an expensive men’s clothing retailer. You won’t be able to get any specialized fitting assistance or tailoring from a thrift store., Purchasing a used tuxedo can be a budget friendly option if you are concerned about getting a matching set from a particular designer. Some consignment shops perform in house tailoring for a fee when you purchase an item. Before to ask about these services before purchasing so that you can get a tuxedo that fits your body well.

, A formal look requires the clothing to fit just right. The jacket should fit snugly, but not so tight that it is stretched. Pants should be worn around the waist and come to just above the heel without bunching around the shoe.Measure around your neck. The fit of your shirt will depend on the diameter around your neck. Make sure that your collar is not too tight around the neck or your formalwear will quickly become uncomfortable.
Measure the length from the shoulder to the wrist. This measurement is important for your shirt size and in tailoring the jacket for the perfect fit.
Get the measurement of your chest. Measure under your armpits fully around your body. This measurement will determine your jacket size.
Measure around your waist. Remember your waist measurement is higher than your hips just under your navel. This measurement determines half of your pants size.
Measure your inseam. The inseam is taken from the crotch to the ankle. This determines the length of your pants.
Take your overall height and weight. These measurements will help a tailor determine the length of your jacket and any additional considerations when tailoring your tuxedo.

, Many retailers provide tailoring services in house or contract with a local tailor for fittings. Tailoring the tuxedo is an important part for getting the perfect fit.Many local dry cleaners also offer tailoring services. Research local vendors to find a tailor near to you.
Ask friends or family for recommendations on tailors to find quality and trusted service.

, If you do, make sure you apply for this on time.

, Ask if they would like to feature their designs at your fashion show, it is likely that many of them would appreciate the opportunity to get their designs seen and people will be more likely to turn up to an event with local designers than they will to one just featuring clothes of the high street.

, You don't need to spend a fortune on professional models, put out some adverts and hold auditions. Give the designers the chance to be at the auditions if they wish, they may have a particular look in mind for their clothes.

, You don't need professional hairdressers and make up artists, try advertising at a local college which offers hairdressing and beauty courses, you will find at least a couple of students who would appreciate the experience.

, How much you can charge will depend on the type of show you are doing. If the proceeds are going to charity, people may be willing to pay more than they would otherwise.

, While the clothes and models are important, you can't hold a fashion show if there's no audience. Advertise your fashion show well and send out invitations, you want to fill the venue you have booked.

, Do the with all of the models so that they know what to do at the real show. This way it's less likely someone will mess up. The rehearsal doesn't have to take place at the actual venue.

, The catwalk doesn't need to be an elevated platform, just a strip of floor with the chairs arranged around it will do, this is what many smaller fashion shows do.

, Keep these simple, anything complicated will distract people from looking at the clothes.

, You will need people to sell tickets and help behind the scenes to make sure everything runs smoothly.

Plan ahead.,
Check local weather or news for updates.,
Allow yourself time to acclimatize if traveling.,
Pace yourself when working in the heat.",How to Stay Cool in Warm Weather5," Whatever you're doing outdoors, having a plan will help cut down on unnecessary activity in the heat. By having a plan, you can set time limits on your exposure to the heat and plan ways to minimize the effects of the heat before you head into it each day. Always be sure to stick to your time limits by prioritizing and leaving less important things to be finished when it's cooler.


When hiking, study the map at the beginning of the day, and calculate the best route, especially one that makes the most of shade where possible.
While swimming, monitor your time in the pool. You may think there is minimal sun exposure because of the cooling effect of the water, but staying in too long without reapplying sunscreen or taking a break could lead to sunburn.
If you have to travel a lot during hot days in your vehicle, plan ahead by having your vehicle inspected and ensuring that your air-conditioning is in working order. When you notice the temps aren’t as frigid as you’d like, take it in for service. The car is likely low on Freon., As part of your planning, spend time watching the weather forecasts. In the USA, NOAA produces a heat alert based on Heat Index Values. The importance of this measure is that it tells you how hot it will feel outdoors when the relative humidity has been factored in with the actual air temperature. Be aware that heat index values are devised for shady areas and light wind conditions. If you're under full sunshine and in the presence of strong winds, the heat factor can increase by up to 15 °F (−9 °C)., Travelers often make the mistake of trying to maintain normal levels of activity when arriving in a country warmer than the one they've left. Acclimatization can take up to 10 days depending on the temperature difference.Rather than pushing yourself, give yourself time to acclimatize to the new warmer environment, which means minimizing physical activity until the heat feels more tolerable.


Once you feel more comfortable in the heat, gradually build up your physical activities until you're back to your normal level.

, Slow down, it's not worth pushing yourself strenuously when it's hot outside. Start and progress gradually, noting when the heat is really affecting you. Rest is an important way of coping with too much heat. Don't deny yourself the opportunity to rest when you feel fatigued during warm weather.Things that require a lot of physical effort can be done early in the morning or later in the day.

Consider the seasons natural color scheme.,
Look for the year's ""in"" colors.,
Go with deeper shades for a warmer look.,
Stick with lighter shades for a more feminine look.,
Think flannel.,
Avoid too many pastels.",How to Be Fashionable in Fall1," Autumn is most notable for the way the trees change color and shed their leaves. Form your color palette off the natural color palette by opting for colors associated with this process. Think reds, oranges, yellows, browns, and deep burgundy-violets.;
, While fashionable autumn colors usually stay within the same general palette, each year comes with its own list of colors that are considered especially stylish. For instance, in 2011, burnt olive, coral, burgundy, teal, and coffee were among the most fashionable choices. Research the season's ""in"" colors a few months before the start of autumn to get a good idea of what colors to look for.

, Deeper shades, like chocolate brown or burgundy, create a warm, “cozy” feeling ideal for the cooling weather. To maximize this effect, opt for colors generally associated with the warm side of the color spectrum, like reds, over colors found on the cool end, like blues.

, Darker, deeper colors work great for the fall, but they also create a heavier appearance. If you want a lighter, more feminine look, stick with brighter fall palette options like gold or coral.

, You do not need to stick with the traditional red and black “lumberjack” look. Flannel print is available in a wide variety of patterns, colors, and fabrics. This pattern is naturally associated with cooler weather, though, making fall the perfect time to start breaking out your flannel print pieces.

, Pastel shades tend to be associated with warmer seasons, especially spring. You can use a few pastel colors, but try to avoid too many in one outfit.

Wear a long linen skirt or linen pants.,
Imitate jeans with chambray pants.,
Opt for cotton skirts or pants.,
Go for rayon bottoms.,
Adapt your pantyhose for the heat.",How to Cover Your Legs in Hot Weather1," To keep your legs covered but cool in hot weather, invest in a long linen skirt or pants. This lightweight, breathable material also reflects heat better than other fabrics, leaving the skin cool and dry. Opt for garments with a comfortable, loose fit to allow air to flow between the linen and your skin., To cover your legs in the heat and stay comfortably cool, opt for chambray pants to imitate your jeans. Chambray is a woven cotton textile that resembles denim despite its light, breathable texture. Dress the pants up with a blazer and a pair of loafers, or make them more casual with running shoes and a plain t-shirt., Cotton is an ideal choice of material for summer clothing as it absorbs wetness and perspiration from the skin and allows it to evaporate from the fabric’s surface. For an ideal fit, choose cotton pants or skirts that are loose enough to allow air to flow through and let your skin breathe. When purchasing cotton items, make sure that they don’t feel heavy, and hold them up to the light to see if they are a bit see-through (which is ideal).For instance, 100% cotton chinos are a great option for summer pants.
Hang dry your cotton clothing after washing it, as it is likely to shrink in the dryer.

, Rayon is man-made fabric that is lighter than cotton and perfect for dry heat. Rayon clothing is delicate, drapes well, and may imitate the texture and feel of cotton, linen, silk, or wool depending on the garment you buy. Look for rayon pants or long skirts in light colors that won’t absorb the sunlight. , If pantyhose are a part of your wardrobe that you wish to wear even on hotter days, adapt them to suit the weather. To make them more comfortable and less sweat-inducing, cut about half an inch off the top of your control-top or regular pantyhose, leaving enough elastic to hold them up. On especially hot days, try putting your pantyhose in the freezer for about five minutes to cool them before putting them on.Knee high pantyhose are also a good way to cover your legs while constricting them less than with full length pantyhose.

Introduce heavier materials into your wardrobe.,
Wear more sweaters.,
Layer your shirts.,
Choose a comfortable sleeve length.,
Consider higher necklines.",How to Be Fashionable in Fall2," Think heavy-knit cottons, wools, cashmere, and traditional flannel fabric, among others. Stay away from sheer, flimsy materials, especially as the weather gets cooler. Heavy materials will keep you warmer, and they also look more appropriate than light materials.

, Sweaters scream fall and winter. Lighter sweaters with standard or low necklines work especially well for fall, when the weather is chilly yet not quite frigid.

, Wear tank tops and camisoles underneath low-cut blouses and vests over long-sleeve t-shirts. Layers keep you warmer and give your style more versatility.

, Dress according to the temperature. During early fall, while the weather is still somewhat warm, stick with short sleeves or three-quarter-length sleeves. Move onto long sleeves once the weather gets chillier. Fall fashions include a broad range of sleeve lengths, so wear whatever makes sense on a day-to-day basis.

, Standard and low necklines may work during early autumn, but once the weather starts turning colder, branch into higher necklines. Think turtlenecks and cowl-necks.

Go for a mix of style and warmth.,
Consider a fitted pea coat.,
Look for bomber jackets or military jackets.,
Wear a fitted hoodie on casual days.,
Try leather.,
Consider a cardigan for warmer days.",How to Be Fashionable in Fall3," Fall is a great time to play with fashionable jackets and coats. The weather is often just cold enough to warrant wearing one, but not so cold that you have to bundle up in the heavy, frumpy coats associated with winter.

, Pea coats are often made of wool and have a button-down front. They come in a variety of colors, ranging from black to red to olive green.

, These jackets create a slightly more masculine image. They look heavy and insulated, but many are still light enough to work well for fluctuating autumn weather.

, If you plan on keeping your look casual for the day, consider a hooded sweatshirt. Opt for fitted styles with a zipper front over pull-over types that have a tendency to look oversized and frumpy.

, Leather jackets come in a number of styles, from heavy and masculine to sleek and sexy. These pieces are also long-lasting and timeless, so you can often wear them year after year.

, On a warmer day with little wind, you may not need anything more than a feminine cardigan to keep you warm. Choose darker colors that look more fall-appropriate over white and pastel, which are generally associated with spring.

"
"
Try on dark wash jeans.,
Look at other heavy materials, like corduroy.,
Consider a knee-length skirt or dress.,
Keep your legs warm with leggings, nylons, and knee-high socks.",How to Be Fashionable in Fall4," Lighter washes may also work, but dark wash works especially well with the richer color scheme of autumn. Dark wash jeans also have a tendency to make the wearer look slimmer.

, Heavy materials are associated with cold weather, even in pants. Heavy corduroys may not work well in spring and summer, but they look great in fall and winter.

, You can wear one while the weather is still warm, or you can even wear one once the weather gets chillier. Knee-length skirts are classic and can be made to work year round.

, This is especially true if you decide to wear a knee-length skirt or a maxi-skirt that exposes part of your calf. Leggings and knee-high socks can look very chic when worn beneath a skirt during cooler weather.

"
"
Consider a classic fashion boot.,
Choose a tall boot for skirts, dresses, and leg-hugging pants.,
Get away with a chunkier heel.,
Wear your favorite heels or flats.,
Avoid sandals.",How to Be Fashionable in Fall5," Fashion boots come in a variety of heel thicknesses, heel heights, and boot heights. A boot that extends just above your ankle looks classic and works well with both pants and skirts. A narrow heel with a little height also has a timeless, versatile appeal.

, Knee-high boots and boots that extend past the knee work best for outfits that permit them to be seen. Wear them with skirts or over skinny jeans.

, Chunky heels have a heavy look to them, but coordinate well with heavier fall clothing like corduroy pants or sweaters.

, Boots may be a highly fashionable autumn item, but heels and flats still work well for fall. These styles transcend the season.

, Sandals call to mind the warmer seasons of spring and summer. They often clash with many of the materials associate with fall clothing.

"
"
Try a fashion scarf.,
Wear a fashion hat.,
Carry a big bag.,
Think gold tone jewelry.,
Wear jewelry that uses other trendy autumn colors.",How to Be Fashionable in Fall6," A trendy scarf wrapped around your neck looks chic while protecting you against any chilly autumn breezes.

, There are many styles to choose from, including bucket hats, newsboy caps, and fedoras. Try on a few different styles until you find one that compliments the shape of your face. Once you find a style that works for you, look for one made of a heavier material, like wool or tweed.

, Small purses with dainty straps work better in the warmer seasons. Large shoulder bags with chunky straps look especially stylish in the fall and winter, since they coordinate more effectively with heavier knit clothing and boots.

, Gold tones are warmer than silver tones and match better with the browns, reds, and oranges commonly associated with fall.

, Look for necklaces with big, chunky beads in coral, red, or dark olive green. Consider chunky dangle bracelets in dark brown or orange. Jewelry can be used to add a splash of color to any outfit, regardless of the season.

Choose light colors.,
Aim for a looser fit.,
Avoid synthetic fabrics.",How to Cover Your Legs in Hot Weather2," Always opt for light colored pants or long skirts in hot weather. Dark colors absorb heat while light colors reflect heat, keeping your legs cooler. Choose whites, tans, or pastel colors when buying summer bottoms., If you want to keep your legs covered in the heat, opt for a looser fit of pants or long skirt to keep cool. Slightly baggier bottoms will allow for better air circulation, allowing your legs to breathe. Looser fitting linen or cotton items will be comfortable in the heat and still look stylish., When choosing pants or long skirts to wear in hot weather, avoid synthetic fabrics altogether. Synthetic fabrics do not absorb sweat like natural fabrics (e.g. cotton) and are not breathable. They also retain heat, raising your overall body temperature."
"
Wear sunscreen.,
Get a spray tan.,
Use concealer to cover imperfections.",How to Cover Your Legs in Hot Weather3," To protect your legs from UV rays in the heat, cover them with sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30. Opt for a brand that is waterproof and sweat-resistant, and reapply at least every two hours. Be sure to all parts of your legs, especially your ankles and behind your knees, where the skin is more sensitive., A spray tan can cover marks, bruises, and pronounced veins on your legs and give them your legs color. Visit a local salon that does spray tanning and ask for a lighter shade of tanner to start (you can always go darker the next time). As an alternative, purchase a self-tanner from a pharmacy or beauty supply store to use on your legs at home.Be sure to exfoliate your legs before getting a spray tan or using self-tanner, as it will allow for a more even distribution of color.

, If you are insecure about marks on your legs such as bruises, scrapes, or bumps, cover them with concealer. To cover very dark bruises, use a concealer that is two or three shades lighter than your skin tone. To cover scrapes, use a fine eyeliner brush to avoid over-applying concealer."

Choose sturdy, warm boots.,
Consider girl specific items.,
Consider boy specific items.",How to Choose Trendy Winter Clothes for Kids," For both girls and boys, choose comfort-focused items like chunky knitted cardigans and sweaters. These are not only on trend but also a favorite with mums and dads.;
, Coat and jacket fashions include military style jackets (in various materials including wool), parkas and duffel coats. What more could we ask for?

, Items such as hats, gloves and scarves are all available for children in bright cheerful colors, or ‘go with everything’ neutrals. For hats think fake fur deer stalkers or woolen beanies. Fingerless gloves are in fashion a lot these days but so are mittens, providing a warmer alternative. Scarves may be traditional or in the ‘snood’ circular style that make them less likely to get lost on your child’s first outing.

, Jeans and corduroys are popular in straight leg styles for both boys and girls and provide comfortable and practical leg wear during the colder months. In the snow your children will be more than happy to wear some of the trendy salopette style ‘surf’ trousers that can be found in specialist shops if you are able to spend a little more.

, Tweed comes in blazers, skirts and trousers for children and again provides a practical and on trend option.

, For both boys and girls there are some great lace up boots around. Avoid a suede finish as they are less hard wearing and waterproof than leather style man made uppers. Wellies are no longer limited to uninspiring green or black, so encourage your child to wear theirs by letting them choose a favorite color or design.

, Woolen tights or leggings paired with a tunic top provide a gorgeous look for girls this year. Tunics can be found in a range of styles from sumptuous velvet to comfy casual jersey fabrics. Brightly colored macs are also widely available and will provide lightweight protection from the rain all year round.

, Stripey long sleeved t-shirts can be found in a range of colours and look great layered with jeans on both boys and girls. Checked shirts are also big news for boys and look fantastic under blazers.

Select a coat in a bright color.,
Opt for a coat in a pastel shade.,
Look for a coat in a bold pattern.,
Consider a fur coat.,
Find an embroidered coat.,
Opt for an embellished coat.,
Choose a coat with defined waist to showcase curves.,
Opt for a below the knee coat to emphasize height.,
Look for a cape or trapeze style for added drama.",How to Choose a Statement Coat," Winter coats traditionally come in dark colors, such as black, charcoal, or navy, so opting for one in a bright shade definitely makes a statement. Choose a vivid red, hot pink, cobalt, kelly green, or purple coat to really stand out.To avoid having a coat that clashes with most of your clothing, look to your closet for color inspiration. If you wear mostly warm colors, opt for a coat in a bright warm shade, such as red, yellow, pink, or orange. If you wear mostly cool colors, go for a coat in a bright cool shade, such as blue, green, or purple.;
, If a bright color seems too much for your coat, consider making a statement with a coat in a pastel shade. Like bright shades, you don’t see too many winter coats in pale shades such as mint, lilac, sky blue, baby pink, or butter yellow, so your coat will definitely stand out.If pastel shades aren’t your thing, light neutral colors can also work for a statement coat. A light camel or gray can be pretty, but you’ll stand out the most in a white, winter white, or cream colored coat.

, If you aren’t a fan of standout colors, you can make a statement with a coat in an eye-catching pattern. Animal print, stripes, polka dots, floral, plaid, houndstooth, and camouflage patterns are all striking options.To avoid looking too busy, it’s best to choose a patterned coat that features at least one neutral color, such as a white and black polka dotted coat or a gray and blue checkered style.
If you really want to stand out, go for a coat that combines bold color and pattern. For example, you might choose pink and purple floral print coat to make a strong statement.

, If you want your coat to be noticed, choosing a fur style can definitely work. Faux fur can look just as convincing as the real thing, and it’s cheaper and doesn’t pose the moral concerns that real fur does.If you don’t want to wear a coat that’s entirely fur or faux fur, look for an option that just features as fur trim along the lapels or hem of the coat.
For a truly eye-catching coat, opt for a fur coat in a bold color, such as pink, blue, or red, rather than the usual black or brown.

, If a coat with an all-over pattern isn’t your style, an embroidered coat is an ideal alternative that still makes a statement. Embroidery involves creating designs on fabric with thread, so the patterns are more delicate. You can often find coats with embroidered floral designs, but some feature more abstract filigree like patterns.For a subtle statement coat, look for a style that only features embroidered designs in specific areas, such as the lapels or the hemline.
If you really want to turn heads, choose a coat with an all-over embroidered designs.
Most embroidered coats are black and use threads in brighter colors that will pop against the dark fabric. However, you can also find white embroidered coats with colorful thread and embroidered coats in bold colors, such as red, that feature black thread.

, If you prefer a coat in a traditional color such as black or charcoal, you can still make a statement by selecting a style that features embellishments. Look for a coat with metal studs, oversized rhinestone buttons, or sequin detailing.If you want a more subtle statement coat, choose one that only has embellishments in a confined area. For example, you might select a coat with metal studs on the shoulders or sequins on the lapels.

, If you want a coat that helps to highlight your curvy figure, opt for a style with a defined waist. The cut of the coat may nip in at the waist or you can choose a style that has a seam or belt to emphasize your waist.If you don’t have a defined waist, don’t try to create one by choosing a coat that emphasizes that area. You’ll only draw attention to your lack of a defined waist.

, Coats that hit below the knee, particularly at the ankle, aren’t very flattering for most body types, but if you’re tall and thin, they can make a strong statement. Keep in mind that they tend to be more flattering when worn open, so they may not be the best option if you live in a very cold area.An ankle length coat is usually the trickiest to wear. A style that hits at mid-calf is usually a better option.

, Choosing a loose or flowy coat, such as a cape or trapeze style, instantly makes you stand out. They tend to be on the shorter side, usually hitting at the hip or mid-thigh, so they’re an ideal option if you want to show off your legs.Keep in mind that it can sometimes be difficult to carry a bag with a cape style coat.

, Buy a sketchbook to design clothes in and keep this with you at all times. If you spot anything that inspires you, make a note of it in your sketchbook so you can think about how you could incorporate it into your designs. Don't just look at other clothes for inspiration, take inspiration from nature and architecture too.

, Make sure you know what kind of fabrics will work with your designs. If you make a design which relies on structure out of a thin, floaty fabric it won't look right.

, Buy fabric and start making your clothes. If you are going to use a lot of fabric it is cheaper to buy it from wholesalers by the roll than from a fabric store by the metre.

, There are websites which cater for people selling handmade goods,(such as Etsy.com) check them out and see if you could sell your designs there. If you are successful, you could start up your own website for your clothing line.

Consider not wearing the item for a period of time until the next trend is well underway.,
Reconfigure your fashion item.,
Stop wearing it from this point.,
Be bold and buck the new trend.",How to Cope when Your Fashion Favorite Stops Being Trendy," Usually there is a period of time during which an old trend is disdained and considered unworthy before it's forgotten about. By being patient, you can ride out the backlash and start wearing it again in about a year's time.


Enjoy the sales; stock up on this item at rock bottom prices!
Be aware that some fashion items remain ""tainted"" for a very long time, like 80s scrunchies or neon leggings. In this case, you could be waiting a long time.;
, Look to see if there is some other way you can wear your favorite fashion item that won't seem old trend. For example, if you loved a certain piece of jewelry, maybe you can wear it or use it differently from the its use during the trend, such as sewing it onto a scarf, embellishing a belt with it, wearing it on a different part of your body, or using it as a hair accessory. Try to think outside the square and find new ways to use it.

, If you feel as if the trend has spoiled its specialness for you, maybe it's time to give it up and move on anyway. If this is the case, consider donating it to charity or passing on to a friend or family member keen to have it.


Turn it into a pretty or useful memento. Perhaps you've decided to stop wearing it but you'd like to keep a memory of it. Think about ways you can turn it into something else, like turning: jewelry into a framed picture, a scarf into a tablecloth, leggings into cat toys, sweaters into cushion covers, hats into a mannequin's hat, a dress into a quilt, etc.

, If it is something that has always represented your signature style and is definitely you, consider ignoring its loss of trendy status and continue to wear it anyway. For some items, especially classic pieces, this will be fairly easy to do, and if people know you've always worn the item, they'll expect you to keep wearing it anyway.

Browse websites and jewelry stores for inspiration.,
Begin sketching.,
Consider colors.,
Think about shapes.,
Don't forget wearability.,
Browse supplies for inspiration.",How to Design Your Own Piece of Jewelry1," When it comes to designing jewelry at home, you will need some inspiration before you start drawing. Browse jewelry online or head to your local craft store or craft show to browse the selection. Perhaps a pendant or gemstone will catch your eye. Once you are inspired, it should be easy to begin designing your jewelry..;
, If you’re unsure where to start, try sketching basic shapes and then begin embellishing those shapes. If you’re still lost, just try some mindless sketching for five minutes or so. This may produce a design you might not have thought of otherwise.


In order to start designing jewelry on paper, you will need blank paper and pencils. These can be easily purchased at a craft store near you or even at a local bookstore. Browse the selection of sketchbooks until you find one that sparks your creativity and helps you feel motivated to design.
As you sketch your piece, label each part of the design with the material you will be using. For example, if you are sketching a red plastic bead, label it on your design. Though it may seem obvious to you now, you may forget what you were sketching later on.

, If you enjoy bright, vibrant colors, you will want to incorporate this into your designs. If you prefer metallic finishes, you can use metallic colors in your designs as well. Designing your own jewelry gives you the freedom to experiment and create whatever you can think of and what you like best!Consider contrasting dark and light tones.
Colors from opposite sides of the color wheel will pop.
Using 3-5 colors adjacent on the wheel will create a harmony.
Try matching a color with the two colors beside its opposite on the color wheel.

, As you sketch, think about the shape you would like to create. Perhaps you would like to incorporate rectangles or zig zags into your design. Perhaps you love spheres or circles and enjoy working with rounder shapes. Consider matching the shape of the whole piece and the shape of the beads or ornaments.


For instance, you could make a round bracelet with round beads. You could also put a heavy, narrow bead hanging straight down from a light chain--this will create a sharp triangular shape ending in a point.
Consider negative space. Think of hoop earrings: the emptiness of the hoop highlights the wearer's jawline. Think about what your jewelry will frame.

, It's easy to get carried away by your design and end up with something too heavy or jagged for comfort.Think about the weight of your jewelry, and consider what it will hang from. For instance, a heavy necklace that drapes around your shoulders will be less painful than heavy earrings suspended from your earlobes.


Similarly, jagged metal earrings are unlikely to hurt you, as they hang away from your face, but a spiky necklace could end up pricking your skin.

, Head to a craft store in your area to gather jewelry supplies, such as beads, chains, clasps, string, etc. You may get ideas from the materials at hand. Having these materials in your possession may also help to inspire you when you are sketching out your ideas.

Sketch out your idea.,
Find a jewelry store that will work with you on a custom design.,
Bring in any jewelry that you would like to redesign.,
Approve the model.",How to Design Your Own Piece of Jewelry2," If you have something in mind, sketch it out on a piece of paper. Don’t be intimidated if you’re not particularly gifted in the art department; simply aim to get a rough draft on paper. If you don’t have any ideas, don’t fret. Jewelers can work with you to develop a custom piece that will be meaningful to you for years to come. Save photos of the jewelry that inspires you on your phone or print them out to bring with you. This will give the jeweler an idea of what you are looking for.

, Many jewelry stores offer custom design centers or studios to work with you on designing your perfect piece. You can find custom jewelers near you by conducting an online search with the phrase, “Custom jeweler in Detroit, MI.” Jot down some that look interesting to you on a piece of paper or your device’s notepad. Call or visit the stores to talk about their services.

, If you inherited an heirloom gem you would like to redesign or have a loose diamond or gemstone, bring them with you. Keep the precious items carefully tucked away in a small, locked jewelry box to avoid losing them before your appointment. You can work with the jeweler to incorporate these pieces into a brand-new, redesigned piece that will retain its sentimental value.

, Most jewelers will provide a wax or 3D-printed model for you to look and test out before the jewelry is created. This is the perfect time for you to provide feedback and let the jeweler know what you like, dislike, and want to change. Don’t be shy, this is a custom piece and you deserve to get exactly what you are envisioning."

If you are doing the fashion show as a fundraiser, you might pick a them in line with your cause.
For example, if are doing a fashion show to raise money for a breast cancer charity, you might choose to showcase the color pink.;
, If you are coordinating a fashion show to raise money for charity, you may want to keep costs as low as possible.See what kind of money you can expect from donations. You can use these funds to defray the cost of a fashion show.
Decide on a price for ticket sales. These will be the primary means of getting a profit or money for a charitable cause.
The price of tickets should be enough to cover costs of the show plus enough to reach a desired profit or donation goal.
You might see if local designers and professionals will volunteer their time and services for the show to offset some of the costs.

, You will need a place with lots of seating that can accommodate a runway, lights, and speakers.For a local fashion show, the most common places to hold them are schools and event centers.

Alternatively, you can have a runway delineated on the floor.
Make sure the changing and backstage areas aren't visible from the audience.

Learn about drawing.,
Learn about sewing.,
Learn about design.,
Learn about fashion.,
Learn about technology and resources.",How to Design Clothes1," You don’t need to be a master illustrator; a lot of designers use a funky personal style when they design. That said, you do need to be able to communicate your vision visually.Take a drawing class, study some books, or just practice, practice, practice.The most important part of learning any new skill is just doing it a lot. Set aside 30 minutes every day to practice drawing.
A good book to reference is Mark Kistler’s You Can Draw in 30 Days.;
, Even if you don’t want to be the one to actually sew your designs, you need to know about sewing. Understanding the possibilities presented by your medium is an important part of being able to come up with innovative, exciting ideas.Many craft stores like Jo-Ann Fabric offer relatively cheap sewing classes.
Studying pattern making is a must if you intend to sew your own garments.You will need to know how a garment is physically assembled. Knowing how to break a design down into shapes is a crucial part of being able to sew a garment.
Buy some simple patterns at a craft store to practice with.

, If you want to produce innovative designs, you have to know about design theory.Molly Bang’s book Picture This: How Pictures Work is a great place to start. It will help you learn to think like a designer.


Don’t limit yourself to studying fashion design exclusively. The principles of design theory apply across all sorts of disciplines. It may surprise you how much studying something like typography can teach you about fashion design., If you want to be a fashion designer, you need to learn all you can about the world of fashion. You may think of yourself as a very stylish person, but knowing how to dress yourself well is only the tip of the iceberg.If you are designing based on what is hot right now, by the time your design is complete it might already be out of style. Professional fashion designers are constantly thinking ahead, to what the next big thing will be.Watch videos or look at pictures from high-profile fashion shows online, or go in person if one is happening near where you live. Professional designers design their seasonal collections months in advance, so these shows can give you an idea of what kinds of trends will be trickling down into commercial fashion in the future.

, There are more tools available to designers now than there ever have been before. On top of knowing your way around a sketchbook and a sewing machine, you will need to know your way around Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator.


Websites like Linda.com or Tuts+ are good online resources.
If you want to do your sketching on a computer instead of in a sketchbook, you will need to purchase a good pen tablet, such as a Wacom.

Buy some eyelid tape.,
Wash your eye area.,
Find your natural crease.,
Attach tape to the applicator.,
Apply the tape to your eyelid.",How to Make a Double Eyelid1," There are a few different types of eyelid tape on the market. You can buy it in rolls, which you will have to cut yourself, or you can buy it in pre-cut strips.Eyelid tape is a specialty product and may be difficult to find in some stores, depending on where you live. However, you can always buy it online.
An alternative to buying specialty eyelid tape is to buy athletic tape and cut it yourself. To cut your own eyelid tape, cut strips of athletic tape into small rectangles and round the corners off. You should now have small ovals of tape. Cut the ovals in half and round off any sharp edges.;
, Before applying the tape, make sure your eyelids are clean. You can apply make-up after you tape your eyelids.Some brands of eyelid tape may hold up better if you apply a small amount of eye-shadow first. Experiment with different brands and find what works for you., Look in the mirror and find where your eyelid naturally creases. Most brands of eyelid tape will come with an applicator that you can use to help you find your eyelid crease.Gently place the back end of the applicator on your eyelid and blink to find where your eyelid creases. This is where you will apply the tape., If you are using pre-cut strips, remove the tape from its backing using the applicator. Peel off one end of the tape backing and place the applicator to a corner of the tape. Pull off the rest of the tape backing until the eyelid tape is completely on the applicator.You should be able to bend the eyelid tape in an arch by squeezing the applicator together.Depending on what brand of tape you use, you may be dealing with pre-cut strips, or tape you cut yourself. In any case, you should have a pair of applicators to apply the tape to your eyelid.If you do not have an eyelid tape applicator, you can apply it with your fingers, but it may be a little more difficult., Close your eye and gently place the tape on your eyelid where you want to see your crease. Blink a few times to make sure the tape is secure.You shouldn't be able to see the tape, and your eyelid should now have a ""double"" crease.
Repeat with the other eye.

Find your inspiration.,
Consider fabric.,
Consider color and pattern.",How to Design Clothes2," What are you passionate about? What makes you itch to create? It might be a particular fabric, a work of visual art you saw, something you want but can’t seem to find in stores, a garment you saw on the street, a particular color pattern, a retro trend you want to bring back, or any number of other things. There is no right way to get inspired. The important thing is to find something that excites you.


Consider your customer. What kind of person do you imagine buying your designs? What does that kind of person need in a garment?
Combining existing styles and trends can be an interesting way to generate new looks. What would it be like to blend military elements with softer, more flowy ones? What would 1990s meets 1930s look like? How can you incorporate menswear elements into womenswear?

, Do you want a stretchy material, or something with less give? Is your design flowy, or rigid and architectural? Should the fabric be smooth, or textural? If your original inspiration was an amazing fabric you found, you already have this covered. Otherwise, think about what kind of material your design demands.


Consider embellishments such as buttons, lace, beads or embroidery floss as well. These can often impact your fabric choice.

, A lot of the impact of your design hinges on your use of color and pattern. Think about the garment's intended purpose and how you imagine someone wearing it. Consider your customer, and what she might want to wear. Most of all, go with what you think looks good. There are no hard and fast rules here. You are the designer, and you should be true to yourself above all things.


Look at a color wheel. Remember, contrasting colors (the ones across the color wheel from each other) make each other stand out. This can add a dramatic affect to your design, but if not handled well it can also be jarring and off-putting.Get some paint swatches from a paint store, and use them to experiment with different color combinations before you purchase fabric.

Draw the outline of a person.,
Retrace the figure in dark pen.,
Trace the figure onto another sheet of paper.,
Start sketching your design.,
Color your design.,
Repeat as wanted.",How to Design Clothes3," When designing clothes, it’s important to think about how your garment will look on the body. This is why most designers draw their designs onto a human form. It can be intimidating and time-consuming to have to draw a figure from scratch every time you make a new design, so many designers use a croquis.This just means a template you can use each time you sketch out a new garment. You will need to start by drawing the outline of a person in pencil. This is an intimidating prospect, but it doesn’t need to be difficult.


If you’re not too daunted, freehand it. The idea here is not to be anatomically correct, and most designers’ croquis drawings are rendered in some kind of personal style. Your design will look even more unique on a figure you drew yourself. Don’t worry about small details; think of your drawing as a 2-dimensional mannequin.
If you don’t feel up to the task of drawing a human figure from scratch, use someone else’s work. Trace an image from a book or a magazine, or download one of the hundreds of free croquis templates you can find online.Many designers use something called the 9 heads method to make sure their drawings are evenly proportioned.The idea is to use a head as a unit of measure, and to draw a body that measures nine heads from the feet to the top of the neck.Draw a straight vertical line, and divide it into 10 equal parts. This will be your guide as you draw.
Section 1 starts just under the head, and measures the body from the top of the neck to the middle of the chest; section 2 measures from the middle of the chest to the waist; section 3 from the waist to the bottom of the hips; section 4 from the bottom of the waist to mid-thigh, section 5 from mid-thigh to knee, section 6 from knee to upper calve, section 7 from upper calve to mid-calve, section 8 from mid-calve to ankle, and section 9 measures the foot., You are going to need to be able to trace this drawing onto another piece of paper laid on top of it. To make that possible, you’ll have to retrace the lines of your figure drawing with a dark pen., For this step you will need to put down the pen and pick up a pencil again. Lay another piece of plain white paper on top of the croquis you just drew. You should be able to see it relatively well, as long as you used a dark pen and your paper isn’t too thick.If you have a lightbox, this would be a good time to use it. Just lay the croquis onto the lightbox, put the blank sheet of paper on top of it, turn the lightbox, on, and trace away.
If you don’t have a lightbox and are having trouble seeing through your paper, try taping the two sheets of paper to a window on a bright day. You’ll have to trace at an odd angle, but the effect is basically the same as if you used a lightbox.

, Still using your pencil so you can erase inevitable mistakes, lightly draw the garment you’ve been imagining. Start with more general things like the basic shape of the garment, and gradually add details as it takes form. When you are satisfied, retrace the whole drawing in pen., You can use whatever drawing materials you want for this step. Markers and colored pencils work particularly well, since they lend themselves to layering. Start with the lightest colors you plan on using, and shade in larger areas with long, consistent strokes that move in the same direction as the fabric. Gradually incorporate darker colors, patterns, and shadow as you go., Now that you have a croquis, starting a new design should be much faster. Just trace the figure, and get going.

Make a dummy.,
Draw your pattern on butcher paper.,
Recreate the pattern on muslin.,
Sew your mock-up.,
Evaluate the garment.,
Decide what your next step is.,
Move on to the real thing.",How to Design Clothes4," You will need a dressmaking dummy to be able to see the garment as you work on it, and make sure it fits a human form. If you don’t have one, you can create a makeshift one yourself, in your own size.Put on a shirt that you don’t want, and cover it completely with duct tape while wearing it. This will create a stiff duct tape form in the shape of your body.
Remove it by cutting it down the side, from your hip to your armpit, and then up along the sleeve.
Tape back over the cut to make the form whole again. Stuff it with newspaper, and close up the bottom, neck, and sleeves with more duct tape. You can decide whether to keep the arms, or cut them off.

, Use a pencil in case of mistakes, and label each section to avoid confusion later. Remember the old carpenters’ adage: measure twice, cut once. You can waste a lot of time with a single mistake. When you’re done, cut out the shapes.Ideally you should know a thing or two about pattern making before attempting this, but you don’t have to be an expert. You do need to be able to envision how your garment will be put together, however, and have the skills to execute it., Lay the butcher paper pieces of your pattern onto muslin, and trace them. Cut these out too, and pin them into the basic shape of your garment., Introduce your pinned muslin garment to your sewing machine. Remove the pins, and put the garment on a mannequin, or on your own body if you are designing for yourself.

, Look at how it fits. Think about the shape. What’s working? What isn’t? Take notes, make sketches, draw on or cut the muslin, or whatever helps you make sense of the changes you want to make., How close is the mock-up to what you had envisioned? Are you ready to move forward with this design? Do you need to make another before you try it with nicer fabric? Depending on how your mock-up looks, you may want to go back to the drawing board completely, or you may be ready to move on to sewing the actual garment., It’s time to bring your design to life. Proceed as you did with the muslin mock-up.Remember, you are going to make mistakes, especially the first few times around. Make sure you buy more fabric than you think you need, give yourself lots of extra time, and always double-check your measurements. Things will not always go according to plan. Be prepared to problem solve, or tweak your design as you go. Sometimes the most exciting innovations come from mistakes.

Buy eyelid glue.,
Make sure your eyelids are clean.,
Find your eyelid crease.,
Apply a small amount of glue to the brush.,
Brush the glue on your eyelid.",How to Make a Double Eyelid2," Much like eyelid tape, eyelid glue may be difficult to find in some stores, but should be easy to find online. Unlike eyelid tape, you can't really make your own.


There are several brands of eyelid glue, most of which come from Japan. Find the one that works for you., Wash your face and clean your eye area. Wait for your eyes to dry completely before applying the glue.Once the glue dries you can apply make-up.

, Your eyelid glue should come with a ""pusher"" to help you find your eyelid crease. If you don't have such a tool, you can use the glue brush instead.Close your eye and run the ""pusher"" along your eyelid to find the desired crease line. This is where you will apply the glue., Wipe away any excess glue from the brush. Try to use just enough glue to secure your eyelid. If you have too much glue on the brush, you run the risk of getting glue in your eye., Close your eye and carefully run the brush along the desired crease line. Use the ""pusher"" to fold the eyelid up and onto the glue. Open your eye to make the glue stick.Using glue looks more natural, but may wear off quickly. Reapply as necessary."

Start with a highlighter.,
Use a darker color to add a contour to your eyelid.,
Use a liquid liner to obscure the tape.,
Apply eyeshadow above and under your eye.,
Blend.",How to Make a Double Eyelid3," Apply a light, natural color to your brow bone. Add a medium shade to your eyelids above the tape or crease line. The trick is to blend the colors together. Try to fade the medium shade into the lighter one by applying it a little to the outside and moving 2/3 of the way into the eyelid., Using a small brush, add the darker color right beneath your brow bone. Add more color on the outside and fade in towards the center to blend the colors., Draw a line using a black matte liquid liner directly under your eyelid tape. Cover the bottom edge of the tape and make sure you cover the tape on the inner eyelid, closest to your nose., When applying eyeshadow to your eyelid, blend from the center curving up and out. Make a wing shape that extends towards your brow line., To create a natural looking double eyelid, be sure to blend your colors. Pick similar colors for both your crease and your eyelid. Keep lighter colors on the inner eyelid and darker colors near the crease."

Work on the business side of fashion.",How to Be a Fashion Designer," If you're considering a career in fashion design, it's never to early to start exploring your interests and gaining experience. You can even begin your fashion design education in high school, taking relevant coursework that can help you get a head start on your college education.


Because designs often start as drawings/sketches, it would be useful to take any art classes your school offers.Many high schools now offer computer-aided design (CAD) classes.Fashion designers use CAD programs to create fashion designs, so hands-on experience with CAD is essential.
Get good grades in high school. Doing well in high school will give you a better chance of being accepted to (and getting a scholarship at) the college of your choice.;
, Most people working in fashion design earn their bachelor's degree in either fashion design or fashion marketing, depending on which aspect of fashion you want to focus on. Both degrees can lead towards a career in fashion design, though the latter will also give you some insight into the business and marketing side of fashion.Look for programs in fashion design/marketing in your area by searching online.
Make sure your school is accredited by the National Association of Schools of Art and Design (NASAD). NASAD puts colleges through a rigorous peer-review process to check for standards of education before accreditation is granted.You can search for accredited programs directly through the NASAD website by searching for the college's name, the program (fashion design), or by city/state., Though internships are not necessarily a requirement for employment, working an internship can help you gain valuable experience in the industry.You'll also get your foot in the door, making contacts who can offer you a recommendation or may even find full-time work for you after graduation.


Internships can give you the freedom to explore different aspects of fashion design while you're still in school. This can help you know what type of work you want to look for after you graduate.
Some colleges have internship programs with coordinators who can help arrange an internship for you.If your school does not offer internships, you can find fashion design opportunities by searching online for fashion internships in your area.

, Some fashion design programs organize their own student design contests. Others can put you in touch with a local student design contest in your area. These opportunities allow you to design and/or create articles of clothing that will then be judged as part of a competition.


Even if you don't win the design contest, it's still a great way to build your portfolio.Every contest you enter allows you to compile more designs and/or creations that you can then include with your resume when you apply to jobs.
You can find student competitions by searching online, or by looking through fashion design websites for upcoming opportunities., After four years, you will graduate with a bachelor's degree in fashion design. It's important to make the most of your college years by working internships, entering contests, and building up your portfolio so that you have supporting materials to use when applying to jobs.


Save all the projects you put together for classes, internships, contests. These can go into your portfolio to highlight your education and work experience.
Ask your professors and internship leaders about naming them as references during your job hunt.

, Depending on where you went to school and did your internships, you may have a specialized knowledge of some aspect of fashion or a generalized knowledge in all areas. When you apply for a job, it may be beneficial to know where your strengths lie, and apply to positions accordingly. The most common areas of focus for fashion designers include:


clothing design (including men's, women's, children's, maternity, and intimate apparel)
accessory design (including handbags, suitcases, belts, scarves, etc.)
costume design (for performing arts, as well as film and television)
footwear design, Your resume should highlight your education, work experience, and any skills/qualifications you might have. It should look professional, of course, but because you're applying to a design position you may have a bit more creative license to stray from the traditional resume format.


Put your name and contact information at the top of the resume.
List your education and work experience in reverse-chronological order (meaning most recent degree first, followed by earlier degrees (if applicable), most recent job first, etc.
List some responsibilities and achievements for each job. This will let your prospective employer know what exactly each job/internship entailed.Research each position you apply to and tailor your resume to highlight the specific skills required by each employer.

, In the fashion design industry, your portfolio is at least as important as your resume. It is an important part of your employment application because it highlights the work you've done in school, through internships, and at any relevant jobs you may have worked. It can also serve as an indication of your potential for future work. Your fashion design portfolio should include:


creative research work that displays a working knowledge of social and cultural aspects of fashion
development of a concept, from sketch to design to photographs of the finished product (no actual garments should go in your portfolio)
well-drawn and presented sketches/illustrations
flat drawings of clothing that are correctly proportioned and display the necessary details required for actual manufacturing of the garment
work that is relevant or appropriate for the company you are applying to
work displayed in reverse-chronological order (most recent first)
an edited collection (in other words, don't include very single thing you've ever done), but one which does not leave any portfolio pages blank

, Some fashion designers may find employment by talking to network contacts (former professors, internship supervisors, colleagues, etc.). If you do not have any network contacts, you can search for fashion design jobs online. You can also seek out specific companies or design firms you're interested in working for and check their employment openings online.


Recognize that depending on where you live, you may need to relocate for a fashion design job.The highest employment levels of fashion designers in the United States are in New York, California, Texas, New Jersey, and Massachusetts.
The highest concentrations of fashion design jobs and location quotients in the US are in New York, California, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Kansas.
Many of these jobs tend to be concentrated in and around urban areas. These include the NY/NJ metropolitan area, the greater Los Angeles area, San Diego, Dallas, Kansas City, and Boston., Because you are interviewing for a fashion design position, you should dress appropriately for the position. Men should wear business attire (suit with or without a tie, depending on how corporate the job is). Women should wear business attire for corporate positions, or something that matches the style/personality of the business for an agency or design firm position.Recognize and discuss the brand of the employer you're interviewing with.Bring your portfolio and at least one copy of your resume to each interview.
Illustrate the desired qualities of a fashion designer: a strong business sense, good communication skills, a skill for creative work, the ability to collaborate, and a strong knowledge of current fashion trends., It can take a while to accumulate the necessary experience before you can advance your career. Many designers start out working as an assistant designer, or working with a team of creative designers. As you gain experience and make connections, you can advance to chief designer, head of the design department, or even creative director., While you won't need any formal continuing education courses, it's important that you stay up to date on current trends in the fashion world. Fashion trends change very quickly, and if you fall behind you'll quickly find it hard to continue working in fashion. The best way to keep on top of trends is to immerse yourself in fashion.


Read fashion magazines. Publications like Vogue and GQ feature current and burgeoning fashion trends, as well as fashion advice and interviews with designers.
Attend fashion shows. If you live in a big city this should be fairly easy, but if you live in a smaller town you can still find shows put on by local brands or retailers.
Observe how people and storefronts are dressed. You can people watch in the park, or walk around the big shopping district in your local city, and take note of what people and mannequins are wearing.Follow fashion designers online. If you have some fashion designers whose work you admire, follow them on social media (especially Instagram, but also Twitter and Facebook) to see what they're working on and what inspires them.

, The specifics of your work will vary, depending on what areas you focus on and which positions you apply to. Generally, if you are working in fashion design, you may start out working as an assistant designer.Duties for this position may include:


designing garment instructions (also called ""briefs"")
producing concept and mood boards, which include photographs, fabric samples, and color samples
using patterns to design and cut basic shapes (called ""blocks"")sewing together materials to create garments and accessories

, If you graduated with an impressive portfolio or have worked for a while as an assistant designer, you may advance to a more creative position. The specifics will once again vary, depending on where you work and what area you concentrate in, but general duties may include:


choosing collection themes
selecting fabrics, colors, and/or styles for garments
using CAD programs to create original designs
presenting design ideas to your creative directorsupervising sample garment construction, If your a dedicated designer and you're ready to spread your wings, you may be considering starting your own fashion design label. However, it can be very difficult to get such a venture off the ground. Think very carefully about what you'll need in order to start a business, and consider whether or not this option is right for you.


Many designers dream of running a fashion label, but most don't realize that you need a great deal of money and connections. You need to know people who will help you get clients, publish/distribute photo shoots, put on fashion shows, and so forth.
If you want to get a ready-to-wear company started, you'll need around $2 million to $3 million to get it off the ground. Fabric samples alone can cost around $100,000 each season.Remember that you'll need a strong business sense to manage your own design label. It's essentially the same as starting your own business: you'll need to hire (and pay) employees, balance your budget, manage expenses, and make executive decisions to keep your business afloat.
Be aware that not every label is an instant success. Some labels take years to gain recognition, while others simply run out of money and/or patience after a year or two.

, Whether you advance to a more corporate position or have a background in business administration, you may decide to work on the business side of fashion. Duties may include:


analyzing and predicting fashion trends
estimating material and manufacturing costs
finding suppliersmarketing designs to retailers and/or consumers"
