Build a portfolio.,
Do some research.,
Use online resources.,
Build a website.,
Brand yourself.",How to Design Clothes5," Document your work in photographs as you go. This is how you will sell yourself as a designer as your career progresses. Keep in mind that you want to showcase your versatility, while also demonstrating that you have a unique voice and point of view. There should be a variety of pieces in your portfolio, but they should all scream “you.”Take quality photographs. Don’t just lay the dress you made on your bed and take a poorly lit picture with your phone. Put your garments on live models, make sure they are well lit (if you don’t have the resources to do this inside, go outside on slightly overcast day—this will give you even lighting), use a decent camera, and pay attention to details like hair, makeup, and accessories. The way you present your work plays a huge roll in the impact it creates., Are there independent clothing boutiques in your area that sell clothes with an aesthetic similar to yours? Are there websites that sell clothes that remind you of your own? Try to find designers doing work that reminds you of yours, or of what you would like your designs to evolve into. Observe their tactics.

, Some websites will fabricate your designs for you, if they or their users are sufficiently impressed. Look into websites like Gamz and Fabricly if you think you have a killer design that you’re not up to sewing on your own.If you are more of a graphic designer, but think your work would look great on clothing, look into sites like RedBubble, that can print your artwork on a variety of different products.

, If you want to sell your clothes, the world must know about your genius. Almost anyone can design a beautiful website these days; use a platform like Squarespace to create a site to display your portfolio. Keep it simple and elegant. You want to the focus to be on your clothing design, not your web design.

, Develop a social media presence. Get on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Tumblr, the works. You need to get eyes on your work, above and beyond all else. Worry about selling things later. Right now, you need to create a buzz."

Purchase a dress form.,
Adjust your dress form to the height, waist and torso measurements you are going to use for your prototype dress.

,
Create a sketch of the dress you want to create.,
Buy muslin to drape.,
Mark a centerline down your dress form in the front and back using tape to aid you in creating a symmetrical dress.

,
Start with a foundation piece if your dress is made out of lightweight fabric.,
Pin the foundation piece of pieces to your dress form.,
Ensure you have enough fabric to cover the sections of the dress between hems.,
Drape the fabric across the front bodice.,
Choose a place with the most folds and begin pinning the fabric to your dress form.

,
Mark additional folds with chalk according to your illustration.

,
Step back and compare the draped fabric to your dress illustration frequently.

,
Move on to the back bodice when you have finished the front bodice.,
Continue with the front skirt next.,
Complete the draping with the back skirt section.

,
Baste stitch the sections and folds to the foundation piece.,
Remove your pins as an entire section is attached with a basting stitch.,
Cut excess fabric off the form at your chalk lines.,
Remove the dress from the form and sew the seams into your dress with a sewing machine.,
Cut away the basting stitches.",How to Drape a Dress," You will need an adjustable dress form to ensure your dress design is made to the exact size you need. Adjustable dress forms are available for approximately $250 brand new.;
,, Do several detail drawings of the front, back and sides.

, Choose muslin that is close to the weight of the material you want to use in the final dress, so that it behaves in a similar way. This will reduce the cost of materials, because you are creating a prototype in a less expensive fabric.

,, This is usually the liner and it allows the dress to keep its shape on the form. If your dress is a heavyweight fabric to begin with, you can skip this step.

, Often designers will make a generic foundation piece in the measurements of the dress form and then adjust it to fit when it’s on the form.

, You can always cut more off, but you can’t add more on without changing your design.

, This is usually where you will start because it requires more tailoring.

,,,, Pin and compare until you are happy with the draping.

, Mark lines that should be cut later with chalk.

,, Keep the pins in as long as you can. Removing pins too early and losing folds and tucks is a common mistake with dress draping.

, Remember to hide raw edges from the draping inside the seams.

, Remember to leave seam allowances. If you have very little fabric left, you can fold in under instead of cutting it away.

, Alternatively, you can sew it by hand.

, Use your prototype to construct a dress using the final material. Once designers get used to dress draping, they may choose to start with the final dress material so that they don’t have to drape the dress twice."

, It could be as simple as your living room without furniture, or as complex as a rented office building floor. You also want to take into consideration how many people are coming to the fashion show. If only twenty people are coming but, there's a huge empty space with no one in it, it is going to seem empty. But if you have a small space and twenty people, it will seem crowded. Also, there doesn't need to be a raised catwalk, just a space with chairs surrounding it.

, A lot of small boutiques would do this for free, as an advertisement. Or, you could make the clothes yourself, if you know how. Here are some articles that will get you started:

If your boss or other superior does not like your clothing item, do not wear it.",How to Dress Professionally," Some workplaces will provide a written dress code outlining specifically what is appropriate and what is not. For others, you may have to judge based on what others there are wearing.


Formal Business attire is typically the dress code used for high-profile jobs: government officials, managing workers, lawyers, and so on. It is also for businesses which cultivate formality, such as credit unions. Be aware some businesses dress formally most days, but have ""casual Friday"" or will otherwise relax the rules for certain reasons or occasions (such as a walk-a-thon, fundraiser, or if the air conditioning breaks down).
""Business casual"" is the term often used for less formal (but not informal) office environments. (See below for a more in-depth discussion on what ""business casual"" means) .Be aware that this varies by culture, region, and profession. Sometimes ""business casual"" offices will become ""business formal"" for important occasions, such as a press conference, a high-profile visitor arriving, or an important seminar.
""Black tie"" is typically only used only for very specific and special events, (such as awards dinners, formal banquets, or galas.) These typically require a tuxedo for men and an evening gown for women.
Typically, the higher paying the position, the higher your rank, the more professionally your office clothing should be. (However, note this is not universal--the CEO of a software company may dress far less formally than an intern at a law firm!)
Some jobs have a specific uniform. For instance, a chef, nurse, life guard, judge, or police officer. This is a professional dress code, but usually this needs very little further discussion.;
, Making professional dress even more confusing is the fact that types of work environment make a big difference in what one wears. Although you are usually fine following guidelines as discussed, realize that workplaces may encourage a certain ""look"" that goes beyond simple ""Office Formal"" or ""Business Casual"" definitions. This usually has to do with what the company makes, sells, or provides.


An African aid organization, for instance, may encourage people to dress in clothes made in Africa and sold on its website in order to promote awareness and fair trade.
The athletic department of a university may be much more accepting of athletic clothing such as running shoes.
Highly artistic or creative workplaces may allow a lot more leeway in the way of dress. A fashion-based office may have much different expectations of dress than an accounting firm.

, Professional dress code in much of the world has some seasonality, based partially on the weather but also on seasonal styles. But be aware that some regions do not really have changes in clothing based on seasons. (Such as the tropics). But for areas with clothing seasons, many areas the following rules of thumb apply:


Linen, seersucker, and madras cloth tend to be appropriate for summer only.
Wool clothing tends to be for fall and winter only.
In America, an old saying is ""no white after Labor Day""...which used to refer to white linen fabrics used a lot in summer dresses rather than absolutely no white whatsoever. This is a very outdated rule. Feel free to brazenly wear a white shirt in the office in winter.
Layers of appropriate clothing can help negotiate in-between seasons, when temperatures can fluctuate. For instance, a cardigan can be useful coming into work on a crisp fall day, and removed later when it warms up. A pair of warm leggings can allow you to wear skirts comfortably in winter.
Keep in mind that the amount of visible skin allowable will be slightly different in business settings. What is acceptable in one culture may be unacceptable in another. For instance, what is fine for a women in France may be too revealing in Qatar.
If you choose to remove layers of clothing, make sure you are in no way being revealing or inappropriate about the skin you choose to show. If you are wearing a camisole under a blazer, and you are not supposed to have a sleeveless shirt, you may be out of luck.

, No color is completely ""off limits"" but it is more formal and professional stick mainly with a neutral color palette. Formal business suits for both men and women tend to be black, brown, gray, tan, or navy blue. Shirts tend to be lighter in color, with white, off-white, and light shades of colors.


This limited color palette may sound boring and dull at first. However, it also can create a wardrobe that allows for many items to interchange easily. Basing a wardrobe around black, white, and khaki will assure that everything goes with just about everything.
""Pops"" of color with accessories such as ties, shoes, and scarves are typically fine, but , it is safer to go with subtle rather than bright and bold.
Multi-colored shirts can be acceptable, such as a classic striped Oxford-style shirt.
These guidelines are for people who need to make their dress more professional. Brighter and more varied colors can be entirely appropriate, depending on the occupation, and the overall appearance of the outfit. But if you are unsure or inexperienced, select conservative colors--they are perennial office clothes favorites because they always look right.

, If you are unsure exactly how formal or casually to dress, try looking at the clothing choices of those in your profession, at your office, or attending the same event as you.


In general, it is better to be slightly overdressed than it is to be under-dressed.
If you are not able to get a good glimpse or have a chat with someone in your field, try searching images on the internet for people in similar positions in the company or last year's event. Pay attention to the appearance of people in these images, and dress accordingly.
Be careful of events that may require a dramatic wardrobe change. For instance, at a conference, you may be required to wear suits and ties for the presentation. At the poolside cocktail receptions afterwards, swimsuits, Hawaiian shirts, and flip-flops are the garb of choice.

, A great outfit will only get you so far. If you are lacking personal hygiene or have a bad haircut, you will not look professional. Make sure that you treat your entire appearance, (including hair, skin, and hygiene), with the same professional care as you do with your clothing.


Shower. How often varies with culture, weather, and activity level. In most of America, at least every other day.
Use deodorant.
Make sure your hair is tidy and well-groomed.
Facial hair (if any) should be trimmed and tidy. Stubble is not generally acceptable. ""unibrow"" eyebrows or very heavy eyebrows are often considered unattractive in many areas.
For women, legs should either be shaved or bare legs covered.
Good oral hygiene matters. Be sure your breath has no noticeable odor. This is particularly important if you smoke or eat pungent food.
Makeup for women should generally be restrained, according to culture., Although fashion changes the little details, the essential core of formal office attire has really not changed much in decades. Dressing business formal is in some ways easier than in business casual, because the parameters are a lot narrower and well-defined. Both genders are typically expected to wear suits, typically in neutral colors (as described above). In general, men and women wear the following:


For men: Formal suit, dress shirt, dress shoes, tie. Sometimes dressy slacks and sport coat are acceptable alternatives for a business suit. Often a shirt without an outer garment is acceptable.
For women: business suit with skirt, blazer, blouse, dress shoes. Pants are also acceptable. A conservative dress may be substituted for a suit.

, Suits should be tailored for fit. Solid colors or pinstripes, and in good condition. Skirt suits should be knee-length and not too tight.

, Shirts should be typically solid or pinstriped, tailored for fit, laundered, and ironed if required.


Long sleeves are always more formal.
Short sleeves are typically acceptable for spring and summer. However, some workplaces and cultures frown on bare arms.
Women typically should steer away from sleeveless shirts if unsure if they are accepted or not. In some regions sleeveless shirts (but not one with straps, such as halter tops) are considered perfectly acceptable. In others, they are not considered appropriate. Tank tops, camisoles, tube tops, strapless tops amd ""spaghetti strap"" tops are not office formal clothing.
Men should match shirt to tie.
Women have to be extra careful in the cut and fit of office tops. Put bluntly, (especially for full-figured women) the bustline must be fitted properly so that it is not too revealing, too tight, or otherwise exposing more of the breasts so it is inappropriate. If your blouse gaps at the buttons of the bustline, the shirt does not fit you properly.

, Ties can allow for some color and pattern in an outfit that would be rather drab. It attracts attention, so be very careful in what you choose. Not all ties are appropriate for business formal dress code.


Opt for either solid color, or have a small (no larger than a quarter) sized print that covers them.
Avoid ties that have more than 3-4 colors total, and which have an image or scene printed onto them.
Ties should match both your shirts and your suits and make sure they use colors that match or go with the rest of your outfit.
Try to buy shirts and ties together, if possible. Men's stores coordinate colors to try to make the buying process easy. It may not be the same colors next year or even next season! If in doubt, ask for help--a good quality store will be happy to help you.
Bow ties are also generally considered acceptable. However, they are far less common and can be considered unusual or ""quirky"".
Bolo ties are often regionally acceptable in areas of the American South, Southwest, and West coast. However, they may or may not be considered an acceptable replacement for a tie depending on the workplace.

, Dresses can easily be worn in a business formal setting, but be careful with your selection. Choose dresses that are knee-length or longer, and are in a subtle print or solid color. Dresses should not be too tight-fitting and should not be revealing.


A good blazer or suit jacket can make a dress more formal and versatile. This sort of outfit is the basis of the classic ""day to night"" women's wear, in which a woman goes to work wearing an evening appropriate dress coordinated with a work appropriate blazer. At the evening rendezvous, put aside the blazer for a less formal look.

, Business formal jobs all require quality footwear, typically made of leather (or similar high-quality material).


Men should always wear formal shoes, often in the baroque or oxford style.Lace up is more traditional.There are many slip-on loafers that also may be appropriate and formal. Black is the go-to color, although brown is sometimes acceptable.
Women should typically wear low or moderate high heel shoes or flat pumps. Conservative boots are sometimes appropriate. Make sure details and embellishments are restrained. Women generally have more choice in color, but sticking to black and neutral colors is still safer.

, In a formal office, white cotton athletic socks are usually not acceptable. If you are wearing socks, they should usually be dark (black is typical). Ideally they go with the pants or shoes.

, In a formal workplace, you should usually wear pantyhose, or tights under your skirt. Choose sheer tights in a neutral color.




Leggings are not appropriate in a formal workplace; choose opaque tights instead.
Barelegged (although well groomed) is becoming more acceptable. But if in doubt, put on a pair of pantyhose or tights., To complete your outfit, remember some accessories. In general, keep jewelry and other accessories subtle and tasteful. Be careful of wearing too much, although what constitutes ""too much"" will vary from culture to culture. Also, what is OK for a man and a woman may be different. For instance:


For men: cuff links, rings (such as a class or wedding ring), watch, pocket square (very formal). Necklaces and bracelets are often uncommon but usually acceptable if in good taste. Medical Alert jewelry is always OK. Most formal offices will not look favorably on body piercings, including earrings. Belt buckles should generally not be over-sized.
For women: Jewelry (rings, necklaces, earrings, bracelets, watches ) are all typically acceptable, but be careful of too much or too large pieces. Pierced ears are almost universally OK, generally other body piercings should not be visible. Scarves, belts, headbands, hair accessories (such as barrettes), are also all fine.

, This is less formal and casual than traditional business guidelines. Unfortunately, it is often poorly defined and can be greatly different from one business to another. For instance, one business will be fine with Hawaiian print shirts with collars, while another will consider it too casual despite the collar. However, in general, the following are usually frowned upon:


Jeans: especially ones with tears, stains, patches, or embellishments such as studs. (Although a more detailed discussion on blue jeans in the workplace is below).
Tank tops: especially spaghetti-strap styles.
Shorts: Sometimes more tailored styles are acceptable--such as ones that resemble full length khakis, but shorter. Athletic styles are usually not OK.
Informal T-shirts: Usually collared polo-type T-shirts are acceptable, or ones with shaping. If in doubt, do not go with any graphic images on your shirts. Shirts usually should not have elements which could be controversial or unacceptable--such as references to alcohol, sex, or violence. Avoid novelty T-shirts, (such as ones with cartoon characters) as this may come off as immature.
Mini-skirts: Skirts should be no higher than about two inches above the knee.
Plunging neckline: Be sure your V-neck shirt is not revealing too much, or your blouse buttoned too low.
Keep it clean and tidy. Never come into work with clothes that are dirty, stained, ripped, or wrinkled (the one exception for wrinkled may be if that is part of the look, such as a seersucker shirt or crinkle cotton skirt).

, Look for styles such as:
Polo-style shirts: This collared shirt is the quintessential ""office casual"" choice for both men and women. Usually it will be available in a solid or striped. It can sometimes be found with a geometric pattern.
Oxford-style shirt: This is acceptable in formal office clothing as well - a well-tailored shirt always looks good whether with khakis or a business suit.
Tailored T-shirt: Some workplaces are fine with T-shirt style tops, as long as they are not informal T-shirts. For instance, a T-shirt with a classic scoop or crew neckline on a woman.
Product shirts. In an office-casual workplace, often shirts given to you by your company are acceptable. Or products that your company sells. For instance, if you work at a company that sells outdoor equipment, wearing your company's shirts may be acceptable. But be careful--just because your company sells tank tops may not make it OK to wear tanks tops to your accounting job!

, Find a few pairs of black, navy blue, khaki, or brown pants. In ""office casual"" the pants are usually cotton and can be a little more ""relaxed"" than those found in formal offices. Woman can wear skirts into the mixed in the same aforementioned color palette.


Avoid patterns if you are unsure on what looks professional. There are great, classic patterns such as pinstripe that look great on pants, but it is easy to make a mistake.
Generally avoid wearing white pants or a skirt. While entirely appropriate, these items can stain easy...if you spill your tea you may be out of luck.
A patterned skirt can be appropriate for women. Try a small floral or geometric print.

, It will inevitably get chilly, so make sure you have the right items for cold weather. Men can choose to wear a cardigan, sweater, or sports coat over the top of their button up shirt for a smart look. Women can wear layered sweaters, cardigans, and structured jackets and blazers to good effect. When desired/necessary, a pashmina or cashmere scarf can be worn for added warmth and style.

, Dresses are sometimes appropriate in a business casual setting, so long as they follow a few basic guidelines. Dresses should be knee-length or longer, expose no skin below the collarbone, and mostly cover the shoulders. Small patterns and solid colors work best, and can be accessorized for added visual interest. Throw on a cardigan or matching jacket for layering in cooler weather.

, Business casual offices vary widely in shoe choice, based on the type of environment. Some good guidelines:


Close-toed shoes. Sandals are usually a no-no. Flip-flops are a definite ""no"". Women can wear flats or heels, but they must be in good condition and quality. In general, stick to neutral colored shoes and stay away from bold patterns.
Be careful of really, really casual shoes. Even if it is closed-toe, some shoes usually do not belong in a professional environment. For example, high top Converse sneakers are best left to teenagers. The classic ""Croc"" shoe is much too casual for most professional workplaces. , If you are old enough to have to consider professional clothing, do so where grown-ups shop. That also goes for clothing stores that cater exclusively to teens and very young adults like ""Forever 21"". That does not necessarily mean you have to dress exactly like your mother or father. However, if you are trying to find clothing to help you to be taken seriously as a young adult, you have to accept that you have to dress the part--at least at work.

, In putting together a wardrobe of work clothes, often your best ally are good salespeople in a quality store. This can be a stand-alone store, such as a menswear store, or a department store. A knowledgeable salesperson can help you select clothing to meet your needs, be sure it fits properly, and accessorize appropriately.


Try to find a salesperson dressed more or less in the way you want to dress. This may be a good indication that he or she has a fashion sensibility that matches yours. However, be open for other individuals. That matronly salesperson may actually really know what the young people like these days!
It can help to bring someone whose judgement you trust to this sort of shopping trip.For instance, your mother or your fashion-savvy friend.
Yes, you need to try on the clothes. Ill-fitting clothes are not professional, and fit cannot typically be judged well on a hanger. If ordering online, be prepared to send back things that do not fit.
Make sure of fit. Just because you can wear it does not mean it fits properly. This includes pants that are showing the lines of your underwear, and baggy over-sized shirts.
Minor alterations are usually available at higher-end stores, and can make a great different in fit and appearance.
Remember: the salesperson will ultimately sell you whatever you want, even if it really is not in line with appropriateness or good taste. Be sure that you keep your goal in sight, and not revert to great clothing that cannot be worn to work.

, In most of the world, blue jeans are a simple ""no-no"" in the workplace; they are considered appropriate for manual labor or leisure. However, America has some office-casual workplaces that are fine with jeans in the office. Before wearing your blue jeans to the office, really be sure it is OK with management. If in doubt, do not bring them to the office.

, Although accessorizing can be fun, piling on too many accessories can give a messy presentation.


One accessory should usually be the focus.
An old but still useful rule: Accessorize, but before leaving the house, take one item off.
In general, wear a single necklace, pair of earrings, and one ring per hand at any time.
Only a single bag or briefcase (never a fanny pack!) should be brought to work.

, Although not all offices advertise a preference for clear-skinned individuals, most workplaces expect employees to be as natural as possible. If you have large tattoos in obvious places or body piercings outside the ears, it may be necessary to slightly adjust your clothing to cover them. There is nothing wrong with having these things, but according to traditional dress code, they shouldn’t be shown when you’re on the clock.

, Make sure you always wear clothes that are clean and pressed, or else give the impression of poor hygiene. Practice setting out your outfit the night before you wear it, so you are not at a loss for what to wear.


Do your laundry once a week and ironing when necessary so that you do not deplete your arsenal of clean clothing and be forced to wear dirty clothes.

, Whether you are running late and just head to your go-to outfit, or you just really love an outfit, avoid wearing the same exact outfit in a seven-day work period.


Mixing and matching pieces is important and maximizes the usefulness of your wardrobe.
Try practicing the two-week rule, where you only wear an outfit (where every piece is being repeated) only once in a two-week period.

, Having all the right wardrobe pieces is great, but if they do not coordinate, they are essentially useless.


Be sure to have more ""basic"" pieces than ""statement"" pieces. You will get more use out of certain items that will go with practically everything. There is nothing wrong with more flashy pieces, but they tend to not go with as many items.
Try to buy items at the same store at the same time. Many store have clothing lines that are to be made in similar colors, patterns, and design. You are more likely to find coordinated outfits this way.
As long as you match all your neutrals and add in a pop of color, you are likely be in good shape., If possible, have clothing that you can change into if there is a mishap at work. A shirt and bottom (such as pants or a skirt), shoes and a tie can be a lifesaver if you get caught in the rain or someone spills something on you. This is also a good use of clothing that may not be your favorites, but are appropriate and fit you all right.

, Your right to dress how you want in large part stops at the office door. This can mean that even if your clothes technically fit a dress code or guideline, your superiors can veto your apparel choice and to a large extent, there is very little you can do about it. This is not high school, where coming to school with an objectionable T-shirt just gets you to have to turn in inside-out.


Issues such as head-scarves for religious reasons may or may not be legally protected in your country or state.
Laws against sexual discrimination or inequality can also offer some protection, again depending on your area.

Remember to present yourself in a professional manner.",How to Dress for Work," Business formal usually means wearing a suit, tie, dress slacks, and dress shoes.


Wear clothes that fit. Clothes that are too tight will be too uncomfortable to work in. Clothes that are too loose will look sloppy and unprofessional. Work attire should be snug without being constrictive.
Have a tailor take your exact measurements and suggest specific clothing for you. Though you may not actually purchase those items, you will have an accurate grasp of your measurements when you purchase clothing in the future.
Notice how your colleagues dress and use it as your standard. Try to dress at the same level as others in your workplace.;
, Always tuck your shirt into your dress slacks.


Pastel shirts are optimal as they are not too bright or dark. Wear either a solid colored shirt or one with subtle stripes.
Avoid loud colors such as bright yellow, orange, and certain shades of red.
Dress shirts come in various sizes that take into account a man's height and build.If you are more muscular, opt for an athletic size. If you are lanky, try the slim fit size. If you are bulky, buy a broad fit size. Again, the emphasis is on snugness, not standard size alone.
If you are uncertain of about the fit of a shirt, ask a tailor what size looks the most professional.

, Be sure that the color you select is conservative, meaning that it is not ostentatious or too attention-grabbing.


Ties with simple designs or solid colors are the best choice.
Avoid ties that are brightly colored or with overly elaborate designs. This can be distracting and off-putting to some.
Do not tie your tie too short. Have the bottom corners of your tie just above the top of your belt.This is the common tie length.
Don't worry about using fancy or special knots. Knots generally only affect the length and width of your tie. Any knot will do in a business formal setting.

, This includes black, grey, or navy blue.Pants cuts typically come in traditional cut, straight leg cut, or slim fit cut. Traditional cut pants are roomier around the thighs, tapering throughout the leg to the hemline. Straight leg pants fit straight through the seat and thighs. Slim cut pants fit closely to the leg throughout.Again, knowing your body type will help you properly choose your pants cut.
Wear pants tightly around your waist, above your hips. Do not sag dress pants as this looks very unprofessional.
Be sure that your pants are properly hemmed. Pants that touch the floor when you walk are either the wrong size or improperly hemmed. Dress pants that rise past your ankles when you sit are properly hemmed.

Do not wear khaki or corduroy pants, as these pants are business casual.

, Again, opt for conservative colors.


Having a tailored suit coat or blazer is preferred, although it is not as necessary as pants and shirts. Having a slightly bulkier or less form-fitting jacket is acceptable.
If your sport coat has two buttons, only button the top button. If it has three, only button the middle button. This is not only a function of style, it facilitates movement.Unbutton your jacket when sitting to avoid stressing the buttons, which may pop off if left buttoned. This will also prevent wrinkles to your coat.
Some workplaces do not require you to wear a blazer or full suit. If you are uncertain, opt for a two-piece matched suit as this is the safest and most professional-looking choice.

, Polish them every few weeks and try to keep them looking shiny.


Find dress shoes that are no more than a half-inch longer than your actual feet. Remember that dress shoes are cut differently and that your normal shoe/sneaker size may not be the best fit for dress shoes.
To help reduce creases and wrinkles, buy a shoe tree to place in each shoe whenever they are not being worn.Remember to store your shoes in their original box when not in use.

Always wear dark dress socks with your dress shoes. Never wear athletic white socks with traditional business attire.

, Business casual should still look professional but does not require you to wear a suit and tie.Be wary of the ""casual"" in business casual. Foregoing formal clothing does not mean wearing jeans, sneakers, and sweatshirts.
Avoid baggy or tight clothing. Business casual clothing should be neat, crisp, and classic rather than trendy.
Take a cue from your coworkers and supervisors about how casual you should dress. Remember that although it is a business casual environment, dressing up a bit can show ambition on your part., Polo shirts are also acceptable in most business casual situations.


Choosing a white, light blue solid, or conservative-striped shirt is the safest choice.Shirts do not have to be tailored but should not be baggy. Though they can be less form-fitting, you must still look professional.

Do not wear shirts with logos or words on the front.
All shirts should be neatly pressed and tucked into your pants.
Some non-professional jobs have a standard uniform that all coworkers are required to wear. While this typically includes just a uniform shirt, your shirt should still be neatly pressed, reasonably sized, and tucked into pants.

, Dress slacks are not required although they can still be paired with business casual shirts.


Pants do not have to be tailored but they should not be too tight or too baggy. They do not have to be hemmed but should still avoid touching the ground.
Black, brown, navy, and khaki colored pants are preferable. Corduroy pants are also acceptable.
Although jeans are sometimes acceptable in certain industries, choose the above options first before choosing jeans. Observe your peers and bosses to see if jeans are truly acceptable in the workplace. If you do wear jeans, choose a dark color over lighter or faded colors.

, Do not wear a black suit coat or blazer as this is too formal.


Opt for a navy blazer, a tweed sport coat, a conservative and solid-colored V-neck sweater, a corduroy jacket, or a cardigan.When wearing blazers, it is okay to pick sizes that are not so form-fitting. For dress sweaters and cardigans, however, it is best to select snug sizes.
Make sure your V-neck sweatshirt is not too low. You only want it deep enough to expose the collar of your dress shirt.If wearing a uniform shirt, a jacket is often unnecessary. Most workplaces employing a uniform want their company shirt to be clearly seen.

, Wear either leather boat shoes or loafers.Avoid shoes that are too formal, especially if wearing khaki pants and short sleeves. The contrast between qualities will look awkward and confusing.
Shoes should still be conservatively colored. Navy, black, and brown are all safe choices.
In some situations, wearing sneakers that are specifically labeled ""business casual"" is also acceptable. These sneakers also tend to be brown or darkly colored.
Some non-professional jobs require you to do manual or physical labor (for example, stocking items items in a back room). In this situation, athletic footwear may be the standard. Remember to observe coworkers and ask supervisors first before switching to athletic footwear.

, Plan on wearing a skirt suit, or dress suit with a blouse underneath.


Wear clothes that fit and that are not revealing. Dressing professionally means avoiding clothes that are provocative and distracting.
Clothes should never be too tight or too loose. They should also not be see-through or inappropriately cut (for example, low-top blouses or high-slit skirts).
Dress to impress, not to be eye-candy. Business formal is all about sending a positive message about your attitude - your being on the job - as well as your ability.

, Skirts should always be the appropriate length and fit.


Be sure that your skirt extends to your knee. Your skirt should fully cover your thighs when you are seated. Longer skirts are also appropriate as long as they are narrow enough to not be billowing but not so narrow that you can't climb stairs comfortably. Skirts should only have center-back slits that extend no higher than the back of your knee.Center-back slits are acceptable because they facilitate walking and stair climbing. Slits designed to increase view of your legs are not appropriate.
If you sit in a chair and can see too much thigh when crossing or uncrossing your legs, your skirt is too short.If you wear a slip under your skirt be careful it does not show.
If you cannot walk comfortably in a skirt, it is either too small or too tight.
Darker colors are the safest and most professional-looking choices skirts.

, Like a skirt, a dress is best for warmer weather but should still be the appropriate length and fit.


Dresses should extend to the knee, similar to skirts. However, wearing long dresses is not advised as this may look too formal, like attending a dinner or award ceremony.Do not wear backless dresses. Do not wear dresses with spaghetti straps or plunging necklines. Sleeveless, short-sleeved, and long-sleeved dresses are all acceptable.
Choose neutral and solid colors. This includes black, grey, navy, and brown.
Wear a slip under your dress for additional warmth. This will also reduce skin chafing.
Wearing a blouse is not necessary if wearing a dress.

, Hosiery should be plainly styled with no patterns.


Sheer is the best choice as it is the most conservative. Dark hosiery that matches your suit and shoes is also appropriate.
Avoid opaque hosiery.
Avoid high contrast between your suit color and hosiery color.
Wear hosiery in cold weather. This will give you both greater warmth and a noticeable professional vibe., Opt for a color that coordinates nicely with your suit.


Blouses should not be too tight or too low cut. No cleavage should be showing.
All blouses should be opaque rather than see-through.
The blouse or shirt should be a fine-gauge knit shell sleeveless or a sleeved knit top. A nice alternative to a blouse may be a tailored knit sweater, sweater set, or twinset.The blouse, shirt, or sweater should be made of quality fabric such cotton, silk, or blends. Avoid velvet or shimmery fabrics you would wear to a party.

, Wearing a separate blazer is also acceptable so long as it matches your bottom wear.


Separate blazers should be tailored.
Opt for navy, dark gray, brown, or black coloring. Choose a solid or subtle weave pattern, or a plaid that looks solid from across the room.
Suits should be made of quality fabrics such as wool, wool blends, high quality blends, or high quality synthetics.

, Shoes should be made of leather, fabric, or micro-fiber.Closed toe heels and pumps are ideal footwear. Do not wear heels that extend beyond 4 inches (10.2 cm).
Avoid wearing sandals, chunky heels, flat-soled shoes, stilettos, and platforms.
It is important to be able to walk comfortably in your shoes. Hobbling in uncomfortable shoes looks clumsy and unprofessional.
For greater effect, coordinate your shoes to match with your purse.

, Unlike men, your business casual attire will often look similar to your business formal attire.


Clothes should still fit properly. Although you do not need to wear a tailored suit, you should still avoid baggy or tight clothing.
Remember, casual does not mean less professional. Low-top blouses and high-slit skirts are still inappropriate.
If you are unsure of what qualifies as business casual, wearing business formal skirts and dresses is acceptable.
Casual wear typically differs the most from formal wear when it comes to shoes.

, Navy, black, gray, brown, and khaki are acceptable colors.


Skirts should at least reach the knees when standing. For skirts that fall just below the knee, a slit just above the knee is acceptable.
A very long skirt should not be slit to above the knee. Slits in the center-back of a skirt are acceptable as long as they do not extend higher than the back of the knee.Hosiery is not essential but is recommended if your skirt is knee length. Remember that although hose is not required, it always looks more professional.
If your job requires you to do physical or manual labor, wearing dress pants is the more sensible choice.

, Tailored shirts, blouses, tailored knit sweaters, and sweater sets are all safe business casual choices.


The fit should not be tight and no cleavage should be showing.
Choose a color that complements your skirt. Unlike formal wear, you are free to inject some color and variety into your ensemble. Bright colors are acceptable.
Cotton, silk, and blends are appropriate fabrics. Avoid wearing velvet or shimmery fabric that you would wear to a party.

, Shoes should be made of leather, fabric, or micro-fiber.


Closed-toed shoes are the best conservative choices.
Shoes should be black, navy, brown, tan, or taupe. White and pastels are not business appropriate.
Sandals which are not too dressy and not too casual may be appropriate. Flat-soled shoes are also business casual.
Thin straps, spike heels, chunky heels, and platforms are not business appropriate.
Some non-professional jobs may require physical work or a lot of walking. In this situation, wearing athletic footwear may be acceptable. Remember to observe coworkers or consult with supervisors before wearing sneakers.

, It's normal to want to show off a nice watch or tie you have recently bought, but be judicial in what you wear to work.


Wear a conservative watch. Even if you can afford an expensive, shiny gold watch with diamonds in it, at work is not the right place to display it.
Wear a black or brown leather belt with a standard sized buckle. Large or customized belt buckles should not be worn in business settings.
If you have facial hair, be sure that you are well groomed every day. Wear your hair in conservative styles (no mohawks!).
Remove any piercings you may have. Earrings are generally viewed as inappropriate, especially in conservative industries.Use either a briefcase or business bag to carry your items in. You do not have to spend obscene amounts of money for a proper carrying case. Just make sure your bag looks like it belongs in a professional setting (no backpacks!).

, Remember that you are not at a fashion show, you are at your place of work.


Do not wear copious amounts of make-up. For a polished look, wearing some make-up is better than wearing none, but wearing too much make-up looks trashy and unprofessional.
If you choose to wear jewelry, be sure that it is conservative and tasteful (No anklets or choker necklaces!)Opt for studs instead of long, dangling earrings. Avoid wearing earrings that are especially bright or colorful. Only wear piercings in earlobes rather than in higher parts of the ear or on other parts of your body.
Use a business like tote-bag to carry documents and other items. If you also carry a purse, keep it small and simple so as to avoid carrying two large bags. If necessary, you can put your purse in your tote bag.
Wear your hair in a reasonable fashion. If you have really long hair, be sure to put it in a bun or ponytail so that it does not look messy. Avoid dying your hair extreme colors or styling it in overly elaborate ways as this will look distracting and unprofessional.
Keep your fingernails at a reasonable length. Avoid using false nails, especially ones that are excessively long. Paint your nails a consistent color that matches your outfit. Do not paint them unusual colors or paint alternate colors on each nail., You do not want to draw unnecessary attention to yourself.


Remove piercings that are not in your ears. Cover up any tattoos you may have as these can quickly become distractions and can sometimes offend customers or coworkers.
Not wearing cologne or perfume is the safest choice. If you do decide to wear cologne or perfume, be cautious when applying it. Too potent a scent can not only become a distraction, but an annoyance.
Scarves, hats, and other optional clothing should be conservative and high quality. Do not wear clothing that is brightly colored or that you knitted yourself.

Get a pair of boots.,
Slip on a pair of jeans.,
Don a hat.",How to Look Like a Cowboy1," One of the most identifiable elements of the cowboy style is a good leather boot with a hard wooden heel (Not actually wooden, is stacked leather). They can take some getting used to, since the heels and sharp toes are designed for fitting a on horseback. If you’re the kind of cowboy who doesn’t use his boots for much more than walking down the street, there are plenty of intricate and comfortable designs available.;
, When a cowboy is working, he needs pants that are both comfortable and durable. Most cowboys favor simple jeans, with straight legs or boot cuts.

, A hat is more than just an accessory for a cowboy – it performs essential functions. A cowboy hat is traditionally worn to keep a cowboy’s head cool, to keep the sun off of his face, and to keep flying dirt out of his eyes. Fancy designer hats are readily available, but a real cowboy prefers an old, worn in hat, whose shape has been formed only over years of hard and constant use. For a true cowboy hat, look for the Stetson or Bailey brands. Choose a beaver fur felt hat for cold weather, and a straw hat for the warmer seasons.

"
"
Wear a Western style shirt.,
Get a good belt and an even better buckle.,
Grow a mustache or a beard.",How to Look Like a Cowboy2," To advance your cowboy look, find a long-sleeved, button-down shirt, preferably with a plaid pattern. Thicker shirts, of course, can be worn in winter, and thinner shirts when it’s warm. Some cowboys do opt for a simple T-shirts, but rarely while working in the sun. Either way, the look should be rugged. Designer cowboy shirts might include some light embroidery, or a chest flap that snaps closed on one side.

, Many cowboys prefer wide leather belts with large metal buckles, which are often made of silver or brass. These may have ""western"" themes, or the cowboy’s initials, or they may just advertise for a favorite tobacco or beer company.

, Cowboys are like any other group of people - some wear facial hair, some don't. But working cowboys, who are often on the job from sun-up to sundown, don’t have much time for shaving.

"
"
Go outside.,
Skip the manicure.,
Get a duster.,
Strap on the chaps.,
Finished.

",How to Look Like a Cowboy3," Cowboys work outdoors, not in corporate offices, so their skin is tan, leathery, and coarse from wind and sun, which they often see twelve hours a day, six or even seven days a week.

, Cowboys don't spend a lot of time working on their fingernails, or trying to keep their hands baby-smooth and soft. Cowboy work makes for rough callouses and dirty nails. Cuts, bruises, and scars are regular sights on hands that spend their time working with fences, lassos, horseshoes, and other rough materials.

, A duster is a long leather jacket, usually with large buttons, and sometimes with fringe in various spots. The duster is most appropriate during cold weather or while traveling. Like most things cowboy, the larger buttons are practical – they’re much easier to use with gloves on. A sturdy leather vest is a good substitute when the weather is warm.

, Chaps are perhaps the most extreme of all the cowboy wear. Chaps provide extra protection and while working on horseback and at the rodeo. It’s not advisable to wear chaps in many other settings. The same probably goes for spurs.

Check out European clothing stores.",How to Dress European," European fashions are most easily recognized by their clean, simple lines. The cut of almost all pieces of clothing, from suits to dresses, have a sleek, geometric appearance. You should look for clothes that are similarly simple in shape, with clean, elegant lines.;
, North Americans tend to wear clothes that are too small or comically large. Europeans usually wear clothes that fit perfectly to their body. Some women may choose clothes, especially in the summer, that drape from their body, but some hint of their slim frame can still be seen. You should make sure that you are also choosing clothes that fit.


When Europeans get clothes that don't fit off the rack, they usually get them tailored. You should do the same! Tailoring is not as expensive as it seems, with items often costing around $30 or less to have altered.

, Bold patterns are not used so commonly by Europeans as they are by Americans. When Europeans do go for patterns on their clothes, the patterns are usually more detailed. They do like texture, and so you'll often see things like lace dresses and knit items, but patterns usually detract from the clean lines they by-and-large prefer.


You will sometimes see exceptions to this rule in the summer, when floral, ethnic, and island prints can come in to play (usually on dresses).

, Every season for roughly every year, there will be a set of colors that is in style and most new clothes you find will be from that group of colors. The colors that are in fashion in North America can often be very different than the colors that are popular in Europe, since Europeans tend to prefer a slightly different color palette than Americans. Usually, they tend to prefer neutral tones with highlights of bright, bold color.


For example, black and emerald green, beige and bright pink, or navy and white.
You can check out European fashion sites to see what colors are in fashion now.

, The color combinations that Europeans usually choose are high contrast, with one dark color and one lighter color.

, North American casual wear uses the same colors pretty much all year round. Europeans are much more likely to match the colors they wear to the season. This is a subtle cue, but if you want, you can go this extra mile.


Winter colors are subtle and lean more towards neutral tones.
Spring colors are a mix of brights and pastels.
Summer colors are bright and bold.
Fall colors are earthy and warm.

, This is the best place to start. Match your shoes to your handbag, choose a colored top that compliments the color of your pants, and generally put some thought into the overall look.

, This is another primary indicator of European vs. American style (and one that has barely changed, even with the popularity of American styles in Europe). Europeans tend to dress nicely, and would certainly never be caught in yoga pants or sweats outside of the house. Go slightly nicer than what you think you'd have to wear and you're probably in the neighborhood.

, Europeans wear outfits that are simple. They tend to shy away from the layering that Americans favor. Limit your accessories and the number of layers, and rely on simplicity.

, It is a myth that Europeans don't wear jeans. They do. Europeans lean more toward mid-toned jeans than we do, but in general any color is fair game. Right now, brightly colored skinny jeans are very popular in Europe and these style-color combinations are also easy enough to find in the US.


Skinny jeans are often paired with looser, longer tops and boots or flats.
Don't wear khakis. When Europeans go for light colored pants, they usually opt for white or beige jeans or slacks, not the distinctive twill fabric preferred by Americans. However, this is not an item that's a dead giveaway, so don't worry if you prefer khakis and have a hard time keeping them in your drawer.

, In general, Europeans avoid flare legs. Pants with holes or rips are also very American in style, although that look is popular in Europe right now.

, Women in Europe tend to wear skirts and dresses more often than American women, so don't be afraid to bring out these girly items. Leave the maxi dresses at home and favor shorter dresses with tights. (Maxi dresses are very American and almost never seen in European fashion.)

, Avoid anything remotely gaudy, big, fake or tacky. Choose, instead, low profile accessories that complement your outfits. Try to stick with understated pieces. Other than that, scarves, delicate hats, necklaces, and elegant jewelry are fine choices. If you're traveling, don't cart around a big, tourist-style backpack. Carry a side bag, LeSportsac bag, messenger bag, leather satchel or something of the sort. Add to that, a pair of sunglasses. Europeans go for the simpler, more elegant sunglasses. A pair of wooden framed, gradient Ray Bans would do the trick with any outfit.

, While business women and those above age 30 definitely can often be found wearing high heels (especially the French), the younger crowd are firmly in favor of flats. No matter the height, the style is always elegant and clean. Oxford flats are a common option for both genders.


The most common shoe for youth and 20-somethings, however, is generally the Converse All Star. Don't feel like your favorite basic sneakers are going to out you. Even the ""gangsta"" oversized sneakers are now in fashion in Europe among teens.

, You know those shirts with vintage style text logos or prints that make them seem like they're from the sport department of a fake university? That is a very American style. Avoid it if you want to dress in a European style.


However, such prints along with many American fashions are popular right now.

, The traditional, basic cut tee is a classically American style. Europeans do wear tee shirts, but they tend to be a little nicer. Often they will have a looser, more tailored fit, shorter sleeves, and a V neckline.

, Any clothes with decorative rips or holes are a giveaway American fashion. Though they are starting to come in fashion in Europe, especially among the younger crowd, they are generally seen as low fashion and should be avoided.

, Acid-washed and, in particular, whiskered jeans are seen as very American styles. These should be avoided as well.

, For Europeans, sweats are for wearing at home and while working out. That is it. You will not see very many Europeans doing their weekend grocery shopping in sweats. Even the rise in popularity of American styles has not led to a change in the wearing of extremely casual clothes like sweats, pajamas, and yoga clothes.

, Most Europeans use the same general fashion magazines that we do, like Vogue and Cosmopolitan, but they have their own special editions. Get a subscription to one of these if you want to stay current on European fashions.

, There are a number of great European fashion blogs which you can follow if you want to get inspiration for your next outfit.

, You can also check out the websites for common European stores. Some stores even have US locations, where you can just buy the clothes (the same clothes are sold in the US as are sold in Europe). Zara, H&M, and Kookai are the most popular stores for the under-35 crowd. Zara also carries clothes that are elegant enough for an older crowd.

Determine a color and material for the suit.,
Consider solids and pinstripes.,
Set a maximum price that you can reasonably afford to pay for a suit.,
Think about the style.,
Decide if you want custom made or off the rack.,
Compare suits at several different clothiers.,
Try on the ones you like best.",How to Buy a Suit for a Man," Most men find that a good quality navy blue or black suit will fit just about any occasion. In order to maximize the use of the suit, choose a fiber blend that will be more comfortable in warm weather, such as a cotton and wool combination.;
, Depending on your height and body type, a thin pinstripe weave for the suit may be very flattering. When in doubt, stick with the darker solid colors, since they tend to be appropriate for most occasions.

, You want a suit that will wear well for several years, so don't skimp on the quality in order to lock in a lower price. Be realistic with the amount, but try to keep the price range to a maximum that won't mean spending the next year paying off a credit balance.

, While trendy fashions of today are often tempting, what is hot today is likely to be out of fashion tomorrow. Stick with a style that is flattering to your body type and won't look dated when you dress up for a wedding or business meeting 2 years down the road.

, A custom suit is more expensive, but has the benefit of fitting more precisely to your body type. A ready-made suit can also look very good with minor alterations. If you happen to be a man of average height and build, off the rack may be both flattering and cost-effective.

, This can be done in person or online if the idea of spending a Saturday looking at suits isn't appealing. Comparing prices, colors, and other basics between several stores can help you decide which local shops to visit and make it easier to find the right suit in a short period of time.

, You want to get a sense of how the material feels, whether the jacket sleeves are long enough, whether the pants can be altered to fit properly and that the jacket hangs on your frame in a manner that looks crisp and professional. If the suit doesn't seem right for some reason, move on to your next choice.

Understand that a gamine is an innocent and childlike person.,
Find a gamine fashion icon and role model who appeals specifically to you.,
Gamines have simple hair.,
Keep the makeup modest but sweet.,
A gamine must always have bushy and perfectly-shaped eyebrows.,
Select your scent.,
Gamines must always have clean and neatly shaped short nails.,
Select quality clothes.,
Accessorize the gamine way.,
Find gamine lingerie.,
Stay slim and healthy.,
Live like a gamine.,
Please remember that these are all ideas that you can follow if you wish to, but it is up to you.",How to Dress in a Gamine Style," As a gamine, you might want to keep it quite simple, yet quite romantic. However, this doesn't mean you can't make your outfits more boyish if you prefer to, because, after all, a gamine is a 'street urchin' and a 'girl of impish appeal'. The gamine look is generally the opposite of sexy and sultry femme fatale, because it does refer to a girl, giving the idea of sweet and innocent. Some people feel as though a gamine's appeal lies in her charm, class and ladylike manners, which is something you might want to take up on, but a gamine is often quite boyish, and if you don't want to be so ladylike, don't feel forced into being so just because it's the 'gamine style'. Some gamine wardrobes consist of very romantic and quite girly sorts of things, whilst others are more androgynous. Whatever you chose to have is fine.;
, Every gamine's total fashion icon is definitely Audrey Hepburn. But there are many more. Twiggy, Jackie O, Leslie Caron and Edie Sedgwick are great examples. If you want someone modern as your fashion icon there are many other women too: Carey Mulligan, Winona Ryder, Audrey Tatou, Emma Watson and Natalie Portman are great gamines.

, The most popular gamine hairstyle is the pixie cut. But not all people look good in this hairstyle, so definitely consult your hairdresser before doing it because it will take time for your hair to grow back. If you want your hair long, it doesn't matter if it is straight, wavy, bouncy or curly. All that matters is that it is always kept neat. A very gamine-like hairstyle for girls with long hair is the ponytail. You can also wear it with a headband, a silk scarf, a ribbon, a hat (preferably a beret) or a barrette. If the hair accessory is in a pastel color or sports delicate accessories like bows, pearls, flowers hearts or embroidered butterflies, then it adds to the gamine-feel, but don't feel as though you have to go buy more accessories if they don't have these things on them.

, A gamine's makeup is always natural and rosy. Opt for pink and peachy shades, or the softest you can find. Gamines have baby-like flawless and soft skin, so be sure to cleanse, exfoliate, moisturize and put on sunscreen of at least 25 SPF. You can use liquid eyeliner and mascara to get the doe-eye look, which is common among gamines. Doe eyes are big and usually brown (like Bambi's) but it is definitely not necessary, as it is only eye colour. A great example of the doe eyes are those of Audrey Tatou in the movie Amélie. To get the look:


Gently apply some liquid eyeliner across the top lid, as close to the lash line as possible.
Elongate your eyes the most you can.
After the eyeliner, curl your eyelashes and apply mascara at the top lashes. Done! It is a simple look.
If you want, you can get brown contact lenses too.
Wear little or no eyeshadow and get rosy cheeks (apply blush at the apples of the cheeks only).
Finally, complete the look with glossy lips. Wear pink or peach lipstick or lip gloss.

, Make sure that the arch of your eyebrow is at the top of the iris of the eye to make it look more natural. Do not overpluck them; gamines are supposed to have pronounced eyebrows.

, A gamine must always have a signature scent. Gamines must waft a sweet fragrance as they walk by, so the perfect scent for a gamine can be floral, vanilla or fruity. The most gamine-like fragrance, in the opinion of some is Miss Dior Chérie by Christian Dior. Not only are the commercials for this perfume always gamine-like (with one even featuring a gamine, Natalie Portman), but it is a delightful scent with a lot of sweetness. Other fragrances gamines could consider are:


Lola by Marc Jacobs, Dolce & Gabbana Light Blue by Dolce & Gabbana, Romance by Ralph Lauren, L'Air du Temps by Nina Ricci, Anna Sui Flight of Fancy by Anna Sui, Gucci Flora by Gucci, Trésor by Lancome, Paul Smith Rose by Paul Smith, Daisy by Marc Jacobs, Joy by Jean Patou and L'Interdit by Givenchy. 

, The most gamine-like nail styles are the French manicure with floral designs and the nude or pink polish. Apply some silver or gold glitter if you want to. Just make sure that they look neat and not over-the-top.

, Clothes are a very important part of the gamine style. Here are the basics of every gamine wardrobe:


For tops, wear: blouses in pastel colors, white button-downs with ruffles, t-shirts with gamine designs and patterns (bows, flowers, butterflies, etc), pastel polo shirts, striped sailor shirts, cashmere sweaters in pastel colors, cardigans, blazers, cropped jackets, turtlenecks and boat-necked tops.
For dresses and skirts, wear: mini, knee-length or midi-skirts (preferably made of tulle or another flowing material), LBD's (little black dresses, even better if they have bows or flowers), A-line dresses, baby doll dresses, tunic dresses and sailor skirts.
For pants, wear: blue or black jeans, denim shorts, capri pants, pedal pushers and tailored wide-legged pants.
For outwear wear: trench coats, peacoats, collared coats and capes.
For shoes, wear: ballet flats, kitten heels, black pumps and a pair of heels in a soft color.
Wear pretty much anything that looks sweet, romantic, innocent and childlike.
Designers that carry many gamine pieces are: Christian Dior, Givenchy (his muse was Audrey Hepburn), Salvatore Ferragamo, Chloé, Ralph Lauren (Audrey Hepburn wore his polo shirts while volunteering with UNICEF) Alice+Olivia, Betsey Johnson, Thakoon, Moschino, Burberry, Marni, Marc Jacobs, Nanette Lepore, Chanel (although some of their pieces are too serious and cold for a gamine), Carolina Herrera, Phillip Lim, Jason Wu, Diane von Furstenberg, Kate Spade, Rodarte, Prada, Gucci (named a bag after Jackie O), Miu Miu, Vera Wang and Lanvin.
Cheaper places where you can find gamine-like pieces are: The GAP, J. Crew, Forever 21, MANGO, The Limited, Banana Republic, Zara, Charlotte Russe, Nine West, Macy's (you can find some designers like Ralph Lauren) and Century 21.
Designers to avoid are: Antik Batik (too bohemian), Pam Hogg (too tough), Dolce & Gabbana (too sexy), Yves Saint Laurent (too manly), Alexander McQueen (too complicated), Juicy Couture (although they have some gamine-like pieces, like charm bracelets and girly clothes; however, tracksuits and neon colors should be avoided), Versace (too bold), Alexander Wang (too street casual), L.A.M.B. (too trendy), Roberto Cavalli and Anna Sui.
Stores to avoid are: Old Navy, Spencer's Gifts (you will never, ever find a gamine there), Hot Topic, Desigual, Bebe, Sears (if the Kardashians do design collaborations there, then gamines stay away) and Abercrombie & Fitch (half-naked models are not for classy gamines).

, Accessorizing helps to make any look more gamine. Some accessories to consider are:


For hats: sunhats, berets, fedoras and derby hats. Or any hat that is in a pastel color or has bows, flowers or any gamine-like look.
For hair accessories: headbands, barrettes and hair elastics with charms.
For sunglasses: Wayfarer by Ray-Ban, aviator sunglasses and over-sized.
For jewelry: simple and small earrings and necklaces, anything with pearls, charm bracelets, rings with small stones or diamonds and avoid piercings at all times (except at the earlobes, of course, but only have one in each ear). Get a simple watch in a neutral color (or a pastel color) so it will go with any outfit. Don't get a digital watch, get the classic one.
For handbags: the smaller the better, any simple handbag will do, but a quilted handbag is the best. All the better if they have cute and girly accessories like charms, bows and flowers. For the night choose a clutch and for the day it can be anything as long as it is classic and simple.
Other accessories: thin belts, colorful silk handkerchiefs and anything sweet with gamine decorations is in.

, A gamine is charming and innocent inside and out, so a gamine's underwear must be childlike and not sexy at all. Nowadays, the more skin you show, the better. But a gamine is classy and sweet, so although it may be a little hard to find gamine-like underwear and nightwear, it is possible.


For bras, the paler the color the better. A gamine can wear bras of solid colors (preferably nude and white, or black when wearing LBD's), soft pastel colors (better if they have some lace of soft shades and/or a bow) and bralettes (if you can). Some very gamine-like patterns of bras that are widely available are the bras with a mini rose pattern and the vertically striped patterned bras. Avoid push-up bras; you're trying to be innocent.
For panties, opt for boyshorts, bikinis and hotpants (or even granny panties are ok! After all, a gamine doesn't need to be self conscious about her panties as she is not the kind of person who sits in a way that shows what is under her skirt). Again, they should not be sexy and you should avoid thongs and g-strings. It is better if your panties match your bra, so make sure that they are at least similar.
For nightwear, silk or cotton pajamas in girly patterns and colors are okay. If you prefer flowing nightgowns, wear negligees (don't worry, there are non-trashy negligees available too), babydoll nightgowns, nightshirts and silk robes (to wear on top of them). Make sure that they are not transparent (you do not want to show your underwear). Again, the girlier and sweeter, the better.
Although it may seem impossible, there are brands that carry sweet and innocent undergarments and nightwear. Cosabella is a great option and they are known for providing seriously comfortable underwear and nightwear. You can also find non-trashy stuff if you look closely at Victoria's Secret. If you're striving to find a negligee or nightgown that is not trashy, pay a visit to Nordstrom, they carry nice negligees of different brands and designers. You should definitely avoid Agent Provocateur and La Perla.

, Most gamines are slim with a boyish body. That means that they have as little fat as they can, but always in a healthy way. The gamine sport is riding a bicycle around town and walking (or skipping) while walking the dog. Gamines are supposed to adore sweet things. That means candy, chocolate, cookies and more sugary desserts. So the gamine diet is probably to eat all you desire in very small portions and to burn off the calories cycling or walking.

, Gamines not only dress the part, but they live it too. Here are some of the key elements:


Learn manners and the rules of etiquette. Begin with Emily Post's book on etiquette (Manners) and find suitable etiquette blogs to keep abreast of the changing manners in society.
Always try to be charming and pleasant to be with.
If you're dressing up as a sweet and innocent girl, don't act like a bombshell. Be as naive as you can be.
Gamines always have poise. If you have poor posture, fix it.
Gamines are always smiling a genuine smile.
Gamines are respectful and never break the rules.
Gamines are classy and ladylike, yet they still have a playful and light side.
Gamines have a wide vocabulary and they never swear (in public). Improve your vocabulary and use it to say what you really mean.
Gamines always think of others first.
Gamines always try to be as happy as they can and look at the bright side.
Gamines are the happily charming girls all girls secretly want to be like, but not in a way that they are hated––more like admired and loved.

, Every interpretation of gamine is different, and if you feel as though these ideas are too girly and sweet, don't be afraid to try something more your style and your own ideas.

Check out brands that make good, high quality snowsuits.",How to Buy a Child's Snowsuit," A one piece snowsuit is a complete piece of clothing, so it is very warm. It consists of pants, a jacket and a hood that are all attached. This suit can usually be closed in front. Some suits have openings at the feet while others have booties attached.If your child is just playing for a bit in cold weather, you can get them a one piece suit with openings at the feet. But if you feel it will be too cold outside for any openings, then get a suit with closed feet. That way the suit will be more resistant to the cold weather.;
, The one piece snowsuit can also get quite hot for very active children, so it is best worn by children who are not old enough to be very active outside., The cotton material will not irritate your child’s skin. The idea is to layer them up comfortably.


If your child is wearing a one piece suit without openings at the feet, shoes are not necessary.
For a suit without booties, make sure your child wears shoes.

, Although this type of snowsuit is very warm and provides good insulation for your child, it is quite difficult for you to get your child out, especially if your child needs to get to the bathroom quickly.


Infants and younger children will not have much of a problem as they will be wearing diapers.
Some one piece snowsuits will have a zipper that runs all the way down the front, making it easy for your child to go to the bathroom and change their clothes., As children need to keep warm while playing, this suit is thick enough to shield them from the harsh conditions. But, this type of suit can also regulate heat better as there are more openings.This kind of outfit consists of trousers and a bib in front that goes all the way up to your child’s chest, quite similar to a pair of dungarees.
The trousers also come with suspenders that are strapped to the shoulder parts to make sure the pants do not fall down, similar to overalls. Unlike the one piece snowsuit, this one has openings at the feet.
There is also a jacket that goes separately with the outfit. The jacket comes with a hood to ensure that your child’s head is warm and toasty. If your child gets too hot, they can also simply take the jacket off.

, To go to the bathroom, they just have to unhook the bib and take off the jacket.

, Any other material can be scratchy and uncomfortable for your child.


Your child can wear this suit similar to wearing an ordinary coat. You can let your child wear pants similar to long johns as part of the inner wear.
Make sure to get good snow boots for your child as this kind of outfit does not come with booties.

, One of the drawbacks of this type of suit is that your child could get cold a lot faster and easier as there are more openings on the suit. These openings make them more susceptible to wind and snow while they play.


Because the suit can be easily taken off by older children, some children like to take it off and not put it back on again. So keep an eye on your child if they are wearing this type of suit outside as you do not want them to be exposed to the cold for too long without a suit or due to the openings in the suit.

, Most snowsuit manufacturers label the snowsuit with a temperature range based on the material of the suit.

, Among all types and brands of snowsuits, this is the most common material used. It’s great for children as it dries quickly but isn’t very expensive.

, Though suits made from polyester are affordable and lightweight, they are not immune to getting wet.


This material will keep your child warm but they may get too hot if they wear a polyester suit and run around outside for a long time.
While polyester is a common snowsuit filling, it won’t keep your child very warm in extremely cold temperatures., This material will keep your child sufficiently warm and is also more flexible and less expensive than other fillers like polyester or down., If you get a two piece snowsuit with a flannel jacket, you will need to make sure your child wears more layers underneath the jacket.


Flannel is usually used as the lining in your child’s jackets and snowsuits.

, This material is quite hard to come by as it is costly, but if you can find a suit made of down and can afford it, your child will be very warm while playing outside. Down insulates very well but it is a heavier material.Down is mostly used as a lining for your child’s suits to ensure full insulation.
Keep in mind down loses its warming power if it gets wet, so look for a snowsuit made of water-repellant down.

, Fleece is a heavy lining found in some snowsuits and is great for keeping your child warm in cold temperatures. But they will sweat and this could make them uncomfortable.

, However, this material insulates well, is lightweight, and very comfortable to wear.

, A child who gets wet through their snowsuit is not only uncomfortable, but also unsafe in very cold conditions.


If your child will be wearing a snowsuit and playing outside for most of the day, look for a lining that wicks away moisture to keep them warm and comfortable.Keep in mind there are some snowsuits that come with liners that can be removed. This way, you can adjust the suit based on temperature and ensure your child is comfortable.

, This will create space for any extra layers of clothing your child may wear underneath the snow suit.Even if the snowsuit is slightly too large, your child should still be able to easily use their hands and to walk without tripping on their pant legs.

, This way, you can tell if it fits correctly and is comfortable.


A snowsuit should allow children to move freely and wear layers underneath, but it shouldn’t be so baggy it causes them to trip or allows cold air to get in.

, This will prevent snow and cold air from getting into the snowsuit.Many higher-end snowsuits come with features that allow the snowsuit to grow with your child, such as extendable sleeves or a convertible waist band., Long underwear is a good insulator of heat that can be worn under regular clothing or under a snowsuit.Make sure your child is wearing cotton long underwear if they are planning to go outside for a long period of time in cold weather.
Long johns can get very hot during mild or warmer days so only put them on your child when they are venturing out into colder temperatures.

, Do this regardless of whether the snowsuit comes with booties or without booties.


Only put one one pair of socks on your child feet. Make sure the socks are made of wool, a wool blend with silk or with polypropylene. These materials ensure there is good insulation should your child come in contact with snow.
Look for socks that are not too tight around your child’s feet or too thick, as socks that are too tight and thick could restrict blood flow and air circulation around their toes.

, Most snowsuits have hoods, but to be sure your child’s head stays warm, get them a wool hat with good insulation.


A lot of kids do not like things covering their heads or keeping a hat on. So, always make sure your child’s head is covered, especially when they play outside or when they are exposed to cold air.

, You can purchase a tube shaped scarf instead of a standard long one to prevent the scarf from getting caught in their suit or from strangling them.

, Gloves do not fit little baby hands very well, so use mittens for them instead. Gloves and mittens will keep your child’s hands insulated, especially when they are playing outside.


Make sure you have several pairs of gloves or mittens ready in case one pair gets wet or your child loses one pair.

, Put them on your child’s feet once they are in the snowsuit and have socks on. Boots will keep your kids’ feet warm and dry.


Ensure the boots fit your child properly and are tied on securely so they don’t fall off while they are playing.

, A brick and mortar store is the easiest place to buy a snowsuit, as you can go into several stores and examine the snowsuits available. You can also bring your child with you so they can try on the snow suit before you buy it.

, The websites for stores like Carter’s, the Gap, and Sportchek will display the snowsuits they have in stock. This way, you can choose from a wide selection of snowsuits without having to leave the comfort of your home.


There are usually size charts on the store’s website. Just make sure your child’s size corresponds to the measurements for the waist, hips and weight of the snowsuit.
Websites usually have promos and discount codes, so check the sale section and look for any ads for discounts on the site to save money.

, This is a great place to shop for deals on a snowsuit as many people post their children’s old snowsuits at low prices, especially during the off season.Look for snowsuits for sale that are barely worn.
Make sure you read the description to see if the suit fits what you want for your child.
Always check the seller’s feedback to ensure you won’t be ripped off or scammed.

, These are practical, affordable sources for a snowsuit, as children tend outgrow their clothing, including their snowsuits, very quickly. It might be impractical to spend a lot of money on a suit if your child will only be wearing it for a short period of time.

, Children tend to play rough so their clothes might get torn or worn. You do not want your child’s snowsuit to fall apart as they are playing, especially if the weather is too cold.


Check for any frayed threads or missing buttons before buying a snowsuit.

, A lot of suits come with openings that have zippers that run all the way down to a child’s ankles or knees. This makes it easy to take off if you need to change your child’s diapers or bring your child to the bathroom.


Try to get a suit with Velcro fasteners. That way you can just take the suit off quickly. Avoid suits with elaborate openings.
If you are buying a snowsuit for an older child, make sure the zippers and buttons can be maneuvered easily by your child.

, There are several brands that are good to buy from, including:


Columbia. This is one of the most renowned brands when it comes to snowsuits. With their patented technology, the material used for their snowsuits allow proper regulation and retention of body heat. Their snowsuit material is also breathable, making this brand one of the best choices for very active children.
Arizona. Not only are their suits affordable, they also have good choices for wind resistant and water repellant materials. Most kids love this brand as they are not bulky.
Oshkosh B’gosh. A subsidiary of Carter’s, this brand is one of the most commonly used among children. Their snowsuits give good insulation, but are not overly thick, so they are perfect for cool weather. But if you are looking for a very thick snowsuit, this brand may not provide enough insulation.
Spyder Boys. If you are looking for a snowsuit that is good for playing outdoor sports, then purchase one from this brand. Their suits are designed to withstand the extreme conditions of the weather while playing outdoors. They are made of breathable and waterproof materials, and they have great insulation that is also lightweight.

Know your body type.,
Learn the basic suit types.,
Look for a suit made of wool.,
Know the available suit patterns.,
Get your measurements.,
Try on several suits to check the fit.,
Evaluate the suit's quality.",How to Buy a Suit," Men's bodies can be broadly categorized into certain types. The kind of suit you select should compliment your body type by accenting its strengths and minimizing its weaknesses.


Bulky men should choose fitted suits with lightweight fabrics that make them look slimmer, with dark colors in either solid or vertical pinstripes. The suit jacket should have 2 buttons and a single vent (slit) in the rear.
Tall and skinny men, in contrast, should choose light-colored suits with heavier fabrics that keep their shape while adding weight to the wearers' frames, such as a tweed or worsted wool. The suit jacket can have 3 buttons and either a single vent or no vent at all. (Tall men can also wear double-breasted suit jackets if they wish.) The pants should have a longer rise (distance between the waistband and crotch) to balance the proportion of their legs to their upper bodies.
Short men can choose whatever suit fabrics they wish but should avoid loud patterns. Vertical stripes, however, make them appear taller by drawing the eye upward. The suit jacket can have either 1 or 2 buttons, but with a vent on either side to add the illusion of length. The pants should have a low rise to make the upper body appear longer by comparison.;
, Suits can be defined in 1 of 4 basic types: the double-breasted Italian suit; the single-breasted, regal-looking British or English suit; the relaxed, young-looking American suit and the Oriental-styled Mandarin suit.

, There are other suit fabrics, such as cashmere or linen, cotton and silk for hot weather, but for most conditions, most of the time, you'll want a woolen suit.


Suit fibers are rated by a ""super number,"" which represents how fine the fibers woven into the suit are. The higher the number, the thinner the fibers, the thinner and smoother the fabric, and the more expensive the suit is. Too fine a fiber wrinkles and wears faster than a thicker fiber, however.

, Suit patterns can be classified as 1 of 5 types:


Solid color suits are all one color, with no discernible pattern.
Pinstripes are thin, vertical, evenly spaced lines in a color contrasting that of the suit, usually lighter than the background color. Their actual width may vary from suit to suit, but they usually convey an air of authority on the wearer.
A window pane pattern is a square or rectangular pattern made using widely spaced horizontal and vertical stripes to provide a stylish look.
A check pattern suit is like a window pane pattern but has the horizontal and vertical lines more densely packed.
Plaid is a check pattern with usually bolder colors. Plaid suits often cost more because of the material and tailoring required for the pattern to look right on the wearer's body.

, To insure the suit you buy fits you, you need to know several important measurements. You can either be measured in the store or by a friend with a measuring tape.


For the suit jacket to fit correctly, you need to know your chest and sleeve measurements. You can obtain the chest measurement by sticking your arms out to your sides and having someone wrap the measuring tape around your chest, just above your nipples. You can obtain your sleeve size by measuring from your shoulder to your wrist.
For the pants to fit correctly, you need to know your waist and inseam measurements. You can obtain the waist measurement by wrapping the measuring tape around your waist. You can obtain your inseam size by measuring from your crotch to your ankles, or by measuring from your waist to your ankles and subtracting 11 inches (28 centimeters).

, If you're shopping in a brick-and-mortar store, try on several suits that interest you and look at them in a full-length mirror to see how they hang on your body.


The suit collar should hang such that a quarter inch of your shirt collar shows when you stand. The shoulders should be padded only enough that your shoulders slope naturally when wearing the suit, not so that they droop or dent the suit material.
The jacket's armholes should be positioned so that you can raise your arms over your head without the jacket riding up, and its sleeves should let half an inch of your shirt sleeves show.
The bottom button is only for decoration; it should never be buttoned when you wear the suit.
Pants should sit at the waist and fit the crotch without bulging. The pant legs should cover the legs without bulging, resting at the top of the shoes with only a small gap.
If you can't try the suit on, you can measure it for fit. In addition to taking the same measurements you took for chest, sleeve, waist and inseam, you'll also need to measure the shoulder width and vertical length of the jacket.

, A good suit should be made with quality materials and workmanship. You should be able to squeeze the fabric without causing more than minimal wrinkles and gently tug the buttons without them feeling loose.

Before she popularized the black dress in the 1920s, it was mostly used for mourning periods., Choose pants that fit the current fashion trends, but be willing to try high-waisted and mid-rise versions in white. She wore these pants with espadrilles in the summer.

, This should include a jacket without a collar and a pencil skirt. The jacket often featured a ribbon trim.


Thanks to Chanel and Jackie Kennedy Onassis, these tweed suits are still sold today. The most elaborate versions include a matching hat.

, Knits were not considered fashionable for the upper class until Chanel took them on. Take advantage of their prevalence in fashion today by combining knits with other textured fabrics, like tweed and denim.

, Coco Chanel wore single and multiple strands of pearls as an everyday accessory.

, Often in black and white or pastels, Coco Chanel’s pillbox hats were structural and often matching the rest of a woman’s outfit perfectly.

, Chanel’s jewelry always made a statement. Not every piece of jewelry needs to be expensive; however, statement pieces were also a big part of her design., She was often seen with studs, necklaces and rings.

, A great pair of heels is the icing on the cake. Shine the shoes and keep them well heeled. Patent leather is a great choice for work or evening wear.


Coco Chanel is quoted saying “A woman with good shoes is never ugly.”

, Chanel believed in embracing new fashion and trying unusual combinations. She believed fashion was made to eventually become unfashionable, so take chances.

, This was her favorite color combination, as shown by her little black dress. Color blocking hats, scarves, sweaters, shirts, pants, shoes and coats creates definition and classic style.


Once you have color blocking perfected with black and white, start adding brighter colors.

, Coco Chanel said, “Fashion is architecture. It is a matter of proportions.” She liked jackets, purses, skirts and hems with straight lines.A cropped coat or a blazer can instantly add a designer look to an outfit.

, It doesn’t have to be a Chanel fragrance, but it should be something that defines you as much as your clothing. Consider switching fragrances between summer and winter."

An evening reunion might invite a cocktail dress, while a casual sundress and sandals might be more appropriate for a reunion in the late afternoon., Before you choose an outfit for your class reunion, you should consider where the event is being held. A reunion at the local pub might lend itself to a more casual outfit, like jeans and a button down shirt. A reunion at a fancy restaurant, however, might mean donning a fancier, more refined getup., Make sure you look at the weather forecast before you choose an outfit to wear to your class reunion. This will help you plan an outfit that is suitable for the climate and season. You would not, for example, want to be stuck wearing a three piece suit in triple digit weather."

Wear your jacket.,
Wear your jacket even when you don't need to.,
Use unconventional forms of wear and tear.,
Consider carefully using a mild abrasive.,
Use leather conditioner to remove stiffness from dried-out leather.",How to Break in a Leather Jacket1," A leather jacket will naturally break in over time from the minor day-to-day stresses of simply wearing it. If you want to break your jacket in as quickly as possible, make it a part of your outfit every day!


Note that activities that cause you to move, bend, and put gentle stress on the jacket break it in more than those that don't. For instance, wearing your jacket on a day you go on a hike will wear it more than a day you're stuck typing at a computer.;
, You don't only have to wear your jacket when you're out and about. In fact, wearing it when you ordinarily wouldn't (like when you're lounging around the house) will break it in even faster. Be careful about wearing it for rough or messy activities, though — nicks, stains, and tears can be difficult to fix on a leather jacket (though, with the right approach, it's still possible.)Wearing your jacket for the following activities (and others) will break it in faster:


If you really want to make the most of your time, you can even wear your leather jacket when you're sleeping to break it in for an extra eight hours each day, as long as it's not too uncomfortable to let you get to sleep.

, Depending on the type of hide they're made from, leather jackets can be surprisingly durable. To break your jacket in quickly, you can try giving it wear-and-tear from activities besides being worn. Here are just a few things you may want to do to break in your jacket faster:Bunch it up and use it as a pillow or backrest.
Wrap it around you as a blanket.
Tie it up in a bundle and play ball with it.
Carry things in it, using the sleeves as handles (do not use especially heavy objects)
Use it to help you gently stretch your arms and legs

, Some (but not all) leather care resources suggest using abrasives to wear down especially rough or stiff spots on the leather jacket.If you want to attempt this method, work slowly and stop to check your work often. Leather is harder to repair than other fabrics, so gouging or otherwise damaging your leather can leave it with a permanent mark.


Opt for a gentler abrasive, like mild steel wool, high-grit sandpaper, or a nylon abrasive pad. Using something harsher, like rough sandpaper, can cause more wear than you intended.
The high-wear spots on the joints (elbows, shoulders) and around the seams are good targets. Keep in mind, however, that this method will actually wear away at the leather.

, It's easy to forget that leather is made from an animal's skin — if it dries out, it can stiffen and even crack (just like human skin.) If your leather jacket is stiff, cracked, or flat-looking, a little conditioner can help soften and protect it, making it more comfortable to wear as a side effect.


Leather conditioner can be bought at specialty shops and online for fairly cheap (usually $15-$30 per liter.)Good brands include Pecard, Lexol, Leather Honey, and others.
Be sure to use a conditioning product that's suitable for your jacket's type of leather. Leather generally comes from one of four sources, each with its own texture: cattle, lamb, goat, or horse. Conditioners are usually formulated specifically for certain types of leather and not for others. Lighter fashion lotions are usually best for softer lamb and goat skins, while heavier all-weather conditioners are often best for cow and horse skin.

"
Wear your jacket for a walk in light rain.,
Move around while the jacket is wet.,
Let the jacket dry on you.,
If you don't have rain, use a spray bottle.,
Alternatively, use a washcloth.",How to Break in a Leather Jacket2," It's common knowledge that leather gets a little stretchy when wet.As long as you don't go overboard with the wetness, you can use this fact to your advantage to help break in you new jacket. One easy way to do this (while getting a little exercise at the same time) is to go for a short walk with your jacket while it's raining lightly or drizzling. The raindrops should get your jacket just wet enough for it to become pliant, but not so wet as to damage it.


Obviously, you shouldn't wear your leather jacket during a rainstorm. Too much water can stain, warp, or damage your leather permanently.

, Before the leather dries, take the opportunity to stretch it out a little. Bend your elbows, windmill your arms, and shrug your shoulders. You can even run, bend, jump, do pushups, or dance around to be sure all of the leather gets stretched. Physical movement is the key here — anything that starts creasing your jacket at the joints is good.

, Get out of the rain and into a dry indoor place. Keep wearing the jacket for a few hours until it dries naturally. As the water evaporates, the stretched-out damp leather will slowly shrink until it's completely dry. Since you're wearing the jacket, this will cause it to contract around you, breaking it in and giving it a fit that's unique to you.If you have to take your jacket off while it dries, stuff it with bunched-up clothes so that it doesn't shrink.

, Obviously, the water is what's important in this method — not where it comes from. If you don't want to wait for it to rain, just put a little water in a spray bottle and give your leather jacket a light spritzing all over. Wear the jacket while it dries as normal. Be careful not to use too much — remember, you're trying to simulate a gentle drizzle, not a downpour.


If you accidentally spray enough to make drips, just use a towel to remove the excess water. The leather won't be damage if you don't let it sit in prolonged contact with water.

, Another way to apply moisture to a leather jacket is to do it by hand. Soak a washcloth in water, then wring it well so that it's just slightly damp. Gently rub it across the leather, taking your time and touching every part of the jacket.

"
"
Don't soak your jacket.,
Don't break in your jacket with excessive force.,
Don't ignore your jacket's care label.",How to Break in a Leather Jacket3," As mentioned above, the methods for breaking in a leather jacket that use moisture all have one important caveat: don't use too much. Soaking leather can cause serious damage. Once it dries, the microscopic fibers that make it up can be stripped of their oils, leaving you with a stiffer, drier product.Prevention is the best fix here: whenever possible, do your best to keep your leather from getting too wet.


Be cautious of methods that recommend you send the jacket through the washer and dryer. While the dryer will obviously dry the leather quickly, preventing long-term damage, this can still cause noticeable shrinkage and change the texture and appearance of the jacket.
If your leather does get wet, try wiping it gently with a towel, then applying a layer of leather conditioner over the soaked leather to replace its oils as it dries., Leather is an exceptionally durable clothing material, but once it's damaged, it's hard to repair. Keep this in mind as you break your jacket in — while nearly all leather jackets will be able to handle a certain amount of wear and tear, you should never intentionally do anything that can tear, cut, gouge, or otherwise damage the leather. If you do, you may be wearing the jacket with these marks for a long time.


Keep in mind that leather jackets made from lamb and goatskin tend to be softer and more delicate than cow and horse skin jackets.
Tears along seams may be able to be stitched up (see our article on mending seams). However, tears in the middle of a piece of leather can require glue or patches.

, When in doubt about how to treat any garment, including a leather jacket, look for clues on the garment itself. Usually, this will be in the form of a small tag or label somewhere on the inside with care instructions stitched in. Every jacket is different — some may even be made in such a way that the instructions in this article aren't safe for use on them. When in doubt, follow the instructions on the care label, not the ones given here.

Mix up a mild soap solution.,
Wet a soft towel or sponge.,
Wipe down the outside of the jacket.,
Clean off the soap and pat the jacket dry.",How to Clean a Leather Jacket1," Run a few ounces of warm water into a large, open container. Add about two teaspoons of liquid dish detergent and stir until the soap is completely dissolved. The goal is to produce a very gentle solution you can use to wipe down your jacket without damaging it.Too much detergent can cause leather to deteriorate and strip it of dyes, resulting in a blotchy, discolored appearance.;
, Submerge the towel or sponge in the soapy solution. Wring out the excess liquid. The towel or sponge shouldn’t be sopping wet, just damp. If it’s too wet, the water can soak into and saturate the leather, potentially causing even more damage.


Use a soft cloth. Rough fabrics may leave scratches on soft leather if you’re not careful.

, Run the damp towel or sponge in long, smooth motions rather than forcefully scrubbing. Pay particular attention to water spots, discolored patches and places where dirt or oil have built up on the leather. Clean the entire jacket, re-wetting the towel when needed., Wipe the jacket again, this time using clean water to clear away any soap residue. Make sure there’s no standing water remaining on the jacket. With a dry towel, pat the leather until it is completely dry.

Some leather cleaners are gels, sprays, or bars. If you’re using any of these other kinds, always start with a minimal amount of cleaner and apply more as needed.

, Take a soft, clean towel and massage the leather cleaner into the surface of the jacket. Use slow circular strokes, rubbing outward in a spiral. As you work the cleaner in, it will collect dirt and remove water spots that have set into the leather.Rub until the cleaner has been absorbed entirely.

Treat your jacket with leather conditioners.,
Have soft leathers professionally cleaned.,
Store your jacket properly.",How to Clean a Leather Jacket3," Read the label inside the jacket.

This may be too harsh for soft or thin leather, but will work like a charm on sturdy, rugged jackets., To avoid damaging them, do not clean jackets made of soft or textured leathers like lamb or suede at home. A qualified leather expert will have the knowledge and equipment to rid your jacket of even the most stubborn stains, and you won’t have to worry about tearing or shrinking the leather.Dry cleaning leather isn’t cheap, but under most circumstances you won’t need to have it done more than once a year or so.
Suede jackets can be kept clean by dusting them regularly with a hand brush.

, Keep your jacket laid out or draped on a hanger when you’re not wearing it. Put it in a cool, dry place. Clean and condition the jacket once a year. As long as you take good care of your leather jacket, it will stay in top condition for years and years, and may even outlast you.If you don’t wear your leather jacket very often, put it in a garment bag.

Make the first folds.,
Make the second fold.,
Make the third fold.,
Tuck the final fold.",How to Wear a Pancha Kachcham1," There are different ways of wrapping and tying a dhoti, and Brahmins have a special variation of their own.

Make sure the colored bands are at the top (at your waist) and facing outward.;
, Wrap the fabric from the back to the front so that you're holding the material in front of your body. Arrange the cloth so that you have equal amounts of fabric on the right and left sides.


With the material from the left side, pull the cloth taut and wrap it around your waist. Hold the cloth at your right hip, letting the excess drape down your side to the ground.
Wrap the material from the right side around your waist and hold it at your left hip. Pull the material so it’s snug around your waist.
At the waist, fold the material down by about an inch (2.5 cm). Then fold it again by another inch to hold it in place., A defining characteristic of the dhoti is the accordion-style pleats, called kosuval, that you create by folding and tucking the cloth. To make the first fold:


Pick up the top layer of material that’s hanging from your left hip.
Hold the material straight out in front of you.
Make a two- to four-inch (five- to 10-cm) vertical fold in the end of the material to fold the fabric back on itself toward your body.
Make a second accordion-style fold in the material in the same way. Continue making folds like this until you’ve made about six accordion folds in the fabric.
Tuck the top three or four inches (7.5 to 10 cm) of the folded material into the waistband of the cloth., Lean down and pick up the bottom corner of the material you just folded in to your waistband. Smooth out the fabric so it isn't twisted.

Tuck the top three or four inches (7.5 to 10 cm) of the folded material into the waistband of the cloth, on top of the first fold., Lift up the layers of material that you just folded and tucked in to your waistband, so you can access the loose material at the right side of your body. Pull the material out in front of you. Let go of the material that you already folded and tucked in.


Hold the material from the right side of your body in front of you. Smooth it out so it isn't twisted or bunched up.
Hold the corner of the fabric and orient it so the decorative band on the horizontal edge is vertical in front of you.
Make about 10 accordion folds in the fabric, until you have folded the entire vertical panel of fabric.
Flatten and smooth out the material so the folds are neat and straight., The final fold gets tucked into the back of the waistband. Bring the folded material through your legs, making sure to go underneath the rest of the cloth.


Grab the folded material from the back and pull it out so it’s over the top of the cloth wrapped around your waist. Make sure the material hasn’t become twisted.
Bring the top of the folds to your waist and tuck the top three or four inches (7.5 to 10 cm) of the fold into the waistband of the cloth.The fabric going between your legs should be snug, but not tight or painful.

Tuck the fold into your waist at the back.,
Make the front fold.,
Tuck in the pleated material again for extra decoration.",How to Wear a Pancha Kachcham2," The Vrindavan-style is another way of wrapping, tying, and folding the pancha kachcham. It’s often the method used by members of the Hare Krishna.


Hold the fabric horizontally behind you.
Wrap the fabric around your hips and waist, and bring it to the front of your body.
Adjust the fabric so you have equal amounts of fabric on the right and left sides., Pull the fabric taut around your body. Hold the fabric so that you’ve got just enough to wrap around your body. At your navel, tie a knot in the fabric.


Let the rest of the fabric hang loose in front of you., Grab the fabric from the left side. Holding the top left corner of the fabric, reach down and grab the bottom left corner. Let go of the top corner.


Make four-inch (10-cm) accordion pleats in the fabric.
Fold the material back toward the top left corner, so that you fold the entire vertical panel of the fabric back on itself.

, Hold on to the folded fabric so the folds don’t come undone. Pull the material through your legs, making sure to go under the fabric behind your legs.


Tuck the top four inches (10 cm) of the folded fabric into the waistband of the fabric at the center of your back., Grab the fabric on the right side of the knot. Hold the top right corner of the material. Make about six vertical accordion pleats in the fabric, so that you're folding the material back on itself toward your body.


Center the folded material at your waist and tuck the top four inches into the waistband of the fabric., Grab the first two layers of material from the pleated fabric at your front. Hold the layers at the height of your upper thigh. Fold the material up toward your waist and tuck a few inches into the waistband.


When you tuck in the extra fold, tuck it in slightly off-centre, to the left of the original fold."

Wash the clothes less.No matter how special you treat your black clothes and how many precautions you take when washing them, the washing cycle itself wears the dye down, eventually causing it to show signs of fading.,
Sort with like colors.,
Turn the garments inside out.,
Use cold water.,
Stick with the shortest cycle possible.Essentially, just as you should wash your black clothes as infrequently as possible, you should also make those washing cycles as brief as possible.,
Add a specialized detergent.,
Skip the dryer.,
Add a little vinegar.During the rinse cycle, add 1 cup (250 ml) of white distilled vinegar.,
Try salt.,
Use a sprinkle of pepper.,
Shake baking soda into the washer.,
Harness the power of coffee or tea.Brew 2 cups (500 ml) of coffee or black tea.",How to Keep Black Clothes from Fading," To limit the effects of fading, you should only wash your black clothes when necessary. If you can skip a washing here or there, do so to preserve the integrity of the dye.


Black pants and sweaters worn over other layers of clothing can usually be worn up to four or five times before needing to be put through the wash, especially if the clothes are only worn indoors. Similarly, if you only wear the garment for a few hours a day, it can likely be set aside and worn again without going through a washing cycle.
Note, however, that black undergarments and socks should be washed after one wearing.
In between washings, you can treat stains with stain remover and eliminate chalky residue from deodorant with a dry sponge.;
, Whenever possible, wash your black clothes with other black clothes or with other dark garments. Dye has a tendency to run during the washing cycle, but if there are no lighter garments to soak of the dark dyes, those dyes will be reabsorbed back into the black clothes they came from.


Aside from separating clothes according to color, you should also separate them according to weight. Doing so can protect the weave and color of your more delicate black garments.

, The surface of the fabric directly exposed to the abrasive washing cycle is the surface that will receive the most wear. As a result, the dye will fade first on the surface always facing out during the laundry. Preserve the outside of black clothing by turning each garment inside out before you wash it.


Black color fades due to the friction that results when clothes rub against each other in the washing machine.
More precisely, friction causes the fibers to break, and the ends of those fibers are exposed. Since the surface of the fabric is disrupted, the human eye sees less color, even when no dye has actually been lost.
You can further reduce the amount of abrasion and friction your clothes experience by closing zippers and fastening any hooks.

, Warm water encourages dye to loosen from the fibers and bleed, so bright colors and black clothes tend to fade faster when washed in warm temperatures. Washing these garments in cold water, on the other hand, can preserve the dye longer.


Warm water breaks down fibers, which is why the colors fade faster in warm wash cycles.
Your cold water cycle should use water ranging between 60 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit (15.6 and 26.7 degrees Celsius) and no warmer.
Note that you may need to change your laundry habits during cold winter weather. Freezing cold outdoor temperatures can cause the water temperature of your washing machine to drop below 40 degrees Fahrenheit (4.4 degrees Celsius). In temperatures this low, even liquid detergents may not be entirely effective. If the temperature outdoors drop below 0 degrees Fahrenheit (-17.8 degrees Celsius), you should consider using a warm water wash and a cold water rinse.

, The less time your clothes spend in the washing machine, the less chance the dye has to run and fade.


A delicate cycle works well when in doubt, but as a general rule, you should still choose settings that are appropriate based on how soiled the clothes are and the type of fabric the clothes are made from.

, Nowadays, there are special detergents that are formulated for use with dark fabrics. These detergents help hold the dye in place during the washing cycle, so that dye is less likely to run and the clothes are less likely to fade.


If you do not use a detergent labeled for dark colors, use one formulated for cold water loads. These detergents can partially neutralize the chlorine in tap water, which is important since chlorine bleaches and lightens black clothes.
Note that detergents do not necessarily contribute to fading, even though some help prevent it more than others. Any liquid detergent is suitable, but you should not use any bleach.
Liquid detergents work better than powder detergents in cold water. Powders tend not to dissolve completely in cold water, especially when you use a short cycle.

, Heat is the enemy when you are trying to prevent black clothes from fading. Black clothes should be hung to dry or laid flat to dry. Avoid using the dryer unless absolutely necessary. If you must use the dryer, skip the fabric softener sheet if possible.


When you line dry black clothes outside, make sure that you place them in an area away from the sun. Sunlight acts as a natural bleach, which will fade your black clothes faster.
If you do need to use the dryer, use the lowest temperature possible based on the type of material the clothes are made from. You should also watch the clothes carefully to make sure that they do not become over-dry or too warm. Remove the clothes while they are still slightly damp to be on the safe side.

, Add the vinegar directly to the washing machine basin containing the black clothes; do not add it to the detergent slot, if a separate slot exists.


Adding vinegar to the rinse cycle has several benefits, including those that pertain to preserving black clothes. This household miracle fix can set colors and also strip fabric of detergent residue. That residue can otherwise create a film on your clothes, making the color appear faded.
Vinegar is also a natural clothing softener.
The vinegar should evaporate during the rinse cycle, so usually, no smell will be left behind. If a smell does linger, however, air drying the clothes should get rid of it.

, Add 1/2 cup (125 ml) of table salt to the wash cycle alongside your black clothes. The salt should be placed directly in the main tub of the machine and not in a separate compartment.


Salt can help prevent color dyes, including black dye, from bleeding. It is especially helpful when used on new clothes, but it can help restore the color of old clothes by rubbing off detergent residue.

, Simply add 1 to 2 tsp (5 to 10 ml) of black pepper into the washing machine tub along with the black clothes at the start of the wash cycle. Do not add any to a separate detergent compartment if one exists.


The abrasiveness of black pepper strips away residue responsible for some of the fading, and the black tint of the pepper can help strengthen the dark hue of the dye.
The black pepper should wash out during the rinse cycle.

, Sprinkle 1/2 cup (125 ml) baking soda to the washing machine tub after you fill it with the black clothes you want to preserve. The baking soda should be in the same portion of the machine as the clothes. Wash the load of laundry as usual from that point on.


Baking soda is commonly used to help brighten whites as a form of non-chlorine bleach. As a non-chlorine bleach, however, it can also be used to brighten other colors, including black.

, Add this liquid directly to the rinse cycle after the black clothes in your washing machine have already gone through the washing cycle.

Coffee and black tea are both used as natural dyes. Even though they dye light fabrics brown, on black fabrics, they strengthen the black dye and darken the overall hue of the garment.

Skin color can offer some general clues as to what your skin tone may be, and can help you determine the type of makeup to purchase. Skin color should not be your only method of determining tone. While there are some general rules, a variety of factors should be considered to assess your skin tone.If you have olive skin, you're highly likely to have a neutral skin tone leaning toward a warm skin tone.
If you have darker skin, you are probably warm-toned. However, if your skin is a bluish ebony rather than warm brown, you may have a cool skin tone.
Ruddy, reddish skin is likely to have cooler undertones. If you skin has a lot of reddish patches or discolorations, and tends to flush easily, you likely have ruddy skin. This increases the chances your skin will have a cool undertone.
Neutral skin is skin with very little undertones of olive, sallow, or pink. If you have neutral skin, with very little color or variations in color, most makeups and foundations will be flattering on you.;
, What color are the veins you see there? This is a quick shortcut that can help you guess at your likely skin tone. However, you should keep in mind that no one indicator can help determine skin tone. You should consider a variety of factors to figure out your tone.If they look blue, then you may have a cool skin tone.
If they look green, then you may have a warm skin tone.
If some look blue and some look green, or it’s hard to tell, then you're likely to have a neutral skin tone.

, Does one of them blend in better? Or does one clearly look better against your skin than the other one does? This can also indicate your probable skin tone.


Silver bracelets usually look best on cool skin tones.
Gold bracelets tend to stand out on warm skin tones.
If there's no major difference, then you may have a neutral skin tone.

, Do you flush and even burn easily? Are you already brown by the time May rolls around? Your skin's reaction to sunlight can give you a hint as to your probable skin tone. However, sunlight should not be the deciding factor for determining your skin tone. People with darker skin often do not burn easily, but may still have a cool tone.If you tan easily, you may have a warm skin tone. If you flush and/or burn easily, you may have a cool skin tone.
Make sure to take this in conjunction with other factors. People with dark skin often don't burn easily, but may actually have a cool skin tone. If you are dark-skinned, and you notice other signs of a cool skin tone, you're unlikely to have a warm tone regardless of how your skin responds to the sun. Makeups designed for a warm tone may look off on your skin.

, Once you know your skin tone, you can use it to help you pick out foundations, blush, clothes, shades of lipstick, and many other things.When it comes to makeup, cool skin tones generally mix best with pink and berry shades. Dark skins with cooler tones may work well with espresso shades.Warm tones go well with bronzes, golds, and makeup with yellow undertones.
Neutral skin tones can wear a wide range of colors and undertones, but they may lean more toward warmer or cooler tones, like a neutral skin tone that leans warm when combined with olive skin color. Experiment with pink and yellow undertones to see which ones work best.

, Does your skin tend to be oily, dry, or a combination of the two? To determine your skin type, look closely at your skin in the mirror.How visible are your pores? If they appear large all over, you probably have oily skin. If some are visible and others are harder to see, you may have combination skin. Small to invisible pores are usually indicative of normal or dry skin.
Do you tend to break out regularly, and if so, where? If you break out a lot in your T-zone (forehead, nose, chin), you probably have combination skin. If you tend to get break outs all over your face, you probably have oily skin. People with normal and dry skin will also get pimples and blackheads, but with much less frequency.
How shiny is your skin? If it's not shiny at all, and can even appear dull and scaly, your skin is probably dry. If it's shiny all over, you have oily skin. Normal skin appears smooth and healthy without too much shine. Combination skin is shiny around the forehead, nose, and chin, but looks normal across your cheeks.

, Each person’s skin has different needs, so go with a foundation that meets those needs. Generally speaking, liquid foundations or creamier foundations with hydrating power are great for dry skin. On the other hand, oily skin looks best with a matte powder foundation that will tone down the shine. If you do use a liquid foundation with oily skin, make sure that it isn’t oil-based.


If you have a lot of acne, you can even find some foundations that contain salicylic acid. However, if you already use several products contained benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid, be careful about adding another into your skincare regimen. You don’t want to end up with acne plus dry skin.If you have combination skin, try a powder foundation. It’s easier to apply more heavily in some areas and lightly in others, and you won’t get awkward lines, which can happen with a liquid foundation.If you want a foundation that does everything for you—hydration, sunscreen, packed with nutrients, evening out skin tone—you can use a product called a BB cream. The “BB” stands for “beauty balm” or “blemish balm.” Basically, it’s an all-in-one product that can be used for any skin type. It’s less specific to a particular skin tone or hue, but it is versatile enough to work as a foundation., Some foundations have a rosier or bluish undertone. For those with cool skin tones, that’s ideal. For those who have warmer skin tones, you should be looking for a similarly warm base, like a yellow or ivory. Neutral skin tones should experiment with both to see what looks best. If you have olive skin, try neutral or warm undertones., If you have major acne, you have the option of using a medium or heavyweight foundation. This will help to even out your skin texture. On the other hand, you might not want much coverage at all. Lightweight options include tinted moisturizers and sheer foundations., You’ve narrowed down your choices to one or two types of foundation and you’ve eliminated anything that doesn’t complement your skin tone. To found out which one matches your skin color, apply a dab of each one to your neck or upper chest—your face and jawline may be too uneven to get a good match., Your skin changes from winter to summer, thanks to sun exposure. This means that you should have two different shades of foundation to match. You also have the opportunity to use a different type of foundation if your skin’s needs change over the course of the year, like using a foundation with more hydration in winter and one with a higher SPF in summer.


If you have fairly consistent skin quality from season to season, use the same type of foundation (powder, liquid, crème, etc.) so that you can just mix the summer and winter shades for spring and fall.

, Are they true blue, gray, green, hazel, or brown? Different eye colors “pop” with different eyeshadow colors.


Brown eyes don’t really have a specific palette. Fortunately, they look good with almost anything. You can add warmth to your eyes with red-browns and metallics, or you can play up your look with darker colors or brighter jewel tones that other eyes can’t get away with as easily.For blue or gray eyes, the best choices for a little pop are warm copper and brown tones. For drama or to highlight the blue, wear a smoky gray shadow (or liner!).For other colors, generally steer towards pinks and pastels. If you have lighter eyes, colorful eyeshadow that is darker than your eye color can be overpowering.
For green eyes, purple is your best friend. If you want a little dramatic flair, try a purple that’s almost black for double the effect.Hazel eyes get a little more variety. If your eyes are greener, opt for the purple palette that makes green eyes look glamorous. If your eyes have more brown or flecks of gold, play that up with warm brown and gold tones.
Don’t forget about your skin tone. If your smoky eye turns out looking more like a bruised eye, then you might need to factor in your skin tone and whether your skin is fair, olive, or dark. Fair skin goes far with light colors, like pastel peaches and pinks, but bright and bold tones are too pronounced, leaving everything else looking washed out. Similarly, darker skin could appear ashy if you use a cool blue or grey. If you’re having trouble figuring it out, pick up a cheap palette with a wide array of colors and experiment with your eyes.

, This is usually pretty easy to figure out for most colors and skin tones. For instance, if you’re fair with a cool skin tone, you probably already know that an orange-toned lipstick will make you look strange. There are two things to consider when you’re choosing lipstick colors.


First, use your skin color to guide you toward the right color range. Fair skin plays well with bold and bright colors. Olive, neutral, or medium skin works with most colors, just avoid ones that will look pale. Dark skin pairs with richer, deeper colors, like wine or bright red.Second, narrow down your selection by factoring in your skin tone. Warmer skin tones pair well with warm base notes. When you’re choosing a red lipstick, for example, you can easily wear a brick red or one with more orange to it. Cooler skin tones work best with pinks, blues, and purples. Your ideal red lipstick is more berry than brick or has a little plum in it.

, The theme here is that whatever you put on your skin should work with your skin’s natural pigmentation. Cool skin tones should wear pink blushes that go well with their naturally rosier tendencies, or try pinker peach tones. A warm skin tone will shine with golden undertones, more towards the beige, orange peach, and apricot end of the spectrum. If you’re lucky enough to have neutral skin tone, play around with different colors depending on your mood.


If you’re unsure how bright or dark to go with the blush, use your skin color as a guide. Fair skin works great with pastel pinks, while dark skin requires rich, bold colors like red-toned browns and oranges. Olive skin has a little more room to play around, but still leans more towards the pink end with room for darker, brighter colors than fair skin., This is generally true if you work in a workplace with a business or business casual dress code. You might be able to get away with a dark lip color if you have darker skin, but otherwise, avoid dramatic or bright colors. Opt for nudes, beiges, and pastels around your eyes, and apply minimal eyeliner.


Do have at least a basic makeup regimen for work. Women are perceived more favorably when they take those extra steps. You never know: some foundation, a bit of eyeshadow, and a sweep of mascara may be the little thing that tilts the balance in your favor., You have less to constrain your style, so why not go for something a bit more astonishing? Break out the bright red lipstick for a kissable confidence boost. Play with a tropical theme for your eyeshadow. Add false eyelashes to take your lash game from good to great.

, If you’re going out after work, start your day with the basics. Line your eyes lightly, put on a coat of mascara, and wear a single shade of eyeshadow. Once you get to the end of your workday, you can pop in the bathroom for extra eyeliner, another shade or two of eyeshadow to complete the effect, and an extra coat (or two) of mascara. Finish it off with a bright touch of lip color and you’ll be good to go.

Ditch the bronzer.,
Make your cheeks glow with blush.,
Create a soft contour to accentuate your facial features.",How to Choose Fall Makeup Colors1," Summer is all about airy, light coverage and a sun-kissed bronze. When fall arrives, it’s time to swap out the shimmery tan for soft, creamy skin and rosy cheeks. You can bring out your full coverage foundations that you skipped in the hot summer months, and use a beauty blender to apply it smoothly and evenly.

Opt for lighter colored concealers and foundations that you used in the summer, so that your skin looks natural in the less sunny weather.;
, As you wave goodbye to your summer tan, it’s important to add color to your face with a go-to blush. If you want to prolong a little bit of that summer spirit, opt for a peachy shade reminiscent of your summer color palette. To get into the fall and winter mode, choose a deeper shade of blush in a shade like mulberry, or a soft, rosy color.

Learn how to apply your blush perfectly here.

, Just because you are putting your summer bronzer away doesn’t mean you have to lighten up completely. Invest in a contour palette for the fall to add dimension to your face. Sweep the darker across your cheek bones, along your temples, and along your jaw to accentuate your angles. Dot a bit of highlighter under your eyes and down your nose to complete the look.

Use rich brown shadows on the eyes.,
Experiment with oranges and reds.,
Darken up your eyebrows.",How to Choose Fall Makeup Colors2," Nothing says fall quite like palettes of brown, tan, and cream shadows!

Use a lighter hand at the beginning of the brow, and darken up the product as you move towards the tail.

Embrace brown lips.,
Rock nude lips.,
Bring out the bold colors.",How to Choose Fall Makeup Colors3," Don’t be scared to experiment with shades of brown on your pout. This is one of the hottest fall trends, and there’s a brown lip product out there for everyone. Look for browns with hints of red or pink, and you’ll be surprised just how bright they actually look. For a perfect fall look, opt for products with a matte finish., If you choose to really play up your eyes, nude is a great choice for your lips. In the simplest terms, your nude lipstick should be very similar to your natural lip color, but better. It’s the lip color you’d dream of having naturally! You might have to try out a few nude lip products before finding the perfect one for you. Find a product with a bit of shine to give your lips more dimension., Fall is your chance to bring out all those deep burgundy, bold reds, and dramatic purples that you put away for the warmer months. Rich, eye-catching colors pair perfectly with sweater weather. Look for products in colors like plum, wine, and even deep oranges. You won’t have to worry about your face looking dull or lifeless in the cooler weather with these intense shades.Let your lips be the center of attention by limiting your eye shadow to soft browns and neutrals, or by only wearing mascara.

If you have a warm skin tone, you look better in jewel tones, reds, blues, purples etc.,
If you have a cool skin tone, you look better in earthy tones, browns, greens, golds etc.,
Once you've figured out your skin tone, try to find makeup in these tones.,
Start with something basic, and natural, for example, some mascara, a little eyeliner, and lip gloss.,
Once you feel confident pulling off an easy look, try to get more advanced, and buy concealer, setting powder and foundation.,
Look up video tutorials of more difficult looks, or figure them out yourself, so that eventually you'll be able to do your own glam looks for parties.

",How to Choose and Start Wearing Makeup," Look at the veins on your wrist. If they are a greenish tone you have a warm skin tone, if they are blue or purple, you have a cool skin tone. If you have both, your skin could be neutral. Different kinds of colors go with different skin tones.;
, Your foundation should be leaning towards pink, and you look good with pure white and black.

, Your foundation should be leaning towards pink, and you look good in ivory and should not wear too much black.

, Start with more neutral tones, nothing to bright or crazy, because these are harder to get off if you make a mistake. Avoid waterproof things until you are more confident in your makeup applying as these are also very difficult items to get off.

, To apply mascara, brush the wand from root to tip of your lashes, to apply eye liner, gently pull your lid taut, then draw a thin line, as close to your lashes as possible, from the beginning of your lashes until the end.

, It's important that you get an exact match for your skin tone. Apply concealer first, then foundation, then powder. To apply foundation, dab it on your face, a couple dots all over, then with large sweeping motions blend it in. To apply concealer, put a small dot and gently rub it in with your ring finger or a makeup sponge. To apply powder, drag your brush through the powder, then tap the edge on the edge of the powder, getting rid of any extra. Then using sweeping motions, lightly cover your face. Be sure to always blend into your neck for a natural look

Wear a white shirt and look in the mirror.",How to Choose Makeup for Your Skin Tone1," Be sure you are in natural or incandescent light, as yellow light or fluorescent light will reflect off your skin. See if your skin appears to have more yellow-red -- warm skin tones; or more blue-pink -- cool skin tones. The skin tone is not your skin color, it is the color that is under the skin color that reflects or is enhanced against white. Skin undertone is often shortened to simply skin tone when referring to color. There are many skin colors, but only two basic skin tones -- warm and cool. Once you know your skin tone, you can select your make-up colors.;

Decide which of the major skin color categories you fall into -- fair, medium, olive or dark.",How to Choose Makeup for Your Skin Tone2," People with the same skin color do not always have the same skin tone. For example, you could be fair skinned and cool toned, or fair skinned and warm toned. You could be dark skinned with either cool or warm. It depends largely on your ethnicity and genetics. You may not be exactly 1 skin color category, and most people are in-between. Determining the nearest category will help you find a color palette more quickly.

Select a foundation that matches exactly with your skin color.,
Try the foundation on your skin.",How to Choose Makeup for Your Skin Tone3," You may need to switch foundations from summer to winter depending on whether your skin is slightly darker in summer months.

, The best place to test foundation is on the skin between your lower cheek and jawbone. Foundations are either yellow-based or blue-based. Some make-up lines actually have words like ""cool beige"" or ""warm honey"" on their labels to indicate the tone it was made for.


Choose a cool color foundation with blue or pink undertones if you have a cool skin tone.
Select yellow-toned foundation for a warm skin tone.
If your skin is darker, be sure that the foundation does not make you look ashen. If so, try a different color or a yellow-based foundation.

"
"
Choose a blush that will complement and blend into your skin.",How to Choose Makeup for Your Skin Tone4," Blush is used to highlight the cheeks and should never look streaky, so choose something subtle within your skin tone range.

Base your foundation on your skin type.,
Choose your foundation shade.,
Pick your eyeliner.,
Decide your eyeshadows.,
Figure out your best blush.,
Get your lips just right.",How to Choose the Right Makeup Products," Skin can be normal, oily, dry, or mixed.


Normal skin works well with mostly any type of foundation.
Oily skin usually does best with powder foundations.
Dry skin can benefit from tinted moisturizers.
For mixed skin, liquid, cream, or mousse foundations are usually a safe bet.;
, For this you'll need to test product in person. Using tester products, apply a small amount of foundation to the back of your arm, which will usually be a skin shade close to that of your face. Also apply dabs of foundations a shade lighter and darker than the one you think will be your match. Once they've dried, see which shade matches closest to your skin. If you're torn between shades, err to the lighter shade.

, There are a few types of eyeliner you can choose from.


Pencils are easiest to use and blend well with eyeshadows.
Powder gives a softer look, and the size and shape of the line is as easy to control as changing your brush.
If you're looking for a smooth, sharp, or dramatic look (and you have a steady hand) liquid eyeliner could be the right choice.

, Shadows can be based on eye color or skin shade.


Brown eyes match well with purples, blues, and metal colors such as copper, silver, and gold.
For hazel eyes, dark purples, yellows, and greens work well, but not blues.
For blue eyes, try cool colors, dark browns, or oranges.
For green eyes, you may find smoky grays and charcoals, plum, violet, beige, or tan to be a good fit.
When it comes to pale skin, avoiding darker and smokier colors is best; go with light earth tones.
Vibrant colors are best for darker skin tones, but be sure to avoid ashy and white shades.

,


Pale skin is easily complemented by light pinks and peaches
Medium skin suggests using rosy pinks and darker peach shades
For dark skin rose shades and deep oranges are great choices.

, The simplest method of choosing a lip color is going with a shade a couple shades darker than your natural lip shade.

If you want more options, pale skin pairs well with apricots, pinks, and creams; medium tones can wear roses and berries well; dark skin can be beautifully accented with dark browns or deep or vibrant purples.

Look at different types of makeup bags to determine which style best suits your needs.,
Place your cosmetics inside the cosmetic bag.,
Find a makeup bag with a zipper closure as opposed to a Velcro closure.,
Consider whether you need a makeup bag that comes with an organizer inside it.,
Determine how many pockets you need.,
Look at the material that the makeup bag is made from.,
Check the sturdiness of the bag.",How to Choose a Makeup Bag," Since there are a variety of different styles, sizes and colors available, pick a few different bags that have all of these features.;
, Is there plenty of room to fit all of your items comfortably? Are the items constricted inside the bag? Is it difficult to zip the makeup bag close? Does it fit inside your purse? Does it contain a zipper or a Velcro adhesive closure?

, Zipper closures stay closed even when the makeup bag shifts around in your purse. Makeup bags with Velcro closures are more likely to come open when your makeup bag is moved around in your purse. This movement can also cause your cosmetic items to come out of the bag and come open while inside your purse-leading to stains inside your purse.

, Check to see if this compartment is removable, which makes it easier to clean. A makeup bag organizer keeps all of your cosmetic items neat and makes finding your items a lot easier when you are in a hurry.

, Some cosmetic bags come with several pockets, while others come with only a few pockets for powder and lipsticks.

, Nylon, polyester or microfiber makeup bags are easy to clean with a damp washcloth. Many of these can also be hand washed with a gentle detergent when powder or other substances stain the outside or the inside of the makeup bag. Make sure the cosmetic bag has the same material on the inside.

, Does it provide good protection for your makeup products? Does it prevent your items from moving around too much while they are inside the bag?

Immediately after your procedure, apply an ice pack for about 15 minutes on procedure area to reduce swelling.,
After icing phase is completed, apply thin coats of Vitamin A&D Ointment or Vitamin E Oil as often as needed to keep area moisturized and to prevent cracking in the skin.,
Don't pick, scratch, or scrape off any dry skin.,
Avoid using conventional makeup over your permanent makeup for about a week until the epidermis is healed.,
Do not scrub or rub procedure areas in any way.,
Avoid direct sunlight for the first week at bare minimum, although 3 to 6 weeks are recommended.,
Avoid chlorinated pools and hot tubs as chlorine can fade the procedure.,

Blend any harsh edges.",How to Bake Your Makeup," If you use an all-over liquid foundation as part of your makeup routine, you should apply this before beginning the baking process. Do not apply any sort of powder foundation. Baking will only set any liquid products on your face. Use your liquid foundation to even out your skin tone, creating a smooth base., Use a hydrating eye cream or serum, which you can find at beauty supply stores or your local pharmacy. By applying this, you’ll hydrate the delicate skin underneath your eyes, prepping them for makeup application. If you struggle with dark circles or bags under your eyes, a good eye product will help make your eyes look brighter and more awake.Applying an eye cream or serum will also help to firm up your skin and smooth out any lines or wrinkles, which can cause makeup to crease up and look very unnatural.
Gently dab the eye cream underneath your eyes and allow it to absorb into your skin for a couple of minutes.

, After the eye cream has fully absorbed into your skin, it’s time to begin applying makeup. To bake your makeup, it’s great to use a thick, full-coverage concealer. If you already have a go-to favorite, you can use that. Using your finger or a concealer brush, begin dotting the concealer underneath your eyes.Rather than bringing the concealer all the way up to your eye, start a couple of centimeters underneath your eye.
Apply the concealer underneath your eye, along the apples of your cheeks, and upwards toward your temple., First, dampen a makeup sponge or Beautyblender. Then, use quick patting motions to blend out your concealer. As you blend, bring the concealer up to your eye. By applying it this way, you will get lighter and more natural looking coverage closest to your eye.You can purchase a Beauty blender online or at a beauty supply store, but most drug stores offer generic versions of the foam, tear-dropped shape makeup sponge.

, A second coat can help to lock in the first coat, ensuring full-coverage all day.This time, don’t apply the concealer as heavily. Gently apply it with a concealer brush or your fingertip, again leaving a tiny bit of space between the concealer and your eye. Grab your damp makeup sponge and blend it out once again., While the skin under your eyes is typically the central focus of “baking,” you can and should apply concealer to any other area where you want a bright, flawless finish. Put concealer on your chin, the center of the forehead, the bridge of your nose, and underneath the hollows of your cheeks.


These are the “highlight” areas, and you can add dimension to your face by baking these areas as well.

, Translucent powders are color-free and are used to set makeup. They even out your makeup and make sure that it will stay put through long days and nights.You can purchase a translucent powder at your local drugstore or beauty supply store.Using a blending brush, lightly apply the translucent powder everywhere that you applied concealer. Use minimal powder – just enough to set your makeup into place.

, This is the step that is referred to as “baking,” although the application of the concealer is just as important. You can use your blending brush, your damp makeup sponge, or a clean makeup sponge or wedge. Spray your applicator of choice with a bit of makeup setting spray.


Dip the brush, sponge, or wedge into the same translucent powder you used previously. Apply it thickly under your eyes, as well as any other areas of your face where you applied concealer.
Apply the translucent powder extremely generously to underneath your eyes, as well as the concealer on your chin, under the hollows of your cheeks, the bridge of your nose, and your forehead.
Continue dipping the brush into the translucent powder to pack plenty of product over your concealer.

, After you’re done applying the translucent powder, you will look silly. Don’t worry – that’s simply part of the baking process! It should look thick and clownish as it “bakes.” The translucent powder allows the heat from your face to set your liquid foundation and concealer firmly into place, so give it about five or ten minutes to bake fully., You can use the blending brush that you used to apply the translucent powder. Swirl your brush into the powder, and tap off any excess product. Don’t worry, this powder will not be applied as generously as the translucent powder., Using the brush with foundation, brush away the translucent powder in light, gentle strokes. Do this to all of the areas you “baked”: under your eyes, your chin, underneath your cheek hollows, and your forehead. As you brush away the packed on translucent powder, the foundation on the brush will give you a little bit of extra coverage.As you brush away the translucent powder, you will reveal smooth, even skin.

, After you’ve brushed away the excess translucent powder, double check that there are no harsh, unnatural edges anywhere on your face. If there are, use your blending brush and a bit of your powder foundation to correct this. Use a light hand to gently blend out any uneven spots without removing any product."

Develop your skills.,
Familiarize yourself with different ""looks.""",How to Become a Makeup Artist1," Practice applying makeup on both yourself and your friends so that you can develop your technique and perfect your craft. Remember that even though you may be a superstar at doing your own makeup, applying makeup on others takes a different set of motor skills and coordination.


Practice applying makeup on people with different colored skin, different face shapes, different eye colors, and different ages. Find people with fair, medium, olive, and dark skin. This will help you develop a breadth of skill so that you can work with a wide range of clients.
Experiment with different brands of makeup. Many makeup artists prefer certain brands of makeup over others, because the quality of the finished product varies between brands. You should also experiment using different textures like liquid and powdered foundation, and learn which ones work best on different skin types (i.e. dry versus oily skin).
Try using different kinds of brushes, makeup wands, and other tools. Makeup brushes come in different shapes, sizes, and textures.;
, Read magazines, scour fashion blogs, watch films, go to plays, and pay attention to the different trends and styles of face makeup. It is important to be able to deliver a look that your client describes to you, and be up-to-date with the current beauty trends so that you can advise him or her on what looks best.


Learn to determine between day and night looks. Keep the following pointers in mind:

In general, daytime makeup should be minimalist; stick with pink tones when it comes to lips, and keep the color within two shades of the persons' natural lips. Eye makeup should be subtle, with nothing more than some mascara and a neutral shadow.
Nighttime makeup can pop more, with either a dramatic eye or lip (but not both), and defined cheekbones.


Another timeless look is having a stand-out red lip with little to no other makeup. Learn to identify which shades of red look best on which skin tones. For example, people with very dark skin look good with wine-colored lips while people with very fair skin look good with orange tones.
Clients will oftentimes request that you recreate a certain look that a celebrity had at an awards show or in a magazine. You will need to learn the terminology involved in makeup artistry so that you can effectively bring your clients' descriptions to life.

Enroll in beauty school.,
Find a job at a cosmetics counter.",How to Become a Makeup Artist2," Many makeup counters will hire people who haven't gone to beauty school, but if you have the time and money, it's worth learning techniques from people who have been in the business for years.


The curriculum will vary between schools, but usually covers both basic skills like wedding makeup and more advanced skills like special-effects makeup. Remember that while these courses help, they cannot replace the benefits of practice, experimentation, and natural talent.

",How to Become a Makeup Artist3," Do you want to work with movie and TV stars, or perhaps models and musicians? Do you plan on starting your own business doing wedding and special events makeup in your city? When you decide on the path that's right for you, start building your ""brand,"" letting the world know that you specialize in a certain type of makeup artistry.


Fashion, theater, special effects, bridal and airbrushing are a few of the fields you could enter.
Network with stylists and makeup artists in your chosen field. Look for entry-level jobs and internships to help you get your foot in the door.
Get creative with collaborations. Ask your friend who's making a music video if she could use your makeup artistry services, or offer to do your coworker's wedding makeup. You'll hone your skills and start making a name for yourself at the same time.

, Your portfolio allows you to showcase your talents to prospective clients and employers. It should contain photographs of your best work and reflect your unique style and skill.


Invest in a high quality camera or hire a photographer to help you put your portfolio together. The quality of the photos can make or break a portfolio.
You will need to find models to showcase your talents on. While they by no means have to be professional models, find people whose makeup you enjoy doing and whose faces are compatible with your style. Consider including ""Before and After"" photos of your models.
Consider making an online portfolio (i.e. blog or website) in addition to a print portfolio. The benefit of an online portfolio is that it reaches a larger audience and can be promoted through various forms of social media.
Your portfolio, whether its print or online, should reflect the brand you are creating. Your best, most creative work should be showcased at the front so prospective clients get an immediate impression of your unique talent.

, Whether you want to land a full-time job with a particular company or work as a freelancer on a project-by-project basis, start marketing yourself to get the word out that you're looking for makeup artistry work.


Conduct research in your area to find available positions, and bring your portfolio and résumé with you on interviews.
You may need to volunteer your services in the beginning stages of your career, if only to develop more content for your portfolio.
Consider doing trade-for-print work with models.
Use word-of-mouth to promote your talents. Ask friends and family to consider hiring you to do their makeup for weddings, parties, or other formal occasions.

Don't give up using makeup.,
Avoid using base creams that are too rich.,
Don't use foundation to cover your entire face.,
Remember that mature skin is fine skin.,
Avoid overdoing the powder.,
Beware the bronzing creams and powders.,
Reduce the amount of blusher.,
Avoid heavy eyeshadow.,
Soften the mascara and eyeliner.,
Reduce the lip colour.",How to Avoid Common Makeup Errors for the Over 40s," Unless you've never worn makeup, don't feel that you have to stop using it. Makeup helps to reduce your age; with it, you can easily appear 10 years younger.


As you age, makeup camouflages imperfections, masks signs of fatigue, restores your colour, and illuminates your appearance.
If you've never worn makeup before, now is a good time to start. You don't have to go overboard, and be kind to yourself by visiting a makeup counter for specialist advice.;
, Rich base creams will outline the wrinkles and imperfections on older skin because they cannot penetrate properly. Look for fluid, liquid textures that are light and nourishing.

, Look for light foundations. Use one type for problem areas (freckles, brown spots, redness, etc.), then blend with a light foundation.


Watch out! Too much thick foundation will cause wrinkles and lines to stand out rather than be hidden.

, It is also dry. Whenever purchasing makeup products, the product must be suitable for fine, dry skin.

, If your face has too much powder on it, you'll look instantly 10 years older. Be stingy with the application.


Dip the point of a large makeup brush into the powder, then shake it. Then simply flick across your face gently, from the centre to the outside of your face.
A good powder will have a slight pink or rose tint to it, to give you back some colour.

, These products don't reflect a lot of light, aging you. Avoid any powder with an orange tint to it.

, Older cheeks hollow out more and are in need of a very light touch of blusher, not a deep brush.

, Maintain a natural expression when applying eyeshadow and brush on lightly. Avoid using vivid colours across the entire eyelid.


Avoid bright or glittering eyeshadow; these have a tendency to highlight wrinkles.

, Trace the eyeline and eyelashes softly, with a gentle, soft colour. Avoid thick mascara or you'll have glued up eyelashes. Keep the darker makeup very light, very minimal or it will age you terribly.

, The bright lipsticks are great on women in their 20s and 30s. In your 40s on, it begins to become overwhelming and your aging complexion will make the contrast too strong.


Keep lip liner extremely discreet.
If your teeth have discoloured, avoid deep colours like browns and burgundy.
Use light colours to reflect light and to help you radiate.

Use yellow eyeshadow for blush.,
Try lipstick to make a cream blush.,
Mix yellow pigment with traditional blush.,
Apply the blush last.,
Apply it along your cheekbones.",How to Apply Yellow Blush1," Yellow blush isn’t a product yet. To get this effect, try yellow eyeshadow. Many different makeup companies sell yellow shades, often under the name of neon.Some companies put out yellow shades like buttercup or golden. Others may be under names like sunshine.;
, Yellow lipstick is another product you can use to make yellow blush. Start with a satin or matte lipstick. Get a decent amount of yellow lipstick onto your fingers. Warm the lipstick between your fingers by rubbing them together. Apply it just like you would with a brush.Other lipstick finishes can be used if you want to experiment with shade and the finish on your cheeks.
You can also use a foundation brush if you want instead of your fingers.

, You can alter the shade of the yellow blush to achieve something more golden or even orange. Take yellow lipstick or eyeshadow and mix with a red, peach, or pink toned blush. Experiment mixing these colors to make your own golden shade., Do all the rest of your makeup before you apply the blush. Make sure you have already applied your foundation, moisturizer, concealer, highlighter, or powder. The blush should be the last thing you do.







, Yellow blush is applied with a technique called draping. To do this, start your blush at the outer corner of your cheekbone and temple. Then, apply the shade down to the apple of your cheek.

"
Pair the blush with other yellow makeup.,
Wear contrasting tones.,
Pair it with neutrals.",How to Apply Yellow Blush2," One way to wear yellow blush is to wear it with yellow eyeshadow and yellow lipstick. Wearing all yellow makeup can give you a fun spring look.







, Another way to wear yellow blush is to pair it with shades that contrast with the yellow. Many people pair yellow blush with blue and red makeup. You can try red or blue lipstick or blue eyeshadow.







, Wearing neutral eyeshadow or nude lips is also a fashionable way to wear your yellow blush. Beige and peach-toned eyeshadow can enhance your beauty but not take away from the pop of color from the yellow blush.








Try brown eyeliner and mascara to soften the look.

"
Wear yellow eyeshadow under your eyes.,
Layer the product for milder or bolder looks.,
Wear it with confidence.",How to Apply Yellow Blush3," If you’re nervous about trying this bold look, start with something small. Instead of putting it directly on your cheeks, start by applying yellow eyeshadow just under your lower lids when you wear yellow eyeshadow. This can get you used to the look before you put it on your cheeks.







, You can apply as much or as little yellow blush as you want. You can make it light for a gentle highlight, or you can apply thicker layers to build a bold, daring look. Experiment with both to determine what works for you.







, This is a bold makeup choice and may not be for everyone. If you decide to wear yellow blush, be confident and have fun with it. You may get some strange looks, but remember you are on the cutting edge of makeup fashion."

Double up the same translucent setting powder that you use to set your foundation to set your liquid/gel liner.",How to Avoid Carrying Too Much Makeup," Try to get light and darker shades, as these are a lot more versatile. No more than two shades per item.;
, After using your lipstick, dab some on the apples of your cheeks and use your finger to blend it out. Not only will you save space, but using the same color on your lips and cheeks will make the look more cohesive. (Eyeshadow work too!)

, Use a brown or black shadow to line your upper lid with an angled eyeliner brush. Use a bright, contrasting color as liner for a more noticeable look.

, It creates shadow, giving the illusion of a bigger bust.

,, Use eyeliner or mascara to give yourself a sexy beauty mark.

,, Best lip colors for hot pink and red!

, Use a flat angled brush, dip it in the powder and pat onto the liner. Replace the translucent powder with a eyeshadow that matches the liner for the same effect.

Prepare your skin before foundation.,
Test foundation shades on your jawline.,
Apply your foundation with a brush or sponge.,
Choose an under eye concealer that’s only one shade lighter than your skin.,
Use a concealer that matches your foundation exactly for discolorations.,
Apply powder strategically.,
Use a light hand with bronzer or contour products.,
Sweep your blush higher up on your cheek.,
Lightly fill in your brows.,
Apply an eyeshadow primer.,
Use a guide to flick your eyeliner.,
Curl your lashes before applying mascara.,
Exfoliate and moisturize your lips before applying color.,
Fill in your lips when you line them.,
Remove your makeup at the end of the day.,
Keep your makeup out of the bathroom.,
Wash your makeup brushes regularly.",How to Avoid Making Makeup Mistakes," If you put foundation over dry, flaky or overly oily skin, it’s going to wind up looking cakey. Always cleanse your face before putting on makeup, and exfoliate your skin one to two times a week to keep skin smooth and clear. Finally, be sure to use a moisturizer before your makeup so your skin is properly hydrated.It’s a good idea to apply a primer before foundation too. Not only does it provide a base for your makeup to stick to so it lasts all day, a primer can fill in pores, fine lines, and wrinkles so your foundation goes on more smoothly.;
, When you’re trying to find the right foundation shade at the store, you probably just swipe it on the back of your hand to test it. But the skin on your hand usually isn’t the same shade as your face, so you wind up buying foundation that’s too dark. Instead, test the foundation along your jawline to make sure it matches both your face and neck.Be sure to test the foundation in natural light to be certain that it’s the right shade for you.
Even if you’re confident that your foundation matches both your face and neck, it’s a good idea to blend a little over your jawline and onto your neck so you don’t wind up with a line between the two.

, While it may be easier to put your foundation on with your fingers, it can actually leave you with a cakey, streaky finish. Instead, dot the foundation on your face with clean fingers and use a foundation brush or egg-shaped sponge to blend it in. You’ll get an airbrushed effect if you press and buff the makeup in with your tool of choice.Avoid flat foundation brushes that look like paint brushes -- they can provide a streaky finish too. Instead, look for a dense, full brush that will blend the foundation more effectively.
If you’re using a sponge, wet it first under the sink. Wring out the excess moisture so it’s just damp, and then use it to blend the foundation. That will keep the sponge from soaking up too much makeup.

, You may think that you using a super light concealer will brighten up your undereye area. However, using a shade that’s two to three shades lighter than your foundation will only highlight the area and give you reverse raccoon eyes. Instead, opt for a concealer that’s only one shade lighter than your foundation under the eyes for subtle brightening.It's usually best to blend in under eye concealer with a clean finger rather than a brush or sponge. The warmth from your finger helps the concealer melt more easily into your skin so it's less likely to crease.

, If you use a concealer that's lighter than your foundation on acne, scars, age spots, and other discolorations, you'll only wind up drawing attention to the areas you're trying to conceal. Instead, apply a concealer that matches your foundation exactly so they blend seamlessly together.For blending concealer in on the face, a brush or sponge typically works best. They help the product melt into the skin without removing too much of the pigment so your dark spots remain hidden.

, Using too much setting powder can give you a cakey look that highlights pores, fine lines, and wrinkles. To set your foundation, only dust powder over the areas where you tend to get shiny or oily. For most people, that is the T-zone, or forehead, nose, and chin. You may also want to apply a light layer to your cheeks.If your skin is dry, you may want to skip powder completely.
It can be very easy to apply too much pressed powder or powder foundation.To keep your powder from looking too heavy, opt for a loose, translucent formula that won’t add any color or coverage.

, Bronzer and contour products can add warmth and definition to your face. If you use too much, though, you’ll wind up looking muddy. To keep it on natural, use a small amount on a small, fluffy brush and apply it softly along your forehead and temples, beneath your cheekbones, and along your jaw on each side of your face in a “3” or “E” shape for subtle definition.Blend your bronzer or contour product well so you don’t wind up with stark stripes on your face.

, If you place your blush too low on your cheeks, you’ll wind up looking harsh and dragging your face down. Start at the apple of your cheek, and blend it back along your cheekbone toward your hairline.Start with a small amount of blush, and only add more if you need more color. Be sure to blend well too, so it melts into the skin for a natural look.
An angled blush brush is helpful for getting the right placement of your blush.

, Dark, fully drawn on eyebrows never look quite right. To avoid looking too harsh, use a product that is the same color or a shade lighter than your brows. Instead of drawing your brow on in one line, use a series of small strokes for a soft, natural look.Using a powder to fill in your brows usually offers the softest, most natural look.
When you’re finished applying your brow product, brush through them with a clean brow brush or spoolie to blend the color.

, If you want to keep your eyeshadow from fading and creasing, starting with a shadow primer is a must. Dot a small amount of the primer on your lids, and gently blend it in with your finger before applying any eyeshadow.If you don't have an eyeshadow primer, you can substitute concealer. Use it just as you would a primer.

, Getting the perfect wing on the end of your eyeliner can seem like mission impossible if you try to freehand it. Instead, place a piece of invisible tape or hold a small piece of paper at a 45 degree angle at the corner of your eye so you can just trace your flick along the edge for a flawless cat eye every time.If you're using tape, place it on the back of your hand and pull it off a couple of times before placing it at the corner of your eye. That will remove some of the adhesive, so the tape doesn't pull at the delicate skin around your eye when you remove it.

, Curled lashes can open up your eyes and make them appear larger. However, it’s important to curl your lashes with a lash curler before you put on your mascara. If your lashes are wet when you curl them, you can create a kink in them or even pull some lashes out.If you’re not comfortable using a lash curler at all, you can curl your lashes without one. In that case, apply your mascara first and then push your lashes back to create a curl. Hold them in place for several seconds to lock the curl in.

, Whether you want to apply a lipstick, stain, or gloss, the color won't look right if your lips are dry and flaky. Use a lip scrub to gently remove dead skin from your lips, and apply a moisturizing lip balm before your lip color so it looks smooth and flawless.You can purchase a lip scrub or mix up your own with household ingredients. Combine 1/2 teaspoon (2.5 ml) of olive oil with 1 teaspoon (4 g) of sugar, and rub it over your lips to exfoliate. Wipe it away with a damp washcloth.
It's particularly important to scrub and moisturize your lips before applying a matte lipstick. Matte lip colors are extremely drying, so they emphasize every crack and flake.

, A lip liner can add definition to your lips and keep your lipstick from bleeding. However, even if your liner is a similar shade to your lipstick, applying it only along the edge of your mouth can often make it stand out. To avoid creating a dark ring around your mouth, fill in your lips with the liner after lining the edge.If you can’t find a lip liner that is similar in color to your lipstick shade, use a nude liner that matches your natural lip color.

, Sleeping in your makeup is one of the worst things that you can do for your skin. It can cause breakouts, fine lines, and wrinkles, and leave your complexion looking dull. Always wash your makeup off at the end of the day with a good cleanser to keep your skin healthy.If you’re wearing waterproof eye makeup or heavy foundation, it’s best to incorporate a specific makeup remover into your skincare routine before you wash your face.
Keep makeup remover wipes on your nightstand. That way, if you’re too tired to stand over the sink and wash off your makeup at the end of the day, you can quickly wipe it off and get to bed.

, The bathroom usually has a large mirror, so it probably seems like the ideal spot to put on and store your makeup. However, the heat and humidity -- not to mention germs -- in the bathroom can cause your makeup to spoil more quickly. Instead, store it in a cool, dry room of the house, such as the bedroom., It can be a pain to keep your makeup brushes clean, but using dirty brushes can lead to dirt, oil, and bacteria being spread over your face each time you use them. You should deep clean with brush shampoo or another cleanser once a week, and use a daily brush cleaner to spot clean your brushes before each use.You can purchase brush shampoo and daily brush cleaner at beauty supply stores. However, you can also make your own.

Moisturize your face.,

Blend out the highlighter.,
Dust a matching powder highlight over the cream.,
Apply a matte blush to your cheeks.,
Use bronzer sparingly.,
Set the non-highlighted areas of the face with translucent powder.",How to Apply Strobing Makeup," Because strobing calls attention to your skin, it’s important to ensure that it’s properly hydrated so the makeup doesn’t look patchy or cakey. Before applying any makeup, use a moisturizer to ensure that your skin looks smooth and healthy.








If you have oily skin, choose an oil-free moisturizer to avoid clogging your pores.
Wait at least 5 minutes after moisturizing your skin before applying any other makeup to ensure that the moisturizer has been fully absorbed.;
, Your skin should be as even as possible when you apply strobing makeup, so use a foundation to even out your skin tone first. It’s best to use a matte formula because it allows the shimmer and glow of your strobing products to stand out against it.








If your skin is mostly clear, you can substitute a lightweight tinted moisturizer or BB cream for the foundation.
Use a sponge or brush to blend the foundation into your skin for the most flawless finish.

, Your foundation may not cover up all of the discoloration on your face, so follow up with concealer. Dab it on acne, scars, dark circles, and any other areas of hyperpigmentation, and blend in well.








You can use a sponge or brush to apply your concealer, but using your fingers usually provides a smoother application because the warmth of your skin helps the product blend in most effectively.

, For the most natural looking strobing effect, it’s best to use a cream highlighter. Be sure to choose one in a shade that compliments your skin tone, and apply a small amount to the highpoints of your face, including the tops of your cheekbones, temples, brow bones, the bridge of your nose, and just above the center of your top lip.








You can also apply the highlighter to the center of your forehead and your chin for extra glow.
If you have oily skin, you may want to skip the highlighter on your forehead, nose, and chin because those areas tend to get shiny on their own.
If you have fair skin, opt for a highlighter in a champagne shade.If you have light to medium skin, opt for a highlighter in a pink champagne shade.
If you have olive skin, opt for a highlighter in a golden shade.
If you have a dark skin, opt for a highlighter in a bronze or terracotta shade.

, Once you’ve dabbed the cream highlighter on the highpoints of your face, you need to blend it in so it looks natural. Use a damp sponge or a synthetic stippling brush to gently work the cream into your skin for a seamless look.







, After you’ve blended the cream highlighter fully in your skin, you can make the glow more intense by topping it with a powder highlighter. Use a powder in a matching shade, and lightly dust it over the cream with a small fluffy brush or a fan brush.








If you have dry skin, you may want to skip the powder highlighter because it may look patchy or cakey on dry areas.

, To make sure that your strobing makeup takes center stage, it’s best to use matte products on the rest of your face. For a healthy look, apply a matte blush in a shade that flatters your skin tone, starting at the apples of your cheeks and sweeping back toward your hairline beneath your highlighter.








An angled blush brush usually provides the most precise application.
For fair skin, choose a light rose or peach blush.For light to medium skin, choose a mauve or apricot blush.
For olive skin, choose a coral blush.
For dark skin, choose a deep orange or berry blush.

, When you’re strobing, you typically don’t use any type of contouring product. However, if you feel like your skin needs some warmth, you can lightly apply a small amount of bronzer. Brush it along your temples, under the cheekbones beneath your blush, and along your jawline.








Just as with your blush, use a matte bronzer. You don’t want any shimmer or sparkle competing with the highlighter.

, To cut down on shine, it helps to lock your makeup in place with a setting powder. However, you don’t want to apply the powder to the areas where you highlighted. Use a fluffy brush to lightly dust translucent powder over rest of your face.








If your face looks cakey after using the setting powder, mist your face with a setting spray. Not only will it help reduce the powdery look, it will help keep your makeup in place all day.

, Toner can help to balance out your skin's PH level and reduce the amount of oil on your skin, so it is a good way to achieve a matte look.


Use a cotton ball to apply toner to your skin.
Allow the toner to dry completely before you apply moisturizer.

, Milk of magnesia can also help people who have oily skin to achieve a matte makeup look. Use the unflavored original formula and make sure that it does not contain mineral oil.








Use a cotton ball to apply milk of magnesia. Focus on your forehead, nose, and chin, since these areas tend to be oilier than your cheeks.
Wait until the milk of magnesia dries completely before applying any makeup over it.

, For example, you can choose a primer specifically for a matte finish or use a primer that will minimize your pores.

, Complete your foundation look with a layer of setting powder. Choose a color that will provide a matte effect and blend it well over all areas of your face.

This color should only be a couple of shades darker than your natural skin tone.
Do not use a color that looks shimmery or luminous. Choose a color that looks matte in the palette.
You can also sweep a bit of this color along your lower lash line to help accentuate your eyes even more but this is optional.

, Next, you will need to add a darker color to your crease to emphasize your eyes a bit more. Make sure that this eye shadow color is matte as well. Apply two to three layers to your crease.








This color should be a couple of shades darker than the first color you used, such as a medium brown.

, To brighten the look of your eyes, apply a matte cream color eyeshadow to your eyelids. Do not apply this color to any other part of your eyes, just to your eyelids. Apply two to three layers of the cream color eye shadow.







, To accentuate your eyes and add a bit of drama, apply a small amount of black eyeshadow near the outer corners of your upper eyelid. Make sure that you use a matte black eyeshadow and nothing shimmery.







, Finish by lining your upper eyelids with black liquid liner. Avoid shimmery eyeliners and stick with a matte black eyeliner. Apply the liner close to your upper lash line.








If you like, you can also add a cat tail to the corners of your eyes. To create a cat tail look, extend the liner out past the outer corner of your eye in an upward swooping fashion.

, Filling in your eyebrows will help to make your look more polished and dramatic. Use a matte brow powder or pencil to fill in the areas around and within your eyebrows. Make sure that you stay within the natural lines of your eyebrows and fill them out evenly.








You can also use an eyebrow mascara or wax to help keep your eyebrow hairs in place. These products are available in clear and in color. If you choose a color, go with one that matches the natural color of your eyebrows.

,
To apply mascara, wipe away the excess mascara from the brush and start near the base of your lashes. Move the brush up to coat the lashes to the tips. Apple multiple layers of mascara for best results.
You can also apply mascara to your lower lashes if you want to accentuate them as well, but this os optional.

, To finish your eyes, add a bit of highlighter to your brow bone and on the inner corner of your lower eyelid as well. Keep in mind that adding highlighter will add a small amount of shimmer to your face, but it will be subtle.








You can use a highlighting eye shadow on your bow bone, such as a champagne color or use a highlighter stick.
Then, use a highlighter eye liner on your lower, inner lash line, near your tear duct.

, You can also sweep some matte pink or peach color blush over your cheek bones to help accent them a bit. Just don’t apply too much. Your eyes should be the center of attention for this look.








If you have a round face, then apply the blush onto your cheekbones and sweep it out and up towards your temples.
If you have a heart-shaped face, then apply blush just under your cheekbones and up towards your temples.
If you have a long face, then apply blush just under your cheekbones, but do not sweep it out to your temples., Next, choose a subtle, matte lipstick shade to add some color to your lips. Go for a nude, pink, or earth tone shade. Apply lipstick to your lips and then press your lips together to distribute the color.








You can also line your lips with a matching lip pencil to prevent the lipstick from bleeding.

Finished.

",How to Apply Subtle Eyeshadow," If you have pale skin, go for a creamy white or light pink. If you have light brown skin (or a tan), go for a very light gold or brown. If you have dark skin, choose a warm chocolate color.


For one of the style options described below, you'll need at least four shades. Choose them from the examples above and arrange them from lightest to darkest.
You can try to branch out to other colors, but you should stick to fairly neutral tones. You might be able to pull of a deep purple, but most purples, blues, and greens are very obvious.;
, Your choice of tool is almost as important as the makeup itself. An extra-soft eyeshadow brush allows for more subtle blending than a cotton pad or sponge applicator. Start with one of these brushes, depending on which style you like:


A thick eyeshadow brush blends the makeup in especially well. This is great for a subtle style, especially if you prefer a more rounded look.
Use an angled brush for more precise effects, such as a cut crease or cat eye effect.

, Moisturize if necessary to start with a clean, fresh surface. Cover your eyelids with eyeshadow primer, concealer, or a foundation that matches your skin tone. This creates an even, natural tone and holds your eyeshadow in place for a longer time.

, If this is one of the first times you've applied eyeshadow, you should learn the basics before you try for a specific style. Here's a great way to apply a subtle effect when brushing on eyeshadow. You can even do this across your whole eyelid for an easy, subtle style by itself:


Hold the eyeshadow brush near the tip. This gives you a lighter touch, making your makeup more subtle.
Dip the brush in the eyeshadow, then brush it lightly across your eyelid in a sweeping motion.
Brush the same area three or four times without adding more eyeshadow to the brush. This will blend it into your skin tone.

, If you have at least four different neutral shades of eyeshadow, arrange them from lightest to darkest. Apply as follows, using a thick brush:


Apply the lightest shade onto your inner eye, stopping at the crease. Blend the edge until you cannot tell where the transition is.
Repeat with a slightly darker shade, starting at the outer eyelid, blending at the edge of the previous shade.
Keep repeating with slightly darker shades, starting further out and blending thoroughly.
Finish with the darkest shade to form the upper V. Apply this over your lash line as well if you are not using eyeliner.

, For a slightly more defined style, pick a single shade. Blend it thoroughly over the crease, plus a small amount in your upper V. Use a thick brush in a rounded motion. This should leave you with a visible circle of eyeshadow, but in a subtle shade.

, Draw eyeshadow slightly darker than your skin tone along your crease. Using a cotton swab or thick brush, brush this upward almost to your brow bone, thinning it into a smoky effect. This works great to enhance small eyes, without going overboard.

, Dab a small dot of white or light tan eyeshadow on the corner of your eye, near your tear ducts. This makes your eyes look big and bright without the makeup itself standing out. You can add this effect to almost any style.


Don't try to rub or blend this in. It should be barely noticeable already.

Apply a makeup primer.,
Dot your self-adjusting foundation on your face.,
Cover any blemishes or dark circles with your self-adjusting concealer.,
Set your products with translucent powder.",How to Apply Self Adjusting Makeup1," Just like with a regular, color foundation, you want to begin your routine by applying a primer. A makeup primer creates a base for your foundation, helping it to adhere solidly and evenly and last all day. It gives your self-adjusting foundation something to really “stick” to, smoothing out your skin so you can work on an even canvas., Squeeze a bit of the product you’ve chosen onto your fingertip. It will be white or clear right out of the bottle. Dot it on your forehead, your cheeks, your chin, and your nose. You just want to apply the foundation so your face is completely covered, otherwise it will not look even. Then, start blending the product out with your hands.Self-adjusting foundation goes on much like your typical face lotion. Simply dab it on and then blend it out.
Don’t forget to apply it to your eyelids!

, Once your foundation has been applied, you can perfect your skin with your concealer. You will apply your self-adjusting concealer much like you would apply a regular concealer. First, dab it below your eyes to cover dark circles. Blend it out gently. Then, apply it anywhere that you want additional coverage – on blemishes or other imperfections.The self-adjusting concealer will change color depending on where you put it on your face. For example, it might not be the same color under your eyes as it will be on a zit on your chin! It will adjust to match the particular area of your face it’s being applied to.

, After you’ve finished applying your foundation and concealer, it’s important to set your products. By applying a translucent powder, you’ll “seal” your makeup. Use a big fluffy brush to dust the translucent powder lightly over your entire face. Don’t worry, it won’t change the perfect color your self-adjusting makeup has created! This will prevent your face from looking greasy and it will help ensure your products last all day."

Determine where it should be applied.,
Dab a bit of product onto the apples of your cheek.,
Blend the blush out thoroughly.",How to Apply Self Adjusting Makeup2," When you apply self-adjusting blush, it turns to the color of your natural blush. That being said, it’s important to apply it in the right place where your natural blush appears! To figure this out, give yourself a big smile in the mirror. The parts of your cheek that raise when you smile are the apples of your cheeks, and that is where the blush should be focused.You will want to apply it to the apples of your cheeks and then sweep it upwards along your cheekbone, ending at the top of your ear.

, Squirt a bit of the self-adjusting blush onto your fingertips. Smile, and then dot the product onto the raised apples of your cheeks. It will come out clear or white, but it may start to change color as soon as it hits your cheeks. Don’t be alarmed if it seems dark, because you will be blending it., After you’ve dotted it on your cheeks, start rubbing it into your skin. Blend it over the apples of your cheeks, and then bring the product upwards. It should follow the natural curve of your cheekbones, moving upwards to the top of your ears. The color will blend and adjust to a very natural, rosy blush."

Invest in a tube of self-adjusting lip gloss.,
Experiment with self-adjusting bronzer.,
Try a self-adjusting primer.",How to Apply Self Adjusting Makeup3," Self-adjusting lip gloss goes on just like regular clear lip gloss, and within minutes adjusts to a custom shade that complements your complexion. If you have a hard time choosing which shade of pink or red gloss to use, a self-adjusting lip gloss can make life a little easier., There's definitely a learning curve when it comes to applying bronzer. It's not always easy figuring out what shade works best with your skin tone. The wrong shade can create unflattering results. Self-adjusting bronzer takes all the guesswork out of getting that perfect sunkissed shade. You can also use it for contouring, which makes it even more valuable., Primer is applied before foundation and is used to extend the life of your foundation and smooth out flaws. New self-adjusting primers will also color-correct, blend seamlessly into your natural skin tone and create a soft-focus effect that minimizes flaws. Experiment with a self-adjusting primer before you apply self-adjusting foundation for a perfectly blended and flawless complexion."

Store your new toothpaste in the jar.",How to Make Peppermint Toothpaste1," Baking soda has been a popular alternative to commercial toothpaste for its abrasiveness (which helps scrape off food and other accumulated particles in the mouth) as well as for its powerful cleansing properties.For this recipeyou will need the following:


1/4 cup baking soda
1/4 teaspoon fine-grained sea salt
20 drops peppermint essential oil (make sure you are using pure peppermint essential oil and not peppermint extract which is used for baking)
20 drops of liquid stevia extract (or to taste)
1-2 teaspoons of water (add to desired consistency);
, The process of making your own toothpaste is quite simple and you don’t need any special supplies to mix the ingredients together. Obtain a small bowl, fork, and a clean, dry jar with a tight-fitting lid to store the toothpaste in.

, Add the baking soda and sea salt into the bowl and then use the fork to mix the two ingredients together. Since they are both dry materials, don’t worry too much about the consistency, just be sure to mix the two thoroughly.

, Start by adding in the peppermint essential oil, mashing it into the dry mixture with the fork. Then mix in the stevia and then finally water until you get your desired consistency.


If you prefer a strong minty flavor, use all 20 drops of the peppermint oil. If you would like a more mild version, start with 10 drops and add more after tasting if desired.
Add in the liquid stevia to taste as well. Mix thoroughly after adding 10 drops and if you prefer a sweeter version, add in the rest of the stevia.
Finally, drizzle in the water a little at a time. Don’t expect the final product to have the exact same consistency as store bought toothpaste. Instead, aim for a damp paste that sticks together.

, Use the fork to mash the two together until they are well combined.

, If you want a flavor that most emulates commercial toothpaste, add in the full amount of peppermint oil and toothpaste. However, if you want a milder flavor, you can start by putting in half the amount of what the recipe originally calls for and then add more to taste.


If the mixture is lumpy or doesn’t stick together, be patient and combine all ingredients thoroughly. If you still aren’t getting a smooth consistency, add a tiny bit more coconut oil (a teaspoon or so) until you have a paste that sticks together.

, Slowly heat and stir the two ingredients together with a heat resistant spoon until both have melted into a liquid state and have combined.


Beeswax makes your sunscreen water resistant, and coconut oil has a natural SPF between 4 and 6.

, Use the same spoon to stir them into the mixture over medium-low heat until thoroughly combined.


Almond, sesame, and avocado oils all have a natural SPF of 4 and all have moisturizing properties that help prevent sun-exposed skin from drying out.

, Lift the top portion of the double boiler out of the bottom portion and set it down on a heat resistant surface.

, Stir rigorously, with a spoon, to combine. Do not add the shea butter to the mixture before removing it from the heat because shea butter that gets too hot develops a grainy texture.


Shea butter has a natural SPF that ranges between 6 and 10.

,, Stir the mixture vigorously until the powder has completely dissolved. Zinc Oxide has no harmful effects when used topically, but inhaling the substance as a powder can be hazardous to your throat and lungs, which is why you must wear a mask when using it. Sunscreens that use Zinc Oxide are the most effective, but if you are strictly against the use of any chemical additives, this step may be omitted.

, Use a low heat to prevent the ingredients from burning, and stir them constantly with a heat resistant spoon. Continue heating and stirring until the aloe gel turns into a liquid and combines with the oil.


Vitamin E oil nourishes and moisturizes the skin, and aloe vera is a cooling agent that can relieve your skin when it feels hot.

, Do not allow the gel to re-solidify, however. This second mixture should still remain in a liquid state.

,, For best results, mix the two liquids together using an electric mixer. Otherwise, use a whisk to beat the liquids together.

, Whisk or beat the oils in.


You can use just about any essential oil you want, but carrot seed oil and rose oil are both valued for their aromatic properties, and both have a natural SPF of about 30. You can also mix and match essential oils as long as the resulting smell suits your personal preferences.

, Plant oils tend to be sensitive to light, so the jar must be dark. Glass works best because it is the least reactive material.

, It should solidify within a few hours and be ready for use the following day. When properly stored, this sunscreen should last up to six months.

Chew when needed.",How to Make Lavender Breath Freshener," Many grocery stores sell lavender stems either in the spices or vegetable aisle. Farmer’s markets are another great source. You will need an estimated 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) of dry lavender for this recipe. Make sure that you purchase culinary lavender, as it is safe for consumption, as opposed to other types of lavender, such as ornamental.Once you find the lavender, conduct a sniff test. If the lavender emits a light fragrance, it is good to use. If it smells musty or has no odor at all, continue your search.Another option is to buy fresh lavender, bunch it with string and hang it upside down to dry. When it is fully dry and crisp to the touch, pull off the buds with your fingers and store them in a glass container for later use.;
, As it stands, your dry lavender buds are too bulky to include directly into the mixture. They need to be ground down into a fine powder. You can use a mortar and pestle, a clean coffee grinder, or a spice grinder to create the powder.If you use a coffee grinder, it may be helpful to grind a cup or so of buds at a time. Store any leftover powder in a glass container.
Remove any remaining plant bits or debris by running your powder through a fine sieve or strainer.
If you have a sweet tooth, you can always add confectioner’s sugar to the buds and grind them together for a sweeter base mixture. Just be careful that you monitor the sweetness level when you combine everything together in the final steps.

, Lavender is a very common essential oil available at most specialty food and health stores. However, although the Food and Drug Administration regulates the basic production of essential oils, the quality can vary widely so purchase with caution.Look for clear information on the bottle regarding origin, purity (you want 100% undiluted essential oil), and production claims. When in doubt, use the smell test again.

, Pull out a small bowl, a medium mixing bowl, a whisk, a spatula, a cooking sheet, and a roll of wax paper. You will also need measuring cups and spoons.

, Keeping your cooking space as clean as possible is important. Starting the process with clean hands prevents the contamination of the final product.

, Place 1 cup of the gum paste in a medium mixing bowl. Pour 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) of water into the bowl. Stir together with a spoon. You want a moldable-dough consistency. If you need to add more water, do so a few drips at a time.

Find a gay community that embraces your beauty.",How to Be Beautiful (for Gay Men)1," Gay men, in particular, may have had years of self doubt and questioning due to living with homophobia in all its forms. This takes time and effort to shake off!

You should also believe other people when they tell you you are beautiful. They are telling you the truth as they see it!;
, It can be hard to find stereotypically ""gay"" aspects of your composure or personality beautiful. This is because straight society has defined these things as undesirable. Instead of falling prey to these ideas, embrace your ""gay voice"" or mannerisms that are stereotypically associated with gay men.

, Attractiveness may have less to do with physical traits than other character traits, such as a sense of humor or a sharp intellect. Become really good at something. Do projects or hobbies you love to do. Develop a career that is fulfilling. Having passions, skills, and pursuits makes you a more interesting, and attractive, person.

, It can be easy to see someone and think, ""I wish I could look that good."" This can be especially hard in the gay community, where looks and traditional attractiveness tends to take center stage. However, this accomplishes nothing. Instead of comparing yourself to others, embrace your own looks.


Learn to recognize your own beauty, and let the good aspects of your looks and style make you feel more confident., There is no one way to be a beautiful and attractive gay man. Some gay men find skinny, hairless men beautiful. Other gay men prefer hairy, large men. In other words, if you want to feel beautiful you don't necessarily need to change yourself. Instead, you can surround yourself with people who like you as you are!


It is undeniable that it feels good when someone else thinks you are beautiful. If you are around people that fill you with self doubt and self hatred, those people are toxic. Find other people that can see the beauty that already exists in you.

Don't rub your face dry, or you could upset the skin., Brushing and flossing should be a part of your daily routine, at least twice each day. Proper dental care will help prevent bad breath and keep your teeth bright and healthy.


Use an 18 inch-long piece of dental floss to get between your teeth, starting with the top row and working your way to the bottom. Form a C-shape around each tooth to ensure you get all sides (including the backs of teeth).Use an antiseptic mouthwash to help kill bacteria in your mouth.

","How to Be Beautiful, Just Like Lauren Conrad"," This may sound a bit clichéd, but confidence is the most beautiful quality in a person and Lauren Conrad has lots of it. You can't be afraid to be yourself or wear what you want. The key step to being as beautiful as her is to be as confident as her. To be confident, you have to love who you are and don't beat yourself up. We all have our ""ugly days"" even celebrities, but you just need to stay strong and keep your confidence and self-esteem up. Treat yourself in the way that you would treat your best friend. In all truth, you are your best friend. You know yourself better than anyone ever will. Confidence also affects the way you act around people and the way you carry yourself. Confident people have a beautiful, strong energy about them that makes people attracted to them.;
, Lauren Conrad had an amazing fashion sense and is widely known for it. If you want to be like her you have to develop a good taste in clothes and fashion.If you have trouble with this step try reading lots of fashion magazines such as Vogue, Teen Vogue, Allure or Seventeen. Be confident in what you wear. If you think that you will never have the guts to actually wear something don't buy it! Try to keep up with fashion trends as good as you can, but they change frequently and some are just ridiculous or ridiculously expensive to follow. Remember always wear what you want and be yourself.

, Lauren has beautiful hair. She has long, blonde, beachy waves. Your can recreate the color by getting wheat or honey blonde highlights. For her waves you could try putting your hair in a loose bun or twist after a shower and then when it dries take it out. This usually produces great waves very similar to her style.Otherwise you could use different heat tools to recreate the style, but using those too much can cause lots of damage to your hair.

, She usually uses neutral colors on her eyes such as gold or beige or light pinks. They are very subtle colors but makeup should enhance your natural beauty, not cover it up and she is an excellent example of this. Her skin has a warm, tan glow. This can be achieved by using bronzer and a light, rosy blush color. She has lighter eyebrows and lashes so when using mascara try brownish-black or black, don't go too extreme.

, People are attracted to someone who is positive and friendly. Try to talk to people that you wouldn't normally speak to. If someone says something to you respond in a nice, calm manner. Don't be jealous or lie. Try to be as positive as possible.

, This can be achieved by two things, proper diet and exercise. Diet is very important. You will have to eat lots of fruits and veggies and try to cut out all red meats. Lean protein such as fish and chicken are the best. Replace most carbs with whole wheat substitutes. For exercise do cardio 3-5 days a week. Cardio burns fat. If you have muscles and do lots of strength training but no cardio you won't be able to see your muscles because they'll be covered by a layer of fat. Mix up the cardio, try running, jogging, swimming, boxing, biking or anything that gets your heart beating faster. Do light strength training with lighter weights about 2-3 times per week. It may seem like it takes longer but doing it the healthy way pays off.

, This not only allows you to know where everything is, but it's a great thing to go and unwind after a long day in a nice tidy bedroom.

, Every once in a while, it is a good idea to change your 'normal' style, so if you wear your hair in a ponytail one week, try a french braid the next. A change is good every so often.

, In today's society, it's important to keep up with the trends, but that is easier said then done. Wear whatever you feel comfortable in, whether it is a polo shirt and jeans or a skirt and cami, it's totally up to you and don't let anyone tell you otherwise.

Be alluring.",How to Be a Bombshell," We all know that a bombshell is a symbol of smoldering female sexuality. You can identify this symbol from a distance. Think 007 silhouettes - the bombshell silhouette has a gorgeous figure and the big, bodacious hair that completes the picture. Use shampoo and conditioner that keep your hair healthy and shiny, and hairspray and Velcro rollers to give your hair volume. A slightly tousled look is best -- one that says, I'm sexy, but I have better things to do than smooth my hair every time I finish romping around in bed. Stick with one hair color and style after you have chosen a good one.;
, Many girls commit the big mistake of thinking they'll look better with lots of makeup. That is a big lie. There's nothing sexy about LOOKING like you're trying too hard, and both men and women will think of you as a wannabe. Get inspiration from the bombshells like the Victoria's Secret models, their makeup is simple but sexy. Flawless skin with very little foundation, concealer and powder to set, nothing too heavy, and a little bit of eyeliner, mascara, blush and very natural looking lip gloss. The makeup on skin must be soft and colors must be subtle, in order to enhance your natural beauty instead of creating a whole new, fake face.

, Second to the hair, clothes are important. Find clothes that fit your shape. It doesn't matter if you are petite, short, tall or even plump. A bombshell knows that gorgeous women come in every shape and size -- and half the bombshell battle is knowing you've got that inner fire. Find clothes that fit your form. Feminine and ultra soft, with plenty of pink and red hues, and showing just hints of skin. Innocent yet suggestive, bombshell clothes manage to be risque without being trashy.

, You see models walking down the runway, right? In order to get that 'walk', you have to be confident and in control. A bombshell is never self-conscious; she's too busy being fascinated with the world around her. Be proud of yourself and be in control. Learn how to sashay.

, Be smart and informed when speaking, but not pushy, arrogant, or know-it-all. When you act this way, you will be showing that you are also intelligent along with being sexy.

, A bombshell is a sex symbol, and yet they have a slightly charming, childlike, naive mindset. Part of their allure is that while they are sexy, they are never trashy. They can avoid being vulgar, even when posing for playboy in the buff.

, Bombshells are not divas, nor are they self important, however, they love themselves as they are, and fully accept their flaws, physical or personality wise.

, Bombshells are engaging and caring. Always thinking of others, completely sensitive, a bombshell is a people person, perfectly willing to share her love and bare her soul. You need to make other people at ease with you as they are with themselves.

, Always keep people guessing. While you shouldn't daily change what you do, you should be spontaneous. Be suggestive, but not inappropriate. Wear a light and personal perfume that goes with your body and personality. Nothing too severe, girly, or boring.

The best and fastest way to get great skin is to drink lots of water, get plenty of sleep, and moisturize your skin daily., Keep your teeth as white as possible by using regular whitening treatments. You can use whitening toothpaste, gel strips, or go to regular dental cleanings to get that rich-person smile., If your hair is dyed, make sure you maintain the color regularly--don’t let your roots show or your color fade! Regularly trim your hair to avoid split ends. Keep your hair regularly conditioned and styled. If regular trips to the salon aren’t an option for you, you can learn how to take care of your hair at home.

, Many people can tell the difference between cheap makeup and expensive makeup, so keep your look as subtle as possible to avoid being noticed.Learn how to apply makeup correctly. Poorly-applied makeup will make it obvious that you aren’t wealthy. Watch makeup tutorials or visit your local makeup counter to learn the best makeup tricks.

Match your foundation to you skin. This is an essential step! If you can’t get matching foundation, it’s best to not wear any at all.

, Keep your nails clean, neatly trimmed, and polished--you can easily do this at home. Even a clear coat of nail polish will help you blend in. Check your nails every day for chipped paint, dirt, or uneven ends.

, Rich people don't wear dirty, wrinkled clothes, and you shouldn't either. Wash your clothes regularly and iron them every time you wear them., The best way to imitate the wealthy is to learn what they like to do and buy. You don’t have to actually buy high-end items, but being able to recognize them and reference them is essential!Watch reality shows about the wealthy. Many of the actors on these shows discuss their favorite brands, restaurants, vacation destinations, and beauty treatments. Learn from them!
Read fashion magazines. Magazines like Vogue can show you what the hottest luxury items are. Study them carefully.
Go to the mall and look at what’s on display in the nicest stores. Department stores are great for this--try Nordstrom, Neiman Marcus, or Macy’s.

, The rich avoid eating fast food or processed foods. It’s okay if you still eat them at home, but when you’re out, order salads, smoothies, and anything described as “local” or “sustainable.”If an entree is too expensive, just order an appetizer or side dish!

, Once you’ve learned about what the hottest cell phone or tablet is, either get it yourself or get a subtle cover for your own device. The latest Apple products are always popular, and you can also look into getting wearable technology. Many cell phone providers offer free devices with a new contract, and if you go to a university, they often rent tablets or laptops to students. If this isn’t an option, get the most subtle case you can find for your own device--a dark color or fake wood finish is best.

, High-end things don’t necessarily have to be expensive. It's better to buy from the clearance rack a a nice store than to buy regular price at a cheaper one.Shop at secondhand stores for designer bargains. Thrift stores, online consignment shops, and pawn shops can get you designer clothes or high-end electronics for much cheaper than retail.

, Follow the one-third rule: buy one-third as many things as you used to, but spend three times as much on each thing. Instead of buying six $10 shirts at a cheaper store, buy two $30 shirts at a fancier store., Some makeup and perfume stores will give you as many as you ask for without having to buy anything--just ask what their policy is!, Buying flashy clothes can backfire--if you wear the same pair of gold pants every time you go out, people will know that it’s your only nice pair. Buy simple, understated clothes and wear them repeatedly.Choose very simple black bags and shoes. It is much easier to blend in with a basic pair of black heels than it is to blend in with a flashy pair of shoes.
If you wear jewelry, go with small, delicate pieces. Big jewelry can look obviously fake.

, Cheap clothes that fit correctly will look better than expensive clothes that don’t. Try on everything before you buy it, and don't buy anything that doesn't fit., If you can pinch more than a centimeter of extra fabric at the tip of your shoulders, it’s too big. If you can’t move your arms freely, it’s too small.
Blouses and dresses should fit comfortably around your bust. If your outfit has buttons, there should never be a gap between the two sides of the buttons.
Pants should sit securely on your waist or hips, depending on the style. There should be no flesh bulging around the top of the pants, and you should not need to wear a belt to keep them on.
A fitted bra can drastically improve your appearance. If your bra is uncomfortable in any way, have yourself fitted at a department store or lingerie store.

, If you can, start visiting the places where the wealthy in your community hang out. Visit high-end stores, fancy restaurants, and trendy coffee shops. If you live near a ski area or equestrian club, visit those too.Find out what the hottest clubs and bars are in your area. Go just to be seen. If people know you hang out there, they'll think you're rich too.
You don’t have to regularly spend money at these places. Order a basic coffee, juice, or an appetizer at restaurants. If you’re at a store, you can always say you’re just browsing today.

, Most wealthy people are college-educated and up-to-date on current events. Read the news and arts sections of your local paper to learn what the wealthy are talking about in your area. If someone makes a reference you don't understand, look it up online later., The wealthy are expected to have good manners, so you should too. Don’t say rude or insulting things to people, say please and thank you, and introduce yourself to new people. If you are hosting others, open doors, offer them a seat, and bring them refreshments yourself.

, Don’t yell at anyone for any reason, even if you’re just having fun. Don’t share overly personal information with people you’ve just met, and don’t refer to embarrassing or personal things in conversation. A good rule of thumb is to avoid pushing information onto other people--let them pull it out of you., Remember, if you’re acting rich, you want to give the impression that you see nice things all the time. Don’t gush over expensive clothes or accessories, and don’t act like you’re afraid to try new things. On the other hand, you shouldn’t be dismissive or rude either--act interested, but not amazed."

Wash the bottle cap.,
Position the bottle cap in your cheek.,
Squeeze your cheek into the opening.,
Strike a pose.",How to Make Fake Dimples1," You can use either a metal or a plastic bottle cap, but since the cap will be going into your mouth, you need to make sure that it has been thoroughly cleaned, first.


Metal bottle caps are shallow and tend to produce more subtle, natural looking fake dimples. The ridges can be painful, though, especially if you have sensitive cheeks.
Plastic bottle caps come in a few different sizes. If you want really exaggerated dimples, use a soda bottle cap, since these tend to be the deepest types. For a more subtle option, though, grab a shallow water bottle cap.The solution should contain about 1 tsp (5 ml) salt for every 8 oz (250 ml) of water. Soak the cap for 15 minutes before rinsing it, drying it off, and placing it in your mouth.
You could clean the bottle cap with soap and water, but make sure that all the soap has been completely cleaned off before placing the cap in your mouth.
If using this technique, you should only create one dimple at a time. Bottle caps produce dramatic fake dimples, and having two dimples like this at once can overwhelm your face.;
, Open your mouth wide and place the bottle cap in inside, wedging it in between your your cheek and your teeth. Make sure that the opening of the bottle cap faces your cheek and not your teeth. It may take a little work before you figure out the right placement, so play around with it a little.

If you have a hard time figuring out where to place the cap, take it out of your mouth and smile in front of a mirror. Look for the outer creases the form on your cheeks when you smile. The cap should be placed just to the outside upper corner of the crease on one side of your face.

, Press on your cheek from the outside while simultaneously sucking on your cheek inward from the inside. Your cheek should firmly indent itself into the opening of the bottle cap.


If done right, you should even hear a small suction noise.
Be careful as you do this so that you do not accidentally inhale and choke on the bottle cap, especially if you are using a small metal cap.

, This fake dimple technique does not really work when you are in front of someone in person, but if you want to create a fake dimple for a photograph, it works well. Take a few pictures from a few different angles until you find the look you like best.


A popular way to pose with this fake dimple is to cover your mouth from below and turn your face so that the “dimpled” cheek faces the camera. Smile slightly, but do not allow the pressure to loosen from the bottle cap inside your mouth.This pose really accentuates the fake dimple while concealing any lines or bulges from the bottle cap, and it can also hide the fact that your mouth is not smiling quite as widely as it would usually need to if it were producing dimples that deep naturally.

"
"
Figure out the right placement.,
Draw a comma on your cheeks.Take a matte eye shadow or eye liner pencil and draw a small comma on your desired location.,
Brush in the eye shadow.,
Repeat as needed.,
Smile.",How to Make Fake Dimples2," Dimples can occur naturally on the outer corner of the lip or further up on the cheek. Figure out which look you want and estimate the best place to make your fake dimples.


Most natural dimples fall near the natural outer crease line of a smile. To figure out where dimples like these should go, smile in front of a mirror and pinpoint the accompanying creases. The dimple should go just outside of the creases on either side of your face.
For dimples that fall just to the outside of your lips, smile in front of a mirror and look for the smaller, inner creases that form just to the lower outside of your mouth. A fake dimple could be positioned along the inside curve of the creases on either side of your mouth.
If you have a hard time keeping an eye on the spot, you can make a small dot with your eyeshadow applicator or eye liner pencil to mark it. This dot should be as small as possible to prevent it from interfering with the final look.

, Draw lightly at first; it will be easier to darken your dimple later than it will be to lighten it.


Use a dark brown color for best results. Make sure that the color is matte. A glossy or sparkly cosmetic would not be suitable since it will make your fake dimples stand out too much and look too fake. Likewise, color other than a dark brown might also look fake.
The period or dot portion of the fake dimple should follow the natural curve of your lips when you smile. Imagine an invisible, diagonal line connecting the corner of your lips and the crease of your smile. The intersection of this line with your smile crease is the right point for your period to go.
Draw the tail of the comma directly below the period portion. This tale should be 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) or so long, and the curve should be about as subtle as the curve of your fingertip.

, Blend the cosmetic into your skin to make it look more natural. Start with a small makeup brush, applying even, rounded strokes that follow the curve of the mark. Fade the edges after you finish with the small brush by using a larger brush. Apply similar strokes with your larger brush.


If you cannot achieve the subtlety you want with your brushes, smooth the mark in further with your ring finger. Use the ring finger of your dominant hand since your other fingers may not be able to apply the right amount of pressure for adequate blending purposes. You should continue blending along the curve of the fake dimple, rather than blending against it.

, Create dimples on both cheeks for a more symmetrical look. If the marks are too light and the fake dimples do not stand out enough, you can apply more eye shadow or eye liner in the same spot and in the same manner.The right level of darkness can vary depending on why you want your fake dimples. If you want to wear them out and about, you should make them fairly subtle. Fake dimples that are too dark tend to have an obviously fake look.
On the other hand, if you only want fake dimples for a photograph, you might want to consider making them a little darker by using several applications of eye shadow or eye liner. This is especially worth considering if you are taking the photograph in poor lighting.

, These fake dimples will show up regardless of whether you smile or not, but a beautiful smile is the icing on the proverbial cake and can take your fake dimples from “okay” to “glamorous.”


You should also smile immediately after application for the purpose of checking your fake dimples. Take a good look in the mirror and determine if you have achieved the appearance you were hoping for. If not, do not hesitate to wash the makeup off and try again.

Get dimple piercings.Dimple piercings are fairly risky since you are dealing with an area more prone to infection than most.,
Consider cosmetic surgery.If you want something that looks more natural and will last for the rest of your life, learn about a plastic surgery procedure that will create dimple-like marks in your cheeks.",How to Make Fake Dimples3," If done right, though, dimple piercings can partially mimic the look of dimples. Keep the piercings if you want to permanently highlight the dimple area or take them out eventually so that the skin eventually heals, leaving behind a dimple-like indentation.


Due to the risks involved with dimple piercing, some professionals do not offer them at all. Others may offer them but often refuse them to anyone under the age of 18, even if that individual has the permission of a legal guardian.
Dimple piercings cut through muscle and usually cause some mild form of nerve damage. This nerve damage can help hold the dimples in place even after the piercing closes up, but it can also be risky and could do unforeseen harm.
The professional piercer should clean the outside of your cheek and should also instruct you to clean the inside of your mouth before making the dimple piercings. The needle and jewelry should also be sterilized.
The piercer will puncture both cheeks symmetrically, right at the spot where natural dimples would fall. Afterward, he or she will place a straight barbell or other piece of piercing jewelry into each hole to prevent it from closing immediately.
Your dimple piercings will need to be cleaned multiple times a day with a saline solution to prevent infection from setting in.
You can keep the dimple jewelry in permanently if desired, but you can usually take them out after three months have passed. If the piercing did the expected nerve damage, you should have an indentation in your cheek even after the skin heals over the original hole.

, Cosmetic surgery can be costly and does come with its own set of risks, but this option will give you fake dimples that look more natural than many other methods can.


A plastic surgeon will use local anesthesia for the procedure. He or she will make a small incision on the inside of the mouth and into the inner surface of the cheek. Using specialized tools, the surgeon will make an indentation in the cheek muscles and mucosal tissues. Afterward, the dimple divot will be held in place with internal stitches, and external stitches will be used to close the wound in the inner mouth.
For larger dimples, a plastic surgeon may perform a punch tissue excision. During this procedure, a portion of the cheek muscle is completely removed, creating a deeper and more obvious indentation.
In either case, the procedure will take an hour or less.
You should expect some pain, swelling, and bruising immediately after the procedure. The area is also weak to infection afterward, so you will need to carefully and thoroughly follow any instructions provided by the surgeon concerning proper wound care and cleansing.
For the first few weeks, your dimple-like indentations will be present at all times. Once your cheek muscles partially heal, though, you should only notice the marks when smiling.

The Ultimate Beauty Secret: A beauty regime is nothing without petroleum jelly.",How to Attain Effortless Beauty," Find a physical activity you really enjoy. It does not mean you need to run, do cardio, or do sit-ups. This can mean a yoga class, purchase a DVD for a dance routine, or even go bike riding. Sweat is a good thing, working out not only makes you look better, but it also helps you FEEL better. The key is to be a healthy you in the body you were born in.;
, When showering use a sweet smelling wash so you’ll feel good while getting squeaky clean. Try exfoliating 1-2 times a week with a sugar or oatmeal scrub. This makes your skin silky smooth due to removing all the dead skin cells from your body, making your skin glow.

, The purpose of shampooing is to remove dirt and oil from your hair and scalp. Do not leave shampoo in for longer than necessary to clean your hair, otherwise it will dry your hair out, no matter what brand the shampoo may be. Invest in an excellent conditioner. When your have rinsed the shampoo from your head, eliminate all excess water and concentrate the conditioner on your ends, clip your hair up and leave conditioner in for the remainder of your shower and rinse. This maximizes shine and healthy looking hair and will prevent knots. Olive Oil has been found best to keep your hair super soft and way shiny.

, Be sure to moisturize as soon as you step out of the shower or if possible, while you are still in the bathroom and you have just dried off. Your skin acts like a sponge and absorbs lotion most effectively when you have just finished your shower, so this is the best time to apply lotion in all areas.

, Your feet are often neglected, and you can often tell if a person really takes care of themselves by looking at their feet. Since the skin on your feet is very thick, use Body Butter here. Keep your toe nails short and clean, and ensure your polish is always fresh. Clear polish is best to those who are unable to keep up with the maintenance of feet due to busy schedules. Same with your hands, they are also often neglected. Keep nails short and clean and clear nail polish always works. It is best to have clear short nails than coloured but chipped nails.

, Keep acne blemishes under control with a great acne wash. One with salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide are most effective (Please remember to follow instructions stated on these products in order to avoid dryness or face irritation). Follow up with astringent if you are very acne prone, and if not use a skin evening toner. Lastly apply a moisturizer with a minimum of SPF 15 to protect your skin from premature ageing, fine lines, and wrinkles. The skin on your face is a canvas, with a flawless canvas you are confident and feel better about looking people right in the eyes.

, Eyebrows should be well kept, cleanly plucked and nicely trimmed. There are great market products that help remove facial hair you may have on your top lip. These work great, but nothing is perfect so you might have to pluck a hair or two. To get a close, clean shave on your underarms, legs, or bikini line, exfoliate first (to ensure you get all that dead skin off and you get a super close shave), use a moisturizing shaving cream (to moisturize as you shave and avoid dryness), and use a new clean blade and shave opposite of hair growth (new blade to avoid bacteria from entering into those little nicks that occur with shaving).

, With perfumes, less is more! Apply perfume to your skin only! If applied to your clothes this might just be overwhelming. Apply dabs to your pulse points which are: Wrists, neck, cleavage, behind your knees, inside your elbows and behind your ears. Behind your knees?!! Yes! Scents travel up, so this way your scent stays with you. It is best to have one quality perfume than many mediocre perfumes.

, There is no doubt that dental hygiene will make or break you. Floss at least once a day, brush at least twice a day and use a total care mouth wash at the end of the night. Your teeth may not be the whitest or the straightest, but a clean germ free mouth is the closing point to this effortlessly beautiful regime I have provided. Smiling is an instant boost and when you have the best smile you can have, it can take you from 0 to 60 in no time.

, This has got to be the best beauty product fr an effortlessly beautiful woman. If applied at night, petroleum jelly creates super soft, healthy lips. It has been shown to strengthen and lengthen eyelashes and eyebrows. It relieves cracked skin you may get on your elbows, and it is a wonderful eye make up remover!

Stay away from the drama.",How to Look Sexy," There are two kinds of sexy: there's the traditional Jessica Rabbit sexy and then there's the kind of sexy that's more down-to-Earth. By conforming to one or the other, you'll be attracting people that are looking for different things. Use this to your advantage, to help you get what you're looking for.


Traditional sexy is great when you're trying to attract more temporary partners. This is because a lot of traditional sexy is about putting on a show, which hides or downplays your natural personality and looks (sending the message that you don't really care if someone likes you for who you really are).
The more natural sexy plays up your inherent personality and looks. This tells someone that you want to be thought of as sexy for who you really are, usually leading to someone who's looking for something more long-term. This kind of sexy tends to not get you very far when you're young, since often people aren't looking for their future spouse at 16, but it can be crucial to attracting good, stable people when you're an adult.;
, Confidence is the number one most sexy quality. Even people who don't have much to offer in the looks department can still manage to come across as sexy if they balance confidence with other attractive qualities, like personality, charm, and humor.


Act confident by working on your self esteem, standing up straight, speaking up for yourself, and starting conversations with people you don't know.

, While the 80s might have been all about piling on the dyes, makeup, and shoulder pads, these days sexy is about looking good in your natural state. Makeup should be subdued and look as close to your natural coloring as possible. The same tends to go for your clothes: skinny jeans or leggings, which show off the natural curve of your legs, are preferred over flare legged pants.


Play up your best features when you can, to really show off that natural beauty. For example, if your best feature is your eyes, don't hide them behind glasses.

, Practice good hygiene by bathing regularly, brushing your teeth, and wearing clean clothes. You should also exercise and eat a proper diet to get a stronger, healthier body. Doing things like this not only makes your body more appealing to others, but it shows that you think you're worth loving and taking care of, indicating a vital self-respect.


If you need help with exercise, see this article.
If you need help eating healthy, see this article.

, Smell plays a big role in sex appeal, but you might not be taking as good an approach as you think you are. Contrary to what Axe would have you believe, your best bet is a natural smell, not a cloud of body spray. Bathe regularly to cut down on the BO that scares people off and use a subtle but pleasant deodorant to keep the smell from returning. Pair with a subtle cologne or perfume (citrus is the most universally liked) if you really want to, but you should be letting your natural pheromones do most of the work.


Practice good dental hygiene as well. This includes brushing, flossing and even mouth wash. Clean your tongue with a tongue cleaner or a spoon every morning for fresh breath. Get a check up and have your teeth cleaned often.

, A haircut can make a world of difference in how everyone sees you. Generally, you want a sleeker look to appear more sexy, but ""natural"" waves and curls are also in right now. Experiment on your own or consult with a hair stylist to find a hairstyle that looks sexy and plays up all your best features.

, You want to project as adult look in order to come across as sexy. Cute looks or young looks will either overtly or subtly turn most people off. Update your wardrobe to look more adult (not slutty, just skip out on cartoon tees and lacy dresses). You'll also want to take a few other measures, depending on your gender.


Women: wear clothes that show your curves. You want to look like you've got hips and at least a little breast. Get a nice push-up bra and wear things like skinny jeans to show off your legs. You'll also want to wear heels to correct your posture and lift your butt.
Men: Trade in those ratty jeans for some slacks and that tee shirt for a button up. Your local thrift store should have plenty of cheap options if you don't have the money for new stuff. Shoes are also important. Have at least a few nice pairs.

, Different people are looking for different kinds of partners, and there are specific ways you can dress that attract those different kinds of people. People are often attracted to the qualities that they prioritize in themselves so by dressing a particular way, you'll send a clear message about what you like and what kind of person you want to date.


For example, if you're looking for a sporty person, wear your hair in a ponytail or sport the occasional hiking outfit or football jersey.
If you're looking for a bit of a geek, wear some Marvel merch or your favorite bow tie.
If you're looking for someone who's very driven, tend towards nicer, dressier clothes.

, Whether you're worried about stuffing a bra or about making your crotch look a little more full: don't. Media plays up the idea that women want guys with big crotches and guys want women with big breasts, but the actual spectrum of preferences pretty equally runs the gamut. Lots of guys like small breasts and lots of women look at big crotch, and just think ""Ouch!"".

, Talent is one of the easiest ways to come across as totally sexy, even when you aren't traditionally attractive. This describes most rock stars, especially from the days before auto tune. You can take a talent you already possess and make it even more impressive, or you can learn a whole new talent. You can find basic primers on many skills right here on wikiHow, or you can take classes or even just teach yourself using online materials.


Talents you could try include playing guitar or piano, drawing, fixing cars or other mechanical devices, computer technology skills, or other talents that speak to you.

, There's nothing quite as sexy as a look of passionate determination on someone's face. When you really care about something and you're working hard to get it, that really impresses people. They hope to have that same quality themselves and by having you around it inspires them. We also feel comforted, know that a potential partner could carry our weight if something ever happened to us. Find a goal for yourself and work hard to achieve it, whether it's working towards a future career or working to gain an important skill. Just wanting more from life and being able to try to get it can often be enough, if you lack direction or are too young to really know what you want to do.

, People don't fall for one-dimensional characters: they like people with quirks and interesting things about them. Think of it this way: would Joe Schmoe rather go for the cute waitress or would he rather go for the cute waitress who also dreams of being a nurse? By having qualities and dreams that are uniquely you, you show people a more interesting, more engaging person. Basically, there's just more to love. Let your interests and passions shine through and pursue new things that help you develop as a person.

, Stop trying to be someone else. Often we think we have to act like someone else in order to be sexy (girls emulating Kim Kardashian or guys trying to be Tom Brady). But being them isn't sexy because it shows that you're obviously trying too hard and lack your own merits. Be you, like the things that you like, and don't apologize to anyone. That shows confidence, which is one of the sexiest things out there.

, If you've got a great sense of humor, you're set. Even the most unattractive funny guys get all the ladies, right? Try to develop your sense of humor by watching stand up comedy and paying more attention to what's going on around you. It's a habit that can be learned. And don't feel limited if you're a lady: a funny girl is just as sexy as a funny guy. People just like to laugh, it helps them when they're having a rough time, and so this is a quality that many people look for in a partner.

, People naturally find evolutionary advantages to be sexy, even when they aren't looking for something long term. Be good with kids (even if you don't like them or don't want them yourself) and be kind and helpful to everyone around you. This will melt the heart of anyone you try to charm.

, A little mystery is pretty sexy, right? But that doesn't mean you should play out your life like a bad modern fantasy novel. You don't need to act like you've got some tragic backstory or keep one eye constantly covered by hair. Instead, just be a bit reserved. Don't automatically divulge every detail of your life. By creating this mystery, you throw down the challenge to someone that they should get to know you better and find what secrets lay beneath.

, We often communicate with people without using any words at all and the universal sexy language is really the language of the eyes. Try looking at them through your lashes with a playful smile on your face and then occasionally look away as you talk to them.


A little lip licking or biting is also a common sexy look.
Practice in the mirror. This is very important. You need to get used to making these motions and also have a good understanding of how they work and look good.

, This goes beyond just liking your body and having good self esteem, although you should totally do those things! Getting comfortable in your body means being good with moving your body. Work on developing your grace. Learn to dance. This will make all of your movements more natural and less awkward, adding to your sexiness factor.

, Sexy voice is difficult to teach, because a lot of it will depend on what your natural voice is like. However, it's worth at least trying to work on, because used sparingly and in the right situations, you'll have an incredibly powerful tool in your hands.


A good rule of thumb is to pitch your voice a little lower, speak slightly slow, and a bit quieter than normal.
You can practice by recording your voice and listening to yourself. Adjust until you reach a tone that you think sounds good.

, For many people, seeing someone who is usually very well dressed looking way more casual can be very sexy. This creates a feeling of intimacy, like they're the only one who gets to see you as you really are. You can try letting your boyfriend see you in your pajamas or wearing nothing but his tee shirt, or let your girlfriend see you without all that gel in your hair (girls love the bed head look).

, The ridiculous shows to try to look sexy are a turn-off for most people. Real life doesn't work like reality shows. You also don't want to keep your life full of drama. Constant fights and negative talk or gossip is a huge turn off for most people. When you act like this, it tends to make people just wonder if you'll talk behind their back too if they dated you.

Maybe you have elegant collar bones, strong, sturdy thighs or set of wide, quarterback-caliber shoulders. Whatever it is, don't be afraid to play it up! When you shop for clothes, choose your hairstyle, and pick out colors to wear, think about how you can make your favorite features stand out.

The change you make can be small, like buying more v-necks to reveal your pretty neck, or putting your baseball hats away to show off your high, handsome forehead.
On the other side of the coin, you can downplay features you don't want to show off. Don't get too carried away with this, though - it'll be obvious you're trying to hide something. Instead, focus on the features you're proud to accentuate.;
, Hair is one of the first things people notice about each other, so looking your best means finding a style and hair care routine that makes your hair look great. No matter what your hair color, texture and length, there's a style out there that will bring out its beauty. To find that look that works best for you, try the following:


Find a haircut that works for your face shape. For example, longer, layered looks look great with oval-shaped faces, while pixie cuts are pretty on rounder faces.

Care for your hair in a way that keeps it healthy. Dying it too much, using glue-in weaves, chemical straightening and other treatments can damage your hair, making it look dry, dull or limp.

Style your hair every day before you go out, even if it just means combing it and adding some pomade or gel. If you're going to a fancy event, take the time to wash, dry and style it well.

If you have facial hair, keep it neat and trimmed, whether you have a full beard or long sideburns.

If you're losing hair, there are a number of methods you can try to make it thicker. However, don't feel like you have to cover it up with a combover or cap. Getting regular trims and washing your hair regularly will keep you looking nice. Own your hair, no matter what it looks like!

, Your eyes are an important feature to think about when you're getting ready for your day - after all, everyone you talk to is going to have the opportunity to look at them closely. Making your eyes look great starts with getting a good night's sleep, but there are a few things you should do in the morning to make sure they look bright and attractive:

Moisturize the area around your eyes. Use a cream to moisturize your eyelids, under your eyes, and in the creases near your temples. You can use a moisturizer every night before going to sleep, too.
Keep your eyebrows neat. Use a tweezers to shape your eyebrows, or go to a salon to get them waxed or threaded. This will bring out the best in your eye shape.

Take care of undereye circles by applying cool cucumber slices or teabags for 5 minutes.
Wear eye makeup if you'd like. Eyeliner, eye shadow, and mascara work together to make your eyes look bigger and brighter.

, Wearing a genuine smile will truly capture people's attention. If you tend to walk around looking solemn, you'll give people the impression you're closed off, and they'll look away. Plus, frowning creates wrinkles and doesn't give your facial features the chance to shine. Having an easy smile is a simple way to make yourself look better every day.


If there's anything preventing you from wanting to smile more, take measures to change it. For example, if you're self-conscious about your teeth, have them straightened or whitened.
Brushing your teeth every morning before you go out will help your smile look bright and attractive.
Condition your lips with chapstick so you won't hesitate to smile wide. You might also consider using a lip scrub to exfoliate your lips if they tend to get dry and flaky.

, Improving your posture is an easy fix that will make a huge difference in your appearance right away. If you tend to hunch a little bit, make a conscious effort to stand up straight. Throw your shoulders back and keep your head erect. When you're seated, don't slouch in your chair. No matter what type of figure you have, you'll look better if your posture is upright and elegant.


Improving your posture takes some practice. You'll have to consciously stand up straight and sit erect for weeks before it comes naturally. It can help to stretch and do light exercises each day.

, This is an important way to look your best, but it eludes a great number of people. You may aspire to fit into a size that's a little too small, or perhaps you drape yourself in fabric in order to hide something you don't particularly want to show off. Either approach to wearing clothes results in a distorted look. Put your best foot forward by choosing clothes that are the correct size for you. Believe it or not, you will look a lot better!



Wearing a bra that fits well can drastically change your appearance. Spring for a great bra and you'll notice the difference.
Shapewear only goes so far to smooth out your curves. The better approach is to choose clothing that fits well, rather than trying to squeeze into a size too small.

, Do you love wearing shorts in the summer, but you're embarrassed to expose your thighs? Wear them anyway! Wear sleeveless shirts, take off the bulky sweatshirt, and put on strappy sandals when you feel like it, no matter your body shape. If you're covering yourself up when you wish you could wear something less confining, it will show in your demeanor. Unless you want to do this for personal reasons, there's no reason you can't bare as much skin as you want, no matter your size or shape.


That said, don't bare too much skin in venues where it's inappropriate. You wouldn't want to show up in a short cocktail dress when everyone else is wearing formal floor-length gowns, or wear a sleeveless shirt to a nice event where others are wearing collared button-downs.

, Your style should start with what feels good to wear, be it high heels and pearls or a t-shirt and shorts. Work on figuring out what style of clothing makes you feel the most like yourself, and the most confident presenting yourself to other people. It doesn't matter what your style is; as long as its an expression of your personality, you'll be able to rock it.


If you've always worn a black hoodie and jeans, and you're not sure how to branch out, start by changing up one piece at a time. Wear a neatly ironed collared top instead of a sweatshirt one day. Does it make you feel good? Do you feel like yourself in it? If not, try a different style next time. Keep changing it up until you start getting a feel for what you like.
Swapping clothes with a stylish friend can be a helpful way to experiment without shelling out too much money. Also consider shopping at thrift stores, where there's a huge selection of a range of different styles.

, It can really help to have good examples of the type of people wearing the clothing and hairstyles you like. Is there a celebrity or other public figure whose style is particularly attractive to you? Once you have a few people in mind, pay attention to how their wardrobes are built. What colors and fabrics do they tend to rely on? How is their clothing usually cut? What accessories do they wear most often? When you have a clear picture, you can start incorporating similar pieces into your wardrobe and trying them out for yourself.


Style blogs are filled with pictures of people trying out different outfits. Find a few bloggers who have taste similar to yours and following along - they'll often give details about where their clothes come from. The great thing about blogs is that they're created by people of all backgrounds, shapes and sizes, so unlike fashion magazines, they reflect reality. That's a lot more helpful when it comes to figuring out what might work for your particular features.

, Do you lean toward cool tones or warm tones? Do you love black and white or prefer muted earth colors? Preferences aside, knowing what looks great with your particular complexion can help you look more beautiful. As a general rule, try to choose colors that don't exactly match your skin - contrast is good!If your skin is dark, choose warm-toned pastels, bright colors and rich, deep colors like copper and gold.
If your skin is medium, choose jewel colors or shades of blue or red, and steer clear of brown or tan colors.
If your skin is olive, go with pink, red, green or brown to bring out the best in your skin.
If your skin is fair, peach, strawberry, navy and dark green will all help accent your rosy hue.

, It's also OK to throw style rules out the window and just wear whatever you want - as long as you feel comfortable in it. Maybe you've heard that tall people shouldn't wear high heels - so what? If you like them, wear them. Or on the other end of the spectrum, it's commonly said that shorter people shouldn't wear maxi skirts - but if you have a gorgeous one in your closet, you'd better not let it languish there! What matters when it comes to style is your confidence. If that's there, heads will turn as you pass by, and people will want to know your secret.

, Sunglasses, jewelry, watches, bags, and other accessories can add just the right touch to an outfit. They help you look more put together, which is an important part of looking your best. After getting dressed, decide how to complete your look.


A solid-colored top usually pairs well with a statement necklace, which adds a bit of interest to the look.
If your hair is pulled back, consider putting on a pair of earrings to draw attention to your chin.
Men can accessorize with watches, ties and cufflinks, as well as other jewelry.

, Part of looking your best is looking the part - and that means putting a little forethought into your outfits. While there's nothing wrong with standing out, you should do it in a way that also allows you to fit in. Don't wear something so out of place that people are distracted by your outfit instead of seeing the person wearing it.


If you're going to a special event, find out if there's a dress code. Find a way to adhere to it that allows you to express your personal style.

, No matter what you're wearing, if your skin looks dull and dry you won't be showing the world your best self. Have a skin care routine that makes you look fresh, healthy and vibrant from head to toe. This will mean different things for different people, but there are a few general approaches that make sense for everyone:


Wash your skin without using harsh detergents. Use a gentle soap that will encourage your skin to retain moisture, which helps it look healthy.
Exfoliate your skin a few times a week. Use a dry brush or a body scrub to slough off dead skin cells.
Moisturize your skin with lotion, cream or oil to keep it supple and soft.

, These two simple grooming habits will help you look clean and fresh, even if you're not wearing anything particularly special.



Give yourself a manicure or pay for one every few weeks.
Decide what hair you want to keep and what you want to remove. Shave, wax, or thread the hair that you'd prefer not to have.

, For a healthy body shape and vibrant hair and skin, it's important to eat plenty of vitamins every single day. Cut back on sugar, processed foods, refined flour, salty food, and fried food for better overall health - and a more beautiful appearance. Incorporate more of the following foods into your diet:


Fruits and vegetables. The importance of eating a variety of fruits and vegetables- preferably steamed, sauteed or blended, rather than juiced, fried or boiled - cannot be understated. Try to make fruits and veggies the bulk of your diet.
Healthy fats. Eat avocados, nuts, fish, eggs, and other healthy fats containing omega-3 fatty acids for healthy skin, hair and organs.
Lean protein. Go for chicken, fish, eggs, lean beef, pork, tofu, and other good sources of protein. Steer clear of processed meats, like lunch meat or beef jerky, since these have lots of additives.
Whole grains. Oatmeal, spelt, whole wheat, and other whole grains are also part of a balanced diet.

, If you feel tired, dull, and a little lifeless, perk yourself up by drinking water. Lots of it. It will have a huge impact on the appearance of your hair and skin, as well as giving you more energy - which, in turn, will also help you look your best. Aim to get at least 8 glasses every single day.


Replace sugary drinks with water or herbal tea whenever possible.
Avoid drinking too much alcohol - over time, it will definitely affect the appearance of your body and face, not to mention making you feel ill or sad the day after drinking. When you do drink, have a glass of water for every glass of alcohol.

, Using tobacco products is a sure way to age your skin and hair, and that won't help you look your best. Start taking steps to quit smoking and using other tobacco products as soon as you can.

, Getting your blood flowing and strengthening your muscles will help you look your very best. Your skin will have a healthy flush, your posture will improve, and your arms, legs and torso will look more shapely. If you don't already exercise, it's never too late to start.


Weight training is key when it comes to building muscle.
Consider joining a team to get exercise and socialize at the same time.
Try yoga if you're not into high-energy sports.

, Part of looking your best is being aware of your body's needs and making time to meet them. When you're feeling run down and stressed, your body suffers, and it shows. It's important to learn how to take care of yourself well. You'll know you're doing it right when you look in the mirror and see that healthy, happy glow.


Get plenty of sleep. Try starting a schedule so you can make sure you get at least 7 to 8 hours every night.
Take time to relax. Whatever you do to relax, make time for it several times a week. Take a long, hot bath, go for a walk, hang out with friends, play some video games, read a book or cook yourself a healthy meal.
Go to the doctor regularly. Staying on top of any health problems is an important part of self care, too. Take care of medical problems before they get out of hand.

Pay attention to the grooming details.",How to Look Good Naked," Poor body image tends to come from three main sources: peers, parents, and standards of beauty that come from the media.All of these sources are external. So, try not to compare and contrast yourself with others, as that’s a sure way to downplay your own attractiveness. Instead, focus on your own definition of beauty and the characteristics that make you beautiful., If no one is around to see you, develop your confidence by walking around the house naked for a little while. If there are other people in the house, get in a little naked time by doing some of your post-shower hygiene routine before putting your clothes on. If you have someone you are romantically intimate with, ask him or her to spend some time being naked with you. Over time, you'll grow an appreciation for your natural body.

, Even when you’re naked, most people will notice your face first. Your expression there will set the context for everything else they see, so give them a winning smile and show off your confidence. Add good eye contact, and you'll look irresistible.


To ensure a good smile and good breath, floss and brush your pearly whites. You might look for toothpaste approved by the American Dental Association.Rinsing with mouthwash will help as well.
Make sure your eyes look great by getting plenty of rest at least a few nights before. Also consider trying out brightening eye drops, but consult an eye doctor first. Certain eye drops can actually constrict blood vessels., Chances are, people who see you naked aren’t thinking what you think they’re thinking, regardless of gender. Research suggests that men, as much as women, want to feel attractive during intimate moments.Fake it ’til you make it.No one is 100% satisfied with how they look. So, everyone who’s confident in their naked selves is faking it to a certain extent and in a healthy way. Why not you too?
Don’t apologize. Avoid drawing attention to anything negative or anything you might perceive as negative—verbally or even mentally, as much as you can avoid it. And never apologize for the way you look!

, Standing or sitting with good posture will make you look taller, slimmer, and more confident. Imagine there’s a string running all the way through your body, from the base of your spine to the top of your head, and alter your posture as if the string is being pulled taut. Just don't stand so stiff you look strained and tense.


Notice your chin lift from your neck, making it appear more elongated.
Your shoulders should also move down and backward.
Your stomach should pull inward and upward (smoothing out any rolls), and your back will settle into a natural arch that pushes out both the butt and the chest.

, When lying on a bed or couch, lie on your side to give off good body language. This posture will also make your waist appear smaller and, with the lower arm under your chest, prop up your upper body as well., Try this old modeling trick, meant to make people look better on a two-dimensional plane. Aim to stand or sit on the diagonal, with a slight twist at the waist instead of facing someone head-on.This will naturally cinch in your waist. Further, walk with one foot directly in front of the other, forcing your waist to again twist back and forth. This sort of fluid motion will make you seem more trim overall.

, Everyone has parts of their body they are particularly happy with. How you position your body will “direct traffic” to or away from certain body parts. Here are some suggestions:


Put a hand on your hip. If you like your waist, draw the eye there by putting a hand on one hip. Twist your torso slightly to accentuate the narrowness of your waist even more.
Arch your back. Arching your back will play up your chest and butt, making them appear more prominent. Women can also lift their rears a bit by putting on a pair of high heels.
Point your toes and cross your legs slightly. If you want to direct attention to your legs, keep your toes pointed and your legs slightly crossed, so that they overlap a bit. This will make them appear longer and smoother.
Push your chest forward. To make your chest appear bigger, drop your shoulders and fold your arms around your waist, so that each hand lands on the opposite waist curve.
Raise your arms over your head and flex a bit. Even less muscular men and women can show off the muscles in their arms and shoulders by lifting their arms and flexing their triceps and biceps a bit.

, Knowing that you smell amazing will help you radiate confidence in your body. Put on deodorant, and wear a body spray, perfume, or cologne—but only enough of the latter that only someone close enough to embrace you would smell. If you're completely out of time and worried about smelling bad, splash some hand sanitizer or water under your armpits to eliminate odor.

, Turn off glaring overhead lights and fluorescents, and opt instead for soft, glowing light sources.Light candles, or turn on a lamp. If the lamp is still too bright, throw a sheer scarf or sheet over it, or if you can, point it to shine on the wall instead of into the room. Position yourself so that the lighting is behind you, showing off your confident silhouette instead of any flaws you might be worried about.

, Make sure your hygiene is at its best before you get bare. If you have time, take a shower or bath to wash and condition your hair and gently clean and exfoliate your whole body. You'll come out looking great and glowing! Just don't scrub yourself red and raw if your skin doesn't have time to recover, and don't spend so much time in the water that your hands start to wrinkle.

, Nudity usually comes with (or at least gives the appearance of) a degree of intimacy. For this reason a hairstyle that looks relaxed and casually confident is often better than something tightly gelled or elaborately coiffed. The fewer pins and ties in your hair, the more natural you will look.


Create appealing bed-head. Before you strip down, run your fingers through the roots of your hair making a scrubbing motion. You can also apply a root-lifting product in horizontal sections where the hair meets the scalp, and blow dry. Alternatively, you can hang dry hair upside down, and point a blow dryer on a cool air setting up at it. For last-minute lift, spray dry shampoo on your roots. Let it dry for a few minutes before mussing your hair with your fingers.

, Wear a full face of product if that's your preference, or go natural. Play up your cheeks with a light pink or coral blush that will make them look naturally flushed, and add a lip color that's one shade darker than your natural tone. At the very least, try to apply lip balm for smoother lips.


Don't overdo the makeup. When you are nude, bold makeup colors don’t have clothes to compete with for attention. If you put on too much makeup, it will be more obvious when you are naked. On the other hand, you can keep attention on your face by applying an eye-catching shade of lipstick.
Use moisturizer. Lotion, body oil, or other moisturizers will prevent your skin from drying out, give it a healthy sheen, and make your skin particularly soft to the touch. Avoid products with parabens and other toxic ingredients., Be bold and highlight your natural beauty with accessories. A necklace, scarf, or feather boa are great choices for women, and guys might want to consider dog tags, a nice watch, or even a tie. Pick something fun and unusual. You can use it to play with if you're a bit nervous, and it can nicely complement your au naturel state.

, Without clothes on, you will naturally need the air to be a little warmer to stay comfortable. Although the cold will make ladies’ breasts stand at attention, guys don't get the same benefits—and shivering with hunched shoulders isn’t a sexy look for anybody. Don’t crank up the heat too far, either: a glow is good, but sweating profusely is not. Aim for a little above room temperature, which is approximately 70 degrees Fahrenheit (21 degrees Celsius).

, Immediately before you plan to be naked, avoid foods that cause gas and bloating, such as beans, carbonated beverages, dairy products, and foods with high levels of fructose and unrefined sugars.If your stomach expands anyway, try to go for a walk or make a trip to the bathroom—both will help move things along, so to speak.


Over the longer term, try to incorporate healthy, slimming foods into your diet, such as fresh produce and items that contain omega-3 fatty acids.

, It might seem obvious, but a healthy diet and exercise will improve your skin and body in a variety of ways—and make you feel better and more confident in general. Here are some mostly-painless ways to start.


Incorporate 10 or 20 minutes of light stretching or weight training into your day, and try to walk when possible. You'll notice a difference over the course of a few weeks.
Tailor your exercise plan to your goals. If you want to lose weight, calorie restriction and cardio exercises are going to be your ticket. If you want to gain muscle, progressive weight training and getting enough protein is what you need.
Consider getting a personal trainer. They can help you identify your goals and guide you toward them with expert knowledge and experience. If you're new to getting fit, a personal trainer will be the best way for you to ensure success.

, When you're naked, glowing skin can become your best accessory. Exfoliate your skin regularly, especially rough patches like elbows and knees, to remove dead cells. An exfoliating brush, glove, or loofah can help, as can scrubs with beads, salts, or other natural exfoliating substances.

, If you want your skin to look glowing, try applying a tinted moisturizer or bronze tanning lotion on your body. Exfoliate first, and be careful that you do this far in advance of having anything else touch your skin; you could stain something before the product dries fully. After your first coat has set, apply additional tanner to areas you would like to look leaner, like your thighs or waist. This gives a slimming shadow look.Remember that tanning is best in moderation—too much will look more alien than attractive. And when in the presence of the real sun, wear sunscreen and avoid harsh UV rays.

, You might find that you feel and look better naked with a little body hair management. Many women choose to de-fuzz their armpits, legs, back, bikini line, or pubic area. Many men also trim or shave their private region and keep an eye on the rest of their body hair, at the very least trimming down lone hairs that grow too long. Here are some methods to do so, from least time-consuming upward.



Shaving. Use a safety or straight razor to remove excess hair. Shaving is best done in the shower, while your skin is surrounded by plenty of moisture, and with some sort of shaving cream or hair conditioner applied to your skin first. Watch out for razor bumps and ingrown hairs, and make sure to shave shortly before you plan to be naked to avoid the appearance of stubble.

Waxing. Waxing will remove unwanted body hair for 4 to 6 weeks. However, the process is a lot more painful than shaving, and it can be harmful to people with certain skin sensitivities. Book an appointment at a salon for a consultation to figure out if waxing is the right choice for you. Never wax yourself at home, unless you're an experienced esthetician, or you have one helping you. You could seriously damage your skin if you do it wrong.

Threading. Threading is similar to plucking, and pulls individual hairs out with tiny knots on a string of thread. Book an appointment at a local threading salon to find out more. This also works to remove unwanted eyebrow hair.
Electrolysis or laser hair removal. These procedures are administered by a licensed professional over a long period of time, and usually result in dramatically reduced hair growth.
Pluck any strays. After you've used the hair removal method of your choice (or not), clean up stray hairs on the shoulders, back, chest, abdomen, legs, or feet with a pair of tweezers.

, Without your clothes, your hair will be about the only way to make a fashion statement. Try to make it look soft, healthy, and touchable, and consider dying it a color that best suits your skin tone.


Apply color touchups to your hair, if needed. A root touchup or quick professional or self-coloring job can help reduce or eliminate gray hairs, if you’re going for a more youthful appearance. You might also consider a few sporadic highlights to draw attention to your hair.

Choose a haircut that flatters the shape of your face and is in proportion to the size of your body. Finding a great stylist and visiting often will keep your hair fresh and fashionable.

, Clear skin is appealing, and as such, acne can only get in the way of showing off your best self. Luckily, there are plenty of simple ways to get rid of acne. Severe acne might require help from a dermatologist, but for light acne, there are natural remedies that can help in a pinch.Apply ice. Ice can help reduce swelling in early-stage pimples. Apply ice wrapped in cloth for a few minutes, remove, then repeat.
The anti-bacterial and anti-fungal properties in tea tree oil makes it an excellent tool to help with acne relief. Just apply to the affected area.
Apply toothpaste to a pimple for an easy night-before treatment. Apply it to the area at night and wash it off in the morning.

, Jagged nails, white knuckles, and the smell of onions you cut for dinner stir-fry just aren’t flattering. Clip your nails to an appropriate length, wash your hands and feet, and apply some lotion if they’re dry. Additionally, consider getting a manicure and pedicure.


Whiten your teeth. Whitening your teeth will help make your smile pop. Consider whitening toothpaste, trays, strips, or pens. You can also have your teeth bleached or laser whitened by a dentist.

Be able to walk confidently in heels. In some cases, wearing especially high-heeled shoes may actually make you come off as immature. You do not want to look like a girl wearing mom's shoes. Teetering and tottering while walking looks like you are inexperienced and therefore childish rather than mature.;
, Clothing is one of the easiest ways a person can control his or her appearance. Wearing clothing that indicates maturity is one way to project an ""aged up"" look.


Blouses and dress shirts often look more adult than t-shirts or other types of tops. While people of all ages love wearing t-shirts, they tend to project a spirit of youth, rather than someone with a job. Wear tailored tops with collars instead.
Avoid novelty clothes. This includes t-shirt with cartoons characters, band logos, or jokes on them.
Avoid embellishments. Juvenile clothing tends to have bows, sparkles, beads, and other such flourishes. Adult clothing does not have nearly as much.
Pick subdued colors, rather than flashy colors. Older women tend to wear neutrals: black, grey, brown, white, and so on. (Of course they can wear any color, but these tend to be staples of an adult wardrobe). Avoid colors that tend to be worn by children, such as bubblegum pink.
Nice cottons and denims, cashmere sweaters, silk shifts, and linen dresses are all good choices for people who want to look like they've got some life experience. Put away the polyester, rayon and stretch pants.
Keep athletic wear for workouts. Most athletic-style wear looks casual, and that tends to give off a vibe of youth. The possible exceptions are polo shirts and good-quality golfing or tennis clothing.
If you're a teenager and you normally shop in the juniors' section of the department store, go to the adults' section next time for good examples of the kind of clothes that'll make you look a little older.

, Adults wear patterned clothing, but they are not typically as whimsical as clothes designed for children. Stick with classic patterns such as florals, stripes, plaids and paisleys. Polka dots and animal prints (such as leopard print) are classic choices, but may still come off as youthful.


Wear jewel tones instead of pastels. Pastels and neon bright colors tend to look more childlike than bold colors (red, navy blue) and muted color schemes (such as mauve or beige).

, Wearing clothing with Hello Kitty or Disney characters on them scream childish. Younger styles will make you look younger, simply put. If you naturally have a young-looking face, wearing clothes that fit you well and cover more of your body might be the key to looking a bit older. Avoid the following clothes and styles:


""Daisy Dukes"": denim shorts cut extremely high in the leg and tight fitting in the posterior.
Mini-skirts
Novelty t-shirts: T-shirts with cartoon characters, jokes, advertising, and so on.
Baseball caps
Baggy jeans
Brands or logos associated with children (even though many adults love them): Disney, Hello Kitty, Pokemon.
Converse shoes

, Depending on the age you're shooting for, and the age you are, it might be good to dress up to a significant degree, or it can look like you're playing ""dress up."" It's a good idea to experiment some with dressier clothes, to see if you can pull of a mature, workplace look, or if that'll just make you look even younger.


This will work if you are more-or-less an adult. An 11 year old wearing a business suit will not pull off the look, but am 18 year old just might.
If you're trying to just look 18 or 21, focus on adding height and using make-up to make yourself look older. If you want to look more ""mature,"" because you're an adult with a younger face, try out a dressier wardrobe.

, If you're 18 and trying to look 21, you'll want to look a lot different than if you're 12 and trying to look 17. How do your older cousins dress, or your favorite characters on TV? Seek out people who look mature and stylish, and pay attention to what they're wearing.


Note the colors and patterns they wear, the fit of their clothes, the type of shoes they have on. Check out the whole package. Start looking for similar items to create your own grown-up wardrobe.

, While guys of all ages wear shorts, they're less formal and more commonly associated with boys and athletic wear. To look a little older, it's best to wear good quality, form-fitting pants, and to leave the shorts for the gym.


It's especially important to avoid baggy cargo shorts and athletic shorts of any kind. Especially baggy shorts will always look young.

, Wearing a good-fitting button-down shirt looks older than a t-shirt, one hundred percent of the time. Plaid shirts or plain-printed dress shirts are good looks, whether you want to look 17 or 70.


Make sure the shirt isn't too big for you, or you'll end up looking like a kid wearing his dad's clothes. The sleeves of collared shirts need to come to the wrist when your arms are out straight at your sides. No further.

, People of all ages wear tennis shoes and sneakers, but if you already look young, they'll make you look even younger. If you're trying to pass as older, wear some more adult shoes. You don't have to wear old-man penny loafers, but more basic leather or faux-leather shoes will always look older than sneakers.


If you're shorter than you'd like to be, you can make yourself taller with Doc Martens, or motorcycle or cowboy boots that have heels, or slightly-raised platform soles.

, Wearing plain black or dark blue socks might seem like a little thing, but it makes a guy look just a bit more professional and a bit older. It's an easy fix. Ditch the white socks and wear dark ones.

, Baggy clothes and tight-fitting clothes will make you look younger, either way. Adults know how to pick the right sizes that flatter their body-type. Spend some time at the store, trying on clothes, to figure out what looks right. Don't just wear the first thing you find.

, Kids often wear wrinkled shirts, clothes that look like they've been pulled rumpled out of a clothes hamper. Adults wear nicely-pressed, clean clothes. Look like you are how you look and put yourself together with a clean set of clothes.

, Some haircuts can make people's faces look a lot younger, while others give the impression of success and power. Here are a few things to keep in mind next time you go to the salon or barber shop:


Stay away from little girl bangs. Straight bangs that are cut above the eyebrows are cute, but they make people look young. Sweep yours across instead for a sophisticated look.
Don't go for the shaggy look. This gives the impression that you are unkempt, whether you're a guy or a girl. Keep your hair trimmed and neat.
Try a bob or a fade. These are both haircuts you might see on people who go into politics or medicine. Choose a haircut that makes you look assertive and powerful, in spite of your years.
Experiment with a darker hair color. Hair often naturally darkens over time, and a darker hair color therefore makes you look older. Do not go overboard, however, as this might not give the effect that you want. A good rule is to stay within two shades of your natural hair color.
Guys should experiment with facial hair. Men who can grow it in thickly look older with some facial hair, but if yours is wispy, stay clean-shaven.

, This simple step can go a long way toward making you look more sophisticated. Take the time to comb your hair and either put it up in a chignon, apply gel to define your curls, or straighten it.


Skip bows and barrettes, which look childish.
Don't wear pigtails or braids. These can look good, but will always look young.
Wearing your hair up can emphasize your youthful features, and look like a much younger style than wearing your hair down, which can help to elongate your face and frame it to make it look a lot more adult.

, Many people think wearing a lot of makeup will make them look older, but it can actually have the opposite effect if you use too much. Go for a classic application of foundation, eye shadow, eye liner, and blush, with a lip that's just a few shades darker than your natural color.Stay away from blue eye shadow or other funky colors, which make you look like a little kid playing with makeup. Skip the glitter and shimmer and wear matte products instead.

, Draw a line starting from just under your natural cheekbone on either side of the face. Next under the jaw line, to create a slimming effect. Down the sides of the bridge of the nose, and on the sides of your forehead.

, Use a lighter concealer than your skin color, down the bridge of the nose in the center, on the cheekbones above the darker shade, under your eyes and just below your cheekbones.

, Nothing communicates maturity like confidence. Even if your physical appearance, unique personality, or social skills aren't as old as you wish they were, that doesn't have to stop you from projecting the confidence of an older person. Be the age you want to be.


Who's the most confident looking person you know? Come up with a confident ""anchor"" or persona that will help you play the part, possibly building on a confident role model that you admire, a Clooney or an Angelina.
Use that confident persona as an anchor inside every action. It might sound silly, but try to imagine how that person would stroll through the room, and attempt to embody that confidence. Walk like you're confident. Pour a glass of water like you're confident.

, Slouching won't convey the maturity you desire. Instead, hold your head up high and straighten your back as much as possible. Use body language to communicate maturity.


Standing up straight not only projects confidence, but helps to make you appear taller and more mature, as you move through a room. The taller, the better.

, Kids are loud and often ignorant of social graces. Act mature. If you are all over the place, hyper and peppy all of the time, you will seem childish no matter what you're wearing. Don't talk too loudly, and be considerate of the people around you. Talk more about other people than yourself, and know when to let silence do the talking.


Listen closely to what others say. Few things demonstrate maturity as well as a being a good listener. Be a good conversationalist who is interested in what people are saying; try to add occasional comments if you think they make sense.

, Even if you look the part, you can ruin it real fast when you open your mouth. It's important to speak confidently, using accurate word choices and speaking authoritatively about what you're talking about, especially if you're trying to fool people.


Cut the filler words. try to use fewer ""likes"" and ""ums.""
Try improving your vocabulary. Read a lot to learn some new words and try to include them in your everyday language. Use good grammar (not slang) and don't cuss.

Understand your own prettiness.,
Stop negativity in its tracks.,
Build your self confidence.,
Change your appearance.,
Wear clothes, make-up, and accessories that make YOU feel pretty and confident.,
Pamper yourself.,
Work to be healthy.,
Be attractive by being kind and respectful and pleasant.,
Decide how you define attractiveness.",How to Feel Pretty," This is the most important step for feeling pretty. You have to understand that your beauty comes from you, not from any outside source. But you have to practice feeling this way.


Write a list of of all the good things about yourself. This includes things like helping someone carry their groceries, listening to a friend, or being the best at puns.
Every morning, when you wake up, go to the bathroom mirror, smile at yourself and say aloud ""I am awesome"" and ""I am happy."" The more you say it the more you will convince your brain that it is true.
Write a list of things you think are beautiful about yourself. Maybe you have big brown eyes, a cute nose, or full lips, or a great laugh. If you can't think of any, ask a trusted friend or family member.
When you start having negative thoughts about yourself, remember your lists.;
, Negative thoughts cause our brain to believe the negativity. If we think we're ugly, our brain will be convinced of that. You have to convince your brain that those thoughts aren't true.When you start to have a negative thought, label it as such. Example: ""My nose is hideous."" Say to yourself: ""I'm having a thought that my nose is hideous."" It makes it so that thought isn't you.
Let the negative thoughts go. You are not your thoughts, but they can be extremely harmful to your self esteem.
Replace the negative thought with a positive thought. Even if you don't believe the positive thought, you can trick your brain into believing it., Everyone has good qualities, both inside and outside, but it's important to realize that people are more than their outer appearance. It's great to admire people (and yourself!) for their physical attractiveness, but it's even better to look at what's on the inside. There will always be someone prettier, more successful, with more romantic partners.


Don't judge yourself so harshly. You are your own worst enemy. Give yourself the freedom to have days where you don't feel attractive. Confidence is about trusting in yourself even on days where you don't feel like it.
Don't judge other people. What you think about other people says a lot about you. Try to think positive, kind thoughts towards others. It will affect your positivity towards yourself.Don't compare yourself to others. This will only cause you to lose confidence in yourself. Besides, that person with the perfect hair might be leading a very difficult life in other respects.
Fake it until you make it. You can trick your brain into being confident if you fake confidence. Act like you already know you're pretty and you will start to believe it.Don't feel as though you have to have a romantic partner to be worthwhile. Your self-worth and your confidence rely on you and only you. If you place too much self-worth control in the hands of other people, you won't learn true confidence.
Indulge yourself in a selfie. You control the picture and you can make it so it emphasizes your most attractive features. When you're feeling less confident, pull it out and remind yourself that you are pretty!

, Changing your appearance can give you a boost in confidence and help you out of an appearance rut. It can also be fun!


Change your hairstyle. Cut it, part it differently, give it highlights or dye it pink.
Give yourself dark smokey eyes or wear bright red lipstick.

Go for a free makeover. Make your way to the makeup counter of your local department store and ask for some assistance trying new colors. If you always wear shades of plum, tell the sales associate to break out the peach tones for a completely new look. You'll go home with a fab new take on your face.


Picking out a new item of clothing can change your entire wardrobe: a new shirt, skirt, or even a scarf.

, Clothes that you feel comfortable in are better than clothes that may be the height of ""fashion"" but which you don't enjoy wearing. Your uncomfortableness with yourself will show.


Check that your clothes fit correctly. It's hard to be comfortable when your jeans dig in too tightly at your waist, or your bra leaves marks on your skin.

, Giving yourself some time alone to do something relaxing can give you a boost in self-esteem and also help you relax, which in turn helps keep up your positivity.


Feel pretty all the way down to your feet with an at-home pedicure. Go as wild as you want! Wear a toe ring or two. Paint each nail a different color, use glitter or sample a shade that you're not quite ready to wear on your hands.
Give your skin some extra special care. When you pamper yourself, it shows. So give yourself at-home facial for skin-smoothing results.

, Healthiness is not only considered attractive, but it also means that your mind is healthy, too! It can help with depression and with keeping you from getting sick. It's hard to feel pretty when you've got a cold.


Sleep is a huge factor in healthiness. Too little sleep strains the nervous system and can make you more susceptible to depression and illness. If you can't get the recommended 8 to 9 hours each night, make sure to catch a nap during the day.Exercise releases endorphins and serotonin which boost your mood and your body. There are lots of different ways of exercising: yoga, dance, taking a walk or run, aerobics, zumba. They can be a lot of fun.Learn to meditate. Meditation can help with retraining your brain to let go of negative thoughts. It also can help with depression, eating disorders, and stress.Laugh. Grab a friend and reminisce about a funny event you both witnessed, or watch your favorite comedy. Laughter can do things like relieve pain, help you cope with difficult situations, and improve your mood.Soak up some rays. Sunshine's known to be a major mood-booster. In fact, in some Northern European countries where the sun rarely shines during winter, people go for light therapy to fight depression. (Take care when being in the sun, and be sure to wear sunscreen.)

, People may react initially to physical attractiveness, but studies have found that they will re-evaluate their perception of that attractiveness based on personality traits.Listen to people when they talk. You don't have to be a doormat to listen to others and people will notice that you have taken an interest in their words.
Kindness is one of the most important traits in rating attractiveness according to Yale psychologist, Paul Bloom.This means helping others out when they need it and not being judgmental about others (see steps above).

, Remember that beauty truly is in the eye of the beholder. Different cultural groups have different beauty norms. The obsession with thin being pretty only really began in the 1960s.Remember that the people in magazines and movies and t.v. shows have a whole army of hairstylists, make-up artists, lighting, and photoshop. Of course you don't look like them. They don't even look like them."
"
Flirt boldly.,
Break the ice.,
Make eye contact.,
Speak clearly.,
Don't forget to listen.,
Find the ""door"" in each sentence to keep the conversation moving forward.,
Focus on common ground.,
Reach out carefully.,
Limit your exposure.",How to Have Sex Appeal1," There are plenty of shrinking violets in the world, but people who are self-assured and comfortable are rare. Make yourself stand out by being unafraid to make a move: initiate flirting, speak clearly and confidently, and let the other person know you're interested. You don't have to be drop-dead handsome or a genius to be good at flirting. All it takes is self-assurance, a little bit of courage, and a sense of supply and demand. You'll make yourself irresistible.;
, The scariest part of any flirt? Approaching someone. It's hard to feel confident and sexy when your palms are sweating and you're trying to think of something brilliant to say to a hottie. But breaking the ice doesn't need to be overly complicated. Gather yourself, use open body language and friendly, non-threatening posture, and lead with a basic question or observation to open up conversation.


Try to read the person to get some sense of their humor and attitude before making your move. If you've just seen someone roll their eyes at the super-drunk host of the party you're both at, walk up to them and say quietly, ""This party is dead. I'm organizing a jailbreak, you in?"" Ice broken.
Don't think too much about having a killer opening to your flirt. Introducing yourself and asking someone's name is a perfectly reasonable way of breaking the ice, as well as super-general questions, like, ""What brings you here?"" or ""How's your night going?"" You don't have to be Shakespeare.
Avoid lines. Looking at you, fellas. Jokey one-liners designed to break the ice more often have the effect of turning people off completely, making you seem unserious, immature, and ignorant. Never fall back on a dumb joke when you're trying to be sexy. It's not.

, When you're trying to flirt with someone, don't look at the ground, or over their shoulder, or at the ceiling. Look them right in the eyes. Holding someone's gaze communicates both intimacy and confidence, and it's the easiest thing you can do to become a master flirter. Instant sex appeal.

, When you're flirting, talk loud enough so someone won't have to struggle to hear you, enunciate your words, and try not to stumble over your words. Slow down and speak carefully. Don't rush through what you're trying to say. Be sexier than that.


If you need a second to catch your breath and consider what you're going to say, take it! Buy yourself a little time by keeping eye contact and smiling. If the worst thing that happens to your friend is that a sexy and confident person smiles at them and loses the ability to speak, let's just say you're probably making someone's day.

, To get a good flirt going, you need to accomplish two things: portray yourself as an interesting and sexy person worth knowing, and to learn whether or not the person you're talking to is worth knowing. You can up your sex appeal by being a good, empathetic listener who's genuinely curious and interested in the other person. Practice good listening skills, paying close attention and responding thoughtfully.


Don't one-up. It's not flirtatious to respond to someone's carefully told story or anecdote about getting a bat out of their house with an off-hand response to how you used to get hundreds of bats in your house as a kid and how it's not a big deal. It's not a competition. Empathize, don't perform or show off.

, If you're struggling to think of things to say to someone you're flirting with, ask questions and try to look for the next opening in the conversation. Think of it like you're in a hallway looking for doors you can walk through into other rooms of subjects.


If someone says, ""I just graduated,"" it might be tempting to ask, ""What'd you study?"" but that might not give you anything to work with if the answers is, ""experimental particle physics with a minor in Latin."" Instead, ask more open questions, like ""How'd you like school?"" or ""What do you want to do with your degree?"" Get to know the person on a more complicated level.
Questions can go too far. Make sure you pay particularly close attention to the person's responses and body language to get a sense if you're over-stepping it into creeper territory. Don't bug people. If the person keeps turning away, as if they're looking for an out, or are giving you closed-off one-word answers, cut the conversation short and leave them alone. There's nothing sexy about overstaying your welcome.

, When you're first entering into flirtatious conversation, resist the urge to launch into your life story, to start complaining about something, or to talk about esoteric concepts or ideas.


If you do talk about yourself, keep it interesting. The mundane details of your day aren't as sexy and interesting as other topics of conversation. Think about what makes you unique, and find subtle ways to reference it without giving too much away.
Dudes: stop ""mansplaining"". There's nothing sexy about assuming other people are ignorant and over explaining everything, as you would to a child. That woman you're ""patiently"" explaining Tesla to? She might be a history PhD who's now quietly praying for your demise.

, Done appropriately, a gentle and friendly bit of touching can take your flirtation to the next level and can do a lot to attract someone. Done incorrectly, you can be a super-creeper with an eye full of mace. Use your judgment and always keep any attempt to touch someone you're flirting with in neutral territory like the arm, hand, or the shoulder.In general, men should not touch someone they're flirting with. It too often comes off as overly-aggressive and forward. Women should have the power in this situation, but can effectively communicate they're attracted by playfully pushing a shoulder, touching a hand or an arm.

, People tend to like things that are rare and novel, and lack of supply increases demand. If you want to stick in your flirt's mind, you've got to leave them wanting more. If it goes on too long, you might run out of things to say and leave on a sour note. Instead, come up with a quick out, and ask to exchange numbers, then make concrete plans to get together sometime. That's sexy.


Uncomplicate the flirt by being totally honest. You don't have to come up with an elaborate excuse why you need to leave, just say, ""Well, I'm going to get back to my friends, but I think I'm going to be thinking about your eyes all night. Can I give you my number? I'd love to have dinner sometime.""

Make yourself feel sexy.,
Take care of your body.,
Use open body language.,
Make decisions with confidence.,
Accept rejection gracefully.,
Smile.",How to Have Sex Appeal2," Whether you're going out for a night on the town, hanging out with your spouse, or going to school, if you want to up your sex appeal, make your own comfort and confidence a priority. For some of us, that might mean rocking a new pair of pumps and a tight-fitting dress, while others of us might feel more confident in a straight-forward shirt and pants. Whatever you're wearing, if you feel sexy, you'll be sexy.


Try to find some kind of middle ground between the sweatpants-and-slippers level of comfort and the 6-inch-Louboutains level of super-sexy high fashion. You don't have to go all out like you're on the runway, but you do need to make sure your clothes are appropriately-fitted, clean, and that you're well groomed and looking your best if you want to be comfy and feel great.

, Spend a little time each day grooming yourself and giving your body the care and attention it deserves. Hair, make-up, oral hygiene, and other little things can do wonders for your self confidence. It's hard to feel sexy and project sex appeal if you're anxious that you don't smell great. Be confident that you've done everything necessary to look your best.


You don't have to be a chiseled hard-body to gain more confidence and pride in your appearance. But if you don't feel comfortable with your stomach, or some other part of your body, take care of it. Put work into your body to get fit and become more confident. Even losing a few pounds can drastically affect your self-confidence, and your sex appeal.
Start slow. Many people get turned off of the idea of losing weight because of overly-elaborate weight-loss schemes and complicated workout regimens. It doesn't have to be that complex. Start going on long walks instead of taking public transportation, or start doing short sets 5-10 each, of push-ups and sit-ups while you watch television. It'll go fast and help you start getting fit. You may even like it.

, Practice working on your posture, keeping your shoulders back and your chin up to present yourself as someone who is open to conversation and to interaction. Stand up straight and project an appearance of comfort and confidence being in the world you inhabit. Even if you're on the train, exhausted after working all day, stand up straight. You never know whose eye you might catch.


Closed body language includes slouching, crossing your arms, or burying your head into your telephone. If you want to seem unapproachable and icy, close off your body language and people will get the hint.

, Trust your own judgment and your ability to pay attention to input from others, and choose what you think is best. You're just as capable as anyone of making the right choice.


It's not sexy to hem and haw at the menu for 20 minutes while everyone else is done. Make a choice and be done with it. If you're getting together with friends to go out for the night, don't spend a lot of time second-guessing the club you're hitting up. Once you've pulled the trigger, let it go and be confident you've made the right choice. People are attracted to that.

, If someone's not picking up on your obvious sex appeal, move on without comment. Like a duck, let that water roll off your back. Keeping yourself above petty squabbles and fights maintains an air of mystery, as well as leaving the door open if the other person changes his or her mind down the road. Plus, others will be impressed with your obvious confidence, which is inherently sexy.


Attraction is complicated, and there are multiple reasons why it might not be there. Instead of acting bitter and hurt, maintain your friendly composure. Maybe you struck out with this person, but someone else could notice how your confidence seems untouchable.

, Maybe nothing is more simple but less obvious than a pleased, attractive, confident smile. Is there anything sexier than a good, genuine smile? To radiate sexiness, keep an amused half-smile on your face, regardless of what you're doing, but especially when talking or flirting with a cutie. You should look like you want to be there, not like your mind is elsewhere.


Smiling also draws people's attention to your mouth, dragging their mind into thoughts of kissing you. If you smile, you'll be that much closer to locking lips.
In fashion ads and runways, models always have a grimace or scowl locked on their face. While fashion models are a certain kind of sexy, that sexy is also unapproachable and ""distant"" by design. You're supposed to aspire to the product they're selling, a relationship you'd like to avoid when chatting up strangers and meeting singles.

Take charge.,
Have a variety of interests, dimensions, and facets.,
Act your age.,
Be attentive.,
Be fun and be funny.",How to Have Sex Appeal3," Research reveals that women prefer prospective partners to make quick, efficient decisions and to be confident in their choices. Don't shy away from taking control of a situation, whether it's deciding where to go for dinner or accepting leadership of a long-term project. Being a fearless in your actions is inherently sexy, even if it's only in small, everyday ways.


This doesn't mean you have to be an alpha jerk—there's a difference between taking charge and being aggressive or condescending. Leadership can be just as powerful when it's quiet and restrained.
There are plenty of opportunities for you to do this while dating. For instance, if you're asking someone out and they don't know where to eat, don't hem and haw along with the other person—make the call and be done with it.

, Women are attracted to complexity and multi-dimensional people. Sexy people are interesting people, and interesting people have hobbies and passions apart from doin' it. Set aside time for yourself to keep up with whatever leisure activities you're interested in.


Hobbies give you time to unwind and decompress so that you can be relaxed and calm when you're around other people. It also gives you something interesting to talk about (other than school, or work, or the weather) next time you're trying to chat someone up. You play traditional claw hammer banjo in a jug band? Sexy.
Don't have extracurricular interests? Get some! Take up a sport you've always admired, practice an art such as singing or painting, start building projects with your own two hands—whatever it is that you've wanted to do, but never started for whatever reason. Commit to learning and chalk it up to being sexy. You'll feel better about yourself, which translates to being more confident and attractive.

, Women aren't attracted to juvenile antics or child-like foolishness. If you want to appeal to a woman, be smart, confident, and adult above all else. Things like grooming, ambition, and intelligence are all deemed sexy traits by women, so don't be afraid to dress up, discuss serious topics, and talk about your dreams for your life. It's not ""lame,"" it's sexy, and it'll let you get closer together.


Be classy every now and then. Foreign films? French wine? Knowing how to dance? It's no joke: women find these things sexy. Channel your inner Sinatra and class up the joint if you want to up your sex appeal. It's adult and it's sexy.
Show your smarts, but don't show off. Talking about the Milton thesis you wrote in college isn't interesting (unless it's somehow on topic). Surprise women with smart ideas, fun perspectives, and quirky intelligent humor, not with regurgitating junk you read on wikipedia.

, Women appreciate compliments about their grooming, their personality, and their humor not because of vanity, but because women appreciate generosity and attentiveness.Forget gifts and tokens of your affection, tell a woman instead that you're thinking about her. That's sexy.

, Women find a good sense of humor very sexy, especially when it comes from a place of confidence and self-assurance. If you're funny and you know it, put those skills on display. Women want someone who will be adventurous and show them a good time, not a wet-noodle who's going to want to hang around the house on Friday night playing video games. Be adventurous and hilarious in equal measure.


No juvenile toilet humor, guys. You're not in the frat house. There's a difference between coming up with a fun idea to explore the food carts and Japanese gardens in the city over the weekend and coming up with an idea to get smashed at a bar around the corner from your house. All ideas are not created equal. Have good ones.

Wear red.,
Emphasize your eyes.,
Empathize and be agreeable.,
Be moderately neurotic.,
Maintain a little mystery.,
Keep a full calendar.",How to Have Sex Appeal4," Some studies show that men are instinctively attracted to the color red, which–you guessed it–ignites the male passion and libido. And we humans aren't the only ones: some primate species and birds associate the color red with their mating rituals.Like humans blush when embarrassed, hot, or turned on, female baboons will make their fertility known by displaying flushing, or redness, on their genitals and chest.It's biological!

, Apparently, men are less shallow than their reputation. Rather than being first draw to a woman's chest, as is generally thought, research reveals that men are actually first attracted to the eyes, not the cleavage.If you want to attract a guy, emphasize your eyes with make-up to highlight their natural brilliance and beauty.


Wear clothes and use make-up that will bring out the color in your eyes to help ensure that guys will get lost in them. You'll have him!

, Men find agreeableness sexy and attractive. When deciding what to do, where to go, or how to approach a particular task, most men find it preferable to follow the simplest, as opposed to the ""best"" or most complex solution. Correspondingly, men find agreeableness and a willingness to act sexy in prospective partners.


If a guy comes up with an idea to go out for a slice of pizza, and seems genuinely excited about it, going along with it will seem sexy to him, even if you're not excited. If you're still full from lunch, does it really matter? Take a few bites and enjoy the company.
This doesn't mean you should be a wet noodle, but you should prioritize things that require debate and decision-making and things that are better off left undiscussed. Guys don't want to talk about what to eat for dinner for longer than 5 minutes, but discussing

, Studies show that men are turned off by both overly-cool and calm prospective mates, as well as hyper-stressed partners. However, people with ""moderately neurotic"" characteristics are usually rated by men as the sexiest. But what does that mean for you exactly?


To appeal to men, it's good to sweat the big stuff and let the little stuff slide. When it comes to your career, your family, and your health, it's good to be somewhat neurotic, serious, and concerned. When it comes to finding a place to eat lunch, go easy.
Don't affect weirdness to have more sex appeal, just be genuine and avoid sharing overly-personal neuroses with people you're attracted to. You might be feeling neurotic about your dog's weird skin warts, but that's probably not something to discuss with a date.

, Keep people guessing! Don't give away every single detail about yourself right away. People like a puzzle, and they'll be more interested in who you are and what you're doing if they don't know everything. Save some good stories to detail later, and keep certain parts of yourself private until the opportune time. It'll seem that much sexier when you reveal more.


If someone you like starts pressing for personal details, you could even turn it into a sly and flirty put-off. ""If I told you, I'd have to kill you"" is an old classic line, but you could also try ""Sorry, that's classified"" or ""That's need-to-know information."" For extra appeal, smile or wink as you say it.

, Don't just spend your time trying to have sex appeal or worrying about what other people think—keep your life interesting and full of events. Socialize, keep up with your hobbies, and try new experiences. You'll feel more confident, and other people will be more attracted to you as a result.


If you lead a generally quiet life, it's still ok to give the impression that your life is busy. If someone asks you out, plan it for a time that works best for you. Keep them wanting. Making a guy wait a few days for the date builds anticipation, which can be sexy.

Be distinctly you.,
Love yourself.,
Be principled.,
Don't necessarily listen to the opinion of other women when pursuing men.",How to Be an Attractive Woman1," Don't copy movie stars like Jessica Lange or Andrea Thompson to achieve your look, If you observe people at a party or any social gathering, you'll notice the majority of guys are drawn to women with unique (but not intimidating) personalities. Focus on what makes you interesting and fun to talk to, and let those aspects of your personality shine through.;
, You can be pretty but not attractive if you don't learn how to love yourself. Nobody will care how shiny and thick your hair is, for example, if you keep complaining about your waist size. Confidence is powerful and infectious, so try to learn to be confident.

, Stick up for what you believe in. Knowing what you like and don't like, what you believe in and what you disavow, is extremely attractive. Being principled will help you maintain your moral compass and keep your social life tidy.

, Every woman has their own perception of beauty and what they think men find attractive. ""Wear this,"" ""Do that,"" ""Show your left ankle; men love it, and they will respect you for it too!"" While sometimes helpful, this kind of advice can keep you distracted from the real goal: expressing who you are.


Go with your own gut, your own instinct; the men who don't respect you for it aren't the men you want to attract. Besides, women all have different ways/methods of attracting others.

Be willing to participate.,
Be capable of carrying on a conversation.",How to Be an Attractive Woman2," Whether it's talking, eating, gaming, dancing, or snorkeling, it's only polite to join in. Who knows, you might learn something, too. A person who just sits there watching might as well be wearing a flashing neon sign that says ""I'm a boring person who doesn't like fun!""


This doesn't mean you should join in drinking or partying if you're not into those things. Participate only in what you have fun doing.
To get involved, walk kindly up to a person or group and ask, ""Do you mind if I join you?"" If they say yes, go ahead and have fun. If they say no, you probably wouldn't have had fun joining them anyway!

, You don't need to have something in common with a guy for conversation to blossom, but it helps. If a guy tries to talk to you and you just stand there, he's going to move on, so learn to be interested in lots of different topics and remember to ask questions.


A good conversation starter is to ask his opinion about something superficial, such as whether INXS picked the right guy or if he did anything fun recently. Avoid asking him for input about your looks, as it can seem like you're fishing for compliments.
Keep the conversation light. Above all, don't put yourself down, unless you do so in a humorous way.
Maintain eye contact. This will help establish a deeper connection. You're reminding him that you're paying attention, and that you expect him to do the same.

Be kind.,
Don't be afraid to smile.",How to Be an Attractive Woman3," A rude person turns ugly in the eyes of whoever who sees her, just as someone who's nice turns into a prettier person in the eyes of everyone who sees her.


Try to be nice to everyone, but also be ready to defend yourself against any rude attitudes, since letting people walk all over you is not very attractive.
If anyone is ""different"", avoid making fun of them or giving them a nasty, ""I am better than you"" look.

, Even a little smile will make you more attractive. What else could be more inviting and approachable?


Be readable. You don't have to be predictable, but don't keep a poker face when it comes to emotions. Guys want a little feedback.
Don't force it if it's not there. Try to smile, but don't be fake. Smile when you feel like it.

The perfume will slowly release its fragrance and create delightfully scented steam., Choose your favorite perfume and put two to three drops of it onto your towel before bathing or showering. Leave the towel on the heated towel rack or radiator until it warms up a little. After bathing or showering, give yourself a vigorous rubdown with the warmed, scented towel. The warm towel will feel cozy and soothing and the fragrance will be left on your skin, subtle but lovely., Start your bath with scented body oil. Then use scented soap of the same scent. After the bath, use body lotion of the same scent and finish up with either eau de toilette or cologne in the same scent. This allows you to layer the scents up, in the same family of fragrances., Use a vaporizer to which you have added your favorite essential oil. Lean your head over the vaporizer, placing a towel over your head, and allow the scent to soak into your skin., Not only will you have clean teeth and fresh breath, it'll also smell sweet. Use toothpaste and mouthwash that have minty flavors, such as peppermint or spearmint., A lovely lip balm will keep your lips in good condition and add fragrance and a delicious taste at the same time.

Try crisp, citrusy scents.,
Choose light floral scents.,
Avoid heavy scents.,
Use eau de toilette.",How to Wear Fragrance in Summer1," Citrusy scents that are light and crisp are great for the summer months. Choose from lemon, pomegranate, bergamot, and grapefruit, to name a few.Crisp earthy scents, like freshly cut grass, are also great for the summer months.;
, Light floral scents are also great for the summer months, particularly white floral scents. White floral scents, like jasmine, frangipani, and tuberose, blossom in the heat.Other great floral scents to choose from are gardenia and peony, as well as green tea.
Try to avoid heavy floral scents that are sweet like vanilla, plum, rose, and woody scents. These scents can attract insects, like mosquitos, during the summer.

, Scents like musk and amber are generally too heavy for the summer months. If you like these scents, then substitute them with medium scents like vanilla, coconut or sandalwood.Green, earthy scents are also a great substitution for heavier scents.

, If you have a favorite fragrance that you do not want to let go of, then try the eau de toilette (or eau de cologne) version of the fragrance. Eau de toilette fragrances are diluted with water, so they are not as strong as their parfum counterparts. Therefore, they are great for the summer months."

Use smaller doses, but apply frequently.,
Spritz your wet hair.,
Scent your clothes.",How to Wear Fragrance in Summer2," Instead of dousing yourself with fragrance in the morning, spritz one or two sprays on your pulse points. Carry a refresher bottle with you in your bag or purse. Re-apply small doses of the fragrance to your pulse points three to five times a day, or whenever the fragrance fades.Your pulse points are the insides of your wrists and elbows, behind your ears and knees, and the front and back of your neck. These spots generate the most heat, which helps to release the fragrance.

, Freshly washed hair holds scents very well. After you have combed your wet hair, apply the perfume to the tips of your hair.If you do not want to apply the perfume directly to your hair, then spray your comb or brush with the perfume. Proceed to comb your hair with the scented brush.

, Instead of spraying your body, spray the inside seams of your clothes. As your body temperature rises, the heat will release the fragrance.Alternatively, try dousing a washcloth with your favorite fragrance. Place the washcloth with your clothes, hats, scarves, and other accessories for a day or two. When you wear your clothes, they will have a lovely, but light scent.

"
"
Start with a body wash.,
Apply a lotion.,
Finish with your favorite fragrance.",How to Wear Fragrance in Summer3," Instead of using plain soap to wash your body, use a scented body wash. Choose a body wash with scents that are similar or complementary to the ones in your favorite fragrance.For example, if your fragrance contains jasmine, bergamot, and vanilla, then choose a body wash that contains bergamot.
Many perfumes have matching body washes and lotions. If your favorite perfume does, then use these to layer instead.

, After your shower, apply a scented lotion that matches your body wash and perfume. Since the lotion is the “connector” between your body wash and fragrance, choose a simple lotion that contains only one or two scents.For example, choose a vanilla or jasmine scented lotion.

, Once the lotion has settled in, spritz your pulse points one or two times with your favorite fragrance. Try not to apply too much fragrance. Remember you can re-apply the fragrance throughout the day as it fades."

Understand the different types.,
Pick a perfume type appropriate for your setting.,
Test a perfume before wearing it.,
Limit how many scents you test at once.,
Choose a fragrance that’s right for you.",How to Wear Perfume1,"

Eau de colognes fade within an hour, while eau de toilette last about two hours.



 


L'eau de parfum contains a higher concentration of perfume oil and last up to four hours without fading.






Perfume classics and perfume extracts contain the highest concentration and last up to six hours.





;
, If you work in a small, enclosed space, for instance, you should avoid strong, overpowering concentrations.

,

You can test it on a piece of paper, which is often supplied at the store, if you’re buying the perfume in person. One thing to keep in mind when testing a scent on a strip of paper is that it will not smell exactly the same way on your body as it does on paper. The key to determining if a perfume is the right match for you is to allow it to mingle with your body’s chemistry before making your final determination.






Alternatively, you can spray a small amount onto the inside of your wrist and wait ten minutes before smelling it. This allows the full range of the fragrance to emerge, giving you a better idea of whether or not the scent appeals to you.






Perfumes have three notes of fragrance: the top, middle, and base. The top note strikes the nose immediately but wears away within five minutes. The middle note develops after about ten minutes and the base takes about fifteen. The middle and base notes are the ones that last for hours, so you need to wait for those notes to develop in order to get a full understanding of the perfume’s scent.






Avoid spraying the scent onto your clothing to ensure that your garments don’t smell like a perfume before you decide if you like it. Perfume can also potentially stain or discolor certain fabrics, so be cautious when applying it when you’re dressed.







, After testing three perfumes, your sense of smell loses its sharpness, and you may not be able to get a clear idea of any fragrances you try after that.


If testing perfumes that are vastly different from one another, you may be able to test five or six before your sense of smell becomes numb.
Ask if you can sniff some coffee beans between tests. Coffee beans cleanse the nasal palate and enable you to better discern smells over longer periods of time. This approach won’t last indefinitely, however, so it’s best to test a small selection of scents at a time.

, Roughly 75 percent of perfumes contain some trace of rose and jasmine extracts, but the amount present varies in each fragrance. Moreover, perfumes usually contain thousands of other ingredients and chemicals, many of which actively alter the scent. This is why no two scents ever seem to smell exactly alike. That said, many fragrances can be divided into one of four categories: fresh greens, woody amber, floral fruity, and oriental spicy.


Fresh greens have scents reminiscent of grass, leaves, and herbs. They tend to smell ""clean"" and suit women with vibrant, sporty personalities. Women who like to vary their perfume by occasion might consider a fresh green scent for outdoor daytime use.
Woody amber like fragrances encompass a wide variety of warm scents. Most include traces of amber, sandalwood, cedar, and various spices. The combination of spices is what gives this scent family such versatility. Women wanting to wear a more sensual scent might wish to consider a woody amber-y fragrance, especially as an evening perfume.
Floral fruity scents evoke a sense of playful innocence and romance. Most scents developed around a specific flower or fruit fall under this category. Some weigh heavier on the fruity side, while others smell like the interior of a florist's shop. These scents are also excellent for daytime use. Women wanting a fresh, zesty fragrance would do well to seek out the former, while those going for a classy romantic scent should look for the latter.
Oriental spicy scents are similar to woodsy ambry scents but usually involve more of a floral element. Fragrances belonging to this category often use rich scents like orchid, orange flowers, vanilla, sweet spices, incense, and musk. These exotic perfumes can be used at any time, but work especially well for evening. Women wanting a warm, mysterious, and distinctly feminine scent should look into this category further.

Wash your skin and apply a lotion before applying your perfume since fragrances last longer on clean, moist skin.,
Layer the fragrance by washing with soap and applying lotions that complement the perfume's scent.",How to Wear Perfume2," Apply perfume immediately after a bath or shower, when possible. Otherwise, thoroughly wash and lotion the areas where you plan on applying perfume.

, Fragrance sets that combine shower gels, body lotions, and perfumes are especially effective, but any soap or lotion that contains similar scent elements will work.


Avoid clashing fragrances. For example, do not wash with a potent fruity shower gel before applying a musky perfume.







"
"
Spray your pulse points, where your blood flows the strongest and the skin is the warmest.,
Spray perfume from a distance of five or six inches, depending on the intensity of the scent.,
Avoid rubbing the perfume into your skin.",How to Wear Perfume3,"


When wearing a stronger fragrance, such as an eau de parfum or a parfum classic, only dab perfume on your wrists and throat.
If you’re wearing an eau de toilette or an eau de cologne, also consider dabbing some on the pulse points behind your ears, on your chest, inside your elbows, and behind your knees.

, The stronger the scent, the further back you should hold the bottle.

, Even though this is a common practice, doing so crushes the chemicals and alters the balance of the scent. Instead, spray a small amount of scent onto your skin and let it dry naturally.

Shake the bottle well to mix the oil into the water. You can then spray 2-3 times into the air to spread the scent into any room.Be careful not to spray into the eyes of any people or pets.
The spray should come out in a fine mist, not a sharp stream. The water is simply a carrier for the oil.;
, An oil burner is an ancient method of scenting a room. To use an oil burner, find an oil you like. Place 3-5 drops of the oil together with some water into the top of an oil burner until it's 1/2-3/4 of the way full. Place the burner in a safe location, away from children, pets or burning hazards. Light the candle at the base of the burner. The oil/water mixture will start to heat and evaporate, scenting the room.A lavender-scented oil may be good for relaxation. Lemon is be both cheering and soothing.
Be careful not to put too much oil into the burner mix, or it can cause throat and sinus irritation.

, Take a new container (1 lb) of baking soda and add a few drops of your favorite fragrance oil. Mix the oil in well, and allow to soak for 24 hours. You can now shake this mixture onto your carpet for a carpet cleaner. Shake lightly across the full area of the carpet you intend to clean. Allow the mixture to sit in the carpet fibers for 30-60 minutes, then vacuum.You can substitute corn starch for baking soda.
Apply to a small area of carpet if you're not sure how your carpet will react to the mixture. Most carpets will be fine.

, Adding a drop of fragrance oil to the insole of your shoes will help cover unpleasant shoe odor.If the shoe odor is caused by foot fungus or infection, adding fragrance oil will not address the source of the foot odor. However, it may help cover the bad smell while your foot heals.
You can also wipe the interior of your shoe with a paper towel that has been moistened with fragrance oils.

, Apply by soaking a cotton ball in your choice of fragrance oils. When you turn the light bulb on, the oil will heat. As it heats, it will start to evaporate and scent your room.Be careful not to add too much oil to a cold light bulb, or the scent may be too strong.
Experiment with different oils to find the one you prefer. Different occasions may call for different oils.
Avoid getting oil on the base that screws into the light socket. Also avoid putting oil on incandescent or halogen light bulbs because they can get very hot and burn. Your light bulb may have a shorter lifespan as a result. If you have a radiator, that may be a more suitable place for the oil.

, Creating a love note with a special scent is a memorable romantic gesture. Place a few drops of fragrance oil onto a paper towel. Fold the paper towel, and place into a plastic bag. Put the stationery into the bag, and seal.The fragrance oil should permeate the stationery.
If your stationery comes in a box, a small oiled square of paper placed in the box will scent the whole stationery set.
Scent your envelopes in the same way.

, Cut an old white tee-shirt into 5-inch squares. Each square is a natural fabric sheet. Add 3-5 drops of fragrance oil to the cotton square, and place it into the dryer with your clothes. Your clothes will be laced with the fragrance as they dry.Each cotton sheet can be reused 2-3 times, adding 3 fresh drops of oil before each use.
Wash the sheet, and reapply a new kind of oil if you like. This dryer sheet can be reused many times before it must be thrown away.
The oil helps with static clean as well as providing a pleasant scent.

, Add a fabric sheet lightly scented with fragrant oil to a sour drawer or closet to scent your clothes or linens. You can also tuck a cotton ball moistened with your favorite fragrance oil into the corner of your drawer.Because this scent will be quite strong, use the oil sparingly.
You can use different scents in different drawers or closets. Perhaps a floral scent in the underwear drawer, and a fresh, ""spring rain""-like scent in the linen closet. Experiment to find the scents you enjoy the most!

, Cut a 6-7 inch square of color-fast cloth. In a small dish, add a drop of fragrance oil to 1/8 cup of baking soda. Mix well, and place the mixture onto a square of fabric. Pull the corners of the fabric together, and tie in place with a ribbon.The sachet can be tucked into any drawer or hung in a closet.
This scented sachet can help with bad smelling drawers. It can also keep moths out of woolens.

, Fragrance oil can lend its scent to any unscented body care cream, including shampoo or lotion. Add 7-10 drops of fragrance oil per ounce of unscented body care product.Using more fragrance oil creates a stronger scented product. Less oil results in a milder scent.
Be careful to use oils that don't cause problems for your skin or hair type. Test on a small area before spreading liberally. If your skin or hair has negative reaction, discontinue use.

Be careful not to mistake fragrance oils for essential oils.,
Understand the benefits of using fragrance oils.,
Use essential oils for aromatherapy.",How to Use Fragrance Oils2," Fragrance oils can be created from a small amount of essential oils placed within a carrier oil. Fragrance oil can also be essential oils held in a synthetic carrier. Synthetic aromatic compounds placed within either a natural or a synthetic carrier are also known as fragrance oils.Essential oils are naturally occurring oils created by a process of distillation. Their uses are varied, but in general these oils are much stronger. Essential oils are rarely used in an undiluted state.
The main purpose of fragrance oil is to add aroma to the environment.
Fragrance oils are also called scented oils.

, Because they are often made synthetically, fragrance oils come in a broader range of scents, and are usually much less expensive than essential oils. Their scent will often be stronger, and last longer, than the scent of essential oils.Using fragrance oils can be more environmentally sustainable than using essential oils. For example, using sandalwood oil is a product of killing the entire tree.
Whether you decide to use essential oils or fragrance oils depends on your purpose. Each oil has its merits.
Some essential oils can cause negative reactions with skin contact. Fragrance oils may offer a way to access the scent of the essential oil by diluting the oil in a natural or synthetic carrier., Fragrance oils smell lovely, but have no real therapeutic value. Essential oils contain the true essence of the flowers, herbs, roots, or resins. Unlike fragrance oils, essential oils have not been cut with any kind of carrier oil.Fragrance oils can lift the spirits simply by smelling good.
Because essential oils are distilled in small batches from local regions, their consistency varies. For crafters seeking to develop a consistent product, this can be a challenge. Some crafters choose to use fragrance oils when possible in order for more predictable consistency.

Facial wipes will also help prevent acne and other facial bacteria.;
, You can use an actual sponge or a wet washcloth/towel to clean yourself. This is a great way to freshen up when you're in a hurry or when you don't want to waste water.

Another method of deodorizing shoes is leaving orange peels in your shoes overnight. The citrusy smell should eliminate the foul odor., If you can't seem to get the bad smell out of clothing, or you absolutely don't have time to wash the shirt that you must wear, use a fabric freshener. Spray your clothing with a light spritz, don't completely douse it. Popular fabric fresheners include Febreze and Lysol.


You can also make your own fabric softener out of common household materials. Combine 2 tablespoons of baking soda and 2 tablespoons of white vinegar with hot water, and put the mixture in a spray bottle. If you want to add a smell-good factor, use a few drops of essential oils like lavender or peppermint., Having good breath will attribute to your overall good smell.

A closet or a drawer is a good way to store perfume to make it last.Perfume that comes in a colorful bottle, rather than a clear one, may be susceptible to less damage from light. However, it still may not be worth the risk of displaying bottles. You do not want perfume, especially expensive perfume, to lose its scent.;
, Extremely high and extremely low temperatures can affect the quality of your perfume. You want to store your perfume in an area of your home that is not subject to dramatic temperature changes.The kitchen and the bathroom are strictly off limits when it comes to storing perfume. The kitchen may get very hot during cooking, and the bathroom tends to warm up when people shower or bathe.
A closet in the living room or in a hallway is a much better place to safely store perfume.

, Humidity can really affect the quality of perfume. This is why storing bottles in the bathroom is generally a bad idea. Pick an area of your home not subject to extreme humidity in order to keep your perfume safe.If you have a dehumidifier set up anywhere, like your bedroom for example, this can be a great place to keep your perfume.

, Some people find success storing perfume in the refrigerator. While it may feel odd to have vials of perfume next to your food, the temperature is generally consistent and not too cool. If you have room, try popping your perfume in the fridge.However, very cold fridges can damage perfume. If you frequently notice drinks, fruits, and vegetables freezing slightly in your fridge, do not store your perfume here.

, A closet is usually the ideal place to store perfume. A closet is away from light and generally has a consistent temperature. Try clearing a space in your closet to store your best perfumes.Remember, however, to consider the area of your home. A bathroom closet or kitchen cabinet is not a good place for perfume.
A closet near your front door or by a window may also be a bad option. Such areas may be prone to drafts, and changes in temperature can affect the quality of perfume.

, If you still have the storage container your perfume came in, keep the perfume in this bottle. Do not transfer it to another container, as this will expose it to air. This can cause it to lose some of its smell., To best store, you should place bottles in boxes before placing them in storage. Boxes will further protect perfume from things like heat and sunlight. Before placing your perfume in a closet or on a shelf, put all the bottles in a box.Make sure the caps on all the bottles are firmly sealed. You do not want perfume leaking in a box.
Decorative boxes can be a fun way to store perfume.

, If you want to travel with your perfume, travel containers can help keep it safe. Opt for travel friendly bottles of your favorite perfumes before a trip, especially if you have to fly. If you can't find travel sized bottles, buy an empty bottle and transfer the perfume here.Travel containers are a good idea because there's always a risk of losing your perfume while traveling. You do not want to use an entire bottle of good perfume.
While it's generally best not to transfer perfume to another bottle, it's acceptable if you have to travel.

, Never leave the cap off after using your perfume. The less exposure perfume has to open air, the better it will keep.Make sure the cap is firmly in place when putting it back on the bottle.

, Many people shake perfume prior to use. Shaking the bottle can expose the perfume to excess air, which can be harmful. Unless there are specific instructions to shake perfume before use, avoid doing so before applying the perfume., Perfume applicators are wands people often dip in perfume and then swap on their bodies. Applicators can provide precision. However, reusable applicators can damage perfume by introducing bacteria and oils to the bottles.In general, opt for using perfume as a spray.
If you do want to use an applicator, use disposable ones.

, If a box falls from a high shelf, a fragile bottle could easily shatter. This will ruin an entire bottle of perfume. Always keep delicate bottles on the floor of a closet or on a lower shelf.This is especially important if you live in an area prone to earthquakes, like California.

Identify the perfume you want to buy.,
Find a reputable website.,
Select your new perfume.,
Read the website’s return policy before ordering.,
Find a store or kiosk to shop for discount perfumes.,
Ask to sample perfumes before purchasing.,
Beware of imitation fragrances.",How to Shop for Discount Perfumes," You may already be a loyal customer of a particular perfume, or you may be in the market for something new. Regardless, before you begin your online shopping venture, you will want to have some idea of what you are looking for. You can either choose a “fragrance family” (which is how fragrances are classified, according to “notes” that define their overall similarities), or you can choose a favorite designer.Even if you intend to purchase your fragrance from a discount online retailer, it may be beneficial to visit the fragrance area at a major department store to test the product you wish to purchase if you are not familiar with it. These stores will often have “tester” bottles that you can try out before you purchase.
If you want to be particularly brave and purchase a perfume without trying it out, read the description of several perfumes so you can understand the differences between the various “fragrance families.” For example, if you like the smell of fresh-cut grass and light citrus, you may want a fragrance in the “Fresh” family; on the other hand, if you appreciate notes of amber and vanilla, you may want to purchase something in the “Oriental” fragrance family.

The basic fragrance families are floral, oriental, wood, and citrus.Knowing some fragrances that fit into these categories is a good place to begin if you have no other knowledge of perfume.

;
, A website that has positive customer reviews and is well-known to carry quality and authentic products is your best option for purchasing discount perfume from a particular designer or brand. In addition, look for a website that guarantees that they only sell original designer fragrances and no knockoff or imitation fragrances.


Ask family, friends, or colleagues if they have any experiences (positive or negative) with particular websites for buying discount perfume. This can help you avoid a bad experience with an unknown company and can end up saving you time and money.
Find a website that has customer testimonials. This will help you see the true nature of the company and the products that they provide before you place your own order.

, You may have a longstanding favorite perfume that has become your trademark fragrance, or you may want to shop around for something new. Even if you do have a trusted favorite scent, it may be worthwhile to browse the website’s selection to see if another similar product is further discounted or if there is something new that catches your eye.


Look for a perfume that will be sent to you in the original manufacturer’s package. This is another way to help ensure that you are getting the discount perfume that you want.

, One downside to online shopping is that you cannot try on the perfume before purchasing it. Thus, there is a chance that you may not like the perfume or it might not be what you expected. It is important to read the website’s return policy before purchasing your discount perfume so that you know whether or not you are able to return a perfume that does not meet your expectations.


Some stores may allow you to return the product within 60 days of purchase if you are not satisfied. However, many also place the stipulation that the product must be unopened, unused, and in the original packaging. This means that if you have sampled the perfume, you will not be able to return it.

, Most popular department stores, while they are very popular places for purchasing perfumes, will not sell perfumes at a large discount unless there is a sale going on. You will need to look for other locations that may sell discount perfumes; for example, many malls will have one or more stores or kiosks that will sell fragrances at a discounted price.


Sometimes these discount stores or kiosks will sell fragrances at a discount price because they have been discontinued. Ask the salesperson if a particular fragrance has been discontinued before your purchase it. There is no problem with purchasing a discontinued perfume, but realize that you may not be able to find it again once you run out.

, Some stores and kiosks will have tester bottles for certain perfumes, while others will not. Regardless, it is always worth asking the salesperson if you would be able to test the perfume before buying it since you will likely not be able to return it once it is purchased.

, Some discount stores offer imitation fragrances of designer labels instead of the authentic product. This means that you must thoroughly check to make sure that you are purchasing an authentic perfume.Check carefully before purchasing and seek out a reputable discount perfume store if possible.


While you won’t have the benefit of reading customer reviews as for an online website, you can still ask friends and family about experiences with particular discount perfume retailers.

, For local deliveries, transporting perfume on your own by car will be much cheaper, considerably less hassle, and there is less risk of damage to the bottle than if you ship by carrier. If the perfume is a gift for a loved one and you’re flying for a visit, you can pack the perfume in your checked bag.


Be sure to double check your airline’s regulations on transporting checked-bag perfumes or potentially flammable liquids (if the perfume contains alcohol) before you leave.

, Although certain liquids are unregulated for shipping my mail carrier, don’t lie about your package status or ignore rules on the reporting of specific chemicals. Packages go through a number of screenings during shipping.


If your package is suspected of a hazard or mislabeling, it can be significantly slowed during transit or destroyed without refund.

, To prepare your perfume for shipping, wrap the bottle with 4 to 6 layers of bubble wrap.


If you’re shipping multiple bottles of perfume, be sure to wrap each bottle individually.

, Using a sturdy tape, wrap the tape several times around the bubble wrap layers to secure it to the perfume bottle.

, You want to choose a box that offers 4 inches (10 centimeters) of space around each side of the wrapped perfume.

, In the bottom of the box, add an even layer of packing material, such as popcorn, shredded newspaper, or styrofoam chunks. Then, place the wrapped perfume in the box on top of the packing layer.

, Use more packing material to fill up the box. Make sure there is an even layer of material on each side and on top of the perfume.


If you’re packing more than one perfume bottle, place plenty of packing material in between each item.

, The box should feel sturdy when you shake it. If you hear any thudding or movement inside, you need to fill the box with more packing material., The recipient’s address should be written in large letters on the middle of the box with black ink. The sender’s address should be placed in smaller letters in the top left corner. Consult your carrier for placement of other labels, like customs forms or hazardous material warnings.


Put clear plastic tape over the addresses to protect against water damage.

, Once you’ve taken your package to your preferred carrier and all the appropriate postage and labeling is attached, use any extra space to write “FRAGILE” in big, bold letters.


Use red ink to catch people’s attention.

Combine scented products carefully.",How to Smell Gorgeous2," Picking a fragrance or perfume can be overwhelming, but it is an effective way to enhance how you smell. Here are a few tips that experts recommend when selecting a perfume:If you know there’s a certain perfume you like or a certain scent, ask a sales associate for assistance finding a similar fragrance. They should be able to help you narrow down the list and identify the notes in the fragrance that you are attracted to.

, Perfume can quickly dissipate, so try these tricks to increase the longevity of the products you apply:


Apply perfume right after you shower, when your skin is moisturized and it easily absorbs the fragrance.One of the best places to apply perfume is the hair because it holds the perfume well and will leave a gorgeous-smelling scent in your wake. Instead of spraying your hair directly with perfume, which can dry it out, apply it to your hairbrush prior to brushing.Avoid rubbing the fragrance once it’s on your skin because this makes the top note of your perfume fade, minimizing the full effect.Use a dab of vaseline or petroleum jelly on an area of your skin before applying perfume or fragrance to make the scent longer-lasting. Moisturizing your skin with unscented lotion before applying perfume also helps preserve the scent longer.Fragrance oils are longer-lasting formulas, so choose these when you need to smell gorgeous for a longer period., Applying too much perfume can make you smell overwhelming rather than gorgeous, so keep these tips in mind to make sure you apply it properly:Body splash, eau de cologne, and eau de toilette, have lower concentrations of fragrance oils and are usually more subtle, so if you tend to over-apply products, these might be a better choice.If you are worried you put on too much perfume or body spray, use a makeup wipe on the area and start fresh.You can also sprinkle a little baby powder on the affected area, which should absorb the fragrance., Many people store their perfumes and fragrances in the bathroom, but the increased humidity, heat, and light in these locations can actually decrease the potency of these products. To keep your products smelling gorgeous, store them in dry and cool locations., Scented lotions can often be more fragrant, cheaper, and longer-lasting than perfumes.


If you’re someone who worries about where to apply the perfume or how much to apply, using a lotion may require less guesswork. Just smooth an even layer of the lotion over areas you would like to moisturize.
You can add a few drops of your favorite perfume or body spray to unscented lotion for a gorgeous smelling version of your perfume that is usually more affordable., Scented bath products are also an easy and inexpensive way to smell gorgeous because they are often more affordable than perfumes.


If you are going to use a strong-smelling perfume or lotion, a lighter smelling body wash or shower gel might be a better choice so these scents are not competing., When you use multiple scented products, it’s important to consider how the scents will mix. Here are a few tips for choosing products that go together and compliment each other so you don’t choose a combination that leaves you smelling less than gorgeous:


Many companies release lotions, perfumes, and body sprays in the same line that are intended to work together. These are known as ancillary products, and if you are worried about how best to combine different products, these are often a safe bet.Choose products in the same scent family so they go better together. For example, if you use a floral-based perfume, choose a floral-based shower gel or lotion.Products with vanilla, amber, and coconut layer well together and often pair with a wider range of products and scents."

You can also use baking soda and white vinegar to absorb and remove unpleasant odors.

Alternatively, you can set out a bowl with one cup of white vinegar in the room that smells bad, and leave it for a few hours or overnight., Bathing regularly and going through the steps above won’t be effective if you put on dirty, smelly clothes. Wash and dry your clothes regularly to keep them smelling fresh, and use a nicely scented laundry detergent or washing powder so your clothes smell as gorgeous as you do.

Walk around the mall without wearing any scent and look around for perfumes you have sampled before and likes, or perfumes that seem really popular (like on TV.),
Approach the sales counter and ask the representative to introduce you to the perfume.,
Ask her/him to spray the perfume on a piece of paper (sample sheets) or if they have little bottle samples or plastic samples to take home, ask them about those options.,
Collect some samples (paper, glass, or plastic) and put them in your bag/pocket.,
Ask for options.,
Go home.,
If you have the option to go home, then smell one paper sample in the car (if you're not driving), then when you get home, wait half an hour, try another paper sample, and put them away.,
Glass and plastic.,
Before buying, make conversation with the rep about why you choose this perfume and any opinions he/she has about the perfume.",How to Test Perfumes," If you already have some preferences, make a list and bring it with you.;
, Ask her about the scent and how popular it is (whether it has a strong scent or weak scent). If she asks to spray it on you, reject it. Do not spray perfumes on your skin, because your skin absorbs it and the smell stays on your skin all day, so by the end of the shopping, you will leave smelling like a bunch of mixed scents.

, If you really want to smell the perfume right away (from the paper) then ask for coffee beans after to smell. Most representatives keep coffee beans at the counter, because they take away that smell of the perfume, and seem like they calm your head. A bunch of smells may overwhelm you and give you a headache.

, Try to spread out the paper ones in different pockets/compartments on your purse so they don't get all mixed up.

, Consider what size you would like to buy, or if there is a combo. If you like 6 perfumes from the same brand (for example) ask if they come in a cheaper, larger package with small perfumes in it.

, It is not necessary to buy your perfume the day you get there, and leave with a perfume. If it is an emergency ( you need one asap, like for a birthday or party gift) then, try smelling the paper for the first sample when you get there, then wait to smell one and lunch, and then after lunch, so leave some time distance in between sampling, so the smells do not get mixed.

After they have melted give it a stir and add your perfume/body spray of choice.

, As the mixture bubbles, the alcohol is being boiled off so the end result will be a bit stronger than it was in the bottle, and it will last longer on skin. The longer you boil it, the stronger it will be.

, If you want to take it on the go, get a container with a lid or use an old lip balm tube for easy application on the go!

Choose the ""hot"" areas of your body.,
Apply successive layers of fragrance in various forms for the best scent reach.,
Take care not to overdo it though.,
Keep the Nozzle at-least six inches from your body.",How to Make Your Perfume Scent Last," Perfume scent is stimulated by warm skin. The best areas are the neck, cleavage, areas where the veins are closest to the skin's surface such as the pulse of the hand and neck, the upper fold of the elbow, the back of the knee or behind the ear. Freshly washed hair will carry a scent for up to a week.


Since aromatic essences are highly volatile, they tend to rise in the air, therefore, a great trick is spraying perfume around the waist.;
, For example: Wash with scented shower gel, use scented deodorant, apply the perfume extract base, and 30 minutes after the first application of perfume, add water to strengthen and extend the effect of the scent's duration.


Buy a neutral-smelling body lotion and add 3-4 drops of your favorite flavor. This provides another form of care for the application layers.

, We know that we tend to easily get used to the scent, so, we can sometimes put on too much just to be able to smell it and this is overwhelming for others.

, To get the best out of scent or perfume it is recommended to keep the nozzle 6 inches (15.2 cm) away from the skin(where you want to apply it) and then spray.

Wash your hair.,
Moisturize your locks.,
Dry your hair thoroughly.",How to Perfume Your Hair1," To give your hair a pleasant scent, it’s important to ensure that it’s clean. Use your favorite shampoo to wash your hair thoroughly before you apply any scented or perfumed products.Your hair can often start to smell if it’s extremely greasy. It’s a good idea to wash it whenever you notice your roots getting particularly oily.
Most shampoos have a pleasant scent themselves that can help perfume your hair. However, the fragrance from a shampoo typically doesn’t last as long as other products so you should layer it with other perfumed items to keep your hair smelling good all day.
If you’re using scented shampoo, choose a fragrance that's similar to the perfumed product that you plan to add later. It helps create a base that allows your hair to stay perfumed longer.;
, Depending on the perfumed item that you use to scent your hair, it may contain alcohol that can dehydrate your locks. That’s why it’s extremely important to moisturize your hair beforehand in case it loses any moisture after you scent it. Use your favorite conditioner to hydrate your hair after you wash it.If you have coarse, damaged, color-treated, or any type of hair that’s naturally dry, you may want to follow up your regular conditioner with a leave-in conditioning treatment.
When your hair is especially dry, you may want to swap your regular conditioner for a deep conditioning treatment or mask. Leave it on for at least 10 to 15 minutes before washing it out.

, For the longest lasting fragrance in your hair, you should make sure that your locks are completely dry before applying any perfumed products. If your hair is wet, the water can form a barrier that keeps the fragrance from penetrating your tresses so the scent doesn’t last as long. After washing and conditioning your hair, make sure it is dry before you apply the fragrance.To avoid damage, it’s best to allow your hair to air dry.
If you’re short on time, you can use a blow dryer to dry your hair. Just be sure to use it on the lowest heat setting possible and apply a heat protectant product before you dry it.

Spray your hair with perfume.,
Apply scented styling products.,
Work a dry shampoo into your roots.",How to Perfume Your Hair2," Perfume works well to give your skin a delicious scent, but it is just as effective on your hair. When your hair is dry, hold a bottle of your favorite perfume at least 8-inches (20-cm) from your head and lightly mist your locks to scent your hair.Not only does applying perfume to your hair give it a pleasant scent, it creates a lovely sillage, which means you leave a scented trail wherever you go.
Many perfumes contain alcohol, which can be drying on your hair. While the amount you apply isn’t likely to do significant damage, it’s best to choose an alcohol-free formula.
One way to ensure that a perfume is safe for your hair is to use a fragrance designed specifically for your locks. There are a variety of hair perfumes on the market that are alcohol-free so you can apply as much as you like without worrying about drying out your hair.

, Hairspray, gel, mousse, pomade, and other styling products are often necessary to ensure a good hair day. But styling products aren’t just good for taming your hair. Many are scented so they can leave your hair perfumed all day. Choose your favorite type of styling product with a pleasant scent and apply it as you normally would.Even styling products can contain alcohol that will dehydrate your hair. Look for a scented formula that is alcohol-free for the healthiest, shiniest locks.
Keep in mind that some styling products are best applied to wet hair. If you usually use your favorite styling product on wet or damp locks, there’s no need to dry your hair first to perfume.

, Washing your hair everyday can dry it out -- and some days, you might not have time to jump in the shower. Dry shampoo can be a lifesaver on those occasions. Not only does it absorb excess oil from your roots, it usually imparts a pleasant fragrance that leaves your hair smelling fresh all day.Be sure to hold the dry shampoo at least 10-inches (25-cm) from your head when you apply it.
Target the dry shampoo at your roots and hairline where hair tends to be the oiliest. You don’t want to apply it all over because too much can make your hair look stiff and dull.
Allow the dry shampoo to sit for 1 to 2 minutes before massaging it into your roots with your fingertips. You can then comb it through the rest of your hair.
Dry shampoo can sometimes leave behind a whitish cast. If you have extremely dark or bright hair, you may want to try a formula that’s colored for your hair shade.

Work a hair oil into your locks.,
Create an essential oil spray.,
Mist your hair with a floral water.",How to Perfume Your Hair3," Hair oils are good for your hair for a variety of reasons -- they help moisturize, boost shine, add antioxidants, and sometimes offer sun protection. But many natural oils also have a pleasant scent so they perfume the hair with a fragrance that can last all day when you apply them .Some oils, such as monoi oil, have a lovely scent on their own. Other oils are mixed together in a blend to create a lovely fragrance.
No matter how good it smells, don’t over-apply any hair oil. It can weigh down your hair and make it appear greasy. Add 1 to 3 drops to your palm, rub your hands together to spread the oil, and apply it to your hair. Only add more oil if your hair is extremely thick or coarse.
Unless you have extremely dry or damaged hair, you shouldn’t apply the oil at your roots. Stop 3- to 4-inches (7.5- to 10-cm) away from your scalp to keep your hair from looking greasy.
If you have very fine, greasy hair, you may only want to apply the oil to the ends of your hair.

, Essential oils are known for their delicious fragrances, which is why they’re often used in aromatherapy. That makes them an ideal option if you want to create a natural, homemade hair perfume. Choose your favorite essential oil and add 5 drops to 2 cups (473 ml) of water and 2 tablespoons (27 g) of melted coconut oil in a spray bottle. Shake well and apply it to your hair.Use a glass spray bottle for the spray. Essential oils can degrade in plastic containers.
You can substitute another oil, such as olive, for the coconut oil. The essential oil won’t disperse evenly throughout the water without a carrier oil.
Not sure what essential oil to use? Ylang-ylang, lemon, jasmine, lavender, bergamont, and sandalwood are good options.
Be sure to hold the bottle at least 8-inches (20-cm) from your hair when you spray it.

, Floral waters, or hydrolates, are made by distilling plants to extract their natural oils into water for a light but concentrated fragrance. You can mist a floral water in your favorite scent over your hair whenever you want to perfume it.You can usually find floral waters at natural beauty stores and online retailers.
Rose water is probably the most common floral water. It offers a very delicate, feminine fragrance.
Orange blossom water, mint water, and rosemary water also have pleasant fragrances that work well for the hair.
Hold the bottle about 8- to 10-inches (20- to 25-cm) away from your hair when you mist it.

"
"
Take a shower or bath.,
Moisturize.,
Apply petroleum jelly.",How to Make Your Cologne Last Longer1," The steam from a warm shower or bath helps open your pores, so your skin will absorb the fragrance more readily. That helps the scent linger throughout the day, and keeps you from having to reapply., Hydrated skin is more likely to soak up your cologne than dry, parched skin, so it’s a good idea to apply a body lotion or cream over your entire body beforehand, paying particular attention to areas where you plan to spritz the cologne.If you don't want to alter the scent of your cologne, be sure to choose an unscented moisturizer.
Because hydrated skin holds onto to fragrance better than dry skin, people with oily skin usually don’t need to reapply their cologne as often.

, Moisturizing your skin can help it soak up the cologne more easily, but if you really want the fragrance to “stick” all day, dab some petroleum jelly, such as Vaseline, on your pulse points where you plan to spray the scent. The petroleum jelly acts as a barrier between your skin and the cologne, so your body’s oils aren’t able to break the fragrance.Petroleum jelly can stain clothing, so be sure to rub it into your skin until the area isn’t greasy to the touch.

Visit department stores in person.,
Bring empty sample vials with you into department stores.,
Request samples at the register whenever you make a purchase.",How to Know Where to Get Perfume Samples1," Sephora and Nordstrom are two of the best department stores for getting completely free perfume samples. If the store doesn’t carry samples of a particular perfume you’re interested in, many of them will decant a bottle and make you a sample of your choice.


Bring a few zip-lock baggies, some small sticky labels and a handful of cotton balls with you. If there is no other way to bring home a sample, simply spritz the perfume on the cotton ball and put it in the baggie.
Be sure to label each baggie with the perfume brand and name. Take it home with you and spend some time with the scent to see if you're interested in it.;
, If the store doesn't have the perfume you want to sample and they don’t have any empty sample vials to create one for you, ask if they would be willing to fill up an empty vial you have with you.Some department stores are happy to fill empty vials that you brought with you. Others don't like it doing it, so it really just depends on where you are.
However, it never hurts to be prepared by having the vials on you and asking a sales associate once you arrive.

, If you are at a department store making an unrelated purchase, always request a few free perfume samples at the register when you’re checking out. Even if your purchase is a relatively low cost item, you should still ask for a few perfume samples.


Most department stores are happy to comply with your request.
Giving free samples with a purchase is pretty standard practice at these establishments, since they want your repeat business.

Layer the scent.,
Spray your pulse points.,
Mist your hair.,
Spritz your clothing.,
Reapply when necessary.",How to Make Your Cologne Last Longer2," If you really want the scent to last all day, it helps to use other products that have the same scent with your cologne. Many fragrance companies offer complementary products for their colognes, such as body washes, deodorants, and body creams. Because the scent is the same, wearing the cologne over a soap or lotion strengthens the fragrance and makes it last longer., Applying your cologne to the right areas of the body is key to making the scent last. You want to spritz your pulse points, including behind your ears, the base of your throat, the inside of your elbows, your wrists, and behind your knees. That’s because these are the warmest spots on your body, which will help keep the scent strong.Other areas where you may want to apply your cologne include the stomach and back of the neck.
Forget the common advice of rubbing your wrists together after applying your fragrance. Rubbing the cologne actually helps break it down, so it doesn’t last as long.

, If you’re only spraying your cologne on your skin, the scent isn’t going to last as long as it possibly can. By spritzing some on your hair, you can boost the staying power because your hair is more porous and hangs onto the scent even longer than your skin.If you’re worried about the alcohol in your cologne drying out your hair, you don’t have to spray it directly on your locks. Instead, apply some to your brush or comb before running it through your hair.

, Because of the natural oils in your skin, a scent can wear off over time. If you apply some cologne to your clothing, though, the fragrance will cling to the fabric until you wash it. Spray some on your shirt, jacket, or even an accessory such as a scarf to make sure the scent lingers all day.Some colognes may stain delicate fabrics, such as silk, so it’s a good idea to test a clothing item before spraying it with a fragrance. Apply some to a small, inconspicuous spot, such as the inside bottom hem of a shirt, to see how the fabric reacts.

, Sometimes, depending on the weather or what you’re doing, the scent of your cologne may fade no matter what steps you take to make it last. If that happens, refresh the fragrance by reapplying the cologne to your pulse points.Carrying a full-size bottle of cologne around all day to reapply isn’t always practical. Fortunately, many fragrance companies make smaller bottles that are travel-friendly, so you can easily toss one in your pocket or bag.

"

Select a heavy scent.,
Check its expiration date.,
Store it properly.",How to Make Your Cologne Last Longer3," Certain colognes and fragrances last longer because the notes that they feature have a stronger, heavier scent. For the most lasting power, choose a cologne with a woody fragrance, such as cedar, patchouli, or juniper. Options with spicy notes, such as clove, ginger, or nutmeg, also tend to be longer-wearing.Woody, spicy scents that come in oil form are the best choice when you want your cologne to last all day. That’s because oils cling better to the skin than sprays or mists. They’re not mixed with alcohol either, so the scent isn’t diluted.
Colognes that features fresh citrus notes aren’t going to last as long as heavier, musky scents.

, Many people don’t realize that colognes and perfumes have a best-by-date if they contain a lot of natural ingredients. Over time, those ingredients can start to turn, weakening or changing the scent. Some colognes will include an expiration date on the packaging, so be sure to choose a bottle that’s still fresh.If there’s no expiration date on your cologne, examine its color and consistency. When it starts to get darker and syrupy, it’s likely gone bad.
Colognes made with synthetic ingredients usually don’t go bad, so you don’t have to worry about an expiration date.

, Extreme temperatures and direct sunlight can alter the oils and other ingredients in cologne, so the scent changes or doesn’t last as long. If you want your fragrance to last all day, it’s important to use a bottle that’s been stored in a cool, dark location.The bathroom isn’t an ideal storage spot for cologne because the humidity from steamy showers can affect it even if you keep the bottle inside a cabinet or drawer.
You may have heard that storing your fragrances in the refrigerator can help them last longer, but the extreme cold can affect its composition just as much as heat and humidity. That’s why shouldn’t store it near an air conditioning vent either.
If you want to display your colognes’ attractive bottles on a shelf, make sure that it isn’t near a window where sunlight will hit them.
Always ensure that you recap your cologne bottles securely. If air reaches the fragrance, it can oxidize, changing the scent and decreasing its lasting power.

Request free samples directly from the perfume manufacturer.,
Look for newly launched perfumes online.,
Check out freebie websites.Freebie sites collect free offers and make them available to customers via their website.,
Look for free samples when shopping on department store websites.",How to Know Where to Get Perfume Samples2," If the manufacturer is giving samples away, it will probably say so on their homepage.


If you don't see a blurb about free samples on the homepage, look for a tab on the menu that says ""Free Samples"" or ""Freebies.""

, If the manufacturer isn't giving away any samples on their website, look for the company’s physical address and write a letter to them directly to request free samples. This strategy doesn’t work 100% of the time, but it’s worth a try! It does pay off occasionally.


Company addresses are usually located at the very bottom of the webpage, in small print, or they can be found under the “About Us” or “Contact Us” menu tabs.
Mailing a physical letter is more likely to get you free samples than sending an email. Business websites are bombarded by emails every day, but physically receiving a personal letter from a customer is becoming a rarity. It will usually get someone’s attention.
It wouldn’t hurt to throw a few compliments in the letter about how much you like their brand, how excited you are to try a sample, etc.

, Some perfume companies will happily give away free samples when they launch a new perfume. Keep an eye on your favorite brands so that you know when something new is coming out. Do a little additional online research on perfume brands that you aren’t familiar with, as well. Check out their websites for possible samples, too.

Check out online perfume outlets and perfume sample businesses.,
Buy perfume samples on eBay.,
Trade perfume samples via online swapping venues.",How to Know Where to Get Perfume Samples3," Niche perfume boutiques almost always sell sample vials of their scents through their online stores. Most of them will throw in one or two freebies with your order if you make a purchase.

Occasionally you will find some really great deals on eBay and usually the prices are pretty good.eBay doesn’t allow the sale of decanted sample vials, so make sure that any product you order and receive is in its original packaging.
Also check any samples ordered through eBay for signs of having been opened and/or diluted. You can report these things and receive refunds in most cases.

, There are multiple online venues that provide a forum for people to swap perfume samples with one another.Each one works a little differently, so make sure you read the site carefully for information about their process before joining up.

Buy petroleum jelly.,
Use olive oil.,
Make conditioner do double duty.",How to Save Money on Your Beauty Routine1," Buy a big jar of generic petroleum jelly. It can serve as clear lip gloss, lip balm, makeup remover, under-eye moisturizer, and foot and hand cream.;
, Use olive oil for multiple uses: To condition hair, rub one tablespoon on scalp, wrap in a warm towel, and let it sit for 20 minutes before shampooing out. For silky skin, pour some into your bathwater. To turn it into an exfoliant, just add some sugar.

, Replace your shaving cream with dollar-store hair conditioner; it works every bit as well. Or use a brand made for men; they’re usually less expensive. Get an unscented one if you don’t want a “manly” fragrance.

, Plump your lips for pennies by mixing a sprinkle of cayenne pepper or cinnamon with a dab of petroleum jelly and applying to lips. It will irritate them just enough to temporarily swell them.

, Often, some inexpensive brands will run coupons in magazines, and newspapers. Cut them and keep them!

, With some water, for example, you can make a free 10 day supply of foundation last for a month.

Waste not, want not.,
Running low on lip gloss?,
Combine and stretch.",How to Save Money on Your Beauty Routine3," Use up every bit of your cosmetics: Get the last smidgen of lipstick out of the tube with a lip brush. Revitalize a dried-out mascara tube with a few drops of hot water. Use a cotton swab to get into the crevices of little pots of eye cream or lip balm.

, You can get more lip gloss into your tube by using hot water. Put hot water in a mug and stand the lip gloss tube vertically in it for about half an hour. The heat will cause the gloss that's stuck on the side, or up on the top of the hole to ""melt"" down to the bottom. You should also let it cool down so it isn't really liquid when you use it. And if there isn't enough gloss in the tube, that your wand can't get it, pour it out into a little container (old cleaned out contact lens cases are great) to use for later.

, When you have a few half-used, forlorn lip balms lying around, take them out of their containers and place in a microwave safe dish. Get every last bit out of the container by using toothpicks to loosen chunks and cotton buds for smudges. Keep these containers aside.

Melt the lip balms by heating in the microwave with 10 second intervals and stir to combine. If the shade isn't ideal, add a little lipstick, microwave again, and stir.
Pour into one of the lip balm containers, freeze for a few minutes or until set. It's now ready for reuse.

If the texture is more liquid than solid even after freezing, invest in a cheap, clear gloss. Pour some into an old tube of lip gloss to reuse that, and use the brush to mix your lip balm mixture into the gloss.
An alternative method is using melted beeswax, mixing that in, and freezing it.

If you have an unsteady hand, consider using a funnel to help you pour the water into the bottle.

Have a good work/life balance.",How to Refresh Yourself," Studies suggest that meditation can physically change your brain to make you happier, calmer, more empathetic, and more focused.Many people are intimidated by the thought of sitting quietly for long periods, but even just a few minutes a day will help.


Set a goal to sit quietly with a clear mind for 10 minutes each day. This won’t be easy at first. You might only be able to go 1 or 2 seconds before a thought flies into your mind.
When thoughts and worries come into your mind, observe them without judgement, and then let them pass.Treat your mind like a muscle. Work up to longer moments of quiet just as you would work up to heavier weights when weight-lifting.Some people find it helpful to name the thoughts that come into their mind as they go by. For example, if work stress comes to mind, just say in your head, “Work” and then allow the thought to pass out of your mind, like a cloud drifting across the sky.;
, If you’re not particularly good at sitting and meditating, try starting with a walking meditation. Find a quiet space and walk from one end of it to the other, back and forth, paying careful attention to the experience of walking.


Pay attention to how your feet feel on the ground; how the air around you feels; to any noises that you hear; or any smells that might be there.
As thoughts come into your mind, don’t engage with them, just let them pass and work on quieting your mind once more. The key is to be fully present in the moment and really experience everything around you.

, This is also referred to as being mindful. Try to slow down and be present in each moment, and to do things with intention. Doing this will help you feel more joyful and calm every day.This may be difficult at first, but it will get easier with time. Whenever you get distracted, just gently draw your attention back to the moment and your intention.

, Keeping a regular journal can help you get in touch with yourself and how you really feel about things. It can also help you solve problems and relax. Set aside 20 minutes each day to write in your journal.It’s ideal to write in a physical journal as opposed to using your computer. Go to a bookstore and get yourself a nice journal that you feel excited to write in. You might also get yourself a nice pen!
If you’re so worried about your privacy that you can’t bring yourself to write in a physical journal, use a password-protected text document instead. Using a physical journal will be more effective, but any journal is better than nothing!

, Countless studies have linked the use of technology — including computers, cell phones, and TVs — to sleeping problems and depressive symptoms.It’s important to set time aside each day to do something that doesn’t involve looking at a screen: read a book, go for a walk, meditate, or do whatever may appeal to you.


People who spend a lot of time on the Internet and social media are particularly prone to fatigue, sleep problems, and depression.Signs that you’re spending too much time online include staying online longer than intended, losing track of time while online, and being unable to cut down on the time you spend online.If you think you might have a problem, start keeping track of how much time you spend online. You can do this in a calendar, notepad, or other device, but just be sure to be consistent. There are also online resources available to help you limit the time you spend on your computer.

, Having a messy house and work space can make you feel anxious and overwhelmed.If you spend a lot of time in cluttered, messy spaces, you might have trouble feeling refreshed.


The physical act of cleaning might even get your blood pumping enough to make you feel a bit better, and having a less cluttered living/working space will definitely help your mind feel more clear and refreshed.
Experts suggest making the task of cleaning more fun by setting a playlist of your favorite music to clean to., When we’re feeling down, it can be difficult to maintain basic hygiene. Doing basic things like brushing your teeth, having a shower, washing your face, trimming your nails, and brushing your hair are sure to help you feel refreshed.


Make your daily hygiene routine into an enjoyable ritual by using products that make you feel good: nice-tasting toothpaste, nice-smelling face and/or body wash, and a good-quality moisturizer are all things that will help you enjoy getting clean and looking your best.

, A popular image for relaxation is a person soaking in a warm, bubbly bath. Light a few candles, play some soft music, and slip into a tub of warm water. Try to lie in the bath for at least 15 minutes while mindfully enjoying the bath — don’t think about work/school/etc.


If you don't have sensitive skin, you can add a nice bubble bath to the water. If you have sensitive skin, try Epsom salts and dried lavender.
If you are unable to take baths, or you dislike them, you can also have a relaxing shower. Use a body wash or soap in a relaxing scent like lavender.
If you take a shower instead of a bath, mindfully pay attention to how the water feels on your skin, how it sounds as it hits the tub, and to any other elements of the experience that may stand out to you.

, Get a massage, go to a spa, get a haircut, or just take yourself out for dinner. Do something that you wouldn't normally do, and that makes you feel pampered. The key is to give yourself a break and have someone do something nice for you.


If you don't have a lot of money, keep an eye out for local Groupon (or similar coupon) deals. Other ideas for pampering yourself on a budget:

Go get a fancy hot chocolate or coffee from a nice cafe, and sit in and just enjoy the atmosphere, or read a book.
Go to a local community center that has a sauna, and sit in there, maybe even enjoy a whirlpool hot tub soak and a swim.
See if there are any gardens in your area that allow free or cheap entry, and then walk around and mindfully enjoy the experience — for example the smells, sights, and feeling of your feel on the ground as you walk.



, Take time to enjoy something that you love, and really devote your time to it. Don’t check your phone or go on your computer, or anything else during this time. Examples:


Cuddle up in blankets and pillows with some hot tea and a good book.
Light some scented candles or incense and flip through song lyrics while you listen to your favorite album from beginning to end.
Sit down with a few of your favorite chocolates and eat each one slowly and mindfully, paying attention to their complex flavors, textures, and scents.
Avoiding screens is a good idea when you’re seeking to refresh yourself, but if you really want to, you could also set aside time to curl up with a snack and your favorite beverage, and watch one of your favorite TV shows or movies.

, While pampering yourself it's imperative that you don’t think about work or anything else that stresses you out. When those thoughts arise in your mind, gently put them aside and continue enjoying what you’re doing.


If you feel guilty about taking time for yourself, it will end up being stressful instead of refreshing, so really try to keep your mind off work or any other stressors while you're pampering yourself.

, Signs that you're not drinking enough water include feeling hungry, feeling tired, having burning eyes and a dry mouth, and reduced mental functioning, including low mood and an inability to focus.To calculate how much water you should drink each day, take your body weight in pounds, and divide that in half. That’s how much you should be drinking each day, in ounces. For example, a 150-pound woman needs to drink roughly 75 ounces of water each day.
If you live somewhere hot or you workout regularly (i.e. you sweat a lot), this number will increase. A 150-pound woman living in a hot climate with an active lifestyle might drink anywhere from 75 to 150 ounces of water, depending on her day.

, Experts commonly recommend eating lean proteins, healthy fats, and whole grains, and avoiding processed foods that contain lots of sodium and/or sugar.The key is to eat a variety of foods in order to get all of the nutrients and vitamins you need.


Studies have shown that eating too much and/or eating the wrong foods can cause damage to your brain and affect your mood and memory.Omega-3 fatty acids (found in fish), antioxidants (found in blueberries), and folic acid (found in spinach, orange juice, and yeast) improve brain function., Aim to use (“burn”) as many calories as you consume. How many calories you need each day depends on your age, gender, size, and level of physical activity.Example: A moderately active female aged 19-30 should aim to consume 2,000 calories a day. Moderate activity includes walking about 1.5 to 3 miles per day (at a rate of 3 to 4 miles per hour), plus any day-to-day activities., Studies have shown that exercise reorganizes the brain, making it more resilient to stress.Exercise has also been proven to improve memory and thinking skills.When you can think clearly and are less susceptible to stress, you're less likely to feel burnt out.


Experts recommend doing at least 150 minutes of moderate physical activity (walking) or 75 minutes of vigorous physical activity (running, cardio class) each week. You can also combine the two.Thirty minutes every day is the most popular recommendation.
If you struggle to find time for scheduling regular workout sessions, do your minutes in 10- or 20-minute intervals throughout the week. For example, one day you could do 10 minutes of walking in the morning, 20 minutes at lunch, then 10 minutes after work.

, Celebrate your daily successes, no matter how small they may seem. When you make mistakes, forgive yourself. Try to live in the moment and let go of any worry that you have about the past or future.It’s also important to let go of any worries you have about other people. You cannot control them. Worrying about what others think or what they may do will only exhaust you.

, Ensure that you get out of the house/workplace and hang out with people who you enjoy spending time with. Socialize with people who make you feel like the best version of you, who are supportive and fun to be around.


When we feel stressed out and burnt out, we tend to isolate ourselves. Avoid this urge, as it will only make your feelings worse. Try to talk to at least one good friend about how you’re feeling. Go out for a walk or a cup of tea with them.If you’re living far away from friends, try to find time to talk to them on the phone or online. There are a lot of ways to communicate now beyond face-to-face, and many of them are free, so take advantage of them.

, Go dancing, watch a comedy special, hang out with people who make you laugh — whatever it is that makes you happy, do it! Taking time to enjoy life will help keep you feeling refreshed and prevent you from feeling burnt out.


Even if you're not feeling happy right now, force yourself to get out and do something that’s likely to improve your mood., Pick up a hobby or two that make you feel fulfilled in life. Learn a musical instrument or a second language; join a cooking class; take an art or writing class at a local college.


Taking time to develop your interests will make you feel more fulfilled in life. If all you do is wake up, work/go to school, come home, eat, and sleep, it’s no wonder you’re feeling burnt out. Help keep yourself feeling refreshed and inspired by learning new things.

, The common recommendation of nightly sleep is 7 to 9 hours for adults and 8.5 to 9.5 hours for teens.However, a study testing participants after 9 hours of sleep versus 7 hours of sleep suggested that even seven hours of sleep per night is too little.If you’re feeling burnt out and groggy all the time, try increasing how much sleep you get each night. Aim for 9 hours per night. If that’s not possible, aim for as close to 9 as you can go.
Some researchers suggest planning your sleep in accordance with the 90-minute-cycle rule. As you sleep, you cycle through 5 phases that go from deep to relatively wakeful sleep. You will feel most awake when you wake up during the wakeful phase.You can do this by deciding when you want to wake up, and then counting backwards in 90-minute segments to figure out when you need to go to sleep. As an example, to wake up feeling well rested at 7 a.m., you’d need to go to sleep by 10 p.m., Studies have proven that lacking a good work/life balance will actually burn you out and make you less productive in the long run. Prevent burnout by keeping lower work hours and spending more time on keeping yourself happy and healthy.It’s common for students and those in regular jobs to work well beyond full-time hours. This is already exhausting, but what’s worse is many employers and teachers encourage this behaviour.
Many people seem to believe that being exhausted and lacking free time are signs that you’re working extra hard. You might even have the best intentions and really believe that you’re working harder, but you’ll only render yourself less productive in the long run."

The results can range from mild to moderate.Ask if your insurance company covers any of these treatments.

Remove the hair on your legs by waxing.,
Get laser hair removal to permanently get rid of hair.,
Tan your legs.,
Use a body shimmer.,
Use makeup to add shine to your legs.",How to Make Your Legs Shiny," Legs that are moisturized will automatically have a nice glow. When your skin is hydrated, it looks younger and much more vibrant. Put on a fresh layer of lotion to give your legs a gorgeous, subtle shine. There are tons of moisturizing lotions that can be purchased at beauty and convenience stores, and you can also use natural products like coconut oil or shea butter to moisturize your skin.Always apply lotion after you take a shower. This will help lock moisture into your skin, and prevent it from looking dull.
Always apply lotion after you shave or wax your legs. Shaving and waxing can be harsh on your skin, so be sure to moisturize afterwards.
If you're wearing shorts or a dress, carry a small lotion with you to re-apply throughout the day. Give your legs a rub down with lotion every few hours to keep your legs looking bright.;
, Exfoliation is the key to smooth and shiny legs, as it removes all of your dead skin cells. Dead skin cells cause our skin to look dull and dry. Exfoliating will eliminate that top layer of dull skin, revealing a new layer of bright, moisturized skin. Use a body scrub to exfoliate your legs 2-3 times per week.









Body scrubs can be purchased at most convenience and beauty supply stores, or you can make your own at home.
To make your own body scrub, you'll need sugar or salt and some type of oil (olive oil, coconut oil, etc.). Your sugar or salt will be your exfoliant, and your oil will be the moisturizer. Mix your ingredients together, your scrub should be thick. You can keep your body scrub in a tupperware container in the shower.
Consider adding an essential oil (like rosemary or peppermint) to your body scrub to give it a relaxing scent., If you want your legs to really shine, apply a small amount of oil to your legs. There are tons of oils that can turn any pair of legs into shiny show-stoppers, including coconut oil, jojoba oil, and olive oil. With oil, a little bit goes a long way. Pour a nickel sized amount of oil into your palms, rub your palms together, and proceed to apply oil all over your legs. The oil will create a shine that will last for hours while simultaneously conditioning your skin.








Be careful when applying oil to your skin, because oil can easily stain clothing. Make sure to rub the oil into your skin very well before getting dressed, as this will prevent any clothing damage.
Applying oil to your legs right after shaving is a great way to lock in moisture.

, Shaving is the quickest and easiest way to remove your leg hair. Removing your leg hair will automatically make your legs appear to be shinier. Shave as often as necessary – some people shave every day, some shave once a week. Invest in a good razor, especially if you have sensitive skin. A good razor will often have multiple blades and a conditioning strip.


When you shave, use a good shaving cream. There are many shaving creams that can be purchased at beauty or convenience stores, but you can also use natural shaving creams. Shea butter and coconut oil make for great shaving creams, as these products deeply condition the skin.
Take your time when shaving your legs. Don't rush through the shaving process, as you could cut yourself or miss a section of hair.
Shave your legs while in a hot bath or shower. The hot water will open up your pores, allowing you to get a closer shave., Waxing is a great way to get smooth, shiny legs, and the results will last much longer than shaving. Waxing is a bit painful, but is worth it if you want better, longer lasting results. Many people choose to get waxed by a professional, but you can also wax your own legs at home.


Exfoliate before waxing for best results.
Purchase an at-home waxing kit. This kit should contain wax (that is typically heated in the microwave) and waxing sticks and sheets.
Wax your legs slowly and carefully. Apply the hot wax onto one small section of skin at a time using the waxing stick, place the waxing sheet on top of the hot wax, and press down. After about 15 seconds, quickly pull the strip upwards off your skin. Repeat this until you have waxed your legs completely.
For more details on waxing your legs at home, check out Waxing Your Legs With a Waxing Kit, If you are sick and tired of shaving and waxing to get rid of your unwanted leg hair, consider getting it removed permanently. This process is a bit more painful and expensive than the typical hair removal methods, but many believe it to be worth it. You can get your hair removed professionally, or you can purchase an at home laser kit.


Laser hair removal typically takes 5 sessions (on average) to remove all of your hair.
Each at-home laser kit is slightly different, so be sure to read the instructions carefully., Tanned or darker skin tends to look shinier than pale skin. If you have naturally dark or tanned skin, embrace it! All you'll need is a bit of lotion or oil to create shine. If you have paler skin, consider getting a tan to give your legs a new, shinier life. You can tan in natural sunlight, go in a tanning bed, get a spray tan, or simply get some tanning lotion.


For the quickest results, get a self-tanner at your local convenience stores. These self tanners come in spray or lotion formulas. Read the instructions on the tanner you purchase for specific instructions.
If you choose to tan via sunlight or a tanning bed, be careful. Too much sun can be harmful to your skin, so always wear a sunscreen., Body shimmer can be purchased at most beauty or convenience stores. It comes in spray and lotion forms, and is a great way to add a bit of sparkle to your skin. Stores like Bath & Body Works often carry body shimmers.


Create your own body shimmer instead of buying one. Mix some shiny gold or silver eyeshadow into your lotion for a homemade sheen. Start by adding a small amount of eyeshadow (just a sprinkling of eyeshadow), and add more until you reach your desired shine. Apply the lotion to your legs as you normally would.

, Using makeup on your legs not only creates shine, but also evens out your skin tone. Natural, dew-like types of foundation are great for legs, as are shimmery powder foundations. Rub your foundation into your hands, and then apply it to your legs like a thin layer of lotion. To apply powder, use a large powder brush and use large circular motions to brush the powder onto your skin.Search for foundations that don't rub off easily and are long lasting.

Some of the higher end foundations that fall into this category include Nars All-Day Luminous, Clinique Stay-Matte, and Mac Nourishing Waterproof.
Some of the lower end foundations that fall into this category include Revlon Colorstay 24 Hour Foundation, Maybelline SuperStay 24 Hr Foundation, and L'oreal Infallible Foundation."

Invest in a few key pieces to elevate your wardrobe.,
Wear the right shoes and accessories.,

Smile more often.",How to Look More Polished," A polished look is a put together look, so don't leave your hair out of the equation. If you have time, make an effort to spend some time styling your hair every day – straighten it, curl it, put it in a nice bun, shape it with mousse, etc. If you're not a great hairstylist, rock a low-maintencace haircut that's easy to style on your own. Ask your hairdresser about cuts that would work best for you.Simple hairstyles like ponytails can look polished with a little extra effort. After you put your hair in a ponytail, take a small piece of your hair, wrap it around the hair tie, and pin it in place. This will elevate your pony to a polished hairdo.
Even if you like the messy, bedhead look, use styling creams or a little shine serum to give your hair an on-purpose messy look.
Leave some hair products and tools at work. Whether the wind ruined your curls on the way in to the office, or you need to re-straighten your hair before after-work cocktails, it's a good idea to keep some haircare things at work.;
, Whether you're heading out on a date, going into the office for a regular day of work, or running errands around town, always wear your fragrance. People always notice when you smell good, and it will leave an impression that you're well polished and put-together. Don't douse yourself in your scent, but subtly apply it throughout the day. Ideally, you should carry a small bottle of your perfume / cologne around with you., As simple as it sounds, taking care of your hands and nails is one of the top characteristics of a polished individual. People who keep their hands manicured appear to be more put-together than those who don't. You don't have to necessarily keep polish on your nails, but make sure that you keep your nails filed and your cuticles trimmed. Carry hand lotion with you to keep your hands nice and soft.If you enjoy polishing your nails, be sure to change the polish once your nails start chipping. It's a good idea to wear softer colors, like tans and light pinks, as it is less obvious when those polishes start to chip.

, Good grooming is key when you're looking to create a polished look. Aim for a natural, flawless complexion, as opposed to caking on layers of heavy makeup. Choose a foundation that smooths and evens your skin, without taking away it's natural glow. Add a bit of blush and highlighting powder to subtly contour your face, shape your eyebrows with pencil, and apply a touch of mascara and lip color. Creating this bright, fresh look will definitely help you look more polished.For men, pay special attention to your grooming. Some guys look great with scruff, but make sure to keep it in check. Use aftershave creams to avoid razor burn, and always apply moisturizer. If you have excessive nose hairs or a unibrow, pluck those hairs to give yourself a more polished look.

, Everybody has their own signature style, even if they don't know it. You have a favorite pair of jeans, a favorite cut of dress, a favorite style of shoe, etc. Figure out what your wardrobe essentials are and embrace them. When you create a capsule type of wardrobe, you'll be able to put together polished outfits instantly, and know that you'll look great.


Get rid of clothing that you don't wear and clothing that isn't figure flattering. Filling your closet with fewer pieces that look great is much better than tons of pieces that don't look that good.
Your edited wardrobe might include pieces that can easily go together, such as a couple pairs of skinny jeans, a nice pair of black slacks, a blazer, a few blouses, and your favorite flats in a few different colors., Adding a nice blazer, sweater, or jacket can improve any outfit, so invest in these pieces. You'll be able to pair them with the majority of the clothes in your wardrobe. Get a nice pair of denim jeans as well, as high quality denim always looks great. Women should always invest in a little black dress, and men should always invest in a nice fitting suit. These can be re-worn over and over again, so invest in something nice., Accessories can make or break any outfit. Overdoing the accessories can cheapen your look, and wearing too few accessories can cause you to look lack-luster. Picking out a few staple accessories – including jewelry, handbags, and shoes – will help you polish up any outfit.


A pair of diamond (or rhinestone) studs can dazzle up any outfit, and a pair of gold and silver hoops can go with nearly any outfit. Add these earrings to your staple accessories and add them to an outfit whenever you're in doubt.
Adding belts, necklaces, and bracelets to outfit can polish up a look when done right. Stick to simple accessories as opposed to gaudy ones.
Invest in a pair of go-to flats and go-to pumps (or a go-to pair of sneakers and dress shoes for men). These shoes should be versatile and comfortable so that you can pair them with almost every outfit.Clean the scuff marks or salt stains out of your shoes. Since you walk around outside, your shoes tend to get dirty. Simply cleaning any dirt from your shoes automatically polish up your look., It's simple things, like coordinating your colors, that can help to create a polished look. Everything doesn't have to match perfectly, but make sure your colors go well together. And when you're in doubt, simply wear black (because black goes with everything and always looks chic).


Neutral colors tend to go well together. Mix a few tans and beiges to create a polished, yet subtle look.
If you're wearing a dress that has pink accents, match your lipstick or accessories to those accents.
Matching your nail color to your shoes is a great way to pull off a completely polished look., Standing and sitting up straight creates a much more polished look than slouching does.

Trim body fat with cardio workouts 3-4 hours each week.,
Build muscle tone with weight training and body exercises.,
Tan your skin.,
Eat a healthy diet.",How to Look Like a Pornstar1," ""Cardio"" is exercise where you raise your heart-rate during a consistent activity like running, biking, or swimming. While pornstars come in a variety of shapes, colors, and looks, they are usually trim, fit, and in shape. In order to burn away unwanted fat and highlight a healthy figure, you should do a cardio workout at least 3-5 times a week.


Dancing, spinning, and rowing all count as cardio -- anything that raises your heat-rate for at least 20 minutes at a time is a good start.
Studies suggest that interval training will help you increase conditioning and burn calories faster. Interval training combines short bursts of energy with longer periods of lower exertion. For example, you might jog three laps of a track but sprint the 4th.;
, Most pornstars have bodies that would make an action star blush, but they didn't come naturally. Lean, sexy muscles only come from hard work. While you should focus on toning your entire body, there are a few muscles that are essential for the pornstar look. For each exercise, start with 3-4 sets of 10-15 repetitions (ie. do 10 sit-ups, three times a day), and try to work out each muscle at least 3 times a week.



Abs: Do sit-ups, crunches, and planks to develop a killer six pack and a flat stomach.

Pectorals: Push-ups, bench press, and flyes (curling weights horizontally towards your chest) will all help you develop a rock-hard chest. Women looking for a large bust should focus less on pecs.

Arms: Push-ups, bicep curls, shoulder shrugs and shoulder flyes will tone and tighten your arms.

Thighs: Squats, box jumps, wall sits and leg presses will all develop solid, sexy quadriceps and butt muscles.

, A tan makes you seem outdoorsy and active and masks fat and imperfections. Tanner people have even proven to be more attractive on average.That said, spending too much time in the sun can lead to skin cancer and skin damage, so bronzing creams are often the best way to get a safe, even tan.


If you choose to tan, wear sunscreen, drink plenty of water, and never use tanning salons. When outside, reapply sunscreen ever 30 minutes, and limit sun exposure to an hour or less.Not everyone needs to be tan to be attractive -- naturally fair skin is beautiful whether you want to look like a pornstar or not.

, In order to get a pornstar body, and keep it, you have to eat a balanced diet that limits fats and processed sugars. Limit your calorie consumption by eating slowly, stopping when you are full, and drinking 6-7 glasses of water a day.Complex carbohydrates, like whole wheat, oatmeal, and brown rice are far healthier than simple carbs like white bread and sugar.
Substitute sugary snacks and junk food with vegetables and hummus, yogurt, or fruit.
Cut soda, candy, and fried foods completely from your diet for the best results.

Your clothes should show off your muscles and lines, but remember the number one rule of pornstar fashion -- it has to come off easily.



Tops: Try deep, deep v-necks and cut-off t-shirts. Open vests revealing bare chests, leather, and shirts that end before the bellybutton are all easy options.

Pants/Shorts: Depending on your style you should either opt for short shorts or tight, slimming pants, like skinny-cut jeans. No matter what your choice, wear them low on your hips to reveal the ""v"" leading from your stomach down.

Accessories: Tattoos, piercings, and hair gel are generally the only accessories male pornstars have available to wear.

, Manscaping is the art of grooming your body hair in an appealing way. Keep your neck hair close cropped and trim beards regularly to remove stray hairs. Pubic hair is generally shaved away completely, and some male pornstars opt to remove all of their chest hair as well.

Straighten your hair.",How to Keep Hair from Curling with Humidity," Dry hair, especially curly hair, needs lots of moisture. This is because curly hair tends to be on the drier end of the spectrum compared to straight hair. If you have curly hair or textured hair, moisturizing is the key to preventing frizz when it's humid.Choose a shampoo and conditioner that is made for curly hair. Some shampoos and conditioners even offer protection against humidity.
After shampooing and rinsing your hair, wring the excess water from your hair and then apply your conditioner from roots to ends. If you hair is thin, then you may want to apply conditioner from the middle of your hair to the ends and skip the roots. If your hair is thick, then apply the conditioner all over.
Then, let the conditioner sit on your hair for a few minutes before rinsing it out.;
, If you have thick textured hair or really curly hair, the it might help to deep condition your hair. Deep conditioning helps to lock in more moisture than regular conditioning and this may help to prevent your hair from curling up in the humidity.To deep condition your hair, apply the deep conditioner to your hair and then let it sit for about five to 10 minutes. You can do other things in the shower while you wait, such as shaving and washing your face. If you are just washing your hair, then put a plastic cap over your hair and go about your normal routine until it is time to rinse.
You can also warm up your conditioner slightly before you use it. This may help your hair to absorb the moisture better. To heat up your conditioner, place the bottle in a bowl of very warm water and let it sit for about 10 minutes. This should warm up the conditioner and make it easier for your hair to absorb., Don’t ruffle the cuticle by drying your hair with a towel.Hair cuticles have lots of ridges. When you rub your hair with a towel, it raises the edges of the hair cuticle, which frizzes your hair. Instead of rubbing your hair with a towel, squeeze the water out of your hair.









Use your hands to squeeze out as much of the water from your hair as possible.
You can also use a microfiber towel or an old t-shirt to absorb some of the excess water.Wrap a microfiber towel or t-shirt around your hair and squeeze. Don’t rub your hair.

, Anti-frizz serums and creams can help to lock in moisture when you apply it to damp hair. They also help control flyaways because the oils in the products coat your hair, creating a barrier between your hair and the humid air.









Use a serum made with natural oils such as a Moroccan oil. Your hair absorbs the products made with natural oils better; they don’t just sit on top of your hair like products made with synthetic oils.If you have thick hair, dry hair or color-treated hair, then a cream may work better. If your hair is thinner, then apply it from the mid-length of your hair to the ends.If you have thicker hair, then you can apply the cream or serum all over, but still focus on the ends of your hair.
Straightening balms can also help to straighten curly hair and prevent it from curling up in humid weather.Look for a straightening balm or cream that offers some protection from the humidity as well.

, Don’t immediately blast your hair with a blow dryer. Allow it to air dry at least partially. Allowing your hair to dry slowly and naturally keeps your hair in place instead of blowing it around, which can cause frizziness. If you blow dry without smoothing it out, it also can make your hair look puffy.








If you want to blow dry, then let your hair partially dry naturally first. Or, you can let your hair air dry completely.

, If you are straightening your hair after letting it air dry, use the blow drier and a boar bristle brush to seal and smooth the cuticle.This smooths the cuticle down, while the heat from the blow dryer seals in the moisture and locks it in. If moisture is sealed inside your hair cuticle, it is less likely to attract the moisture in the air and become frizzy.








Blow dry your hair in a downward motion while using the boar bristle brush to smooth it out as you go. Brush your hair and move the blow dryer along with the brush in a downward motion.
Boar bristle brushes are made from keratin, which is the same material that your hair is made from. This is why using a boar bristle brush to blow dry your hair is ideal. However, if you do not have a boar bristle brush, then any rounded or flat brush will do.
While you are blow drying, pay attention to the crown where frizz is really noticeable. If you don’t smooth out your roots, you’ll look like you have a halo of frizz around your head, and it can make your hair look really frizzy.Make sure your hold your hair taught with the brush as your blow dry the crown of your head.

, It is important that your hair is completely dry if you’re entering a humid environment. If your hair is damp, it will continue to absorb moisture from the surrounding environment, making it appear puffy and frizzy. So, before you go outside in humid weather, make sure that your hair is completely dry. Like the serum, dry hair acts as a barrier between your hair and outside moisture. Even if you air dry, your hair should still be completely dry before leaving the house.








Use a cool shot of air on each section of hair that you straighten. If your blow dryer has this button it will blast some cool air on your hair. This closes the cuticle, so it seals in the moisture on your hair., Flat ironing your hair before you go out into humid weather may increase the chance that it will curl or frizz up. This is because flat ironing can dry out your hair and then it will try to absorb moisture from the environment when you go outside. To avoid this, you may want to consider skipping the flat iron on humid days.If you do not want to skip the flat iron, then make sure that you use a heat protectant product, such as a straightening balm or cream.

, Using an anti-frizz hair spray may help to lock in moisture and prevent frizz. Spray some on your hair after you have finished styling it.









If you are going to blow dry or flat iron your hair, then spray your hair after you are finished.
Choose a product that is in an aerosol can. The non-aerosol kind may cause your hair t frizz more easily., Brushing your hair when the weather is humid may cause it to frizz more easily. To prevent your hair from frizzing, try using a wide toothed comb to style it and touch it up as needed.









If possible, don’t touch your style at all while you are out in humid weather.

, If all else fails, braid it, twist it or put it up in a bun. Securing your hair away in a protective style helps to protect it from the humid air. Just in case the humidity does affect your hair, you don’t have to worry about frizz or looking like a “poof ball.” It will be contained. Plus, when you take your hair down at the end of the night, you’ll have a soft wave instead of loads of frizz.Some braids to try include fishtail braids, French braids, cornrows or the common three-strand braid. Opt for French braids or cornrows for longer lasting styles.
Other god options for wearing your hair on humid days include buns, top knots, or chignons.
If you just have to be outside for a short while until you reach your destination, then you can try putting half of your hair up with hair clips.You could also try wearing a hat or even try wrapping your hair up in a scarf.

, Using a straightening treatment such as a Brazilian straightening technique, relaxer, or keratin treatment may help to alter the texture and curl-pattern of your hair. Although all hair types and textures are prone to humidity, changing the texture of your hair permanently or semi-permanently might help to eliminate the degree of frizz on humid days even if it does not eliminate it completely.


However, keep in mind that there’s no guarantee that a straightening treatment will eliminate frizz completely. Moisture makes the hair cuticle bend and curl as it tries to absorb the moisture from the air. This is the case even if your hair has been straightened.
Hair that is more fragile and porous, such as curly, wavy, kinky-curly hair and color-treated hair, is especially prone to humidity even if you have straightened it.
Generally, drier hair textures are affected the most by humidity because they require the most moisture and your hair will try to get it anywhere it can, even from the air.

Experiment with earrings.,
Wear sunglasses.,
Distract with a flashy top or necklace.,
Contour your face with makeup.,
Use double-sided tape.,
Cover your ears completely.",How to Hide Big Ears1," The right earrings can alter the overall appearance of your ears quite well, but the wrong ones will make them stand out even more. There are two approaches people use for large ears, so try them both and see which works for you:


Small lobe earrings detract attention from tall or stuck-out ear tips. Studs are a good choice, but small hoops or dangle earrings can work.
Other people take the opposite approach and wear large lobe earrings, making the ears look relatively smaller. Like upper cartilage piercings, this tactic does make your ears into a focal point, but perhaps one you can be proud of.;
, Not only do these draw attention to your eyes, a pair of sunglasses with large frames can partially hide your ears if you push them up to your forehead.

, While you might worry about your ears, chances are good that other people barely notice them, especially if you draw their attention elsewhere. Choose a top with a bright color or a vivid pattern, or wear a necklace.

, Wearing a little makeup will focus attention on your face. Try contouring using two shades of foundation. Start by contouring the outline of your face with foundation two or three shades darker than your skin, then use lighter foundation to highlight areas such as the center of your forehead and the bridge of your nose. Blend these together well along the border between them.


You can even contour the outer edge of your ears in the same way, but this can be difficult to get right if you're not used to applying makeup.

, On days when you are feeling especially insecure, pin back your ears to the side of your head using double-sided tape. Use a tape intended for skin to avoid pulling out your hair, such as clothing fashion tape.


This is a temporary measure for occasional use. The tape may come undone if you leave it on too long.

, There are many accessories that hide your ears altogether, including headbands, earmuffs, bandanas, scarves, turbans, hoods, or a hat large enough to tuck your ears into. A large pair of headphones will also work when you're engaged in solitary activities in public.

Grow out your bangs.",How to Hide Big Ears2," If you have short hair, try applying mousse or other hairstyling products, and mussing your hair in a bedhead look to partially hide your ears or distract from them.


In the long run, you could try growing out the sides of your hair to medium length, to cover your ear tips. You can keep the rest of your hair short, although not buzz cut short.
All the remaining steps in this section are focused on medium to long hair styles.

, The more volume your hair has, the easier it will be to cover your ears. There are several ways you can accomplish this:



Apply dry shampoo.
Use mousse or other hair styling products.

Curl your hair, add a wave, or get a perm. The simplest method is to use hair curlers overnight, but there are more permanent options described in the linked articles, or available at hairdressers.

, If you have long hair, pull it back loosely, so the sides arc over your ears. Side ponytails or braids are another option.


Avoid tight or high pony tails, which pull your hair away from your ears.
You can even go for the princess Leah side buns look, if you want to completely hide your ears.

, Long, sideswept bangs can hide your ears completely. Even shorter bangs left in front, with the rest of your hair pulled back, will make your hairstyle softer and less star, so your ears are not as much of a focal point.

As an example, if you struggle with negative self talk (those voices in your head that tell you you’re a loser, worthless, stupid etc.), work on countering that with positive affirmations such as “I am thoughtful” or “I am a good friend”.
When you're confident, you don’t beat yourself up for making mistakes, and you don’t talk down to yourself. Confident people are able to celebrate the success of others without feeling jealous or bad about themselves.;
, It can be difficult to enjoy life when your mind is on the past or future. Instead of worrying about what you just said or what might happen next, enjoy the moment you're in.


If you’re nervous and unsure of what to say, a great way to connect with someone is to ask them questions. In particular, asking someone for advice about something, or encouraging them to talk about themselves, is a great way to get them to like you.If you are relaxed and focused during your time with with others, they will be more likely to enjoy your company and seek it out again.

, If you’re talking to a guy you like (or anybody, for that matter), a surefire way to get them to like you (at the very least, as a friend) is to actively listen to them. Active listening involves the following steps:Don’t interrupt or judge the person who is talking.
Nod your head or give short verbal signs (“yes”, “mm hmm”) that show you acknowledge what the person is saying.
Paraphrase what they’ve said so that they know you’ve understood.
Ask questions to signal you’ve paid attention and are interested.

, Resist the urge to tell a guy what he wants to hear instead of what you really think. Just be sure to be respectful while you’re voicing your opinion. There’s no need to insult him or his ideas.


You want him to like you for who you are, not for who you think he wants you to be. He might even appreciate that you have your own ideas and the courage to voice them.
For example, if a guy asks what you think of a movie you didn't like, say what you really think instead of pretending you liked it just because you think he liked it. If nothing else, it'll lead to an interesting conversation.

, When people talk about their passions, it's like they come more fully alive. Their excitement can be infectious, making them exciting and fun to be around.


When you're talking to a guy you're interested in, don't be afraid to reveal a little about what's important to you.
Don’t forget to ask questions about his interests, too. This will show him that you’re interested in getting to know him better, and could help him feel closer to you., Volunteer for a cause you believe in; learn a musical instrument; take dance classes; train for a marathon; or join a recreational sports team. Being happy and fulfilled will make you more attractive to men.


In addition, having hobbies will give you more to talk about and more opportunities to bond with your crush, if he shares any of your interests. You might even meet someone through your hobbies.

, Do little things to show him that you’re interested and that you care about him. If you’re at a party, ask him if he needs a drink or some snacks; if you’ve recently talked about a concern of his, check in to see how he’s doing with that concern.


Studies have shown that if you’re loving, supportive and stable, people are more likely to consider you as a potential mate, so take opportunities to show that you are all of those things., Countless romantic comedies are built around someone saying they’re someone they aren’t, and their lie blowing up in their face. Don’t be that someone.


If your ideal night is at home with pizza and Netflix, don’t tell your crush you’re a party animal. It will only be exhausting for you, and sad when you inevitably break up because all he wants to do is party and all you want to do is relax.
If you love math and want to teach, don’t tell your adventure-seeking crush that your dream job is being a snowboarding teacher at a resort.

, It can be fun and even healthy to step outside of your comfort zone — for example, by trying new hobbies or being more social — but always make sure that you’re doing it with a firm sense of who you are and what you want in life. Stay true to your beliefs and goals.


The only good reason for changing who you are is if you are unhappy with who you are, and you want to change so that you’re happier with yourself.
If being with a certain guy requires you to be someone completely different, you probably shouldn’t be with him.

, Research shows that while physical elements play a key role in a man’s initial attraction to a woman, other factors are also important. These include humour, beliefs, and personality.Men generally like women who appear young and healthy — with good skin, youthful facial features, and trim figures — because on a subconscious level they are evaluating them as possible mates., It doesn't matter what shape you are, what your skin color is, what size you are or how long your hair is: there is beauty in you.


Studies show that other people see you as 20% more attractive than you see yourself.Too many women judge themselves harshly instead of seeing their own beauty.
Maybe you don't conform to conventional beauty standards, but who are those for, anyway? The beauty standards of today are different from those of the past and will continue to shift through time., You style should be an expression of your personality, rather than a copy of someone else's version of what's attractive. Wear things that fit well, suit your body type, and make you feel confident.


If you’re unsure of what your style is, seek inspiration in fashion icons and the people you look up to. It’s okay to experiment with different looks — it doesn’t mean you’re trying to be someone else, it’s about exploring how you express yourself.
Play around with accessories, styles and colors you wouldn't normally choose. If they feel good, wear them out; if they make you feel like you're playing dress-up, keep experimenting.

, Are there certain features that you really love about yourself? Maybe it's your deep brown eyes, your amazing hair or your pretty chin. Whatever it is, other people are sure to think it's attractive, too.


Find ways to make your best features stand out by choosing certain clothes, accessories and makeup that accentuate them.
For example, if you have really pretty dark eyes, wearing gold hoop earrings might draw more attention to them. Or, if you love your long, slender neck, you could wear V-neck tops or get a shoulder-length haircut that draws the eye to your neck.

, Some studies show that men find women more attractive when they’re wearing makeup.Other studies have shown that men prefer women who wear less makeup (although to be fair, sometimes men think a natural look equates to no makeup).If you’re not big on makeup but you’d like to try it out, you can start by keeping a natural look and just giving your face a healthy glow. You might top it off with some mascara and a natural-looking lip gloss.
Ultimately it’s most important to do what feels good to you. If you don’t want to wear makeup, don’t do it.

, Much of what attracts men to women is related to a primal instinct wherein their mind views certain features as signalling a better ability to reproduce. Symmetrical, youthful faces signal fertility and health.Studies have shown that men prefer women with childlike faces — big eyes, small noses, full lips, and a small chin.You can use mascara and lip plumper to make your eyes look wide and your lips look full.
If you want to go further, try using some contouring powder to make your face look more youthful and symmetrical., Research has shown that on average, men are more attracted to women’s lips than to any other body part. If you put some lipstick on — especially red lipstick — your lips will be even more attractive to most men.A common belief is that a full, red lip mimics widened blood vessels during arousal, leading men to think about getting intimate., Studies have shown that men generally find women with higher-pitched voices more attractive than those with lower-pitched voices. Researchers believe this is because the smaller voice sounds like it belongs to a smaller body.Ultimately you need to be yourself. Men will be most attached to a confident woman who is comfortable in her own skin (and voice), but it’s an interesting fact worth knowing. (The study also showed that women prefer men with deeper voices.), Studies have shown that wearing the color red can make a woman appear more attractive and sexually desirable to men in particular (interestingly, not to other women).There are many shades of red. Be sure to choose a shade of red that complements your complexion!

, Research shows that on average, men are most attracted to hourglass figures — a small waist and larger hips, which suggest health and fertility.The hourglass shape is the most rare body type, so don’t beat yourself up if you don’t naturally have it.


You can achieve an hourglass shape through exercises that build your bum and hips, and tighten your waist; certain styles of clothing; and/or by using a waist cincher, which is also known as waist training.Note that in some countries, a larger, rounder flame is considered more attractive as it signifies access to food and money., When you hang out with a group of girls, men will generally see individual group members as being more attractive than they actually are.


It may seem counterintuitive, as you may feel like hanging out with girls who are prettier than you will make you seem uglier, but it’s the opposite — you’ll all look more attractive., This is related to being confident. You may be striving to attract a man, but what will help you do that most is to become attractive in your own eyes. Take good care of yourself: eat well, exercise, sleep enough. And don’t beat yourself up if you have an off day or don’t look like a supermodel.


If you’re trying to attract a man you’ll likely read all sorts of article that tell you what men like, and it will often be things that you don’t have.
Research has proven that personality is more important than physical appearance, which is why it's so important to be happy and comfortable in your own skin., Advice varies depending on what you read, but on average, if you’re trying to stay in shape, you should aim to be active at least 30 minutes a day, every day. This could be something as simple as going for a walk or doing three 10-minute bursts of exercise throughout the day.


Exercising does more than keep your body healthy. It keeps your mind healthy too!

, Divide your body weight (in pounds) in half: that’s how many ounces of water you should drink a day. The amount could be more if you live in a hot climate and/or exercise regularly.


A 150-pound woman should drink between 75 and 150 ounces of water each day depending on her level of activity and where she lives.

, Studies have shown that people who are sleep deprived are less attractive than when they have had a restful night’s sleep.It’s possible to hide a bad night’s sleep with a good concealer. Get one that closely matches your skin type and use it to cover up any dark under-eye circles. Precede it with an eye cream if you need help with puffiness.
If you regularly don’t get enough sleep, consider seeing a doctor to see what the problem may be.

, Eat lots of fruits, veggies, whole grains, and lean proteins. Avoid eating processed and packaged foods, and too much sugar or salt. This will help keep your weight down, your mood stable, and your skin and hair looking good.

, Wash your face twice a day with a cleanser made for your skin type (types include normal, combination, oily, and sensitive). Follow this up with a good moisturizer that contains an SPF.


When you get out of the shower, apply a body moisturizer to keep all of your skin feeling smooth and soft.

, Smooth, full lips and straight, white teeth are commonly quoted as being key attractors for men and women. Drink enough water and regularly moisturize your lips to keep them smooth, and regularly brush your teeth.


Straight, white teeth are a sign of good genetics and on a primal level attract men.If you don’t have white teeth, don’t fret! It’s totally normal. If your teeth are healthy but just a bit stained, clean them up with a whitening toothpaste, or consult your doctor about a whitening treatment.

, Studies have shown that long, full, shiny hair is most attractive to men as it signifies health and fertility. On average, men rate women with long hair as more attractive than those with short hair, even if they have the same facial features.More important than tailoring your hair (or anything for that matter) to getting a guy is wearing your hair in a look that complements your facial shape and your personal style. Above all else, you need to feel good about how you look.
If you do want to experiment with longer hair, consider trying clip-in hair extensions, which can be purchased at salons and beauty supply shops. If your hair is very short, you might try a wig instead.
Avoid dyeing, straightening, or otherwise over-processing your hair, as frizzy, damaged hair is unattractive.

, These are the spots where you feel the most carefree, relaxed, and happy, making you look and feel more attractive.


You’ll also be more likely to meet men who share your interests and have fun doing the same things you love.
For example, if you love playing softball, join a co-ed softball team. You’re at your most attractive when you’re relaxed and having fun, so be good at what you do, but don’t take it so seriously that you get angry or mean!

, This is possibly the most effective flirting technique there is. Making eye contact projects confidence, show's you're interested, and makes people weak in the knees.


A common practice is to look into his eyes and then smile briefly before looking away. Do this a few times over 20 minutes or so, and if he’s interested, he’ll likely approach you.
If you’re already talking to him, make eye contact at special points in the conversation, like while you're giving him a compliment. Once in a while, hold his eyes just a little longer than normal to suggest that something deeper is going on.
Don't linger for too long, or it could get intense and weird. Keep things subtle in the beginning.

, Research has shown that happy women, particularly smiling ones, are generally more attractive to men.Make sure your smile is sincere, engaging your eyes and not just your mouth, which can come off as looking fake.


Laugh if he says something you think is funny, but make sure it's not forced.
A very powerful flirtation technique is to smile and make eye contact at the same time.
You can tailor your smile to the occasion — a brief shy smile to get him interested, or maybe a longer mischievous grin once you’re already talking, to let him know you’re interested too.

, You don't have to wait for him to do the talking. If you're interested in someone, introduce yourself and strike up a friendly conversation so you can get to know each other a bit.


Be sure to keep things light-hearted. If you’ve just seen a movie or a concert, talk about that. If you’re sharing a class, ask how he’s enjoying it.
As you converse, see if you can gauge his interest. If he returns eye contact, asks you questions and seems engaged, keep up the conversation and see where things go.
If he doesn't seem interested, don’t push it. Just tell him it was nice to meet him, politely excuse yourself, and start talking with a friend or someone else.

, A safe way to show a guy you’re interested and to make him more interested in you is to compliment him. Studies have shown that even insincere compliments can be effective, but it’s be to be sincere in your compliments.If he looks good in a specific shirt, tell him. If he changes his hair, let him know you’ve noticed and that you like it. Compliments will not only make him feel good; they’ll hint to him that you like him., If the conversation goes really well, and it seems like he's reciprocating, you can ask for his number. You don't have to wait for him to make the first move.


Schedule the date for a few days later so you both have some time to think about it and get ready.
If you're not quite ready to go on the date, you could just get his number or give him yours.

, Don’t be obvious about it, but do mirror the positions and movements that a man takes when he’s talking to you. Mirroring his actions sends a subconscious message that you like him, and it will make him more likely to like you back.As an example, if he runs his hand through his hair, wait a minute or two then casually do the same, with your other hand though. Make sure it looks unintentional. You don’t want to seem like a creepy copier (which you kind of are!)."

Recognize that makeup has an expiration date.,
Throw away expired products.,
Get rid of unused cosmetics.,
Rotate your products.",How to Keep Your Makeup from Going Bad1," Many people keep beloved—and half-used—cosmetics in a drawer, cabinet, or makeup bag. But that favorite blush or lip gloss may be years old and a goopy, bacteria-laden mess. Most cosmetics have a specific shelf life based on if it comes in liquid or powder form. Understanding that each of your products expires at some point can prevent infections, keep them performing well on your face, and help streamline your routine.Your makeup may have gone bad if:


You’ve had a recent eye infection or cold sore - the germs could have touched your makeup applicators
It smells different, in some cases like stale oil
Its color has changed
Its texture has changed
It feels different on your face;
, Each type of cosmetics has a general expiration date. After this, they may dry out and harbor oil and bacteria. These can cause infections as well as promote melting makeup during the day.Throw away the following products if they seem bad or at their general expiration dates:Foundations, tinted moisturizers, cream blushes, BB and CC creams: six months
Facial powder: two years
Mascara: three months
Liquid eyeliner: three months
Cream eye shadow: six months
Pencil eyeliner and powder eye shadow: two years
Lipstick, lip gloss, and lip liner: two years

, A common scenario that many individuals who use cosmetics have is “discovering” that cool new product they used once and then forgot. If you have these moments, get rid of the product. Throw any lightly used cosmetics you never apply in the trash. You can also donate unopened cosmetics packages to organizations that help women and men who don’t have as many cosmetics.Ask yourself the following questions when considering what to throw away:


When did I purchase this?
How many times have I used it?
Is it for special occasions only?
Do I still like how it looks on me?
Could this serve someone else better than me?

, If you’re like many people, you find yourself buying jazzy new cosmetics when you see sales and free gifts. This can lead to product overload in your cosmetics bag or organizer. Consider throwing away one product for every new one you purchase. If notice that a new product you bought looks like another you already own, return it to the store unused. This can help keep your cosmetics from going bad and your makeup process streamlined.


Think about donating sample-sized products, including soaps and perfumes, to organizations that provide them to needy persons.Give your child cosmetics you don’t use often. These can provide fun during playtime alone or with friends. Make sure to not give your child any expired products, which may lead to infections on a child’s delicate skin.

Stay Timeless yet Trendy.,
Makeup.,

Elegance.,
Be Cultured.,
Smile.",How to Feel More Glamorous," Aspiring for the general idea of glamour is well and good, but putting a face to the concept will give you a visual to aim for. Find someone worthy of the glamorous description to inspire you. Keep in mind, going for someone else's idea of glamor will only result in a contrived and invalid version of yourself. What is glamorous to YOU? Finding a glamour icon suited to your tastes will ensure that you embody glamour with genuine grace and comfort. You can't reach for the stars if you don't know your astrology, after all.;
, We all have flaws, but the truly glamorous don't let the world know it. This doesn't necessarily mean being bulletproof confident or being in denial. Just don't insult yourself. There's a whole world out there ready to bash who you are; give yourself a break and don't do it to yourself.

, This goes hand in hand with not insulting yourself. There is always going to be someone who doesn't like who you are no matter how you choose to present yourself. The glamorous thrive in negativity; learn to see any publicity as good publicity. If someone is going to put their energy into hating you, you're obviously worthy of their time.

, Beauty comes with the territory. We are all beautiful in our own way, but that doesn't mean you can't improve yourself. Your face is especially important; wash your face, shave your legs regularly, use lotion, shape your eyebrows, remove unwanted imperfections to the best of your ability, do whatever it takes. You were meant to be beautiful, so don't stand in your own way. Take care of your beauty needs.

, What usually defines a person of glamour is their hair. Hair color is particularly important. Make sure it is a solid, defined color; no crazy streaks or avant-garde coloring ideas. Try to find a flattering shade. The extreme colors are most glamorous (platinum blonde, raven black, daring red) but any variation that goes best with your features is a must. Keep your hair in good condition. Take pride in your hair and splurge on it a bit, anything to keep it as luxurious as you can. Also make sure your hair is in a style you find beautiful and is beautiful on you.

, Look to the past for style. A touch of something classic will ensure your glamour. Try the little black dress or pearls; something to add an old Hollywood flair to your attire. You don't need to go all out pin-up girl or flapper, but a little pop of those familiar fashions will add visual interest and it speaks volumes of your style. You should also stay on top of the latest trends. Do not follow them to the letter; that is mindless and not very exotic. Take a few notes however so you don't look completely out of place.

, Accentuate your best features, but keep it simple. Your makeup should be classy and elegant with a slight sense of something offbeat. This is a good chance to show your individuality. That doesn't mean bombarding someone with what makes you tick. Just a hint. Glamour is about subtlety. This usually entails one bold move; red lips or dramatic eye shadow for example, but never both at once. Stick with bedroom eyes or cat's eyes as a sure bet.

, Be an original. Personality is ultimately what makes one glamorous. Marilyn Monroe was pretty, but what caught you was her charm. Do not follow the crowd; if you're strange be strange. Rarity equates to being unforgettable, which is what our glamour icons are. Take comfort in who you are and it will take you places; do not however tell everyone your life story. Mystery creates intrigue. It is never polite to talk about yourself unless asked so do not assume everyone wants to pick your brain. Make someone wonder about you; give them a reason to keep coming back. Showing all your cards only makes for a loss in interest. The glamorous are interesting because there's always something new to learn about them.

, Being unemotional isn't healthy, but there is a time and a place. It is usually more appropriate to be calm and even-mannered. Carry yourself with elegance; best manners, best attire, best behavior. Practice etiquette and learn the art of conversation. This doesn't mean you have to be agreeable; you can tell someone to shove it with perfectly polite words. Just make sure you are constantly making good first impressions; treat everyday as a reason to be your best. Assume someone is outside ready to interview you and take your picture.

, Learn about the world around you; it will show your intelligence and it will make you well rounded. Having a knowledge of culture will ensure you find respect and admiration no matter where you travel. A true glamorous person is always willing and trying to learn. Particular areas of interest to know are foreign languages, arts, current events, and literature.

, Smiling shows everyone that you love being you. It makes others think that there's something to the way you live. A smile exudes an inner happiness that others will envy.

Store products properly.,
Touch your cosmetics sparingly.,
Use smaller containers.,
Avoid pumping mascara.,
Clean brushes and applicators regularly.",How to Keep Your Makeup from Going Bad2," The bathroom is often the most convenient place to store your makeup. The heat, humidity, and high levels of airborne bacteria can promote the growth of mold and yeast as well as contaminate beauty products. Keeping your cosmetics in a cool and dry closet or room may keep them from going bad or causing an infection.Consider storing products in a clear acrylic drawer or heavy plastic cosmetics bag. This can make it easier to find products and prevent contamination with fingers.Place creams, serums, and other liquid makeups in an easily accessible spot in your refrigerator.
Fill a small vase with colored marbles and place your brushes and applicators in it. A clear straw dispenser is another option that keeps brushes and applicators dust-free.
Try a hanging makeup travel bag to keep your cosmetics organized.

, Fingers can harbor bacteria and oils that degrade your makeup. Touching makeup only when necessary may keep it from going bad quickly. It may also keep it fresher for a longer period of time.Consider using brushes instead of sponge applicators to put on your makeup. Brushes sweep up less product and may not press as much oil into the product., Transfer a small amount of product to a different container. Use this on a daily basis and replenish from the original container, which can keep products from drying out.Getting small, clear, and reusable containers has several advantages. First, small containers ensure that if you do contaminate your product, you don’t lose the entire product. Second, clear containers help you more readily identify your products. Finally, reusable containers save you money—and the environment.
Label your products to more easily identify or organize them.

, Most people love the look of long and voluminous eyelashes. Applying mascara is the way many people achieve this look. However, a common thing people do is “pump,” or quickly insert and remove—the mascara wand. This can actually dry out the mascara and cause bacteria to grow in the tube. Making a concerted effort to not pump your mascara may extend its life and keep it fresh., Cosmetics brushes and sponge applicators can harbor a lot of bacteria, oil, and dust that may degrade your makeup. Clean your makeup brushes and with some soapy water every month and place them on a paper or cloth towel to dry. Wash sponge applicators after every use and replace weekly."

Soak your legs for 15 minutes before plucking them.,
Treat your skin with baby oil after plucking pubic hair.,
Wash and soak your face prior to plucking facial hair.",How to Avoid Bumps When Plucking Hair1," If you pluck hairs from your legs, spend 15 minutes getting your legs wet before plucking. It is best to pluck leg hair after a bath, but if you prefer a shower wait until the end of your shower to pluck leg hair. This softens hair and opens follicles, making hair come out easier.Strive for no more or less than 15 minutes. Any longer than 15 minutes can leave your skin wrinkled, making it more prone to irritation and red bumps.;
, The skin around your genitals can be very sensitive. It needs to be treated with soothing products just after plucking the area. After plucking pubic hair, wash the area in a lot of warm water, removing any loose hairs and shaving creams. Then, rub soft baby oil into the skin anywhere that you plucked.You should not use products other than baby oil, especially products like aftershave. Aftershave will string, irritating your skin and making bumps more likely.

, If you pluck hairs from your face, you want to soften the skin and open follicles first. Wash your face as you normally would, using any of your regular facial cleansers. From there, rinse a cloth in warm water. Press the cloth over the areas you're going to pluck.Hold the cloth in place for a few minutes. This will help open your pores, making plucking easier.

Remove hair less often.,
Sterilize your tweezers with rubbing alcohol.,
Pluck in the direction of the hair.,
Do not wear tight clothing after plucking.,
Try a different hair removal technique altogether.",How to Avoid Bumps When Plucking Hair2," The more often you remove hair, the more likely you are to cause skin irritation. This can lead to an increase of red bumps. Instead of removing hair every day, cut back to every two to three days.If you're plucking hairs exclusively, you probably do not need to remove hair every day anyway. Hairs that are removed with tweezers should not grow back for three to eight weeks., Red bumps may get infected if you're using dirty tools. Rub down your tweezers with rubbing alcohol prior to use. This will protect you from getting infected red bumps, which will be more visible., Regardless of where you're plucking, you should always pluck in the direction your hair grows. This will make the hair come off more easily, preventing red bumps., Tight fitting clothing, especially when worn just after plucking, can make red bumps more likely. Strive for loose clothes on the areas that you shave. For example, avoid tight jeans the day after you pluck your legs.If you pluck your pubic hair, try not wearing underwear for half an hour after the process. This can help prevent red bumps., If you have red hairs a lot after plucking, your skin may be sensitive to the process. Try switching up your hair removal technique and see if this lessens red bumps. You can try shaving or waxing instead of tweezing and see if makes a difference.Shaving should be done with shaving cream and you should always shave with the grain of the hair and not against it.
Hair removal creams and waxing kits should be used according to instructions. Most removal creams are placed on the area you want to remove hair and then wiped off. Waxing involves placing wax over unwanted hair and pulling it off with strips of paper.
Keep in mind, you should still moisturize skin regularly, as well as after hair removal techniques, regardless of the method you use. Make sure to get skin wet before removing hair.

Use cream on your skin regularly.,
Exfoliate regularly anywhere you pluck.,
Moisturize your skin after plucking.",How to Avoid Bumps When Plucking Hair3," In areas where you remove hair, regularly use skin cream. The more healthy and moisturized your skin is, the less prone it will be to bumps when you do pluck hairs. Do not moisturize only before and after hair removal. Do it daily to keep your skin strong.Opt for a mild daily moisturizer. Avoid harsh chemicals or abrasive options.
Hydrocortisone cream works well if you do have bumps you need to treat. It prevents swelling and inflammation, both of which can lead to red dots.

, Exfoliation gets rid of dead skin cells, leaving skin fresh and soft. Exfoliating a few times a week, focusing in particular on areas where you pluck hair, can help prevent red bumps.You can exfoliate using exfoliating gloves, which you can buy online or at a beauty supplies store. These are gloves with textured fabric that you rub on your skin while showering to remove dead skin cells.You can also opt to scrub exfoliating soaps and creams, which are more grainy than regular products, into your skin to exfoliate. Most department stores and drug stores sell exfoliating creams.
Remember, you should always moisturize after exfoliating.

, You should also be strict about moisturizing after plucking in addition to doing so regularly. This is especially important if you do things like wax and shave before plucking your hair, as your skin will be very sensitive and more prone to damage. Moisturizing can help minimize irritation.You can apply your regular moisturizer after plucking. However, there are many moisturizers specifically designed to be used after shaving. Stop by a local drugstore or salon and pick up a cream designed for use after shaving if you're very prone to red hairs.

The problem, however may be more than skin-deep. Work on doing an inner-makeover first and change the way you view yourself from the inside out.


Replace any negative or critical self-thinking with positive thoughts about the different ways you attract people. Instead of thinking, “My nose is too large” maybe think, “People tell me how beautiful my eyes are all the time.”, Think of yourself as a friend who is feeling the same way. What would you say to her if she told you she didn't feel beautiful? How would you help show her the parts of her you thought were amazing? You deserve to treat yourself as well as you treat your friends.If you are struggling, try repeating affirmations or mantras to yourself, such as:

""I radiate beauty, charm, and grace.""""I am strong, I am beautiful, I am enough.""""My body is healthy; my mind is brilliant; my soul is tranquil."", Realize that every one has something unique to only them.

Pick out a mild soap or gentle cleanser to wash your face with each day.,
Use your fingers to gently apply the cleanser and wash your face.,
Try not to touch your face too much throughout the day.,
Ignore the urge to pop pimples.,
Avoid putting cosmetics on your existing acne.,
Use salicylic acid-based shampoos to keep your head dandruff-free.,
Apply benzoyl peroxide cream to your acne.,
Try topical vitamin A cream.,
Talk to your doctor about trying to balance your hormones.,
Talk to your doctor about dermabrasion to get rid of acne scars.",How to Avoid Adult Acne1," You should try to pick out a face cleanser that is specifically designed for acne-prone skin. These sort of cleansers will regulate how much (or how little) oil your skin produces, and will be less likely to irritate sensitive skin. They also help to get rid of dead skin cells, a place that germs thrive and cause acne to form.Try lipid-free liquid cleansers. These sort of cleansers don’t contain soap, so they are gentler on your skin. They also don’t contain oils or fats, so you are less likely to break out when you use these cleansers. Cetaphil and Aquanil are two different lipid-free cleansers.
Use synthetic detergents to wash your face. These cleansers have a pH that is very similar to your skin so it is less likely that they will irritate or dry out your skin like some soaps do. An example of a synthetic detergent is Dove Sensitive Skin Bar.;
, Wash your face at least two times a day to keep your skin from excess oil that can create acne. When you wash your face, use warm water, rather than hot or cold water. Both hot and cold water can dry out your skin.


To apply your cleanser, rub your fingers in a gentle, circular motion over your whole face. You want to be careful not to be too rough with your skin because when acne is present your skin can be damaged pretty easily.

, Your fingers can collect a lot of bacteria by touching things during your daily activities. When you touch your face without washing your hands first, you are unwittingly spreading germs and bacteria on to your face that could ultimately lead to a breakout.


If you do have to touch your face, try to wash your hands before doing so. Even applying some hand sanitizer to your fingers can help keep your face from breaking out.

, While you may see a pimple and immediately want to pop it, it is important to remember that pimples contain bacteria. When you pop a pimple, that bacteria can land on other parts of your skin, creating more pimples.Your fingernails can also pose a bacterial threat. When you pop your pimple with your nails, any bacteria that is under your nails could get into the now open pimple-wound, causing further infection.

, Many cosmetics contain oils that can actually make your acne worse. While you may want to cover up your acne, it is best to avoid oil-based cosmetics. If you would prefer to use cosmetics anyway, buy cosmetics that say they are oil-free.

, Salicylic acid is an exfoliating substance that helps to control dandruff and get rid of dead skin cells. When your dead skin cells are removed, they cannot clog up your pores and cause a pimple.Exfoliating agents like salicylic acid also help to keep your pores open by helping your body to shed mature, superficial skin cells that can also cause acne.

, Benzoyl peroxide helps to reduce the inflammation caused by acne and prevents future acne by reducing the amount of oil that you skin produces. Before applying the cream to your face, wash your hands and face so that your skin is clean.Spread a thin layer of the cream on to your acne. Do this once or twice a day unless you were given specific instructions from your doctor.
Benzoyl peroxide can also come in gel and wash forms.

, Topical retinoids like vitamin A cream work by unplugging clogged pores. When your pores become unclogged, other topical medicines, like antibiotics, can enter the hair shaft and fight underlying infection. Topical retinoids come in cream, gel, and liquid forms.


You should apply the medicine to your skin once a day, usually at night. Generally you should wait to apply the cream until at least 20 or 30 minutes have passed after washing your face.

, When your hormones get thrown off, be it because of stress or some other life event, you become more likely to develop adult acne. See your doctor about ways that you can correct your hormone balance.For example, if you are a woman who notices that her period is not normal and you have developed adult acne, it is very likely that your hormone levels are messed up. Talk to your doctor about ways that you can correct them.

, Dermabrasion, or planing the skin, is a treatment that is used to remove superficial scars created by acne. Revolving wire brushes or sandpaper tools are used to remove these scars.


This should only be done by a licensed dermatologist.

Avoid chemicals known to irritate skin.",How to Avoid Irritation Caused by Natural Skin Care Products1," Skin care products marketed as natural often contain fragrance. Labels can be misleading as well and the FDA does not regulate label descriptions.

Likewise, just because a product is labeled as “all natural”, “for sensitive skin”, or “hypoallergenic” does not mean it will not cause irritation.While some fragrances may be clearly marked on the product’s label or packaging, others are “hidden” with chemical names that at first glance don’t appear to be fragrances. For example, sometimes the fragrance responsible for a product’s scent is listed as an emulsifier. Fragrances known to cause skin irritation include:Cinnamic alcohol

Read the label.,
Test the product on your skin.,
Visit your doctor.",How to Avoid Irritation Caused by Natural Skin Care Products2," If you are using a natural skin care product and you get hives, bumps, or itchy skin, you should assume it was caused by the product and stop using it immediately.

Know the benefits of using facial moisturizer.,
Wash your face before applying moisturizer.,
Place the required amount of moisturizer in your hand.,
Dab some moisturizer onto specific parts of your face.,
Spread the moisturizer around the rest of your face.,
Allow the moisturizer to dry before applying makeup.",How to Apply Moisturizer1," Moisturizers, in general, are great for your skin. When you apply a moisturizer to your face, it plumps up the skin and helps reduce the appearance of lines and wrinkles. It also protects the skin on your face from the various effects of weather, like heat and wind. And finally, and possibly most importantly, moisturizer increases the water content of your skin in order to keep it hydrated.Some moisturizers also offer sunscreen protection through SPF content. SPF, or Sun Protection Factor, indicates how well the screen will shield you from harmful ultraviolet radiation. The SPF number gives a rough sense of how long it will take for your skin to burn in the sun.If you use both a daytime and nighttime moisturizer, it’s normally the daytime version that includes SPF. Since the SPF is contained within the moisturizer, the instructions for applying it are the same as for non-SPF moisturizer.
SPF moisturizer should be used on your face all year round. Your skin can be exposed and damaged by the sun at any time of year (and in any kind of weather, sunny or not). Over time, exposure to the sun can damage the skin and increase your risk of skin cancer.;
, Before applying moisturizer you should always wash your face. A good skin care routine would have you wash your face twice a day. Once in the morning, and once in the evening (before bed). Apply your facial moisturizer after you’ve rinsed and patted your face with a towel, before your skin completely dries.Apply any facial treatments you use before the moisturizer, too. This will let them absorb properly.
When washing the face, use lukewarm to warm water. Hot water will dry your skin.

, Every type of moisturizer will come with its own instructions on how much of the product should be used on your face at a time. Thinner moisturizers may dry into the skin faster and require a larger amount to be used. Really thick moisturizers (or creams) may allow for a lot of coverage for only a small dollop of the product.Facial moisturizer also tends to come in different types of bottles or containers. For moisturizer that comes in a pump bottle, simply pump the required amount into the palm of your hand. For moisturizer that comes in a tub-like container, you can dip your fingers into the container as required.
If, after using the required amount of moisturizer, you find it is either too much or not enough, alter how much you use. Consider the recommended amount on the bottle to be a guideline or a place to start, not a hard and fast rule.

, Using the first two fingers of your dominant hand, apply dabs of moisturizer onto your face in the key dry areas such as your: forehead, cheeks, nose, chin, and neck.If one of those areas is particularly oily, don’t put a dab of moisturizer in that area.
Don’t forget to include your neck in both your washing and moisturizing routine. And if you are wearing a lower cut shirt, include whatever portion of your chest is visible. This is especially important when you’re apply a daytime moisturizer with SPF, which will help protect these areas from sun damage as well.

, Using the first two fingers of each hand, spread the moisturizer upwards and outwards from each dab on your face. Use a swirling motion to blend the moisturizer into your skin. It’s usually easiest to start at your neck, and work your way up your face to your forehead., Once you’ve blended your moisturizer into your face, allow it to dry for about 1-2 minutes before doing anything else. After that 1-2 minutes you can then apply any other products you want to your skin, including makeup.If you’re applying a separate layer of sunscreen to your face, apply it after your moisturizer. And make sure the sunscreen is designed for use on your face so it won’t clog your pores.

",How to Attain Flawless Skin," The standard breakdown of skin types is: normal, dry, oily, acne-prone, mature, and sensitive. When you know your skin type, you will have it so much easier finding the right products. If you buy the wrong products, that doesn't suit your skin type, it can really mess up your skin and even make it worse.


To work out your skin type, see How to determine your skin type.;
, You will need (by skin type): A cleanser, skin tonic, moisturizer, a scrub, a deep cleansing mask and a spot stick and make.up remover. Go for a series that fits your skin type. Having trouble with finding the proper product? Ask the one behind the desk what to buy; that's what they are there for.

, Follow it twice a day, morning and evening. The regimen is described in the next steps.

, Use your hands, and pat your face dry afterward with a clean towel. Always remember to wash your hands with soap before any contact with your face.

, When you apply it, barely touch the skin so that you don't irritate it. Let the cleanser work for about 5 minutes, or for the time described on the product. Then carefully wash the cleanser off, and pat the face dry with a clean towel.

, Gently pat (don't rub) the pad with tonic on your face. Let it penetrate the skin.

,,,


Sleeping in makeup makes your skin look older, and can cause dry or oily skin., Two-three times a week scrub your face, and once a month use your deep cleansing mask. Do what is described on the product.

, These remove dead skin cells and any dirt that probably didn't get washed out. You can use cucumbers while you sleep to get rid of those dark circles and puffiness in your eyes. You can get facials at your local beauty salon (if there's one near you) or do this yourself at home.

, Moisturizing your skin makes it smoother and hydrated. Water can also help with hydrating skin. Moisturizer also helps with wrinkling and aging skin. Most moisturizers contain SPF, so it will be protected from sun.

,,, Eat a lot of fresh vegetables as carrots and tomatoes, fruits like kiwi, oranges, avocado. Eat and/or drink nuts, eggs, fish, lemon, green or white tea. Remember to get 600 grams of fruits and vegetables every day. That way you will get the vitamins and minerals you need.


Fruit is nature's candy. Raspberries, strawberries, bananas, and so forth, are very good for your skin.Replace that Coca Cola with water with lemon.

, Exercise 30 to 60 minutes per day. Do both strength work out and cardio vascular work out. That keeps the blood circulation going.

,, Your skin reflects your emotional health as well as your physical health. Take time every day to relax and do something you really enjoy. Take a walk, get a lot of fresh air, read a book or whatever you like. Stress is never good for your skin.

, This makes your skin look worse, and it can cause even more inflammation. Plus, the injured tissue takes longer to heal, and it leaves scars. Use your spot stick on your pimples instead.

, Two times a day is enough.Your face needs natural oils.Too much face washing will lead to dry peeling skin, which does not look cute. The best times to wash your face is in the morning, and at night before you get in bed.

, Only use mascara and concealer when you need it, or just a very sheer cover of powder. Skip the heavy layer of foundation, it can clog your pores and cause pimples.


You can use make-up if you like, but use light makeup that matches your skin. There are brands that are made for covering acne. Keep in mind caking make-up on will agitate your acne and it will probably break out worse. The best thing to do is to wash your face and let it clear up. But if you do cover it up with make-up, use high quality make-up made for acne.

, Change your pillow slip more often if wished.

Exfoliate at least once a week.,

Do not use hot water to wash your skin.,
Apply moisturizer after a shower or bath.,
Use oil instead of moisturizer.,
Massage in hand cream before bed.",How to Apply Moisturizer2," While in a bath or shower, exfoliate your skin at least once a week using a loofa, face cloth, shower puff, etc. Exfoliation helps to remove the top layer of dead and dry skin cells, which when left as is, prevent your moisturizer from penetrating into your skin deep enough., When in a shower or bath, use soaps and body washes that contain moisturizer to wash your body. The labels for soaps and body washes will indicate if they contain moisturizing ingredients.One option is to apply oil to your skin while in the shower or bath, and then rinse off as much as you can before getting out. This moisturizes you skin nicely, but removes the excess oil so it doesn’t stain your clothes or feel slippery., Whether you’re washing your hands, or having a shower or bath, use warm water and not really hot water. Unfortunately hot water can actually accelerate how quickly your skin ages and dries it out faster than warm water.If you’ve ever swam in a swimming pool or bathed in a hot tub, you probably noticed how dry your skin was afterwards. This dryness was caused by the chemicals used in the water to remove bacteria (as the water is used over and over again). Most city treated water also has chemicals added to reduce bacteria, although in much smaller amounts. However long exposure to that water can still cause your skin to dry out, so it’s best to keep your showers and baths as short as you can.

, In general, it is best to apply moisturizer to any part of your body after you’ve washed that part of your body and the skin is still damp. For your body, it is best to apply moisturizer after you’ve had a shower or bath. Pat off the excess water from your skin with a towel, and then apply the moisturizer to your damp skin.You can, however, still apply moisturizer to your body if you did not wash it. But the moisturizer will be more effective on damp skin.
Apply body moisturizer using short, but firm, strokes with your hand.Pay specific attention to applying moisturizer to the driest parts of your body like: hands, elbows, knees, and feet.
If you apply moisturizer to your feet after a shower or bath, be careful about walking around in bare feet afterwards. Avoid walking on tiles or hardwood floors without socks or slippers.

, Many products — other than specifically designed body moisturizers — can help hydrate your skin. For example, you can use coconut or olive oil, instead of moisturizer, to get the same, or even better, results.If you decide to use an oil rather than a moisturizer, remember to wipe off excess oil with a towel after it’s been applied to your skin.
Also keep in mind that some oil may stain the clothes you put on over top of your skin. Because of this, it is best to apply oils before bed, under your pyjamas.

, Your hands go through a lot over the course of the day. Every time you wash your hands, for example, the natural oils on your skin, plus any previously applied hand cream, gets washed off.Before bed, apply a larger than normal amount of hand cream and massage the cream into your hands for a few minutes.
It’s a good habit to start reapplying hand cream every time after your wash your hands to continuously rehydrate your skin.

Use only eye cream around your eyes.,
Apply eye cream only with your finger.,
Dab the eye cream under your eyes.,
Tap to blend the eye cream.,
Press eye cream onto your eyelids.,
Allow the eye cream to dry before applying makeup.",How to Apply Moisturizer3," The skin around your eyes is much thinner and more sensitive than the skin anywhere else on your body, and as such, it needs to be treated with extra care. Eye creams are designed specifically for this type of skin and should be the only product (other than eye makeup) that is applied to this area., Always apply your eye cream using your middle or ring finger on your dominant hand. The reason for this is that this finger is used the least and will be the most gentle.If your eye cream comes in a pump bottle, you’ll need to pump a small amount of the cream onto the finger you’re going to use, and add more as needed. If you’re eye cream comes in a tub-like container, you can simply dip your finger into that container as needed.

, Using your middle or ring finger, dab the eye cream lightly around the base of your eye, about ½ an inch blow your eyelashes. Start nearest to your nose and dab moving outwards until you reach the corner of your eye., Using the same finger, continue to tap the eye cream into your skin until it’s completely blended. Try not to dab/tap too close to your eye lashes in order to avoid any eye cream from running into your eyes and irritating them., Using the same finger, obtain another dab of eye cream and rub it into your eyelid, along the orbital bone above your eye. You do not need to apply cream to your entire eyelid, just the area directly below your eyebrow along the bone line., After you’ve blended your eye cream into your skin, wait 1-2 minutes before applying any eye makeup. This is especially important if you use any liquid types of eye makeup, as it may run if your skin is too damp.It is especially important to remove all your eye makeup at the end of the day, before you wash your face before bed.

Determine your skin type.,
Think of other considerations.,
Do not forget about your lips.,
Use a humidifier.,
Apply hand cream after washing.",How to Apply Moisturizer4," Different moisturizers are made for different skin types. Your skin type can differ somewhat between body parts (e.g. you might find your face is oily but your leg are dry). You should select a moisturizer (for your face and body) based on the type of skin you have on those parts. The different skin types are as follows:Normal Skin — Skin that is able to maintain a natural moisture balance. Normal skin only needs a light, water-based moisturizer to keep it looking fresh.

Dry Skin — Skin that is dry to very dry in certain areas, sometimes even cracked. Dry skin needs heavier, oil-based moisturizers in order to keep it hydrated properly.

Oily Skin — Skin that may have patches of oil in one or more places, normally on your face. Oily skin also tends to be more susceptible to acne and breakouts. Although counter-intuitive, oily skin still needs to be moisturized, especially after you’ve washed it. For oily skin, use really light, water-based moisturizers that won’t clog pores.

Sensitive Skin — Sensitive skin can be easily irritated and may turn red, itchy or even break into rashes when certain products are used. You should try to select a moisturizer with soothing ingredients for sensitive skin to help prevent irritation. You’ll also want to avoid moisturizers with fragrance and dyes, as they’re more likely to irritate sensitive skin.

Mature Skin — As skin ages, the oil-producing glands slow down and skin becomes drier. Mature skin will have a better time maintaining moisture if an oil-based product with antioxidants or alpha hydroxy acids is used.

, Some moisturizers are designed for older skin, to help reduce lines and wrinkles. While yet other moisturizers may contain extra ingredients that help with certain conditions, like acne. Before selecting a moisturizer, think about any specific situations you may want to address.Your skin type can change because of the season (the winter can cause you to have dry skin when you may have normal skin in the summer), and due to other medical conditions (i.e. pregnancy, menopause, etc.). Change your moisturizer when your skin type changes.
The cost of a moisturizer is NOT an indication of its quality.
If one type of moisturizer isn’t working for you, experiment with others until you find one that meets all your needs.

, Your lips are skin too, and they also need to maintain moisture in order to look great. Use a moisturizing lip balm to keep your lips soft and plump. Carry it with you and reapply as needed throughout the day. You can even wear it under your lipstick.Your lips can also burn in the sun, so try to use a lip balm that contains SPF.

, Sometimes, especially in the winter, the air can get so dry that it seems to literally suck the moisturizer out of your skin. One way to help avoid this is to use a humidifier in your home. You can install humidifiers directly to your furnace (if you live in a place where you have a furnace), or you can buy humidifiers that can be used in one room., Your hands take the brunt of just about everything that you do. However, every time you wash your hands you not only remove some of the moisturizer you previously applied, you remove the natural oils and moisture in your skin. Get into the habit of applying hand cream every time after you wash your hands in order to keep them soft."

You don’t want to continue using it, especially on your entire face, if it is going to give you an unpleasant reaction.Instead of applying the crème to the entire facial area, only apply a small amount of the peeling formula (Cerate 39XXX) to a small area of your face. It is usually best to choose an area between the chin and the neck.
Leave the crème on for 30 minutes, then rinse it off. Wait at least six days before beginning the full course of treatment to ensure that there are no unwanted side effects on the area you tested.
Be sure to always only use these products on your face. And don’t apply these products to skin that has been freshly peeled – either from similar products or from damage due to a sunburn.;
, Once you have successfully completed the patch test (and waited six days for the results), begin the next step by washing your face with cold water. Be sure to avoid using any soap or cleaner – just cold water – for this part of the process.Pat your skin dry and wait for five minutes before moving on to the next step.

, Apply the entire contents of one of the jars of peeling cream over your entire face using the applicator. Do not rub the cream in. Instead, create a thick coating of the cream on the surface of your facial skin and let it sit there.Upon application of the peeling cream, a hot stinging sensation often occurs.
Be sure to avoid contact with the delicate parts of your face – like your eyes, eyelids, lips, and inner nostrils.
Make sure you wash your hands after each application. The peeling cream is only intended for use on your face, so you don’t want to leave it on your hands for too long.

, Leave the cream on your face for 90 minutes. Once the time is up, remove the cream with the included applicator. To remove any excess cream, put some Vaseline on your face and wipe it off with tissues or cotton pads.At this stage, your skin may become a deeper red and, in some cases, a dark tan. Your face may also begin to feel tight.

, Wait at least eight hours before rinsing your face after you’ve used the Vaseline to remove the excess peeling cream. Your face needs the Vaseline to keep it supple during this intense peeling process. Once you’ve waited eight hours, you can gently rinse your face with warm water first and then cold water.Be sure to avoid using any soap or cleanser on your face at this point.

, For the first four days of the peel, you’ll need to repeat the above steps (numbers 2 through 5) during each application. This means that each you will clean your face, apply the peeling cream, remove the cream with Vaseline, and rinse your face.


Once you finish the fourth day, you should move on to the second phase.

, Before you begin on days 5 and 6, take a moment to gently rinse your face with warm water, followed by cold water. You can use a washcloth or cotton ball to gently pat the water dry on your facial skin.Be sure to avoid using any cleanser or soap on your face during this part of the process when your facial skin can be so sensitive.

, For days 5 and 6, apply a thick layer (about ¼ of the jar) of the Normalizer Cream to your entire face. Leave it on for 90 minutes and let it soak into your skin.Be very careful not to pick or pull at old skin during this stage as it could cause permanent or unsightly damage to your skin.
As your skin continues to peel, keep using the Normalizer Cream every day until the peeling is complete.

, Leave the Normalizer Cream on for 90 minutes and then remove it with cotton balls or tissues. When your skin is done peeling, you may discontinue use of the Normalizer Cream.You may also rinse your face with cool water and pat it dry with a towel. Remember not to use any cleanser or hot water on your face.
If peeling continues beyond the sixth day, don’t worry. This is a normal part of the process.

, You need to make sure you are storing these open containers carefully so that no one gets access to them who shouldn’t. You wouldn’t want a beloved child or pet getting a hold of these products and accidentally ingesting or using them.Be sure to store the skin peel products in a cool, dry place.
These products should always be stored out of the reach of children.

, While you are using this product, it’s normal to feel a bit of irritation or even a slight burning sensation. However, the peel treatment should not be outright painful. If you begin to feel pain, immediately discontinue use of this product.


Consult a doctor if you are worried about the pain or experience any other concerning side effects.

, During your treatment plan with this product, your face will begin to peel and you’ll need to cut back on other products that you may normally use on your face. Until the peeling process is complete, you shouldn’t apply any other preparations, treatments, soaps, or makeup to your skin., Avoid shaving or waxing your face while using this product. The skin peel takes layers of old skin off of your face, and shaving with a razor could seriously (and easily) damage your currently delicate facial skin. Wait to continue shaving your face until you have completely finished using the skin peel product and have given your face a bit of time to heal.You should also refrain from picking at your skin while using this product. The dead skin should loosen and come off on its own. Picking at it could damage your sensitive skin.

, During this time, especially because your skin is so sensitive, use an SPF15 or higher sunblock on your facial skin. The sunblock will help protect your delicate skin during this transitional time and prevent further damage.


Continue to use the sunblock for at least thirty days after the peeling treatment, regardless of weather conditions.

Repeat the process once per week.",How to Apply Face Masks Correctly," There are many types of masks on the market, and even more that you can make at home. First, look in the mirror and determine what you want your mask to accomplish. Are you aiming to hydrate your skin or to clear up oil? Do you want to get rid of breakouts or are you looking for an anti-aging product? Once you know what kind of mask (or masks) you need, you can find, or make, the right product., There are two routes you can take when using a mask product: purchasing a store-bought mask, or making a DIY mask at home. If you will be using a store-bought mask, read any preparation instructions and follow them. (Some clay masks, for example, require the addition of water or apple cider vinegar). If you will be using a homemade mask, gather all of your ingredients and follow the recipe.









Homemade masks can be made from egg whites, avocado, milk, oatmeal, and many other household products. Find a recipe that works for you.
Store-bought masks can be found for all manner of skin ailments and skin types. Read ingredient labels and find a mask that you’d like to use., Face masks are best applied with a soft-bristle brush, such as a paintbrush (normally used for art making) or a tint brush (normally used to apply hair dye). Invest in a brush that you will use for this purpose, and be sure to clean it when you are done.








You will also need a bowl for your mask, and possibly a washcloth.

, You may want to cut two very thin slices of cucumber to place over your eyes. This will relax your eye area and reduce any eye puffiness while your mask works.








If you do not have any cucumber at home, slices of raw potato will work as well., Keep all of these things in the refrigerator until you are ready to use them. This is especially true if you are using perishable ingredients in your mask, but even if you are using a store-bought mask product, applying it cold can feel great and be good for your skin.








For a cooling effect, place face mask in the refrigerator at least one hour prior to application.

, Before you apply your mask, be sure to cleanse your skin thoroughly. Using warm water and your favorite facial cleanser, remove any makeup, dirt, and oil. Do not apply moisturizer.







, If it has been a while since you last exfoliated, it is a good idea to do so before you apply your mask. It removes the dead skin cells and helps your mask absorb better.









You can use a store-bough facial scrub, such as St. Ives Apricot Scrub.
Alternatively, you can mix a small bit of ground coffee or sugar into your face wash.
Apply the product to wet skin, gently scrub, and rinse with warm water.

, Your mask will do the most good if open up your pores before applying it. The simplest way to do this is to take a hot shower before applying your mask.








As an alternative, you can take a washcloth and dip it in hot water (as hot as your face can bear) and cover your face with the washcloth until it cools off.
A third option is to hold your face over a bowl of steaming water for 1-2 minutes.

, Using a paintbrush (or another soft-bristled wide brush) or your fingertips apply the mask evenly to your face. If you do not have a brush and plan to use your fingertips, then make sure your hands are clean before applying the mask. Be sure that the application of the product is even and smooth. Avoid going too close to your eyes or mouth, but don’t forget your neck!







, After applying the mask, set cucumber (or potato) slices on your eyes, if you are using them, and relax. You may want to switch off the light. It relaxes you better.







, The length of time you will leave on your mask will vary based on the type of mask you are using, and the type of skin you have. In general, 15 minutes is a good average for most masks. Set a timer for yourself and relax.If using a clay mask, do not wait for the clay to dry. Remove the mask while the clay is still slightly wet.If using a store-bought mask, read the instructions to know how long to leave it on.

, After the proper waiting time, use warm water and a washcloth to gently remove the mask. Be sure to gently wipe away the mask from around your hairline and under your chin.







, Use a cotton ball to apply toner to your face and neck. This shrinks your pores and locks in all the benefits of your mask. Finally, apply a bit of your favorite moisturizer.








Avoid applying too much moisturizer, as this will clog your freshly-cleared pores., It is important to avoid using clay masks too often because it can irritate your skin. However, using a clay mask can be a refreshing treatment for your skin. Use a clay mask only once per week to reduce the chances of irritation.

If your skin is dry, then you may want to use a clay mask less often.
If your skin is oily, then you might be able to use the treatment more often.

Understand the research.,
Be aware that it is very difficult to achieve the correct dilution at home.,
Understand that using bleach on the face is not recommended by doctors.,
Know that bleach can burn and irritate the skin.,
If you decide to go ahead with using bleach on your face, make sure to follow the proper safety precautions.,
Try specific facial bleaching creams.,
Consider using hydroquinone.,
Use ""brightening"" creams.,
Wear sunscreen everyday.,
Use lemon.,
Try yogurt and turmeric.,

Try raw potato.",How to Apply Bleach to Your Face," The recent trend for using household bleach on the face is believed to have started with a study conducted at Stanford University School of Medicine. This study found that diluted bleach helped to heal and renew the skin of mice with dermatitis.


The object of this study was to find a solution for radiation dermatitis - an unpleasant skin condition that often affects patients undergoing chemotherapy and radiation treatment. However, researchers believe that in the future, bleach could also be a key ingredient in treating skin problems caused by sun damage and aging.
Although this study indicates that bleach could be the answer to many skin issues, it is important to remember that the test subjects were mice, not humans. Human trials have yet to be conducted.
In addition, the various applications of bleach as an ingredient in household beauty products requires further study.;
, Another point to take into consideration is the fact that the Stanford researchers used a very specific dilution rate in their study - .0005, to be exact.


Most household bleaches have a concentration somewhere between 5% and 8%, making them significantly stronger than the solution deemed safe for use during the study.
Even if you attempted to dilute bleach yourself before use, it would be very difficult to achieve a concentration of .0005 without the necessary knowledge concerning dilution methods, or the required tools.
The effects of using a dilution higher than .0005 have not been studied, and could have an adverse effect on skin. , Although medical researchers are currently looking into the applications of bleach in anti-aging and skin rejuvenation products, the use of household bleach as an at-home face cleanser is not recommended by doctors.


In fact, many doctors would strongly advise against it. Dr. Mona Gohara, a professor of dermatology at Yale School of Medicine states ""Bleach is absolutely too irritating and should not be used as a face wash ... If used incorrectly, bleach can cause extreme inflammation and dryness.""While Dr. Daniel Shapiro, a renowned Phoenix-based cosmetic surgeon has stated ""I wouldn't recommend trying the bleach facial at home ... I do see how bleach can be a potentially promising product for anti-aging ... But it will need a great amount of work."", Bleach is a corrosive substance - in fact, in high concentrations it can burn a hole through stainless steel.And even in low concentrations bleach can burn the skin, leaving it red, dry and irritated. Therefore, although the object of using bleach on your face is to to make it clear and glowing, you could very likely end up producing the exact opposite effect.

, Ensure that the bleach is highly diluted first. The dilution used by the Stanford researchers was less concentrated than the water in a swimming pool.As it is difficult to work with very tiny amounts of bleach, it is easier and safer to use a large quantity of water instead. Therefore, you should make the bleach solution a gallon jug by mixing 1/4 teaspoon of bleach with three quarts and 12 ounces of warm water.
When it's ready, label the container clearly and mark with a skull and crossbones and poisonous. Store the jug where it can be stored for later use. Do not put the bottle of bleach in the refrigerator, or anywhere it could be mistaken for a beverage.
Make sure to perform a patch test on a small piece of skin before applying the bleach solution to your entire face. Use a cotton pad to apply a dab of the bleach on the skin below the jawline. Wait 24 hours to see if any redness, dryness or irritation occurs before proceeding.
If no irritation occurs and you decide to proceed with the bleach treatment, apply only a thin layer of the diluted bleach solution to the entire face (carefully avoiding the eyes, mouth and nostrils) and leave for a maximum of ten minutes.
Thoroughly rinse the bleach from your face using a face wash and running water, then immediately moisturize the skin. If any irritation occurs, do not repeat the treatment.It is strongly advised that you consult with your doctor or dermatologist before using bleach on your skin. There are many safer, more effective options out there, whether you wish to target skin discoloration, acne or signs of aging.

, A much safer option than using household bleach is to use bleaching products designed specifically for the face. These products can be bought over-the-counter and often contain ingredients such as hydrogen peroxide, which is a well-known bleaching agent.


Facial bleaching creams are designed to brighten the skin and hide unwanted facial hair. They should be used according to the instructions on the packaging.
You should discontinue use of these products if any irritation occurs.

, Hydroquinone is an effective skin lightening cream which uses retinoids (acidic vitamin A) instead of bleach.


It is mainly used for treating skin discoloration and dark spots, as it reduces melanin in the skin. Hydroquinone creams should only be used at night, as they make skin hyper-sensitive to UV light.
Although 2% solutions of hydroquinone are available over-the-counter in the US (4% with a prescription), it is important to be aware that products containing hydroquinone have been banned in large parts of Europe and Asia due to their potential carcinogenic properties.
As a result, you should consult with your dermatologist before using any hydroquinone products., If you are simply looking to brighten your complexion and achieve a more youthful, dewy look, then brightening creams are the way to go.


These creams are available over-the-counter and usually contain natural lightening agents such as kojic acid, glycolic acid, alpha hydroxy acids, vitamin C or arbutin.
These ingredients also work to inhibit melanin production and reduce pigmentation in the skin, but they are safer than hydroquinone.

, The sun is a major culprit when it comes to skin discoloration, dark spots and general signs of aging.


Therefore, it is imperative that you protect your face from harmful UV rays by wearing sunscreen everyday.
Simply by wearing sunscreen, you can protect your skin from becoming darker and prevent many of the skin problems associated with sun exposure, including skin cancer.
You should wear a minimum of factor 30, and wear a hat to protect your face from direct sunlight. You should even wear sunscreen in winter, as harmful UV rays can penetrate clouds and cause damage, even if it's not hot. , The citric acid contained in fresh lemon juice is an effective natural bleaching agent and can be used to brighten the complexion and to minimize discoloration and the appearance of dark spots.


Squeeze the juice from half a lemon and dilute to half strength with water. Dip a cotton ball into the liquid and dab onto the face, concentration on the areas you wish to brighten.
Leave the lemon juice to sit for 10 to 15 minutes, then wash off with cold running water and apply a nourishing moisturizer (as lemon juice can be drying). Repeat several times a week for best results.
A word of warning - never expose your skin to sunlight while the lemon is juice is on your face, the citric acid makes your skin extra sensitive and increases the risk of sun damage., Turmeric has been used in Indian skincare for hundreds of years, thanks to it's smoothing, lightening, anti-aging and anti-inflammatory properties.


To make a mask that won't stain your skin, mix 1 teaspoon of turmeric with 2 teaspoons of rice flour and 3 tablespoons of plain yogurt (or milk or cream).
Apply the mask to your face and leave to sit for 10 to 15 minutes, until hard. Rinse off with warm water, using a gentle scrubbing motion., Aloe vera is a gentle, moisturizing natural substance which soothes red, inflamed skin and helps to fade discoloration.


To use, simply snap a leaf from an aloe vera plant and squeeze to produce a clear, gel-like sap. Rub this sap all over your face and leave to sit on your skin for as long as you like.
Aloe vera is extremely gentle and safe to use, so you can apply the sap as often as you like., Due to its high vitamin C content, the juice from potatoes is believed to work as a skin lightener. Vitamin C is used in many skin lightening products.


To try it, simply cut a well-washed potato in half, then rub the exposed flesh over the skin you wish to lighten. Leave for 10 to 15 minutes, then wash off.Cucumbers and tomatoes are believed to have similar skin-lightening properties, as they also contain high quantities of vitamin C.

It's best to start the conditioning treatment in your bathroom, but you'll be able to move around while you let it soak into your hair for a few hours.;
, You can use a plastic shower cap, a large sheet of plastic wrap, or a second old t-shirt to wrap up your hair. Choose something you'll be able to keep in place for several hours, or even overnight.

, The amount of coconut oil you'll need depends on the length and thickness of your hair. If you have long, thick hair, use 5; if your hair is shorter and thinner, you only need 3 or 4.


Use unrefined, cold pressed (not refined or solvent extracted). Refined coconut oil has additives and is put through processes that remove some of the natural compounds that make it so healthy for your hair and skin. Unrefined coconut oil is complete in its natural, healthy goodness. Similarly, solvent extracted oil usually contains traces of the hazardous hexane solvent.
Make sure not to use too much; focus the oil on the middle section and bottom of your hair. If too much is used, especially near the scalp, this can cause the hair to look greasy even when washed out thoroughly. Your hair produces its own natural oils that come from the scalp.

, Avoid the microwave oven as it can destroy the bio-active compounds.


You can melt coconut oil with your hands. Melt one tablespoon at a time by holding it between your palms and gently rubbing them together. Coconut oil melts with very little heat.
Heat a small saucepan or bowl on the stove. Remove from flame and pour the oil into the bowl. Let it melt and get warm.
You can also heat up coconut oil on the stove. Scoop it into a small saucepan and heat it up over low heat until it has just melted.
You can also heat up coconut oil by running the jar under hot water in a sink until it melts which will only take a few seconds.

, Pour the coconut oil into your hand and then start applying it to the ends of your hair first. Use your fingers to massage it in and smooth it down your hair shaft all the way to the strands. Avoid applying the oil to your scalp. Continue massaging it into your hair until your hair is completely drenched in coconut oil.


You can use a comb to help you distribute the oil evenly. Pull it down from your roots to your tips.
You may just want to condition the ends of your hair, rather than the roots. If that's the case, apply the coconut oil to the ends of your hair instead of pouring it over your scalp. Massage it in with your hands.
If you have fine hair, then only apply the oil to the tips of your hair.

, Place your shower cap, plastic wrap, or old t-shirt over your head and wrap it up so that your hair is completely covered.


You can secure your hair with a loose hair band to help it all stay wrapped up on top of your head.
Use a towel to wipe away drips that might have gotten on your face during the wrapping process.
For fine hair, wrap your hair before piling it on your head to avoid getting the oil on your roots.

, The longer you keep it in your hair, the more conditioned your hair will be. Wait as long as you can manage for best effect.

, Use a sulfate-free shampoo to wash out the coconut oil. Wash it two or three times, until your hair no longer feels oily.

, Let it air dry or blow it dry to see the effects of the conditioning treatment. It should be soft, shiny and gleaming after this special coconut oil application.

Rub egg whites into your skin.",How to Tighten Skin1," Exfoliation is a process in which you use grainy scrubs to remove dead skin cells. This can help tighten up saggy, loose skin. Exfoliate the skin you're trying to tighten each day and you may eventually see results.Use an exfoliating brush or rag to brush your skin in the morning before you take a shower.
Use long strokes to brush your legs and arms. Work your way from your feet to your thighs, then from your hands to your shoulders, always brushing toward your heart.
Concentrate on areas where your skin is loose.;
, Collagen and elastin are skin proteins that contribute to skin elasticity. If you're worried about your skin sagging, look for firming creams at a department, salon, or online. Opt for creams that contain collagen and/or elastin and apply them to the areas that need tightening according to package directions., Find a skin moisturizer at a drug store or online that's fortified with vitamin E, vitamin A, vitamin C, or soy protein. These vitamins and proteins can help skin tighten and reduce the appearance of wrinkles. Apply your moisturizer daily to problem areas.If you prefer something more natural, many people find moisturizing with coconut oil helps.

, For a simple, natural cure, try egg whites. Some people find the protein in egg whites is helpful for skin and can tighten problem areas. Simply rub egg whites into your skin and then rinse. Do this daily and see if you notice your skin tightening."

Wash your face.,
Choose your cleaning products wisely.,
Drink plenty of water.,
Rub petroleum jelly or baby oil on your skin after your bath or shower.,
Wear sunscreen.",How to Achieve Smooth Skin on a Budget2," Wash your face at least once per day and no more than three times per day. Washing your skin removes oil and dirt, allowing healthy, smooth skin to shine through. When you wash regularly, you also prevent that dirt and oil from embedding deep down in your skin which can cause blemishes, spots, and redness.Touch your skin gently when you wash it, working in gentle circles which clean deeply and also give you a slight massage.
Rinse with cold or warm water. Hot water dries your skin out.

, You don’t need to spend a lot of money to get great cleaning products, such as face wash, astringent, and moisturizer. Look for face wash that doesn’t contain the drying ingredient sodium lauryl sulfate. Instead, look for plant-based cleansers and vitamin or essential oil-infused washes.You can find great cleaning products at your local drugstore, big box stores, and health food markets.
Look for a mild facial cleanser that has moisturizer as an active ingredient. The bottle will likely advertise this on the front.
Again, the dollar store is a wonderful place to find name-brand facial products.
Print manufacturer coupons for steep discounts on moisturizers, lotions, and make-up.

, Applying moisturizer to your skin is helpful in moisturizing the top layer of your skin, but for truly smooth, vibrant skin, you need to moisturize from the inside as well. Drink at least 64 ounces of water per day, aiming more for 100 ounces per day. Drinking water hydrates your skins cells, moisturizing from the inside out, and is a great way to obtain smooth skin on a budget.If you’re in a warm climate or you exercise, compensate for water loss by increasing your water intake. Dehydration can cause a variety of health problems, and will definitely be visible in your skin.

, After bathing and before drying, rub petroleum jelly or baby oil on your skin. You’ll trap the water in between the oil coating and your skin, which maximizes hydration. Once it’s rubbed in, towel dry as you normally would.The dollar store usually isn’t the best option for petroleum jelly and baby oil. Instead, your big box stores like Target and Walmart carry store brand petroleum jelly and baby oil for much less per ounce than other retailers.

, Sunscreen not only protects your skin from the damaging effects of ultraviolet radiation, which can cause skin cancer, but it also protects your skin from sun damage. Sun damage can make your skin look dull, dry, and lifeless. Because sunscreen wears off after a while, make sure to apply it at least twice per day, even if you won’t be spending much time outside.This is one product that you will want to splurge on, but that doesn’t mean you have to break the bank. Look for sales and manufacturer’s coupons.
You can also find great deals on moisturizers with sunscreen toward the end of summer. Just remember to pay attention to expiration dates.
You’ll want two different sunscreen products: a facial moisturizer with sunscreen and a general, all-body sunscreen.

Apply a good foundation.,
Rub face primer on your shoulders.,
Use a bronzer on your face and collarbone.",How to Achieve Smooth Skin on a Budget3," Fortunately, foundation doesn’t have to be expensive to be good. Look for a liquid foundation that’s relatively creamy, and if possible, one that contains silicone. Most importantly, you want to buy a foundation that matches your skin tone. Use a cosmetic sponge to apply your foundation, and make sure that you don’t put it on too thick, as that will just accentuate any wrinkles or bumps that you have.You can hold the bottle up to your neck to get a good idea of your face’s skin tone.

, Face primer contains light diffusers and are great for diffusing light, smoothing skin, and drawing attention to all the right places. Apply face primer to your shoulders, arms, legs, and even your back to achieve a smooth, brilliant look. Instead of buying an expensive primer, consider using a little baby powder instead.Primer is typically pretty expensive, but you can usually get it at a great discounted price. You can look through your Sunday paper for sales and coupons, often combining the two for an even better deal.

, Buy a brown-toned bronzer while avoiding orange or metallic bronzers, which give an unnatural look. With a wide make-up brush, apply bronzer to all areas of your face and collarbone that would naturally tan first: your forehead, your cheek and jaw bones, and your nose. Lightly dust your face and collarbone with bronzer to draw attention to specific parts of your face and shoulders, while smoothing out the appearance of the rest of your face.Choose a bronzer by what color you are when you tan naturally. Bronzers usually come in three shades: light, medium, and dark. So, if you are fair complected or just don’t tan much at all, you’ll want a light bronzer.
Bronzer is another typically expensive product. As with primer, look through your local advertisements for a sale on cosmetics.

Rub a little coconut oil around your eyes.,
Apply coconut oil sparingly to other dry areas.,
Rub coconut oil on your lips.,
Use coconut oil as a face cream.",How to Use Coconut Oil on Your Hair and Skin2," Whether you lightly splash your face with water, exfoliate it with a brush, or use the oil cleansing method, go ahead and wash your face. Pat it dry with a soft towel, making sure not to pull at your skin - your facial skin is fragile, and a lot of pulling and tugging can cause damage.

, Coconut oil is a wonderful undereye cream. It helps moisturize that paper-thin skin, improving dark circles and keeping wrinkles at bay. Use your fingertip to pat—don’t rub—a tiny amount under your eyes, focusing on areas that have wrinkles. Then, gently run your finger along your undereye area to distribute the oil.You probably only need a pea-sized amount for each eye. Take care not to use too much.
Avoid getting the coconut oil in your eyes. It will thinly coat your eyes, making your vision blurry for a little while!

, If you tend to get a very dry patch between your eyebrows, at your temples, or in another spot, apply a small amount of coconut oil there. Rub it in gently using a circular motion.

, Unrefined coconut oil will soften and moisturize chapped lips. It's completely edible, so there's no need to worry about ingesting a little. In fact, eating coconut oil is great for your health.

, If you have dry skin, then you might consider applying coconut oil as a face cream. However, do not apply oil before applying makeup because it will affect the look of your makeup. Put it on after a shower or after washing your face. Let it absorb into your skin for 10 minutes before applying makeup. You only need about a dime-sized amount to cover your whole face.


Some people experience breakouts when they use coconut oil all over. Experiment by using coconut oil on just one patch of skin for a few days. If you like the effect and see no signs of the breakout, use it all over.
You can use coconut oil for the oil cleansing method, too. Again, be careful if your pores are prone to get clogged. You can cut coconut oil with castor oil if you're worried it will be too rich for your skin.

, Scoop out a tablespoon and place it on your arm. Start at your elbows and work the oil all over your arms. Use your opposite hand to rub it in until the coconut oil has melted over your skin. Smooth it on evenly and keep rubbing until it's all gone. Repeat with the other arm.

, Scoop out two tablespoons and rub them into your thigh, knee area, lower leg, and foot. Keep rubbing until the scoops have melted into your skin. Repeat with the other leg.

, Rub it over your back, buttocks, stomach, breasts, and anywhere else you'd like to moisturize. You can use coconut oil just as you would any other lotion.

, It might take about 15 minutes for the oil to completely get absorbed into your skin. In the meantime, hang out in your bathroom or put on a bathrobe so you don't get oil on your nice clothes or furniture.

, Place about an ounce (shot glass) full of coconut oil in the warm almost hot bath and swish it around the tub to dissolve it. Then soak for a while. Do this for a few weeks about once or twice a week, until you notice your skin is no longer so dry.

, Rub a pea-sized amount of coconut oil between your hands and smooth it over your hair to get rid of pesky flyaways and frizz.

, Rub a liberal amount of coconut oil over your scar. Repeat twice daily. Over time you'll see the scar reduce in size and blend in with your skin.

Engage in weight training.,
Stay hydrated.,
Avoid smoking.,
Eat more protein.",How to Tighten Skin2," One of the best forms of exercise to treat tight skin is weight training. Doing deadlifts and bench presses tightens skin in the stomach, arms, back, and thighs. Starting at about one or two pounds, lift regularly at the gym or at home. Aim for five sets of six to eight reps and make sure to engage in some light lifting and cardio to warm up.Make sure to ease into a routine.

In addition to worsening loose skin, they can damage skin cells.

, Sulfate soaps are found in harsh laundry detergents, shampoos, body washes, and dish detergents. Avoid purchasing soaps that contain sulfate, as these are very hard on skin and can contribute to loosening and wrinkling., If you swim, chlorine can be very harmful. It can contribute to skin wrinkling, drying out, and loosening. After swimming, wash yourself with soap and shampoos specifically designed to remove chlorine from skin and hair. You can buy such products online or at a local drugstore., Sometimes, natural treatments are not enough to tighten skin.

It’s usually balanced and is not too sensitive or easily irritated.You won’t see too many imperfections with normal skin, so you’re usually less prone to acne breakouts.;
, Visible pores typically accompany oily or combination skin, and tight pores go with dry skin. Normal skin usually means your pores are barely visible and don’t make your skin feel tight., Normal skin usually means a radiant complexion. While your skin isn’t shiny with oil, it isn’t dull and dehydrated either. Instead, it has a healthy glow without requiring any makeup., With normal skin, you should cleanse your face once in the morning and once in the evening. Be sure to choose a cleanser free of damaging sulfates.A gel or foaming cleanser is often a good option for normal skin.
Avoid bar soaps, which can strip even normal skin of moisture.

, Normal skin can benefit from the hydrating properties of a gentle, non-irritating toner. Toners can help close up pores and moisturize your skin, giving you a healthy glow and a refreshing feel.Look for a toner with antioxidants, such vitamin C, vitamin E, or green tea.
Stay away from toners that contain alcohol. They can dry out normal skin.
Most toners are liquids. Apply it to a cotton pad or ball and smooth it over your face without rinsing it off.
If your toner comes in a spray bottle, mist it over the face and wait for it to be absorbed before moving on with your skincare routine.

, Antioxidants can help protect the skin from environmental stressors, calm the skin, and give it a more youthful appearance. Use a lightweight serum to deliver powerful antioxidants without bogging it down.Some antioxidants to look for in your serum are vitamin C, vitamin E, resveratrol, retinol, and/or green tea.

Check the instructions for your serum regarding how often to use it. In many cases, once a day is sufficient, and you should usually use the serum at night.

, You may not want to slather on sunscreen every day, but you should wear sun protection daily. Kill two birds with one stone by applying a moisturizer with built-in SPF to keep your skin looking its best.Opt for a moisturizer with a SPF 30 for daily use.

, Ideally, the night cream will be the moisturizing and firming kind and include beneficial stem cells. The latter can stimulate the production of collagen and thus increase skin elasticity., Luckily, normal skin typically doesn’t have many problems. Maintaining a skincare routine will keep your skin healthy and glowing, and can also prevent visible skin changes that occur due to age, such as spots or wrinkles. Most importantly, be sure to always cleanse your face at the end of the day if you wear makeup. Even normal skin can suffer from clogged pores if you go to bed with heavy foundation, powder, and concealer on it. If you’re too tired to wash, use makeup removing cloths to quickly cleanse your skin.

, If you sometimes get a dry patch or some oiliness here and there, you may not have 100% normal skin. If that’s the case, use beauty products that are aimed for normal-dry or normal-oily to keep it balanced.You should also stay away from abrasive or irritating products, including those with alcohol - they’ll do your skin no good, especially if your skin is between two types.

, Because normal skin doesn’t usually experience many problems, it’s important to take note of any changes that do occur. If you notice discolorations, bumps, or textural changes in your skin, visit a doctor to ensure that they’re not serious., Oily skin typically a shine to it due to the overproduction of oil, which may get worse with stress or humidity. If that’s the case, you likely have oily skin as shine is not associated with other skin types.An easy way to tell if you have oily skin is to wash your face. If your skin gets shiny and greasy within an hour of cleansing, you likely have oily skin.
The increase in hormones during puberty often leads to oily skin, so teenagers usually have this skin type.

, If you have oily skin, your skin will feel greasy when you touch it. You may even have an oily residue on your fingers afterward.Having to use blotting papers or sheets continually throughout the day can be an indication of oily skin.

, If you have oily skin, you’re probably used to acne, even if you’re an adult. Your hair follicles become clogged with oil and attract bacteria. That leads to inflammation, which can manifest itself as pimples, whiteheads, and blackheads.Oily skin can experience wide spread breakouts all over the face or just suffer acne in the oiliest areas of the face, such as the forehead, nose, and chin.

, Because excess oil can clog the pores, they typically have an enlarged appearance when you have oily skin. If you notice these, it’s very likely that you have oily skin.You will usually notice enlarged pores on the nose and cheeks, but you can have them anywhere that there’s excess oil on your skin.

, The key to caring for oily skin is to clean it frequently to remove excess oil, dirt, and bacteria. Ideally, cleanse your face at least twice a day: once in the morning, once at night. You should also wash your face after working out. Choose a gentle, water-soluble foam or gel cleanser so you don’t strip your skin completely of oil. Be sure to choose an oil-free formula as well.
Avoid cleansers with fragrances because they may irritate your skin and cause breakouts.

, A gentle, effective toner can remove any lingering dirt and oil after you wash your face and help diminish the appearance of enlarged pores. They can also lightly moisturize the skin so you don’t need a separate moisturizer.Choose an alcohol-free toner that contains antioxidants such as green tea or retinol for oily skin.
Most toners are liquids. Apply it to a cotton pad or ball and smooth it over your face without rinsing it off.
If your toner comes in a spray bottle, mist it over the face and wait for it to be absorbed before moving on with your skincare routine.

, A lightly hydrating product is all oily skin needs. If it has salicylic acid, which can clean your pores from the inside out, all the better! Apply your moisturizer after cleansing and toning your skin.Select an oil-free moisturizer to ensure that it won’t clog your pores.
A gel-based or serum moisturizer is often a good option for oily skin

, While your pores are here to stay, you can help minimize their appearance with regular exfoliation. Instead of a harsh scrub, though, use a gentle exfoliator with salicylic acid, which can exfoliation the surface of the skin as well as the lining of the pores.Unlike scrubs, which are manual exfoliants, salicylic acid is a chemical exfoliant so you usually leave it on the skin to slough off the dead cells.
For oily skin, a liquid salicylic acid product is usually the best method of exfoliation.

, A good, oil-control foundation primer will keep your makeup looking great and won’t dry out your skin. Powder makeup is absorbent and can soak up any excess oil that remains after you clean your face.Make sure you’re using oil-free makeup -- it won’t clog your pores, and any acne medication you use will still be effective.It’s also important to look for makeup products that are non-comedogenic, which means that they do not clog your pores.
It’s also a good idea to carry blotting papers with you when you’re wearing makeup. They can soak up excess oil from your skin so you don’t have to add another layer of powder, which may make you look cakey.

, If this is within your means, try to get extraction facials monthly. A licensed professional will massage your skin to remove the gunk that’s clogging up your pores to leave your skin feeling fresh and clean for a few weeks., Heat up some water and put your face over it, taking care not to burn yourself. Do this before you cleanse your skin or apply any product so the steam can soften your skin and prep it for any subsequent treatment.Drape a towel over your head when you’re steaming your face. That will trap the steam so it’s more concentrated on your skin.
You can also use a steam room or sauna for steaming your face.
Alternatively, you can also use low-level LED light therapy to correct damage made to the surface of your skin, including your pores. It may take a while for you to see results.Never pick at your pores; it can lead to scars and possible cause an infection.

, You don’t want to add more oil to your skin than is necessary, so incorporate oil-free sunscreens, cleansers, lotions, makeup, and hair products in your routine.That can help prevent your clogged pores and breakouts., When oil and dead skin cells combine, they form little dark spots on your skin. A clay mask with kaolin, a drying mineral, can help clean out your pores and absorb oil if used regularly.In most cases, using a clay mask once a week is sufficient to keep oily skin in check.

, To fight breakouts, look for a serum containing benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid. These ingredients will penetrate your pores and target your pimples to help get rid of them quickly.Don’t pop or pick at your pimples. You can cause additional inflammation, infection, and even scarring.

, Dry skin often results in flaky or peeling bits of skin. If you notice these on your face or in some parts of your body, like elbows or knees, you likely have dry skin.The skin will usually have a rough texture that you can feel when you touch it.

, With dry skin, you’ll typically notice small pores that make your skin feel tight or rough. Your skin can often crack if it’s dry, which can in turn lead to irritation and itchiness.Dry skin is more likely to feel tight and itchy in cold, dry weather.

, Dull and red skin are usually indicators of dryness. These may get worse depending on the weather, how long you shower, or the ingredients your skin products include.Cold winter weather usually makes dry skin more dull and red.

, Hot water can be relaxing, but it also strips your skin of its natural oils, leaving dry skin even more dehydrated and irritated. Lukewarm water will be comfortable for bathing, but still leave your skin with its natural moisture.It’s also a good idea to bathe less frequently if you have dry skin.
Don’t scrub your skin when you’re bathing because it may irritate your skin and make the dryness worse.

, For dry skin, you want a cleanser that will replenish moisture as it cleans. Look for a rich, moisturizing body or face wash with natural oils that won’t strip your skin.Look for creamy cleansers that contain beneficial natural oils, such as argan, avocado, jojoba, almond, coconut, or olive oil.
Stay away from irritating ingredients, such as sulfates or alcohol.
Bar soaps are usually too drying for both dry skin on your face and body., Immediately after washing your skin, apply a thick, rich moisturizer while your skin is still damp. Your skin will be better able absorb and lock in the moisturizing ingredients when it’s still wet.You can gently pat your face dry with a clean towel after cleansing your face isn’t dripping when you apply the moisturizer. However, don’t dry it completely.
Choose a moisturizer that has natural plant oils, such as argan, avocado, or olive, as well as antioxidants, such as vitamin C or green tea, to help soothe your skin.
Look for a moisturizer with at least an SPF30 or a separate SPF30 sunscreen to apply after your moisturizer to ensure that your skin is protected from sun damage.

, If your skin is Sahara-dry, it’s time to break out the heavy moisturizing creams after patting dry. Creams with heavy emollients mean you won’t have to re-apply moisturizing lotions every few hours.Apply your body cream liberally twice a day.
Some emollient ingredients to look for in your body cream include plant oils, shea butter, mineral oil, petrolatum, cocoa butter, and fatty acids.

, If you wear makeup, opt for the kind that will hydrate your skin -- the last thing you want is makeup that’s going to cake or flake. During the day, you might choose to just wear tinted moisturizer. Foundation should be liquid or cream.Avoid powder products, which will sit on your dry patches and bring attention to them.
Foundations that are marketed as “hydrating” or “moisturizing” are best for dry skin.
Look for makeup that has a dewy or radiant finish. That can help perk up dull, dry skin.
It’s best to apply foundation to dry skin with a sponge or clean fingers. Using a brush can actually accentuate flaky areas and make the makeup cling to them.

, Very dry air can damage your skin, so if your skin is particularly dry, a humidifier can help. It add moisture to the room you’re in so you can run the humidifier during the day and at night as you sleep to replenish any lost moisture.A humidifier is especially helpful in cold weather when you have the heating turned on in your home and the air is usually drier.

, Perfume, antiperspirant, and harsh soaps can all dry out your skin. Try to limit your use of perfume, replace harsh soaps with mild cleansers, and opt for deodorants without antiperspirant., You may think you have naturally dry skin, but if you get regular breakouts, it’s unlikely that you do. The products you’re using may be the cause of instead. Stop using them for a couple of weeks to see if there are any improvements.For example, acne spot treatments are often very drying and may create flaky, dehydrated patches.

, Certain health problems, such as kidney disease or diabetes, can cause dry skin. For skin that won’t respond to moisturizing treatments, it’s best to see a doctor and rule out any medical causes, particularly if you have other risk factors for these conditions.Even if there is no medical cause for your dry skin, your doctor may be able to recommend an effective moisturizer, particularly if you have thinner skin.

, Your T-zone is the area of your forehead extending down your nose to your chin. If you have combination skin, this area will typically be oily.Pay attention to any breakouts in these areas. They indicate that you have clogged pores in the T-zone, which is often a sign of combination skin.
You may have enlarged pores and acne in your T-zone as well.

, Combination skin means you have a blend of oily, dry, and normal skin types. While your forehead and nose may be oily, your cheeks may feel dry or cause you no issues.In addition to your cheeks, the sides of your face may show signs of dry or normal skin.

, Not all people with combination skin have dandruff, but it’s a common condition if you have a mix of dry and oily skin. Examine your scalp to see if you notice any white flakes., For combination skin, a gentle, water-soluble cleanser is your best bet. Wash your face twice a day to remove excess oil and soothe any dry, flaky patches.A lotion or gel-based cleanser usually works best for combination skin.
If you need an extra bit of cleansing in your T-zone, you can use a soft-bristled cleansing brush in those areas.

, Don’t follow up your cleansing with a moisturizer meant for normal skin. Instead, use a moisturizing lotion with ingredients that are mattifying, such as silica, and hydrating, such glycerin. These will target both your oily and dry zones.You may prefer to use two different moisturizers -- use an lightweight, oil-free formula for the T-zone and a richer lotion for the dry spots.

, Your T-zone will benefit from a clay mask with oil-absorbing ingredients, and your dry areas will soak up the ingredients in a moisturizing mask. If you get both dry patches and breakouts, the masks can help keep your skin in line.In most cases, using each type of mask once a week is enough to maintain healthy skin.

, Because the aim with combination skin is to achieve a balance between oiliness and dryness, jojoba oil is ideal. It is an oil so it hydrated the skin, but it is very similar to the natural oil in the skin so it isn’t as likely to clog the pores.Opt for 100% pure jojoba oil for the best results.
You can use jojoba oil on both your face and body. Massage it into the skin until it is fully absorbed.

, If you have larger pores than you’d like, use products with exfoliating ingredients to keep your pores unclogged. Keep in mind, however, that no product has actually been proven to shrink pores. They just minimize their appearance temporarily., If you are experiencing breakouts, don’t apply your acne treatment product with salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide all over your face or it may irritate the dry patches. Dab the product only on affected areas so you treat the acne without damaging the rest of your complexion., Some people with combination skin have patches of dry, flaky skin on their head. Target dandruff by using a shampoo designed specifically for the condition. Use the product according to packaging instructions .Some dandruff shampoos require daily use, while others recommend bi-weekly treatment.

, Apply light to medium pressure while brushing your fingers across your cheek. If your skin turns red, then it’s likely sensitive. You may also notice your skin turn red when you apply cleansers, moisturizers, serums, and other skincare products.If you notice that you’re flushing and blushing without reason, you may have rosacea, which is usually sensitive as well. Bumps and pimples may also be a telltale sign of rosacea so consult your doctor if you’re concerned., Your skin is sensitive if most products you apply cause a burning or stinging sensation. You may be using products that are too harsh, and are irritating your skin. For example, you may be washing with a cleanser that’s too drying or using too many anti-aging products.

, As is the case with dry skin, flaky patches on your skin are often a telltale sign of sensitive skin. If your skin has a rough, uneven texture, it can also be a sign of sensitivity., You don’t want to unnecessarily aggravate your skin, so test out any new products on a small, inconspicuous area before slathering them on. Wait 24 hours to determine whether your skin will react negatively to the product. The inside of your wrist or elbow, as well as behind your ear, are good place to test products for a possible reaction.

, Your cleanser should not contain ammonium laureth sulfate or sodium lauryl sulfate. These ingredients break down the lipids in your skin and allow irritants to get in. Opt for a gentle, water-soluble cleanser that is fragrance-free.If your skin still reacts negatively to washing, use your cleanser only once a day.
Use your fingers - not a scrubbing mitt - to slowly apply the cleanser to your skin.
Use warm, rather than very cold or hot, water to wash your face. Extreme temperatures can irritate your skin.

, When moisture escapes your skin, it leaves it unprotected and ripe for cracks and flakiness. A nutrient-rich serum can replenish your skin’s damaged protective barrier so it’s less likely to be irritated. Choose a serum that was specifically designed for sensitive skin and has vitamin C to maximize the benefits.

, Sensitive skin is especially at risk for inflammation due to UV rays. If you experience redness, sunscreen can prevent it from getting any worse.Sensitive skin usually responds best to physical sunscreen rather than chemical sunscreens. That means you should avoid ingredients, such as avobenzone, octinoxate, and oxybenzone, in favor of natural minerals, such as zinc oxide and titanium dioxide.Be sure to use a sunscreen with SPF30 or higher.

, It’s important to learn what ingredients to avoid when you have sensitive skin. Check all of your products’ labels to make sure that you are using a potentially irritating products.Some ingredients for sensitive skin to avoid include parabens, phthalates, propylene glycol, and sodium lauryl sulfate.
Keep in mind that ""paraben"" doesn't always appear by itself. It usually is part of a longer ingredient, such as methylparaben, propylparaben, and butylparaben.

, Many skincare products use menthol, alcohol, or fragrances in their ingredients to give them a pleasant scent. However, these can easily irritate sensitive skin and cause itchy, red flare-ups so you avoid them.It’s also a good idea to avoid harsh skin exfoliators, such as aluminum oxide crystals or pumice.

, Sensitive skin can have many triggers, from allergic skin reactions to environmental factors. Try to avoid these as much as possible and seek treatment if you have a condition that leads to skin sensitivity.For example, if you have atopic dermatitis or eczema, talk to your doctor about a corticosteroid cream or ointment prescription to treat the condition.
If you notice that your skin gets extra sensitive if you spend the afternoon in the sun, try to limit your sun exposure. Stay in the shade, wear protective clothing, and slather on natural sunscreen made specifically for sensitive skin.

Reduce wrinkle-causing activities.",How to Adopt a Natural Beauty Routine for Sensitive Skin," Not all skin types are sensitive. Many are oily, others are dry, and still others are considered “normal.” You can determine your level of skin sensitivity by looking for specific symptoms: itching, tightness after using soap, burning, or stinging.Darker-colored skin is more prone to sensitivity.
You can also tell you have sensitive skin by the way you react to products, such as breaking out in a rash after using a cleanser or cream.;
, If you have determined that you have sensitive skin, one of the first things you need to look for is products labeled as fragrance-free. Fragrances cause allergic reactions, which weakens skin.Look for products labeled as allergy tested or specifically designed for sensitive skin.
Fragrance-free products may also be more natural because they don’t contain synthetic scents.
Be wary of products labeled “hypoallergenic.” This is a process that is not regulated by the FDA, so you can't be certain what each company means by this, nor do you know if it is truly good for sensitive skin or not., With sensitive skin, you need to be particularly cautious of possible irritants and always do a skin test before using any new product, even if it's natural or not store-bought. In addition, if you have a skin condition like rosacea, which can be irritated by specific products, you must be careful what you purchase. Some ingredients are prone to cause skin irritation more than others. Ingredients that irritate rosacea include alcohol, witch hazel, eucalyptus oil, peppermint oil, and menthol.Although most of these ingredients are natural, it is wise to be cautious about them — natural doesn't mean you can't have a reaction, or that you can't be allergic, or that the product won't be too harsh for your skin.

Always test products on your neck or the inside of your elbow to make sure you won't have a reaction. Wait 48 to 72 hours and look for swelling, itching, burning, or redness.Write down the ingredients of products that cause a reaction to help to narrow down which ingredients you are sensitive to.

, You can still wear makeup with sensitive skin, but you must be careful which products you choose. For example, using mineral powder is a safe bet for sensitive skin because it usually lacks dyes and preservatives.Avoid waterproof mascara because it can be difficult to remove it at night, often requiring products with harsh ingredients.
Use pencil eyeliner because liquid eyeliner is usually made with latex, a known allergen.
Throw out old cosmetics because expired ones can grow bacteria: three months for mascara and liquid eyeliner; six months for liquid makeup and cream eye shadows; two years for powder makeup and eyeshadows, pencil eyeliners, and all lipstick and lip liner., To adopt a truly natural beauty routine, you might try a pure oil cleansing regimen on your face to clear away acne and excess oil. Using natural oils you might find in your kitchen can help balance the skin’s natural oils. Mix up a blend of castor oil and olive oil to dissolve your skin’s natural oils that have hardened and blocked pores.Mix up a solution of ¼ castor oil and ¾ olive oil (or ½ castor oil and ⅔ olive oil for oily skin).
Pour out a quarter size amount of oil and massage it very gently onto a dry face. Only massage for about a minute.
Remove the oil by running warm water over your face until you feel that the oil has completely dissolved. (Or hold a warm washcloth over your face for a minute, gently wiping away excess oil afterward.)
You probably won’t need moisturizer after this unless your skin is very dry.

, There are many ways to use fruit to refresh your skin, making it the perfect addition to a natural beauty regimen. The vitamins in fruit can supply your skin with nutrients. Many fruit juices can tone your skin and give you a healthy glow. Add them to lotions, face masks, or scrubs.For example, you can use cranberries to prevent wrinkles and reduce redness. You can also use oranges to reduce fine lines in your face.Try lemon and tomato juices to reduce large pores.
Kiwi's natural acids provide a toner that treats acne and fights signs of aging., Others foods can be good for your skin too. Yogurt, honey, and oats are all known for their benefits to the skin. For instance, Greek yogurt can be used to reduce pimples. Apple cider vinegar can be applied to the skin as a toner to kill bacteria and reduce large pores.Raw honey is useful for moisturizing the skin.
Sake, a Japanese wine, may lighten up age spots if you get a cotton ball wet and rub it on the spots.
Coconut oil can be applied to the eyes and face to remove makeup. Gently massage a small amount of coconut oil on the eyelid and eyelashes, and then use a cotton pad to wipe the oil and makeup away.

, The caffeine in coffee grounds can reduce the appearance of cellulite. You can make your own coffee scrub by grinding up fresh coffee beans—or purchasing some pre-ground—and mixing them with oil. Make sure they are caffeinated because it’s the caffeine that does all the work— reduces swelling and can increase blood circulation to the skin’s surface.Apply a handful of the coffee ground/oil mixture in circular motions onto problem areas. Let it sit a few moments before rinsing it away.

, You can easily make your own exfoliating scrubs by using ingredients you purchase at the supermarket. For example, sugar scrubs are a popular do-it-yourself option. Fruit like cranberries and grapes can be chopped up and combined with lemon juice to make a hydrating scrub. Oats are also a great way to naturally exfoliate.


You can make your own cranberry treatment by combining 1 cup of cranberries with 1 cup of seedless grapes, 2 teaspoons of lemon juice, and one packet of unflavored gelatin in the blender and then refrigerate it. Leave it on your face for 15 minutes to exfoliate and hydrate your skin.A useful do-it-yourself sugar scrub calls for ½ cup of sugar, ½ cup of oil (coconut or olive oils are best), and an option of adding a few drops of whatever essential oil you like best.You can make an oat scrub by combining 1 tablespoon of oats with about 3 tablespoons of warm water. Wait five minutes for the oats to soften, then massage the paste gently onto a clean face for one to two minutes. Rinse off with warm water followed by cold water to close your pores., When it comes time to washing your face, no matter what cleanser you use, only use warm water. Hot water might burn and dry out sensitive skin, and cold water can close pores, preventing them from opening and being cleansed of impurities.Choose a cleansing solution that is made for sensitive skin but won’t be hard to wash off.
To wash away the cleanser, splash your face with water rather than scrubbing it off with a cloth.Blot your skin dry with a soft towel, but don’t rub your face with the towel.

, After your face is dry, apply any medication you might need for sensitive skin, such as if you are having a rosacea or dermatitis breakout. If your medicine causes stinging, this means your face was still too moist.You might want to wait about 30 minutes after washing your face to apply medication.
Apply moisturizer five to 10 minutes after applying medicine.

, After applying any sensitive skin medication, apply sensitive skin moisturizer. Make sure the moisturizer that you purchase is gentle by testing it out on another body part like the neck or the back of a forearm.>


To be truly natural, you can simply use a tiny dab of coconut oil or shea butter, rubbing it gently into your skin.

, After finishing washing and moisturizing your face, it is wise to apply sunscreen beneath your makeup. Use a natural sunscreen with simple ingredients to minimize your exposure to allergic reactions to sunscreen lotions.Look for active ingredients like zinc oxide and titanium dioxide. These are less likely to cause a reaction.
Active ingredients like oxybenzone, octocrylene, and octinoxate are more likely to cause reactions. They are also less natural and can cause other damage.
You can make your own sunscreen with olive oil, beeswax, coconut oil, shea butter, and non-nano zinc oxide.Remember that you can still have an allergic reaction to these ingredients, so make sure you test the mixture on a small patch of skin before using it on larger areas of your body., Watch for blemishes on your skin so you can treat them, but don’t squeeze them because this will increase skin irritation. Also check your skin for damage from the sun and for new growths. Finally, if you notice odd changes to your skin while on medication, ask your doctor about drug interactions with skin.


If you have a sore that does not heal or see changes to an old growth (like a mole or beauty mark), tell you doctor. They may recommend that you get your skin checked by a dermatologist every few years.Medications like blood thinners and aspirin can make you bruise easily.Some antibiotics and vitamins can increase your susceptibility to sunburns.

, More intake of water actually flushes the body of toxins, including the skin. The theory is that more water in your system can make your skin glow, but this is more of an observation made by individuals than a fact of science. Naturally cleansing your skin, then, means drinking at least eight 8-oz glasses (2 liters) of water a day.If this is challenge for you, try getting a water bottle that you can fill up and carry with you throughout the day.

, If you want to reduce wrinkles in your skin, you don’t have to apply a bunch of chemical-laden creams and lotions. These treatments can cause your sensitive skin to react, and are certainly not natural. Instead, focus on lifestyle changes that prevent wrinkles in the first place.


Eat foods containing antioxidants, which combat the free radicals that cause your skin to age. Foods like blueberries, spinach, Brazil nuts, hazelnuts, bell peppers, papaya, broccoli, carrots, and green tea all contain powerful antioxidants that can help your skin on a cellular level.Manage stress so that you aren’t carrying stress in your face, such as a furrowed brow or frequent frowning.

Quit smoking or make a commitment to never smoke. Also avoid second-hand smoke. Wrinkles from smoking can start to occur only 10 years after starting to smoke."

, If your skin starts to look a little dry and dull, it may mean you’re not drinking enough water. Drink at least 8 8-ounce (240-milliliter) glasses of water daily to rid your skin of toxins.Drinking so much water may sound like a hassle, but it can leave your skin looking youthful, bright, and glowing.
Drinking plenty of water may also help reduce acne and keep your skin looking clear.

, Being in the sun is good - it boosts your vitamin D levels and keeps your bones in tip-top shape. However, the sun’s rays can be very harmful. Choose sunscreen with a minimum SPF30 for daily use and reapply every two hours.Wear sunscreen every day, even during the darker, colder winter months.Avoid the sun between 10am and 4pm, as this is when its rays are most harmful.
If you don't like wearing sunscreen, consider using a moisturizer or foundation that already has sunscreen in it.
If you swim or sweat a lot, you may need to reapply sunscreen more often.Avoid tanning beds.

Avoid going to sleep with the night’s makeup still on -- it will clog your pores and lead to breakouts.If you find that you’re often too tired to wash your face at the end of the day, keep makeup removing wipes in your bedside table so you can quickly remove most of the residue before you go to sleep.

, Consulting a doctor who's trained in identifying and treating skin problems is your best bet for pursuing anti-aging care. If you’re worried about wrinkles, easy bruising, or potentially concerning moles or birthmarks, check with a qualified professional rather than jump on the latest fad.Talk to your doctor about having any bothersome age spots or tags removed.

, Aging is natural, and there’s no clinically-proven way to look 15 years younger from one day to the next. Using sunscreen, applying moisturizer regularly, and living a healthy lifestyle will get you the farthest. Beware of health scams. You can spend thousands of dollars on face creams and treatments and see no results. If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.

, Vitamin C prompts the production of collagen, vitamin B3 helps with cell regeneration and may improve the elasticity of skin, and Vitamin E has anti-inflammatory properties., Retinol, in particular, is made from vitamin A and signals to your skin that it should produce more collagen and elastic fibers. It can also reduce the signs of early skin aging, including loss of elasticity and wrinkles.Retinaldehyde and tretinoin are derivatives of Vitamin A and can also promote skin healing.

Stop using tobacco products.,
Stay away from massage and drainage.,
Let the area around the hickey rest.",How to Remove a Hickey2," Eat more foods that contain vitamins C and K or talk to your doctor about taking supplements.


Examples of foods high in vitamin K are kale, spinach, broccoli, liver, and eggs.Good sources of vitamin C are strawberries, raspberries, blueberries, sweet potatoes, and red peppers.It's usually easier and better for you to up your intake of certain foods than switch to supplements; however, you can ask your doctor about supplements. You can also talk to your parents about taking vitamins. If you don't want to explain the reason, you can say something like, ""We learned about the importance of vitamins in my health class, and I think it might be good for me to take some.""

, If you smoke or use other tobacco products, stop using them while you have a hickey. Smoking decreases your blood supply and may delay healing of the hickey.Speak to your doctor if you want to quit smoking. There are medications and smoking cessation programs available that may make it easier for you to quit.
If you are underage, it's an especially bad idea to smoke. Your body is still developing and smoking can interfere with this process.

Figure out the proper way to soak.,
Try milk and honey.,
Use champagne or red wine.,
Use herbs.,
Take an oatmeal bath.,
Moisturize after your bath.",How to Soak for Beautiful Skin1," When soaking in a bath to moisturize your skin, remember to limit your exposure to water to 20 minutes. Any longer could dry out your skin. Keep water lukewarm. Hot water can cause skin to peel and flake.;
, Milk contains lactate, which has exfoliating properties, and honey has softening, moisturizing properties. Soaking in a milk and honey bath can help improve the quality of your skin.


Use full fat milk or powdered milk and pure honey. Full fat milk can help moisturize the skin as well as helping to exfoliate.Pour 1 to 2 cups of milk and half a cup of honey under warm, running water and wait for the tub to fill. Mix the milk and honey into the water until the mixture if uniformed throughout.Get in the bath and soak for as long as you feel comfortable. Once you get out, gently pat your skin dry., While extensive research is lacking, many celebrities and beauty enthusiasts claim they notice their skin becoming softer, lighter, and younger looking when they soak in red wine or champagne. This may be due to antioxidants in red wine and tartaric acid in champagne, both of which can potentially lighten skin.Pour a glass of wine or champagne in a running bath. Mix the alcohol into the water and climb into the tub. Soak for about 20 minutes.Many feel soaking in alcohol is a waste of money, but the good news is the effects will be the same if you use champagne that's gone flat or wine that's turned bad. If you have any old alcohol sitting around, you could use it for a bath rather than letting it go to waste., A variety of herbs and spices, some of which you probably have in your kitchen right now, can be used in a bath to revitalize skin. If you have any spices you don't frequently use, try throwing them into a bath.


Sage, rosemary, peppermint, chamomile, and green tea have a positive effect on the skin for some. The scents of these herbs can also be calming, if you're looking for a bath as a means to wind down.You can either sprinkle herbs into your tea are brew a herbal tea ahead of time. Take one to two cups of your tea and add it to your bathwater. Any excess herbs should be removed from the tea kettle and placed in a washcloth. Tie the top of the washcloth together and leave it in the bath while you soak., Oatmeal baths are a very popular method to treat dry skin. Oatmeal can sooth dry and itchy skin and also helps moisturize skin.


For an oatmeal bath, either use colloidal oatmeal or run a few cups of regular oatmeal through a food processor. This will mix better with the bathwater.You can also add baking powder, coconut milk, or olive oil for added softness.Mix the oatmeal and any other ingredients you're using into a warm bath. Stir until dissolved and then hop in. Soak for 20 minutes and, when you're done, gently pat your skin dry., Once you get out of a bath, use your regular moisturizer on your legs, arms, shoulders, and face. This will make the effects of the soak last longer and replenish any oils lost through the bathing process.

Use fresh razors.,
Go in the right direction.,
Shave at night.,
Shave in the shower.,
Clean your razor regularly.,
Splash your skin with cold water.,
Dip the blade in rubbing alcohol after the final rinse.",How to Prevent Razor Burn1," Razors that have been used many times become dull and grow bacteria - two problems that significantly worsen razor burn. Use new razors every two weeks or five uses, and clean your razor well after every use.;
, Shave with the grain of the hair, in short, deliberate strokes. Shaving against the grain increases the odds of ingrown hairs, irritation, and inflamed skin. Long strokes often cause one to press down too hard on the skin, increasing razor contact and making razor burn more likely.

, Shaving your hair in the morning typically precedes the application of some product - for example, deodorant after shaving your armpits. Additionally, throughout the day you are likely to sweat and come into contact with bacteria and toxins from the air. The combination of all these things with your freshly shaved face greatly increases the likelihood of razor burn. Prevent this by simply shaving at night before heading to bed, where you will be less likely to dirty the area.

, Even when you dampen your skin before shaving, your hair doesn’t have enough time to soften and become easier to shave. Take a hot shower and shave after a few minutes; the heat and moisture will soften your hairs and make them easier to remove. Don’t wait too long, though, as waiting ten minutes or longer will swell up your skin and leave you with a bit of stubble after you’ve cooled down and dried off.

, If you shave without rinsing your blade, you might be increasing your chances for razor burn. The buildup of hair and product in the blades of your razor forces you to push down with more pressure on subsequent swipes, making it more likely that you’ll irritate or cut the skin. Thoroughly rinse your razor after every pass you take on your skin to remove all hair and buildup between the blades.

, After every finished shave, splash your skin with cold water to close up the pores. This will constrict the skin and help to close any small cuts or ingrown hairs that are forming., Blades last much longer than most people think. The apparent dulling of the blade is due to the formation of microscopic ""teeth"" on the edge, made up of mineral crystals from the water. These drag against the skin, causing the blade to grab and producing cuts and much of the razor burn. The alcohol will displace the water and the minerals within it, and evaporate without leaving a residue. Store the razor with the blade edges upward.

",How to Detangle Hair Without Damaging It1," Take a small amount of any hair oil of your choice or a hair serum in your hand.Rub it in between your hands. Start applying to the hair from mid length to the tips.;
, Do not use any comb yet.

, Take the first partition of hair and use your fingers to start detangling the hair slowly. Use your thumb and first finger to work between your hair knots. Press the thumb between your hair and start working your way out through the length of your hair, parting the knots all the way gently with your other finger. Use the fingers of both the hands to help detangle the knots or catch the hair with one hand and work you knots with other hand.( which ever method makes you more comfortable)


Occasionally you can use your other fingers to pull heavy knotted hairs.
Work your way from the bottom of the hair up towards the root of the hair. This cause less pain to the scalp and less damage to the hair.

Select your detangling instrument.,
Separate your hair into four sections.,
Use detangling spray.,
Separate out one tangle at a time.,
Use a comb.,
Use a smaller-toothed comb next.,
Pin up the detangled section into a loose twist.,
Exercise care when combing or brushing.",How to Detangle Hair1," When dry detangling your hair you can use your fingers, a wide-tooth comb, or a paddle brush. It will depend on the kind of hair you have. For thin or tightly curled hair, a wide-toothed comb works best. A paddle brush works well on long loose curls. Using your fingers first can make it easier to find and work through smaller knots., Part your hair in the middle and go all the way down the back of your head. Then do a horizontal part around your head just above your ears. You can do this easily with hair clips or pins. Though this may seem like an unnecessary step, tackling each section separately will safeguard against over brushing and provide better consistency. If your hair is especially thick or tangled, it might help to separate your hair into more than four sections.








, These products, available at beauty supply and drug stores, might be all you need to get through the tangles. For some people, just using the spray is enough to get rid of all the knots. If you have more tangles, keep going.








Spray some evenly over your hair
Comb your hair, working your way in small increments from the bottom.

, Pull the knotted area away from the rest of your hair if possible. If you can see it in the mirror, it might help to take a quick look at it. Then you can see what you’re dealing with and how you might begin untangling. Start with a small amount of hair
Begin near the bottom and run your fingers through
Apply gentle pressure
When you find a knot, run your thumbnail gently over it and keep going.

, Once you have done as much as you can with your fingers, start with a wide-toothed comb. Again, start down near the end and work slowly up the length of the hair. 








If there are tangles you absolutely can’t get through, use either some hair smoother (available at drug stores) or a little coconut oil or avocado oil.
Use only a dot on the knot and try the comb again.

, If you’ve gotten out as many tangles as you can with the wider teeth, use smaller teeth this time. This will often lead to finding small knots in your hair. Work these the same way as the larger tangles. Sometimes these knot simply will not come out.








Don’t pull at it or rip it out with a comb -- this is bad for the hair.
Gather the small amount of hair in the knot and cut it just above that tangle with a very sharp pair of scissors.

, As you finish one section, loosely twist it and pin it up. Continue working through the rest of your hair. Move through it systematically, section by section. Pin up detangled sections until all of your hair is detangled. If your hair benefits from brushes, you can brush it at the end.







, Using combs and brushes can result in some breakage, as your hair is not very flexible when it is dry. You should avoid over combing to prevent split ends.

Exfoliate your skin.,
Add baby oil or olive oil to epsom salt mixtures.,
Moisturize.",How to Soak for Beautiful Skin2," Epsom salt is not actually salt but a naturally occurring mineral compound. It has a number of health benefits, including moisturizing and rejuvenating dry, cracked skin. You can take a bath using epsom salt if you want better skin.Add 2 cups of epsom salt to a warm bath and let the salt dissolve.

Use a face wash.,
Use shaving gel.,
Apply Aloe Vera.,
Use an oatmeal mask.,
Put on some sour cream.,
Try an antibiotic ointment.,
Check for allergens.",How to Prevent Razor Burn2," Even if you aren’t shaving your face, using a face wash containing salicylic acid will help to kill bacteria and reduce the likelihood of razor burn. Rub the area you are going to shave with a gentle face wash and rinse off before shaving.

, Never dry-shave with just water, and avoid using a shaving cream that can clog pores. Instead, apply a coat of shaving gel to the area you will shave, and rinse your razor after every swipe. The gel will help to protect your skin from the blades without clogging your pores., After you finish shaving, put a little Aloe Vera gel on the area. This will help to soothe irritated skin and prevent razor bumps. Allow it to set for 5-10 minutes before rinsing off with cold water and patting dry with a clean towel.

, Oatmeal has been used for decades as a remedy for skin irritants and works great for razor burn. If you know that you are prone to razor burn or are already experiencing the mild rash, blend oatmeal with a bit of milk and dab it onto your skin. Leave it for 5-10 minutes before rinsing off with warm water.

, Although this may sound odd or gross, the sour cream contains nutrients that are great for healing razor burn. Additionally, the cold cream feels good on the irritated skin. Swipe on a dollop of sour cream to the area you have finished shaving, and then rinse off after about 10 minutes.

, After you finish shaving, rub some antibiotic cream into your skin. This will kill the bacteria that clog pores and lead to the unsightly razor rash you are experiencing. Do this for several days or until your razor burn has reduced or disappeared completely., Look through all the products you apply to your skin to see what they’re made of. There might be something in the ingredients list that you are allergic to, and therefore are reacting to with a rash. Cut out all your skin products for a few days after shaving, and slowly incorporate them back in one at a time to find out which one is the culprit."

Take a small amount of hair oil or serum in your hand.
Start applying from mid length to the hair tips.
This smooths frizzy hair and protects the  entire hair and hair tips from drying and damage.
You can even untangle some small knots with your fingers before shampooing. This cause less damage to hair while washing and gives a smooth result.

Put oil on your fingers when hand detangling.,
Spritz your hair with oil.,
Consider wearing latex gloves.",How to Detangle Hair2," Like detangling with a comb, divide hair and clip, and then start with small pieces, working from the bottom. A little lubricating oil, such as avocado or coconut oil on your fingers will reduce the friction your fingers may experience running through your hair. There are additional benefits, like improved glossiness, depending on which oil you use.








If you are partial to using heating tools to achieve your style, consider olive oil. The fatty acids in olive oil coat and protect your hair from heat damage., Use argan oil or a suitable substitute to lightly spritz your hair. You can find these at the drugstore or beauty supply store.

Dry detangle as much as possible with your fingers.,
Shampoo your hair.,
Always use conditioner.,
Squeeze your hair dry with a towel.,
Work your fingers through each section of hair while wet.",How to Detangle Hair3," Many people have hair that cannot be fully detangled when it’s dry. But it’s important to try detangling as much as possible before you cover your hair in conditioner. This will make your job easier.







, Divide your hair into four sections as discussed earlier and work your fingers through each section. Going section by section, shampoo your hair. Gently massage your scalp as you go. As you rinse your hair, work your fingers through each section and continue to work out any remaining tangles.








, If you have dry or normal hair, use a leave-in conditioner on the ends of the hair and apply after shampooing. If you have oily hair, put conditioner only on the bottom 2/3 of your hair before using shampoo. Then use the shampoo to wash it off. You also might consider using a specific detangling conditioner, which you can massage into your hair following the shampoo and then rinse off., Be gentle when rubbing your hair with a towel -- the friction and fibers from your towel can make tangles even worse. Use patting and squeezing motions instead of rubbing. If you have really long hair, do it in increments. Pat and squeeze the bottom first, then a little further up and so on until you reach the roots. 







, Do it in the same manner as for dry hair -- start with one section of hair and work on the knots from the ends to the roots. Then use a wide-toothed comb, moving to a smaller-toothed comb if it’s necessary.

Put hair in braids before bed.,
Use a satin pillowcase.,
Keep your hair healthy.,
Put your hair in a ponytail or braid when exercising.",How to Detangle Hair4," Securing your hair in braids before you go to bed will reduce friction and tangling. Your hair won’t be able to move about so freely, further reducing tangles., Satin is a smooth fabric and your hair will not stick to or get caught in it like with cotton. The reduced friction of smooth fabric can be a powerful tangle prevention measure.

, Get regular trims and cut off split ends. Take off a small amount from the ends to remove split ends on your hair and prevent further damage. Fewer split ends will result in fewer tangles.

Make sure your braids are dry by pressing them with your fingertips.,
Undo your braids.,
Style your hair by running your fingers through it.",How to Crimp Your Hair Without a Crimper or Straightener," You can do this technique fresh out of the shower, or just use a spray bottle to wet your hair. Towel dry your hair using a patting motion so that your hair is damp, not wet. Apply any leave-in conditioners or oils that you normally use on wet hair.


If you want to avoid the mess of getting your entire head wet, you can use a spray bottle to dampen each section of hair as you go along.;
, It will be easiest to create the braids if your hair is smooth and tangle-free. Braiding freshly combed hair will also minimize frizz. Run a wide-tooth comb through your hair, creating a part wherever you desire.









Once your hair has dried, you cannot brush out your hair again. It's important to have it parted where you want it, because it will be difficult to change later!, The amount of sections you need to create will depend both on the thickness of your hair and the look you are going for. If you have very thin hair, you may only create two or three braids. If you have very thick hair, you might create up to ten. The smaller your sections, the tighter your crimps will be. Conversely, if you take big thick sections of hair you will create looser, less dramatic crimped waves.








Clip hair out of the way until you are ready to braid it. This will make the process much easier.

, Start from the root and begin braiding. If you are unfamiliar with the braiding technique, learn all about it here! If you want tight, defined crimps, make sure you are creating very tight braids. As you move down the hair, pause to pull and tighten the three strands sporadically. If you want looser, less defined crimps, hold the three strands of hair loosely as you braid them, worrying less about tightening up the braid as you go down.








Make sure that you braid as far as you can to the tip of the strands. Whatever hair is left unbraided will remain straight. If you have a full head of tight crimped hair and stick straight ends, you may look a little funny.

, This will ensure that your crimped hair will hold its shape nicely as it dries. If you’re using a hair spray, just mist it lightly over the braid from the roots to the tip. If you’d like to use a hair gel, rub it into the palm of your hands and then lightly stroke it down each braid.







, The braids take a lot longer to dry than normal hair, because the moisture becomes trapped in the crevices of the twisted hair. Because it will take hours, it is best to just create the braids before heading off to bed. You certainly don’t have to sleep, but your hair needs to stay in these braids until it’s completely dry!


If you’re short on time, you can speed up the process by running a blow dryer over your braids. Just remember to apply a heat protectant spray on your hair beforehand if you are going to be doing this.

, Make sure you feel all of your braids, especially the ones that may have been pressed into your pillow as you slept. When you’re certain that the outside of each braid is dry, gently thread your finger through the braid so you can ensure the inner part of your braid is dry as well.









If there are a few damp spots, you can wait a bit longer or use your hair dryer to remove the final bits of moisture.

, Once you are certain that there are no damp spots left, remove your hair tie and gently undo the braid. Once every single braid has been undone, gently shake out your hair. When you first remove your braids, they may look a bit “chunky” due to the sectioning of each braid. By shaking out your hair, you can help to blend the sections back together.








, Whatever you do, do not brush your hair after removing the braids. This will undo the zig zag crimps, and make your hair poof out. Instead, comb through your hair gently with your fingertips, playing around with your tresses until your hair has settled how you like it. Spray it with hairspray to ensure it lasts all day, and enjoy your beautifully crimped hair!








Play around with different hairstyles. Throwing a headband onto crimped hair can look super cute, and crimped hair can also create a beautiful, voluminous ponytail. Get creative!

Whether something went wrong at the salon or you just don't like the cut you requested, it's hard to acknowledge that the long hair you just had is now gone. However, there are things you can do to appreciate your new style and maybe even come to love it.Remember that your hair will grow back, slowly but surely, so if you really hate your new cut it's just a temporary problem.
Try to enjoy your new hair care routine; you won't have to spend as much time on upkeep if your hair is shorter.;
, If the hairdresser botched your cut, you might want to see someone else to make it look a little more stylish. Short haircuts can be amazingly chic, and there's no reason to go around feeling like your hair is a mess.


You might have to go a little shorter to achieve a cut that looks good, so bear this in mind. Tell the second stylist you want a prettier shape, but that you want to keep as much length as possible.

, Long hair can be beautiful, but so can short hair. Try to take this opportunity to see how versatile your style can be. Short hair makes the eyes look bigger and frames the face in a way that causes heads to turn. You might even end up liking it better than your previous longer look.

, It's fine to cover up for the first few days, while you're still getting used to being a short-haired person. However, if you aren't a hat person and suddenly you start wearing hats all the time, other people will think you have something to cover up. It's better to just get used to your hair and stop trying to hide it. You'll feel better and look more confident.

, Once you've gotten used to your new look, it's time to actually make it work for you. Make it part of your overall style and wear it with pride instead of embarrassment. Decide you're going to pretend that this is the cut you wanted all along.


If someone compliments your new haircut, don't say ""Ugh, it's way too short."" Instead, tell them, ""Thanks! I wanted to try something different.""

, Short hair is in, and there are plenty of examples of stylish celebrities sporting shorter lengths. Look online for pictures of celebrities with short hair to see how they style it. You'll see that short hair can look gorgeous slicked back, tousled, spiked, and in many other styles. Here are a few popular celebrities who rock short hair:Jennifer Lawrence
Rihanna
Beyoncé
Emma Watson
Jennifer Hudson
Demi Lovato

, Product looks very good in shorter hair. Gel, mousse, pomade and other products can help you achieve styles you'd never be able to get with longer hair. Using these products in longer hair would cause it to look weighed down. Because short hair weighs less, it can be spiked and tousled.


Try combing gel into your hair while it's still damp after a shower for a sleek, slicked-back look.
Rub some pomade between your palms and tease it into your hair for a cute tousled look.

, If your hair is still long enough to pull back into a ponytail, you can make a bun that gives the appearance that your hair is still quite long. Gather your hair at the top of your head and secure it tightly in a hairband, the follow these steps:


Divide the ponytail into two sections.
Twist one section down and pin the ends right next to the ponytail holder with bobby pins.
Twist the other section up and pin the ends right next to the ponytail holder with bobby pins.
Use hairspray to keep the style in place.

, To quickly feel like a long-haired person again, there's nothing like putting on a wig. Choose a wig that's the length you desire and wear it until your hair grows out if you want to. Wigs are easier to wear when your hair is short, so take advantage and have some fun with it.

, Using a hair dryer, straightening iron or curling iron every day will damage your hair, causing it to get brittle and break more easily. When this happens, it can take forever for your hair to grow back out. Keep your hair healthy by avoiding heating tools unless you want to achieve a certain style for a special occasion., If you're interested in getting extensions, be very careful what kind you choose. Extensions are hard on hair, and if put in improperly they can cause hair damage and hair loss. Some say that no extensions are good for hair, but if you definitely want to get them, make sure you have them put in by someone who knows what she's doing.


Glue-in weaves are known for damaging hair, since the glue bonds the weave to your existing hair.
Sew-in weaves can be less damaging, but can still wreak havoc if the weaves are heavy and pull out your hair.

, The way you take care of your hair every day can make a big difference when it comes to growing it out. You want to make sure your hair is as healthy as possible so it grows in long and strong. Here's what you can do:


Don't wash it every single day, since this dries out your hair. Limit your shampooing to two or three times a week.
Pat it dry gently with a towel instead of using a hair dryer.
Comb it with a wide-toothed comb instead of using a brush.
Don't dye or bleach your hair, since this causes damage.

, Eating plenty of protein and omega-3 fats will help nourish your hair. While eating healthy might not necessarily make it grow faster, it will help your hair grow in strong and healthy. Here's what to eat:


Salmon, tuna, and other fish that contain omega-3 fatty acids

Style your hair.",How to Crimp Your Hair Overnight1," Before you go to sleep, take a shower. Shampoo and condition your hair according to your typical routine.


Shower at least half an hour before you intend to go to sleep in order to give your hair time to air dry.;
, Towel dry your hair immediately after you shower. Then wait for your hair to air dry partially. Keep in mind that thicker or longer hair will need more time to dry than shorter, finer hair.Your hair should be damp to the touch, but not dripping wet. See how it feels after a half an hour or so.

, Start by following your normal part and parting your hair in two from your forehead back to your neck. Then, divide both sides horizontally into sections.


For thicker hair, divide each side up into three sections. For thinner hair, divide each side into two sections.

, Braid each section and tie off each braid with a small hair tie or elastic. Start each braid as close to the scalp as possible, and continue down as close to the tips as possible.To get loose waves, keep your braid loose. Don’t pull hard as you braid and allow your braid some slack as you go.
For a tighter crimp, pull your braid sections tight toward your scalp as you go.

, This style only works when your hair dries completely while in the braids. Sleep on your braids and allow them to dry completely before you take them out.


If your hair is not dry by the time you wake up, consider using a blow dryer on a cool setting to finish the job.

, Once the braids are dry, remove the elastic and unbraid your hair. Shake the braids out and comb through with your fingers.Avoid using brush or comb if possible, as it may cause your hair to frizz.
If you need to use a hair tool to work out knots, try a wide-toothed comb.

, If you like the way your crimps look, you are all done. Otherwise, consider adding texturing paste or a curl enhancing spray to your look to get more definition. You may want to apply an anti-frizz serum to tame any flyaway hairs that got loose from the braids overnight.


Use a small amount of hairspray to help hold your style and make it last all day, and try a dry shampoo to keep your scalp looking fresh and stop oil from weighing down your crimp.

The more sections you have, the smaller your curls will be., For this step, you can use any kind of elastic band or hair clip.

Note: Remember that you'll be sleeping with the clips in your hair. So try to clip them in locations on your head that will still allow you to sleep comfortably.

Slice an aloe vera leaf.,
Remove the gel.,
Apply the gel in the shower.,
Rinse out the gel.",How to Condition Your Hair With Aloe Vera1," You can buy aloe vera plants online or at a local greenhouse. To extract the gel, slice the plant straight down the middle of the leaf. Move the knife slowly to avoid slipping up and accidentally cutting yourself.Make sure to use a sharp knife, as it can be difficult to make a clean cut with a dull blade.;
, Use a tablespoon to extract two tablespoons of aloe vera gel. Aim for the clear gel inside the leaf. There will be some yellowish gel near either end of the leaf. Do not gather this gel as you should only use clear aloe vera gel on your hair. Place the gel in a small container you can set in the shower, like a Tupperware container.Depending on the size of your plant, you may be able to get enough aloe vera gel from one leaf. However, if your plant is smaller, you may have to collect gel from another leaf until you have two tablespoons.

, When you shower, you can apply the gel when you would normally apply your conditioner. Work it into your hair, moving from the roots to the tips.Use it exactly how you would use your normal conditioner. For example, if you normally let conditioner sit in for a few minutes in the shower, do so.

, After apply the gel to your hair, rinse it out. Make sure to get all the gel out of your, especially the sticky bits. If you have a hair type that responds to aloe vera gel, your hair should be noticeably softer."

Be realistic.,
Come at least five minutes early.,
Don't ask a hairdresser to ""squeeze"" you in when he or she is already booked solid.,
Avoid seeing your hairdresser as your therapist.,
Grow old gracefully, not by being stuck in time.,
Get medical attention where needed.,
Be respectful.,
Tip generously if you live where tipping is required.,
Don't skimp when it comes to coloring.,
Realize that your hairdresser sees many clients and won't have a photographic memory of your last cut.,
Don't skimp when it's your kids.,
Try to make a two-way conversation.",How to Connect Effectively with Your Hairdresser," Your hairdresser is a beautician, not a magician. Your hairdresser can give you Gisele Bündchen's haircut, but can't give you her face.;
, If you're running late, please call ahead. Show the hairdresser some basic respect. This is a business, not fun and games.

, To expect otherwise is to take time and effort away from other clients. You wouldn't like being treated that way and neither do they.

, Hairdresser school does not teach about counter transference, projection, negative reinforcement, or personality disorders. If you're looking for a therapist, all your hairdresser has is a tail comb and an opinion.

, Some women think that if they keep their hair all one length the way it was in high school, everyone will think they're still in high school. Guess what? You're not. As you get older, you need to soften the lines around your face. Layers are the magic remedy.

, Bodies and hair change as hormones change. If your hair is dry, listless, or brittle, or if it's not holding your color or style the way it used to, see a doctor. If your hair isn't over-processed, you could be pregnant (surprise!) or menopausal (yes, your hairdresser can tell).

, Remember that a trim is not ""just"" a trim. It requires a hairdresser's expertise, skill, knowledge, and time. Would you say to your dentist, ""It's just a tooth,"" or to your doctor, ""It's just a leg""?

, That single bill you stuff into the shampoo person's hands isn't doing her any favors. A dollar bill doesn't buy anything anymore. Tip her at least $3—more if your hair is long.

, If you want to buy a bottle of color and do your own hair to save a buck, you can live with the consequences.

, Some clients will say, ""Cut my hair just like you did last time."" That always baffles. The average time between appointments is six to eight weeks. The average hairdresser has hundreds of clients. How is your hairdresser supposed to remember exactly how he or she did your hair the last time? If you want a carbon copy of a cut and style you loved, take a picture and show your hairdresser.

, Why do you think a child's haircut should cost less than yours? Kids don't sit still. Kids kick. It's an intense experience!

, Hairdressers see women at their worst. Their hair is wet, they have foils on their hair, they have no makeup on. There's nothing for them to hide behind. So they tell hairdressers everything. The truth is, they really don't care what you do; they're only interested in your hair.

Gather your supplies.,
Turn off the curling iron.,
Make sure that your curling iron is not hot.,
Begin by wetting your cloth with either water or rubbing alcohol.,
Wipe down the iron.,
Scrub the barrel with a toothbrush.,
Clean off the cleaner.,
Dry the iron off.",How to Clean Hairspray off of a Curling Iron," You will need a cleaner, a cloth or paper towel, and, possibly, a small scrub brush. Instead of using an all-purpose cleaner, you can use rubbing alcohol to clean the iron. This has the benefit of evaporating and not leaving a strong smell.Any general purpose cleaner will also work, although a cleaner with a strong smell could linger and eventually the smell could be transferred to your hair when you use the curling iron again.
You can also make your own cleaning solution. Simply add one part baking soda to two parts water. This mixture can be used just like a commercial cleaner. The baking soda serves as a gentle abrasive that is good at cleaning off hairspray.
A small brush that is easy to find is an old toothbrush. However, make sure that the toothbrush is very clean, and that no toothpaste residue is still on it.;
, It can be very painful to get an accidental burn from a curling iron. Because of this, you should always make sure a curling iron is turned off before attempting to clean it.


Even if the curling iron isn't on or hot, make sure it's unplugged. This will reduce the risk of electrical shock.

, A turned off and unplugged curling iron can still be too hot to touch. If you have just used your curling iron, you will need to wait a while before attempting to clean it.


While some suggest cleaning a curling iron while it's still a little warm, it's best to clean a completely cold curling iron for safety.You may even want to clean it when you have not used the iron on that day. This will help to avoid the risk of getting burned.

, You do not want to submerge the curling iron in a lot of liquid. That is why applying the liquid to your cleaning cloth is a good idea. This will limit the amount of liquid coming into contact with the iron.


Rubbing alcohol or all-purpose cleaner will work better at breaking down the hair spray than just plain water. However, if you can get the hair spray off simply with water, try that first. This will eliminate the need to wipe the iron down with water at the end to wash off the residual cleaner.

, If that didn't take off all the hairspray, or if you have a lot of hairspray stuck on, begin scrubbing the iron with the paper towel. Start off with the spots that have the most hairspray on them and make sure to scrub in all directions. This may take a while depending on how much hairspray is on the iron.


Make sure to lift the clasp that closes on your hair when in use and clean under there as well! This is a spot that can get particularly gummed up with hairspray.
Clean the handle and the cord too. Hairspray can sometimes get stuck on the handle area of the curling iron. This should be cleaned off so you don't have to touch sticky hairspray every time you pick up your iron.
If the handle of the curling iron has vents, be careful not to get water or cleaner in them. These vents allow air to circulate into the electronics inside the curling iron. These electronics may be damaged if exposed to too much moisture., If the hairspray doesn't come off with a light wiping, you may need to do a bit of scrubbing. Cover your small brush in a bit of cleaner and rub it onto the iron. Look for areas where the hairspray is being particularly resistant to cleaning, and focus your scrubbing there.


The cleaner made of a combination of baking soda and water can be adjusted to make it thicker for this process. Put some baking soda in a bowl and add just enough water to make it into a paste. This paste will stick to the brush, and the iron, better than a thinner cleaner.

, Once you get all of the hair spray off of the curling iron, wash your hands and grab a clean paper towel or napkin. If you used the rubbing alcohol or all-purpose cleaner, wet the paper towel with water and wipe it down the iron to remove any residue it may have left.If you simply used water to clean your curling iron, you do not need to wipe it down again. However, wiping it down with a towel with clean water could get even more of the hair spray residue off the iron.

, Get a dry towel and begin drying off the iron, making sure that there is no water left. Then leave your clean iron alone for a few hours to make sure all the water is completely gone and the iron is dry.


You do not want to use a curling iron with any water left on it. This is a serious electrocution hazard and should be avoided.

When you have fine hair, daily washing can actually do damage to your hair. Aim to wash your hair every other day; it puts less stress on your hair and will cause less breakage., Volumizing shampoo coats each shaft of thin hair to make it appear more thick. It has a lightweight formula and won’t weigh your hair down. To find a quality shampoo, pick a more reputable, high-end brand or ask your hair stylist for recommendations.Avoid shampoos that are meant for dry hair types. These shampoos are best for people with thicker, frizzy hair, and will weigh down fine hair, making it look limp.

After getting out of the shower, don’t vigorously dry your hair. Instead, pat the moisture out of your hair with a towel. Avoid rubbing your hair with the towel, especially near the ends which are prone to breakage."

The conditioner you use regularly does condition your hair as thoroughly as a deep conditioner. A deep conditioner will make your hair appear softer, shiner, and healthier. It should only be used once a week. Focus on your ends when you condition and leave it on for no longer than thirty minutes.It should say on the bottle if it is a deep conditioner that is meant to be used less often.
Use steam or wear a heat cap to add moisture to your hair.;
, Many hair products bought at supermarkets can actually damage your hair more than help it. A product that contains more than two detergents can strip your hair, like sodium lauryl sulfate, sodium laureth sulfate, ammonium lauryl sulfate. Products with alcohol can damage your hair by drying it out. Instead, look for natural products with ingredients made from plants.John Masters Organics, Rahua, and Acure are a few brands that offer organic shampoos and conditioners.

, Heat from your straightener, curler, and blow dryer can damage your hair. It is good to avoid using heat on your hair when possible, but if not, buy a heat protectant product. A heat protectant product will replenish moisture and protect your hair against frying. A heat protectant can be bought at your salon, many supermarkets, and from online stores., Washing your hair everyday can be tempting, but it does your hair more harm than it does help. The detergents can strip the color of your hair and cause it to fade faster. It can also strip your hair of its natural oils. Try to wash every other day if your hair is naturally oily and wash a few times a week if your hair is dryer.Invest in a dry conditioner to prolong the time between shampoos. Apply the dry conditioner along your hairline.

, A bad brush can cause breakage and damage to your hair. A quality hairbrush can keep your hair healthy and make your color last longer. Look for a hair brush with a mixture of boar bristles and nylon fibers.A brush with boar bristles and nylon fibers will distribute the hair’s natural oils throughout your hair.

, Mix one part apple cider vinegar with three parts water to create a mixture. Use this mixture once a month after your shampooing and conditioning routine. This mixture will remove mineral buildup than can dull your hair, which will boost your shine and highlights.Apple cider vinegar is fairly inexpensive and can be bought from most grocery stores.

, A glossing treatment is similar to the topcoat you put on your nail polish. A treatment can maintain color and add shine in between salon appointments. The treatment will neutralize brassiness and remove mineral buildup. Get a treatment done only once a month at most.There are also home glossing treatments available, but it could interfere with the work your stylist has done.

, A product that protects your hair from UV rays acts as a sunscreen. UV rays can damage the outer layer of the rays by eroding the cuticles, which can dull your hair color. You can buy conditioning or spray products that have built-in UV ray protection.Bumble and Bumble Color Minded UV Protective Polish, Babo Botanicals Cucumber Aloe Vera UV Sport Conditioning Spray, and Garnier Fructis UV Ultra Strong Hairspray are a few UV protectant products., Hot showers feel great, but very hot water damages hair. The hot water opens the cuticles and washes away dye in your hair. It can also leave your hair feeling dry and brittle. Turn down the water to lukewarm or slightly cold.If you can’t stand cooler water, only turn the heat down when applying and rinsing out product from your hair.

, A root concealer can temporarily hide roots that have grown out between salon visits. The concealer will last from the time you apply it until your next wash. You should pick a color closest to your hair color, and spray it two to three inches away from your scalp. Wait until the product dries before brushing your hair., Use a product to add texture to your hair and change the direction of your part. Straight hair shows off roots more than waves and curls. Use a product that adds texture to your hair and use a comb to create waves. You should also change the direction of your part because the top area of your hair often takes on a darker tint., You can buy a tinted dry shampoo to cover up roots. A tinted dry shampoo is typically less messy than a root concealer. Look for a tinted shampoo in your hue, but if you can’t find one, even a translucent dry shampoo will lighten the appearance of darker roots. It will absorb the excess oils that make hair appear darker and add volume., A root touch-up kit is hair color made especially for covering roots and only roots. The dye is more translucent than regular dye, so it won’t contrast harshly if the shade is slightly different than your hair color. The process typically takes only ten minutes to complete. Only use a touch-up kit if you do not think it will interfere with your stylist’s work."

Wash and condition fine hair with a hair thickening shampoo and conditioner.,
Choose styling products that are specifically designed for fine hair.,
Combine styling products.,
Make sure the fine hair products you choose are lightweight.,
Use a clarifying shampoo to strip hair follicles of product build-up.,
Purchase a deep conditioning treatment to use once a week.,
Protect your fine hair from humidity.",How to Choose the Best Hair Products for Fine Hair," Look for products that claim to add thickness, volume or body to fine or thin hair.;
, There are many fine hair products on the market, including mousses, gels, root lifts, sprays and serums. Look for tag words such as ""volumizing,"" ""thickening,"" ""bodifying"" and ""texturizing.""

, Hair care product developers often offer styling product systems that work together to create a desired effect, such as thicker and fuller hair. For example, you may start by coating hair with a thickening serum, then spraying the roots with a root volumizing spray, then working a voluminous mousse into the hair shafts and ends before blow drying.

, Lightweight hair products are specially formulated for fine or thin hair, so as to keep from weighing it down.

, Product build up weighs fine hair down, making it harder to style and depleting it of its volume. It is a good idea to use a clarifying product at least once a week.

, This will keep split ends at bay, which is important because split ends contribute to thinning and breaking hair. Deep conditioning products with the protein keratin in them are ideal for naturally plumping up thin and weak strands.

, Humidity weighs hair down. Mist finely textured hair with an anti-humidity hairspray in order to keep the air's moisture away from the hair shafts.

Condition after every shampoo.,
Use only as much as you need.,
Focus on the tips of your hair.,
Rinse thoroughly when you’re finished.,
Shampoo less often to keep your hair from drying out.,
Consider getting silicone-free conditioner.,
Look into leave-in conditioner.",How to Condition Your Hair1," Shampoo is designed to cleanse the hair of dirt and oils. Washing away the natural oils your scalp produces is necessary for your hair to look clean, but it can dry out your hair. That’s where conditioner comes in. Each time you shampoo, follow up by using conditioner that’s right for your hair type.


If you have very dry or damaged hair, choose a moisturizing conditioner that will restore its shine.
If you have fine, light hair, choose a lighter conditioner that won’t make your hair look limp.;
, When it comes to conditioner, you can definitely have too much of a good thing. You should only use as much as you need for your hair type and length. If you use a handful of conditioner your hair will end up looking dull and even greasy. Use just enough to lightly coat your hair and make it easy to untangle the strands.


If you have short hair, you only need a dime-sized amount of conditioner.
If you have medium hair, use a quarter-sized amount.
For long hair, use a silver dollar-sized amount.

, Since your scalp produces its own natural oil, your roots don’t need to be conditioned as much as your tips. The tips dry out much more easily, leading to frayed and split ends. When you condition your hair, work the conditioner between your palms and finger-comb it in starting at least an inch from your scalp. Comb it down to the tips and gently rub it in. Then go back and massage your scalp and roots with the tiny bit of conditioner that remains on your hands.

, After rinsing there will still be a light coating of conditioner on your hair. You want enough to provide moisture and a protective layer against the elements, but not enough to weigh your hair down or make it look greasy. Finger-comb your hair as you rinse to make sure there are no areas with a lot of conditioner build up.

, You shouldn’t have to shampoo and condition your hair more than twice a week, and three times tops. When you shampoo, the natural oils your scalp produces get washed away, and no conditioner can really replace them when it comes to keep your hair healthy and shiny. Plus, when you wash your hair too often the glands in your scalp go into overdrive to produce more oil, and your hair ends up looking greasy much faster.


When you first stop shampooing every day, your hair will look greasy pretty quickly. Ride it out for as long as you can (hats are very helpful for this). The next time you shampoo and condition your hair, it will take longer for your hair to look dirty.

, If your hair tends to look dull even though the products you use claim they’ll make it look shiny and sleek, you may want to switch your products. Silicones are an ingredient in commercial conditioners that do indeed make hair look shiny – at first. After awhile, though, the silicones build up in your hair and cause it to lose its shine. Look for conditioner that’s labeled “silicone-free” and you won’t have to worry about this problem.


You may also want to get sulfate-free shampoo. Sulfates strip hair of its natural oils very effectively – too effectively. If your hair is on the dry side, using shampoo with sulfates will dry it out even more, and no conditioner will be able to make it look healthy again. Use a sulfate-free shampoo paired with a silicon-free conditioner.

, This is a great choice for those with hair that tends to get dry and frizzy. Rather than rinsing the conditioner out, you spray it on or comb it through your hair and leave it in as your hair dries. If your hair is very fine or tends to get greasy easily, this may not be the best choice for you.

Use mousse or styling spray.,
Use heat protective spray for styling.,
Use a cool or warm setting on your heat tools.,
Try dry shampoo for touch ups.,
Don’t brush wet hair.",How to Care for Fine Hair2," If you generally use styling product when doing your hair, pick a mousse or styling spray. Mousse and spray products are lightweight, while creams or serums will weigh down your hair, making it look limp. Try to pick a mousse or spray that is volumizing.Use an oil-free product, especially if your hair is oily as well as fine.
Don’t use too much product. Even lightweight formulas can weigh down hair when used excessively.

, Heat stylers like curling irons or straightening irons can cause damage to any hair type, but they are particularly harsh on fine hair. It’s best for your hair not to use irons at all, but if they are an important part of your beauty routine, use a heat protective spray before using heat tools. Heat protective sprays coat the strands of your hair so that they are not damaged by the heat of the iron.

, Always start with the lowest setting on your hair iron or dryer. Since heat is damaging to delicate, fine hair, always start off with the lowest heat setting when using a dryer or iron. Increase the heat gradually if the cooler setting does not have the desired effect.Letting you hair dry whenever is possible is best for dry hair.

, People with flat, fine hair often notice that their hair gets oily very quickly. Dry shampoo is a great remedy because it acts as a powder that absorbs excess grease and oil. To use, dust a small amount on the scalp. Then use your fingers to work it over the oily areas of your hair.Don’t use dry shampoo as a stand in for regular shampoo. Instead use it occasionally for touch ups.

, Try to only brush or comb your hair when it’s dry. Because your hair is more fragile when wet, brushing wet hair can be stressful to your hair. Therefore, try to brush your hair when it is dry and use a wide toothed comb or a bristle brush to be extra gentle.

Get haircuts regularly.,
Try a layered hairstyle.,
Sleep with your hair up.,
Buy satin pillowcases.",How to Care for Fine Hair3," Regular haircuts are especially important to those with fine hair because their hair is more prone to breakage and split ends. At minimum try to get a haircut every three months. Ideally, aim for a small trim every six to eight weeks weeks., If you have long hair, ask your hairdresser to give you a haircut with layers. Layering your hair makes it appear fuller and more voluminous. For women, short hairstyles like bobs are also very flattering for fine hair types because they make your hair less weighed down and flat. Ask your hairstylist what style would work best for you., If you have long hair, sleep with your hair in a bun or ponytail. All the tossing and turning that you do during the night can cause your hair to get tangled. Untangling your hair in the morning is not only a pain, but it can also damage fine and brittle strands. Before going to bed, brush your hair and put it up to save yourself the headache of untangling stubborn knots., Even if you sleep with your hair up, you may still wake up to find knots in your hair. One solution to this is buying satin pillowcases. Hair glides more easily against satin than it does against cotton, creating less friction and reducing the chance of knots."

, Once the oats are ground, mix them with 1 tablespoon (5.5 g) of honey. Stir well until the ingredients are fully combined.


Raw honey typically works best, but you can also use processed honey.

, When the oats and honey are fully blended, start adding in 1 to 2 tablespoons (18 to 36 g) of yogurt. Stir in just enough yogurt to create a thick paste.

Deep condition once every few weeks.,
Choose a deep conditioner.,
Comb a tablespoon or so through your hair.,
Put on a shower cap.,
Let it sit for at least an hour.,
Shampoo it out.",How to Condition Your Hair2," You don’t need to deep condition more often than this; in fact, deep conditioning too much can actually damage your hair and cause it to break more easily. Once every week and a half or two weeks should be sufficient. You know it’s time to deep condition when your hair feels a bit dry, or the ends seem ready to split.

, There are hundreds of store-bought deep conditioners to choose from, and salons offer deep conditioning treatments as well. However, if you don’t want to spend money on a deep conditioner, you can use household ingredients that are just as effective. Here are a few deep conditioners you probably have on hand:


Coconut oil (unrefined)
Olive oil
Mayonnaise
Almond oil

, Use a little less if your hair is short, or a little more if your hair is long. Apply it near the roots and comb it through your hair to the tips, making sure every strand gets covered. A wide-toothed comb is a great tool for the job, or you can just use your fingers.

, This will trap your body heat against your head, gently heating the deep conditioner and helping it become more effective. Plus, it will keep the conditioner from getting all over your clothes and furniture. If your hair is long, you can put it up in a clip, then cover that with a shower cap.


If you don’t have a shower cap, use plastic wrap or a plastic bag pinned around your hair.
Be sure to use something that’s nonporous, rather than porous material like a towel or t-shirt that will let the heat escape.

, An hour will be enough time for the deep conditioner to penetrate your hair and work its magic. If you have time to spare, you may keep it in your hair for several hours or even overnight.

, In some cases you may need to shampoo two or three times to rinse it all away. This is especially true with coconut oil and olive oil, which are both very rich oils that aren’t easy to wash out. Wash your hair until it no longer feels as though it’s covered in oil. When you dry your hair, it will silky and bouncy.

Try going no-poo.,
Cut back on frizz.,
Use a finishing oil.",How to Condition Your Hair3," These can be used more often than deep conditioners. They aren’t meant to penetrate your hair, but to provide a light mask that keeps moisture in and protects your hair. Comb about a tablespoon of the mask into your hair after wetting it at the beginning of your shower, then shampoo it out after about then minutes. You can buy a hair mask from the store or make your own using one of the following:


Honey
Egg whites
Milk or yogurt

, Boar bristle brushes are designed to pull the sebum produced by your scalp from the roots of your hair to the tips, so that the entire length of your hair will receive the benefits. They don’t cause breakage or damage like plastic brushes. Boar bristle brushes are difficult to get through very curly hair, but they work well for people with wavy or straight hair.

, People with very curly or kinky hair have found a solution to dryness and frizz: stop using shampoo altogether. Instead of shampooing, then conditioning, try using conditioner to wash your hair. Wet your hair at the beginning of your shower, massage conditioner into your scalp and hair from the roots to the tips, then rinse it away. This technique would weigh thin hair down, but it works for those with thick, dry hair.

, People with dry hair often have frizz to go along with it. There are a few changes you can make to your routine to cut back on and potentially eliminate frizz altogether. Try the following:


Blot your hair dry instead of roughly toweling it
Let your hair air dry instead of using a hair dryer; save heat styling for special occasions
Use a wide-toothed comb instead of a brush
Handle your hair as little as possible throughout the day

, Finishing oil is similar to leave-in conditioner, but it provides a little extra protection for hair that tends to get really dry. Hair oils and serums are available for purchase at salons and beauty supply stores. Look for products that contain the following:


Argan oil
Moroccan oil
Jojoba oil
Rosehip oil

Wash feet daily with soap and warm water. While your feet are wet, use a pumice stone to remove dry, flaky skin from heels and the bottom of your feet and to smooth down calluses on your toes. Dry your feet thoroughly, especially between the toes.






You should cut your toenails straight across to avoid ingrown toenails. Cutting into the corners of the toenail could lead to the nail growing into the toe. Use a nail file or emery board to smooth the rough, sharp edges of your toenails.






Moisturize your feet with creams or lotions made of oil-based ingredients such as shea butter of coconut oil to keep the skin soft and supple.






Check your feet for cuts, scratches, infection (such as athlete's foot) and changes in color or appearance. Some changes in your feet can be handled at home (clean cuts and apply antibiotic ointment and use over-the-counter creams for athlete's foot) or may require a visit to a podiatrist (foot specialist).






Apply sunblock to your feet when wearing sandals. This will reduce your chances of sunburn.;
,







Knowing your foot type will help you to choose the right shoes. If your feet are flat, you will need to purchase shoes with arch support. If you have high arches, choose shoes that support the balls of your feet and the heels. A podiatrist or retail shoe sales person can help you determine your foot type.






Purchase shoes at the end of the day when feet are at their widest. Have your feet measured while you are standing with your weight evenly distributed.






When trying on shoes, there should be 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) of space from the top of your longest toe to the top of the shoe's toe box.






Walk around the store in both shoes. If one or both of your feet hurt, do not buy the shoes.






Shoes that have a round toe box offer more room for your toes than shoes with a pointed, square or oval toe box.






According to the American Podiatric Medical Association, wearing heels over 3 inches (7.6 cm) can put pressure on the balls of the feet, lead to problems with balance and put stress on the ankles and knees.






Wearing different shoes every day will allow sweat form your feet to dry out of shoes completely and reduce the occurrence of infection. Wearing shoes made from breathable material like leather will assist with shoes drying out quickly.

,







A podiatrist is a medical doctor who specializes in problems of the feet and ankles. You should see a podiatrist if you have on-going or increasing foot pain or recurring infections.






A podiatrist can diagnosis and provide treatment for a variety of foot related ailments such as bunions, nail fungus, ankle and foot fractures and more.






If you have diabetes, a podiatrist can assist you with maintaining the health of your feet. See a podiatrist if you experience tingling or numbness in your feet or have wounds that fail to heal.

Select a moisturizer.,
Choose a good exfoliant.,
Find a pair of gloves.,
Exfoliate your hands.,
Add your moisturizer.,
Put on your gloves.,
Go to bed.,
Finish softening your hands.",How to Have Super Soft Hands (Overnight Method)," Super soft hands don’t come without the right products; any old moisturizer won’t do, if you want the silkiest skin. Find a moisturizing cream that is specifically advertised for use on hands. Hand creams are typically much thicker than a regular lotion, and have more nutrients needed for softening rough hands (which tend to be the driest part of your body). If your moisturizer is runny or thin, it probably won’t do the job you need to get super soft hands.





;
, Exfoliants are used to scrub off the dead skin on your hands, both before and after moisturizing. The reason your hands feel rough to begin with, is because of the dead skin that is present. You can scrub this off, and then the fresh skin underneath is exposed. Exfoliants can be store-bought, or you can create your own. Try one of the following homemade recipes:









Sugar and olive oil, mixed into a paste
Ground oatmeal and milk, mixed into a paste
Coffee grounds and coconut oil, mixed into a paste
Baking soda and water, mixed into a paste, Using the overnight method for soft hands involves a set of gloves or mittens. There are some specialty spa gloves available for getting soft hands overnight; these have a permanent gel that lines the gloves, that helps to lock moisture into your hands. Otherwise, any pair of knit or cotton gloves or mittens will work.









If you don’t have any gloves, you can use a clean pair of socks.
If you have exfoliator gloves, made from a rough loofah-like material, you can wear those as well.

, Go to the sink and run warm water; wet your hands completely, washing them if necessary.Take your exfoliant, and scoop about 1 tablespoon of it out into your hands. Rub this thoroughly over each of your hands for 3-5 minutes. When you’re finished scrubbing, turn the water back on and rinse your hands off. Dry your hands completely.








, Put a dab of cream about the size of a quarter onto each hand; it may seem like a lot, but it will soak into your skin overnight. Massage the cream into each of your hands, spending time on the palms, between your fingers, and around your cuticles. Feel free to carry the moisturizer up your arms slightly, to soften the skin around your wrists as well. Don’t worry if your hands feel greasy or you think you have too much.








, The concept behind the gloves (or mittens, or socks) is that they will trap the moisture inside, forcing the cream to soak into your skin. This will prevent it from rubbing off in your sleep, onto your bedding or clothes.








, Leave your gloves on overnight while you sleep, being careful not to pull them off while you slumber. If you’d rather, you can wear them during the day for the same results as long as they remain on your hands for at least 6 hours.








, In the morning, remove your gloves; you should be left with super soft hands! You have the option of adding a bit more moisturizer at this point, and dabbing on some cuticle oil around your nail beds. This will soften everything up, and leave your hands silky and soft. Repeat this entire process 1-2 times a week for hands that are always their very softest.

Use a thick, greasy cream or ointment to maintain the skin's natural internal moisture while severe dry patches and cracks heal.









The body's natural moisture is needed to help living cells grow from the bottom up to renew the tough, dead build-up of the outer layer which has suffered cracking, scaling, or more. The outer layer itself normally protects the lower layer, but it can't do that as well where there is an injury - that's why you need an ointment to help do the job.
Drugstore lotions often contain ingredients like alcohol, fragrances, and other chemicals that can actually make matters worse.
Look for products that contain pure emollients and humectants, which hydrate and protect the skin:


Lanolin, which keeps sheep comfy 'outside' in the 'rain and snow' all winter, is an excellent product for healing cracks.

Jojoba oil closely mimics the skin's natural oils. Look for products that list it as one of the main ingredients.

Coconut oil and shea butter are both excellent products for protecting the skin.

Petroleum jelly can protect the skin by forming a seal that doesn't allow moisture to escape.



, The way you wash your hands might be making matters worse. Washing rinses away your skin's natural oils, causing dryness and cracking. Washing your hands is unavoidable, but if you do it gently, you can prevent making the cracks get deeper.









Use a gentle soap. Strong chemical soaps are harsh on the hands. Try a gentle Castile soap, or dilute your soap with water before use.
Use warm water. Hot water washes away more of your natural oils and dries out the skin. Use warm water instead.
Dry your hands gently. Don't rub them roughly with a towel; pat them dry instead.

, Your skin loses moisture as the water evaporates off your skin; applying humectant helps seal this moisture in and keep it there.








, Water and harsh soaps will continue to dry out your hands, aggravating the cracked skin on your fingers. If you cannot avoid a lot of washing, protect your hands by frequently applying cream.








, If it is possible, wear light cotton gloves throughout the day. They will help to protect your cracked skin from further irritation. Apply cream before putting them on. If you are limited to when you can wear them, put the cotton gloves on at night before bed to help seal in moisture, keep on ointment, and make less of a mess while you sleep.








, Harsh ingredients found in dish washing or powerful soaps will irritate your cracked skin and further dry it out.








, Cold air carries very little water, and when heated, will tend to dry out your hands. Try a bedroom or whole-house humidifier. The type that fits into a central HVAC system and automatically draws water is economical and convenient.








, Sun exposure will also dry out and otherwise damage your skin and the hands are most susceptible to being exposed to the sun's harmful rays. They are not much weaker in winter than summer. If the cracks on your fingers are severe, wait until they are no longer bleeding or the sunscreen may sting.








, Deep cracks can trap soapy water that draws out the skin's natural moisture and breaks it down over time, and their edges can meet and force the bottom apart hurting and renewing damage as the skin flexes. A small, controllable, non-stabbing tool such as a cuticle nippers can be used to trim the clear, dead top layer of skin on each side to bring the crack to a shallow angle that will not trap water or force its bottom apart.









Don't trim too much; trim about half a millimeter on each side of the crack at a 45 degree angle. The trimming should not hurt, expose red, or draw blood: as with trimming cuticles, one should not mess with anything but the tough, transparent surface layer.
Keep the cuticle clippers or other personal hygiene tool clean and disinfected and do not share them.

, Cracked skin on your fingers could indicate an underlying medical condition, such as eczema, psoriasis or a fungal infection. Your doctor may prescribe topical steroids to help heal the skin.

Once you're awake in the morning, apply a generous amount of Vaseline or any type of moisturizing hand cream or lotion.,
Wear Gloves.,
Bring lotion with you!,
Before Bed, take some of the same body lotion (unscented, scented - doesn't matter) and apply it over the dry areas of your hands, elbows, wrists, feet.,
Apply petroleum jelly at night.,
Repeat, and good luck.

",How to Keep Your Hands Soft During the Winter Time," Mostly on the dry area's, such as your knuckles, your fingertips and in between your thumb and index finger.;
, Gloves are great accessories when Winter arrives. After you've applied lotion, whether you are going out to work or to school; always wear gloves. Leather gloves are more reliable than cotton or polyester gloves, though anything covering your hands during the cold season will work.

, A small bottle of lotion is always handy when you're at work or at school and feeling the irritation and burning sensation of your cracked skin. The unscented kind are probably better off than the floral, fruity (they leave a bit of a distraction) ones when you're out in public. May i recommend Aveeno?

, Make sure you're especially applying the lotion over your hands and knuckles until they feel somewhat smooth. (The process isn't quick.)

, (Ignore this step if your hands aren't severely dry) Nighttime. Right before bed (and after you've applied lotion) apply some Vaseline or any brand of Petroleum jelly all over the dry areas of your hands. Those cotton gloves come in handy during this step! Carefully slip on the cotton gloves (the ones at the dollar store/any cheap ones are fine) and make sure the jelly is secure inside the gloves. Now, it may feel uncomfortable but it works. Sleep with the gloves on throughout the entire night. This is the only way your skin will have the time to heal without any distraction and keep soft during the entire night.

Let the polish smooth itself out by getting a big drop on the brush, then gently rolling it out with the brush., The top coat adds extra shine and protection.

, Use a small brush or piece of tissue and nail polish remover to clean up the nail polish you get on your skin., Cold water can help set your nail polish, but hot water can cause your nails to expand, which can lead to cracking.,


Glittery polishes tend to last longer on your toenails than non-shimmery polishes. Use polishes that claim to be ""three-free."" That means that they don't contain formaldehyde, toluene, or dibutyl phthalate. These chemicals can be harmful over time., If you're shy, don't go with funky neon orange. For classy events, try French tips.

Do foot soaks on a regular basis.,
Exfoliate.,
Select proper footwear.,
Moisturize.,
Clip your toenails properly.",How to Have Flawless Feet1," Some basic foot care can help your feet look smooth and soft. Doing regular foot soaks can help remove dead skin cells and moisturize your feet.


A foot soak should last around 10 minutes. Any longer could leave your feet dry and cracked. Aim for lukewarm water. Water that's too hot or too cold could cause redness and other damage.You can soak your feet in plain water. If you have sensitive skin that tends to react poorly to additives, this might be your best bet. However, adding certain ingredients can help make the foot soak more relaxing and help moisturize and clean your feet.Sea salt, Epsom salt, dried flowers, oatmeal, and essential oils are all great potential additives. Be careful, however, when using essential oils. You have to dilute most oils in a neutralizing substance, such as olive oil, prior to use or it can cause skin irritation.Listerine is a type of mouth wash that some doctors recommend for foot soaks. Mix one part Listerine with two parts warm water. Soak your feet for 15 to 20 minutes and then apply a moisturizer.;
, Exfoliating feet is important to having strong, healthy feet. Exfoliation is a process by which dead skin cells are removed. You should exfoliate your feet once a week to keep them looking smooth and soft.









There are many ways to exfoliate your feet. You can buy foot creams and gels at department stores that come with micro-beads or other exfoliating agents. Use such creams as directed on the box. However, keep in mind micro-beads have a somewhat bad reputation amongst environmentalists. Beads are not biodegradable and end up causing pollution.Many people get good results making their own exfoliating cream at home. Any grainy substance, such as sea salt or Epsom salt, can be mixed with water or soap and rubbed against the feet.To exfoliate, you rub your cream of choice into your feet. Use enough force to smooth out rough patches and remove dead skin cells. Then, rinse your feet and moisturize.

, A major factor in caring for your feet is selecting the right shoes. Shoes that are too tight can cause calluses, pain, and other damage.


Contrary to popular belief, foot size can change over time. Go to shoe store and have your feet measured before selecting shoes. A salesperson can assist you in determining what size shoe would work best for you.Keep in mind most people have one foot that is slightly larger than the other. Select shoe size based on the larger of your two feet. It's better to have shoes that are slightly too loose than shoes that are slightly too tight.When standing, there should be about 3/8"" or 1/2"" inch, about the width of a finger, between your longest toe and the end of the shoe.Walk around in shoes for awhile before making a purchasing decision. Make sure shoes don't chafe or rub in any uncomfortable places.Taking these precautions with your shoes is the main way to prevent issues like corns, calluses, and bunions., Feet encounter a lot of wear and tear in the average day. A lot of oils and moisture is lost through day-to-day walking. Use a moisturizer for your feet on a regular basis. You can use your normal moisturizer or lotion. However, a stronger moisturizer might be required for feet. You can find moisturizers specifically designed for use on feet at a local supermarket or beauty store.







, Damages like ingrown toenails can result from improper toenail trimming. Always clip your toenails straight across and then file them to your desired shape. Many people try to build a round toenail shape through clipping the toenails in a certain way but this can cause toenails to bend inward. This can result in ingrown toenails."

You may have to wait until you're home from work or school to do so., Toe nails sometimes get stained with dirt and debris. It's fairly easy to remove a toenail stain using household items.


Toothpaste, whitening strips, and hydrogen peroxide are all effective means of un-staining toenails. Hydrogen peroxide is the best option. Stain a q-tip or cotton ball with hydrogen peroxide and gently dab on the stained area. Wait 3 to 5 minutes before washing the peroxide off.If you do not have hydrogen peroxide, you can try the same process using whitening strips or toothpaste. Keep in mind this may be less effective."

Care for the cuticles.,
Moisturize.",How to Give Your Feet a Makeover," Sounds simple enough, right? Wrong. Standing in soapy water doesn't count as washing your feet. Sit on the edge of your tub and give them a good wash, rubbing with soap and probably a brush if they are very dirty. Brush your toenails too, until they are clean.;
, This may sound girly, but you need to soak before you tend to tough unsightly issues like the thick skin on your heels. Fill a small plastic tub with warm to hot water and add just enough milk for it to turn white. You can add some oil (olive or almond) too, but very little. Sit still until your skin prunes up.

, With a foot file (or a pumice stone) and gentle pressure, try to slough away the thicker skin on your feet such as the heels or balls or the side of the big toe. Multiple scrubbings with gentle pressure get much better results than filing your foot until the skin gets hot.

, Cut the toenails straight across to prevent ingrown toenails and leave a small white strip at the top of the nail. With a small grain file, try to even out the edge of the toenail. This is very important, especially when they are too short to cut. If they are yellow, use an old toothbrush to rub a baking soda and vinegar mix onto them, or maybe rub lemon to whiten them.

, If your feet still have tiny pieces of dead skin attached from the filing or just aren't as soft as you'd like, rub a paste of coarse sea salt and olive oil on the areas you'd like to exfoliate further. Girls should try rubbing with sugar first, as salt may be too rough on your feet. If you wash away the paste, try to pour as little water on your feet as possible, to keep the olive oil next to your skin.

, Push them back slow and carefully with an appropriate tool you can buy at drugstores, or an orange stick. Rub cold cream onto them or, if they are especially dry, Vaseline.

, If you still think your feet are dry, slather the moisturizer of your choice and put on thick socks. Try to do this before bed. If after a couple days you still think your feet could look better, repeat from step 1. Especially when you've neglected your feet for a long time, they can take a while to look good again.

",How to Get Soft Hands," Lotion is the easiest and most important way to keep your hands soft. At the store, lotion is available in dozens of scents and styles to meet your personal needs.


Moisturize your hands every time you wash time. Keep small bottles at regular places around the house, so you always have some on hand.
Look for lotions that contain shea butter, B vitamins, and retinol. These ingredients keep your skin soft long after you’ve applied the lotion.
Mineral oils and lanolin help to trap water in the skin. Lotions with lactic acid and urea have soothing qualities, as well. Glycerin and dimethicone help to moisturize, while hyaluronic acid can help retain that moisture.;
, If you don't want to buy lotion, you can also use natural oils to rub into your hands, just as you would regular lotion.A very small amount goes a long way, as well, making this a cheap alternative. All of the following natural oils are used in cooking, but are nourishing and healthy for skin, nails, and hair when applied regularly:


Avocado
Almond
Aloe vera gels
Coconut
Cocoa butter
Sunflower
Olive

, Exfoliant scrubs are usually just moisturizing lotion with some grit in it, included to help scrub off dead skin. These are available in most beauty supply and drugstores, but you can make your own for cheap at home:


Combine a few tablespoons of white sugar with olive oil or coconut oil to form a paste, and rub it into your hands for two minutes. Rinse with warm water, and you should be left with hands that are much softer than prior to your scrub.If you like, add a few drops of peppermint or lavender essential oil to add a nice smell to the lotion. If you don't want to use sugar, use grated beeswax or salt.

, When the temperature drops, your skin suffers. If you live in a cold area, use a deep-conditioning treatment with an old pair of socks to keep your hands soft. It's simple and effective:


Heat of a pair of clean socks in the microwave for 15 seconds. Put a generous amount of your favorite lotion on your skin, but don't rub it in.
Put the socks on your hands, and let your hands soak it all in for 10-20 minutes. Remove the socks and continue rubbing in the remaining lotion.You can do this and leave the socks on overnight to help with extra dry skin. While it might seem weird, socks are usually better and easier to clean than gloves.

, If your hands are peeled and cracking, bring out the big guns. Use a conditioning hand salve, like Bag Balm, or a similar product. These are gel-like creams used for healing deeply dry skin. Rub it into your knuckles, palms, and other problem spots for several days until your skin has softened.

, A recent study revealed that flax and borage supplements helped increase moisture and decrease roughness in skin. These fatty acids are found in most well-balanced diets, but if you're struggling with extremely dry skin, a supplement of flaxseed, borage oil, or evening-primrose might be effective in helping to control it., It's a common home remedy to use Vaseline or lemon juice on to dry skin to soften it up, but both of these should generally be avoided when you're treating dry skin, in favor of other more nourishing remedies. Neither is recommended by the medical community.Vaseline actually acts as a moisture-barrier, not a moisturizer. While it is effective in preventing chaffing and ""locking moisture in,"" it's not a moisturizer, and won't treat dry hands alone.
There's some controversy about whether or not lemon juice can be used to exfoliate skin and soften it, or whether or not the citric acid in the lemon juice acts more as an irritant.Never apply lemon juice if you're going to be exposed to the sun, because it makes your skin prone to burning.

, Washing your hands regularly is beneficial for good hygiene, but it can also seriously dry your skin out. Find soaps that are skin-sensitive and contain moisturizing ingredients such as jojoba or olive oil, which nourish and heal dry hands.


Avoid alcohol and glycerine-based hand sanitizers, which dry out the skin on your hands.
Sub out regular body wash or soap for something with moisturizing ingredients as well, so that you aren’t damaging your hands in your regular showers.

, Very hot water can actually burn your skin and dry out your hands. It might not be recognizable as a ""burn,"" but if your skin turns slightly red in the sink or bath, the water is too hot., Dish soap is one of the most aggressive and irritating forms of soap for your hands. When you wash dishes, especially in the wintertime, it's a good idea to use a pair of yellow dish gloves to keep your hands dry. This is very true if you're submerging your hands in the water.

, If you’re outside a lot, do what you can to keep your skin soft even when facing nasty weather. In the fall and winter months, wear gloves to protect your hands from the wind.

, Your hands are just as susceptible to the damages of the sun as the other parts of your body that are exposed. While most people don't want to wear gloves in the summer time, go for sunscreen instead.Go for as high an SPF rating as you can get. If you're out in the sun, there's little point in wasting time with anything rated less than 20.

, If you're not getting enough water, your skin will dry out. Diet plays a big role in your skin health, making it important that you get at least 8 glasses, or around two liters of water each day.Alcohol can dehydrate you, which can in turn result in dryer skin. If you struggle with dry skin, avoid the overconsumption of alcohol.

Exfoliate your feet every day.,
Hydrate your feet daily.,
Soften your toenails.,
Remove overgrown cuticles.,
Avoid soaking your feet in hot water.",How to Get Soft Feet1," Calluses and dead skin will build up on your feet from simple, every day use. In order to remove calluses, use a foot file or pumice stone to remove dead skin from the bottom or sides of your feet every day, after a shower or bath.When purchasing a pumice stone, ensure you buy one intended for use on your skin.
Both pumice stones and foot files are essentially sandpaper for your feet. In fact, the coarse surface on a foot file (and emery board) is basically sandpaper made specifically for your body.While not required, it helps if you soak your feet in warm water before using a pumice stone or foot file. This can include having a shower or bath.
Before using a pumice stone, dip it in water, or run it under a warm water tap.
Use either the pumice stone or foot file to gentle rub excess and dead skin off the bottoms of your feet - in a circular motion. Do this for only a minute or two per area on your feet.
You will most likely need to repeat this process several times before you’re able to remove all the dead skin.
Do not use foot razors to remove dead skin. Nicks and cuts to the skin on your feet can be easily infected.;
, Feet do not have a lot of oil glands to keep the skin moisturized on their own. With age, the cell regeneration in our skin slows down and also impacts foot dryness. To help offset these problems, put foot moisturizer on your feet every day, ideally after a shower or bath.Be careful not to walk around in your bare feet on tile or hardwood floors after applying moisturizer, your feet will be very slippery. Either stick to carpet, put socks on, or use slippers to walk around.
If your feet are very dry and bothersome, consider talking to your doctor about a prescription-strength foot cream.

, As we age, our toenails get thicker and harder from the constant contact with the inside of our shoes. To help soften your toenails, you can apply petroleum jelly to your toenails before bed, every night., Every 2 weeks, rub cuticle oil on your toenails and soak your feet in warm water for 10 minutes. Use a wooden manicure stick (or your fingernails) to push your cuticles back and remove excess skin.An alternative to cuticle oil and foot soak is to use a commercial cuticle remover. You should be able to purchase cuticle remover at a department or drug store.

, Hot water is very drying. When showering, bathing, or soaking your feet, avoid using really hot water. Use warm water instead to help keep the natural moisture and oils in your skin.

See a podiatrist to have the corn assessed.,
Remove a corn at home.,
Get silicone foam wedges for corns on the toe(s).,
Use over-the-counter medications and pads to get rid of the corn.,
Talk to your doctor about using antibiotics in conjunction with other methods.,
Take action to prevent corns from returning.,
Understand that there are other things that you can do to help prevent corns from cropping up in the first place.",How to Get Rid of Corns," Over the counter remedies do exist and are helpful, but there's no substitute for seeing a licensed doctor with a full arsenal of medical options.


A corn is a symptom of a condition, not a condition itself. A podiatrist can help you determine the cause of the corn so you can deal with the problem directly. Corns are most often caused by footwear that doesn't fit properly, excessive use of dress shoes, toe deformities, or problems with your posture or gait that pressure areas of your feet.
The podiatrist will most likely decide to remove the corn for you, but will advise you that the corn will return if you do not resolve the condition that caused it.
Follow the podiatrist's recommendations for corn management. These may include a change in footwear, padding to protect the area from friction or pressure, foot orthotics to change the pressure distribution on your feet, or surgical correction for foot or toe problems.;
, The best way to begin removing a corn is to:


Soak your foot in comfortably hot water for 5 to 10 minutes to soften the corn.
Sand the corn gently using a pumice stone or another sanding object, like a skin file.
You may need to repeat the treatment several times before the corn is fully removed.

, Specially-made silicone foam wedges will help relieve the pressure and friction between toes., Follow package instructions carefully. Most corn removal products contain salicylic acid, which could irritate or burn your foot.


Most OTC pads contain 40% salicylic acid, making this a strong medication.Even so, your doctor may recommend that you file away some of the dead skin on the corn before applying the pad.

, Antibiotic ointments are a common way to prevent infection, which is a common risk you run when treating the corn at home., An ounce of prevention is worth a pound cure.


Wear properly fitted, well-padded, shoes that have a wide toe box.
Bring your shoes to a cobbler to have the toe box stretched in the area where you develop corns.
Choose thick socks to absorb pressure on the foot. Make sure the socks fit loosely and do not cause your shoe to be too snug. Also make sure that your socks don't have seams that rub against any corns or places where you might get corns.

, These include:


Washing your feet every day with soap, water, and a scrubbing brush. When your feet are dry, apply a foot cream (not just normal lotion) to rehydrate.
Go shoe-shopping later on in the day. Feet naturally swell as the day progresses. That means that shoes bought early in the day might not fit you later on in the day.
Change your socks daily and use a pumice regularly. When using a pumice stone, be careful not to scrape away dead skin too forcefully.

Familiarize yourself with your anatomy.,
Stay sanitary.,
Be sure the coast is clear.,
Two-Finger Method for Beginners.,
One-handed Method for More Experienced Women.,
Funnel method.,
Hover Method.",How to Urinate Standing Up as a Female," You may not have given much thought to how things work in your lower region, so it's a good idea to review some basic female anatomy by looking at a diagram or using a hand mirror to look at yourself.

Find the urethra. The urethra is a tube that leads from the bladder to the outside. The urine travels through this inch-and-a-half long tube and is released through a small hole that's located behind your clitoris, just in front of your vagina.
Locate the labia. The labia majora are the two outer rounded folds of tissue that lie on either side of the urethral and vaginal openings. The labia minora are two inner folds of skin enclosed within the labia majora.

The opening to the urethra is tiny--just a small slit--so don't be concerned if it takes you a minute or two to locate it in the mirror.
It's a good idea to touch these parts of your anatomy and see how they feel. When you're first learning to pee standing up, you'll need to use your fingers to open the labia minora in order to expose the opening of the urethra and obtain a well-controlled stream of urine.

;
, If you know you'll be somewhere the bathrooms are disgusting or non-existent, keep a few items on hand to help yourself stay clean.


Hand sanitizer. Before you pee standing up, it's essential that you wash your hands. You're going to be touching your genital area and you don't want germs from your hands to cause a urinary tract infection. Because women have short urethras, it's easy for germs to move up their bladders.If soap and water aren't available, use hand sanitizer to protect yourself.
Wet wipes. Have a travel-size pack of sanitary wipes with you to clean your hands when you're done. For some standing-up styles of urinating, your fingers will get wet.

, You may need to urinate standing up because you're out camping or because the women's room is far too crowded and the men's room was available. Before you begin, make sure you have privacy. If you're interrupted mid-stream, things could get messy, and there may be some degree of embarrassment for you, your intruder, or both.

, When you're first learning to pee standing up, you want to make the process as easy on yourself as possible. You'll get better with practice but for now follow this introductory method to practice at home.



Wash your hands. Wash your hands thoroughly with warm, soapy water and dry them.
Remove everything from the waist down. As a newbie, you're likely to create a bit of a mess. To prevent urine from getting on your pants, skirt, underwear or shoes, simply take them off. If you have a top that hangs down low, you may want to remove that as well.
Position yourself in front of the toilet or in the shower stall. Stand with your feet about 2 feet (0.6 m) apart. Use the fingers of both hands to pull the labia apart as best as you can. Place your fingers slightly in front of the urethra. Pull your fingers up and forward just a little while exerting equal pressure on both sides.
Start the stream. Rotate your hips to slightly control the direction of the stream. Push hard at the beginning of your flow and then again to end the stream. This will cut down on ""dribbles"" .
Wipe yourself and mop up any mess around the toilet area or rinse down the shower. Be sure to wash your hands again.

Do not be discouraged if you peed down one leg or sprayed all over the place--that's absolutely common for beginners. The key is to practice a lot; if you do, you'll definitely see improvement.
Experiment a bit with posture. You may find it helpful to bend your knees a bit or arch your back. What works for one woman may not work for you so try a few different positions.



,


Wash your hands.
Move clothing out of the way. Slide your skirt off or pull your underpants and pants all the way down.
Be ready with toilet paper or a wipe in one hand. Use this to clean up if the urine goes somewhere you don't want it to.
With your other hand, make a “V” with the first and second finger and spread the inside of the inner lips, pulling upward. You need to spread the inner labia so your urine will come forward in a stream and not run down your leg. By adjusting how much you pull upwards, as well as the position of your hips, you can control where the stream goes (although it'll take a bit of practice).
Wipe yourself and mop up any mess around the toilet area if you're at home. Be sure to wash your hands again.

Once you've had plenty of practice and are confident that your can direct your urine stream, you can use the one-handed method and keep your clothes mostly in place. You can pull your pants down a little, but if they have a long zipper, you may be able to open the zipper all the way and leave the pants in place. Lift your skirt with your free hand. Use the hand that makes the ""V"" to slide aside your underwear at the crotch.



, Use a female urination device (FUD) or stand-to-pee (STP) device. Female urination devices have been around for almost 100 years, and the designs have advanced considerably over that time. They are available in reusable and disposable models and can be found through online pharmacy and product websites.


Wash your hands.
Move your clothing out of the way. It should be enough to undo your pants and pull down the front of your underpants or push them to one side.
Put the device in place. If it's made of plastic or other rigid material, you can place your hand on either side of the device. If it's made from silicone or other flexible material, stretch your thumb and middle finger to hold the device from front to back. Place it securely against your body taking care to maintain the seal on the back. Direct the outlet pipe away from the body and out of the pants.
Direct your stream. You can do this by using a third finger to make a triangle to stabilize the pee stream. Shift your hips, bend your legs and/or arch your back to find a comfortable position that allows you to control your flow. Aim urine to a suitable place; into a toilet or away from feet.
When you're done, pull the device away. If you're without toilet paper, use it to wipe away any drips. Shake it off and rinse with water if possible.

While you may find this easier than the finger-method, it still takes practice to avoid drips and dribbles. Plan to use a FUD at home several times until you are comfortable with it.
Some reusable devices come packaged in a reusable plastic bag or pouch; others may not. Have your own plastic bag on hand to store the device before and after use if it does not come with a bag.
In a pinch, you could make your own device from a plastic bottle. Cut off the bottom of the bottle with scissors or a utility knife. Remove the cap and wash the top of the bottle thoroughly. Place the opening at top of the bottle over your urethra. Make sure it is directly over the opening or you will split the urine stream and make a mess. Direct the open end of the bottle away from you and use a firm but not forceful stream.



, If your legs are strong and you can hold a squat for several seconds successfully, then you can use the hover or squat method to urinate.


Put the toilet seat up. This will give you a slightly larger ""target"" and keep you from messing up the seat for the next woman. Of course, if you're using this method because the toilet is dirty then it's not a concern. One the other hand, if you're not used to this method and are worried about slipping, you may want to leave to seat down to catch you if it comes to that.
Bend your knees and lower yourself backside so that you're ""sitting"" at an almost 90-degree angle. If you don't commit to an almost-full-90 degrees and instead simply ""tilt"" yourself back, you're likely to spray all over the seat and possibly your pants and shoes. Balance yourself by resting your forearms on your knees or putting one hand on the wall to steady yourself. Get as close to the bowl as you can without touching the surface.
Position yourself as far back as you can over the opening. Since your stream will flow outwards in front of you, starting further back will prevent splashing or overshooting.
Keep your head up. Focus on a point directly in front of you. Looking between your legs may cause you to lose your balance.
When you're done, wipe yourself and wash your hands if possible. If you left the seat down, take a short look for mistakes. If necessary give the seat a swipe with some toilet paper to clean it up for the next user.

Maintain good oral hygiene.,
This one may seem obvious, but take showers daily!,
Find a face wash which works for you.,
Use a good antiperspirant!,
Remember, when it comes to makeup, less is more!,
Be sure to clean your bedroom and house often!",How to Stay Clean," One of the first things people notice about someone is their teeth and mouth. As soon as all your milk teeth have been replaced with your set of permanent teeth, its important that you look after them well as they are the only ones you will ever have!


Brush your teeth twice daily, in the morning and after dinner. This is important as it scrubs away sugar that could feed off the enamel in your tooth and cause cavities. Using a good fluoride toothpaste, apply a pea-sized dollop of toothpaste onto a toothbrush. Be sure to scrub in a way that would push the 'grime' away from your gums. Replace your toothbrush every three or so months. Select one that is best suited for your gum type. It is recommended that you use one with soft bristles as ones with hard bristles can cause bleeding gums.
Try to floss from as young an age as possible. Purchase a good dental floss from a brand you trust. Flossing removes any food that gets stuck in between your teeth which a toothbrush cannot properly reach. You do not need to floss twice a day, flossing once a day after dinner would suffice.
If you are over the age of 13, invest in a good mouth wash. Use this after breakfast to kill off bad breath and make you feel fresh and cleaner instantly. Bad breath is a big no-no when it comes to personal hygiene. Listerine is a well-known brand of mouthwash which does the trick well. Ask your local dentist for any recommendations on great mouth washes.;
, When you are relaxing after a long, hard day, it can be irresistibly tempting to go to bed straight after dinner without having a shower. Not so fast! If we didn't take showers, how else would be get rid of all the dirt and grime we project ourselves to on a daily basis?


Find a shampoo and conditioner that works best with your hair type. Do you find your hair is constantly frizzy, or does it break really easy? Maybe it gets very oily during the day, or maybe there isn't much wrong with it at all! There are plenty of conditioners for different hair types on the market, so read the bottle before you buy to see if it is best suited to your hair. This also requires a bit of trial and error. If you aren't really sure what brand or what type of shampoo/conditioner works best for your hair, shop around a bit and try different kinds until you find one which you find works for you. Ask your hairdresser for assistance. Don't forget, it is there profession! However, if they suggest you buy one of their upper-market brands, be careful. These people are also sales persons! Plus, expensive brands do not necessarily work the best. Plenty of drugstore hair shampoos and conditioners work a lot better for some people than expensive salon types. Once you have found your ideal shampoo and conditioner, Try to wash your hair every other day. Do not wash your hair every night as it will dry it out. Always wash your hair after participating in any activities such as swimming in the ocean or in a swimming pool and remember to always use both shampoo and conditioner every time you wash your hair, not just one of the two.
Find a good body wash which smells good and works well for you! Even just looking for one in your chemist or drugstore will suffice. You don't need to go and spend a fortune on this! Just find something which you like the smell of.
Invest in a good razor! If you are a girl over the age of 14 or so, you should definitely consider either shaving or waxing your legs! Getting a good razor and spending a little more is probably better in the long run than buying a cheap disposable razor and getting cut seven times by it!

, Acne or pimples are no fun to have around, and can make your skin red and irritated. But before you Try to pop your zits (and end up with big scars on your face), try getting a good face wash. Like shampoo and conditioners, not everyone will suit the same face wash. It all depends on your skin type. Just because your friend finds a certain brand of face wash works well for them, doesn't necessarily mean it will work the same for you. However, it doesn't hurt to try. Shop around a bit until you find something your face (and your wallet!) is happy with.


Wash your face every morning after you wake up. Not only will it create a stable face washing routine, it will also help you to feel more awake and alert. Just think of it as an alternative to coffee!
Make sure to tie your hair out of your face when washing it. You don't want your hair falling into the water! This includes pinning back your bangs and any other wisps of hair which might fall out.
Wash your face with warm water. This will open up your pores and flush out all the dirt in them which causes zits.
Careful! Don't rub your face too hard, otherwise your skin and acne will become even more irritated, making the zits redder!

, This is extremely important as nobody wants to smell bad. Let's face it, sitting next to someone who's sweating isn't exactly everybody's cup of tea. There are many different scents of deodorants you can use. Most deodorants (or antiperspirants) come in either a roll-on or spray bottle. The only difference between the two is how they are applied. Apply antiperspirant in the underarms only. If using a spray bottle, spray approximately 15 centimeters (5.9 in) away from your underarm.


Find one that smells good! There's no point of using a deodorant if it smells disgusting. Whilst it may seem slightly odd to go to your friends and ask them what kind of deodorant they use, you can quietly find out what brands of deodorant they like by seeing what they keep in their bags after working out at the gym etc.
Try to keep a deodorant with you if you know you'll be participating in any type of physical activity or something that you know will cause you to work up a sweat! Keep a bottle in your school locker or your gym bag just to be on the safe side.
Don't use too much of it! There's no need to drench yourself in it. Don't get deodorant mixed up with perfume.

, Using makeup frequently clogs up your pores, which is the cause of zits and pimples! Try to stick with the fresh-faced beauty look where possible. Love the skin you're in and you will be truly beautiful!


If you need to use makeup, try to avoid sticky kinds! This will double the chances of getting pimples as it is oily and will sink into your pores easier, and that is not cleanly!
Keep a simple look when using makeup. Try to stick to neutral colors. They give you a more clean look!
Either do something dramatic with your eyes or lips, NOT BOTH! Your goal is to look clean and simple, not transform into a clown!
Always remove makeup before you go to bed to avoid it from clogging up your pores overnight.

, Keep a rubbish bin in any room you might do any eating or craft-type activities in so whenever you need to throw away rubbish you have a bin to use and you're not tempted to throw it on the ground.

Talk with them at the first signs of puberty.,
Get their attention.,
Respect your teen’s privacy.,
Verify that your information is accurate.",How to Talk to Teens About Personal Hygiene1," It is a good idea to talk this subject over with a pre-teen, so that they are prepared when they hit adolescence. However, you can also wait until you notice the signs of puberty and see your teen struggling with them. At that point, start casually mentioning the importance of hygiene.You might say, “I’ve noticed that you don’t have enough wash cloths to clean your face daily. Would you like me to buy some for you?”
Be sure to have a direct conversation with your pre-teen as well. Talk with them about the importance of things like showering daily, wearing clean clothes, using deodorant, washing their hair, and brushing their teeth.;
, You want to pick a time where your teen will pay attention to the conversation, such as during a car ride. Look for a time with few distractions and avoid the period immediately before and after school. During this time, ask them to put away their cell phone. Keep the discussion brief as well so that they don’t get bored or start tuning you out. You should also know the times at which your teen will be the most receptive to your advice. For example, if they are not a morning person, then it is probably a good idea to wait until that evening.


You could say, “When you are finished with your homework, let’s sit and talk for a bit.”

, Pursue this subject when you are alone and one-on-one, not in public or around their friends. If you embarrass them by discussing hygiene in front of other people, your teen will be less likely to confide in you in the future., Before you start to give advice, spend some time on the internet looking at reputable medical websites, such as the Mayo Clinic, to see what they recommend for teen hygiene. This will ensure that you are accurate and won’t contradict anything the teen might have heard already from teachers.Your teen’s pediatrician can be a source of really useful information in this respect. Ask them for advice regarding the best way to approach the topic and see if they would recommend any products in particular. You might say, “Is there a particular face wash that you would recommend to combat teen acne?”

Emphasize the social aspect of good hygiene.,
Provide teens with clear examples.,
Ask your teens if they have any questions.",How to Talk to Teens About Personal Hygiene2," It is quite possible that your teen may be embarrassed about their hygiene, but is simply unsure how to fix it. Or, they may not realize that anything is wrong until you tell them otherwise. Either way, make sure to proceed cautiously and include praise about their appearance as well.For example, you might say, “You have such lovely hair. I just bought you a new shampoo that is supposed to bring out your highlights even more for summer. Why don’t you try it out and let me know if you like it?”
Do not laugh and avoid joking with them when you have this talk. If they have questions, be sure to praise them for asking.

, Talk with them about how they are doing with their friends. Ask about trends in hair care or style. Use this an entry point into discussing how they could be a trendsetter by being really in tune with the latest products and grooming techniques.Whatever you do, do not point out that your teen will, “Have no friends,” if they don’t follow your advice. This will be perceived as a threat and will get a negative reaction. Instead, you might say that “even more people” will be drawn to them if they practice good hygiene.
You could also point out that following good hygiene practices will make them a positive role model for their younger friends or siblings. You might say, “It would be great if you could be a model for your younger sister and take a shower every day. She really looks up to you.”
You can also make jokes about the situation, but in a positive way. For example, you could remark how your daughter will smell the best out of the entire school, especially with all of those smelly teen boys around.

, Don’t just speak in generalities or your teen will probably lose interest. Instead, draw upon your personal experience to relate cautionary tales of poor hygiene. You can also mention those cases where someone reaped rewards for taking care of themselves. It is best if these examples are persons who the teens knows directly.


For example, you might talk about a teen cousin who had to go to the dentist for a root canal after refusing to brush their teeth for years. Or, you could talk about how another cousin cleared up the acne from her face by following a strict face washing routine.

, This is probably the most important step of all. You must keep the lines of communication open. Give your teen a chance to pepper you with questions and treat all questions importantly. Try to answer what you can and be a good listener as they are explaining their concerns.


For example, your son might tell you that he’s concerned his facial hair will re-grow darker after shaving. You can discuss this with him and perhaps even do some internet research together.
Instead of just saying, “Do you have any questions?” you might ask, “Do you have any questions about proper hair care?”
You can also be more specific by asking things like, ""How are you feeling about your skin lately? Are you having any problems?"" Show that you are willing to help them problem-solve.

, Most teens, especially if they are engaged in athletic activities, will start to sweat heavily as they go through puberty. Talk to them about their clothing needs and do extra laundry, if needed. Discuss with them the possibility of using deodorants or antiperspirants to mask the odor or control moisture.If they are participating in sports, you could say, “I notice that you are going through a number of shirts in soccer, which I expect since it’s so hot. But, would you like a few new ones?”
You might also suggest that they keep some deodorant in their gym bag, locker, or car just in case they forget to use it one day. Then, they will have some handy to use.

, Both boys and girls will likely need to start shaving once they hit their teen years. You can discuss the different product options available to them, from protected razors to scented creams.

Emphasize the need to go slow as well, whatever method they choose.If you notice that the teen has an excessive amount of hair, you may want to make an appointment with a doctor to rule out any medical issues and discuss removal options, if desired.

, Emphasize that the good oral care routines that were established in childhood need to carry on into the teen years. They should brush at least twice a day.

By having good dental hygiene, they may be able to prevent damage later in life.

, Oily skin is a common problem for teens as their hormones rage out of control. You may want to encourage your teen to wash their face on a regular basis, even using specialty soaps. However, also tell them to be gentle and to avoid picking or scratching at their skin. Visiting a dermatologist is another option if the problem is severe.If your teen expresses sadness or hopelessness about their skin, let them know that this is only temporary and that most people experience skin problems during this time.

, Depending on your teen they may be excited or dreading going shopping. So, tailor the trip according to their personality and needs. You could even split this up into a few brief shopping trips as well.

You could say, “Why don’t you hang out here and pick out a shaving cream that you like and anything else you want. I am going to head over to the frozen foods, just find me when you are done.”
After you buy the products, if they plan on taking them to school, remind them that it is not a good idea to share hygiene items with others as you can get all sorts of infections and illnesses., You can also do some shopping on your own and stock your teen’s bathroom with an assortment of new products. Keep an eye on which ones they use and keep those filled. If they seem to avoid others, perhaps try a new brand or scent.

Keep the bathroom door open, when reasonable, so your teen can watch you go about your routine., Offer sincere praise at regular intervals. However, make sure that you don’t draw too much of a contrast between past and present. Instead, talk about how they continue to improve as they mature and grow up. This will make them proud and more likely to follow your advice in the future.You might say, “I’m so happy that you’ve stopped biting your nails. I knew they would be beautiful if they grew out. Has it been hard to resist biting?”

, If you notice that the teen is also appearing downcast or depressed, then you may be dealing with a larger mental health issue. Try to observe the teen’s sleeping and eating patterns to get more of a clue regarding their overall mindset. If you continue to be concerned, seek out the help of a medical professional.Consider how you teen was about a year ago and see if there is a stark contrast in how they are now. This can be a clue that they are suffering.

, If you are working with a teen who is special needs or has additional complicating issues, you may want to speak with a counselor or your pediatrician.

Rinse the toothbrush with hot tap water before and after brushing.,
Dry the toothbrush thoroughly.,
Rinse the toothbrush in an antibacterial rinse.,
Bathe the toothbrush under ultraviolet light.,
Replace the toothbrush every 3-4 months or as needed.",How to Sanitize a Toothbrush1," Hold the toothbrush from the handle grip with your thumb. Run the bristles back and forth repeatedly under the hot water. Do this every time, before and after, you brush your teeth and make sure it has been completely cleaned., After finishing a cleaning session you need to shake out the bristles, and make sure the moisture is gone. Tap the brush handle against a hard surface, such as the sink, to get some of the water out of the bristles. You can also shake the brush briskly over the sink, bristles face down, to get more moisture out, but never let the brush touch the sink. Let the brush finish drying without the bristles coming into contact with any other surface.If the bristles touch any other surface, then you might want to re-run them under hot water, and start the drying process over.

, Use an alcohol-based rinse or even chlorhexidine 0.02 % mouthwash for this. Pour some of the rinse into a clean plastic cup. Just pour enough to dip the toothbrush head and bristles in. Grasp the toothbrush by the handle grip and dip the bristles into the rinse. Swish the bristles around in the rinse for 30 seconds. Remove the brush, tap the handle on a hard edge (such as the sink) to shake out any moisture, and then store it upright to dry without the bristles coming into contact with other surfaces or other bristles of someone else's toothbrush. Dispose of the cup.Never dip the brush into the main bottle of rinse, or you risk cross-contaminating the entire bottle as well as the brush.
Extend this rinse to a 10 minute soak if you are sick.

, Many sanitizers use ultraviolet (UV) light to kill the bacteria on the bristles of the toothbrush. The basic technique is the same for most of these devices. Open a user accessible casing of the device. Insert the toothbrush or toothbrush head (in the case of electric brushes) into an internal compartment. Close the casing. Turn on the device and let the UV light clean the bristles for the instructed period—usually just a few minutes. Remove the brush when the device signals you to do so.There are some alternative methods to these automatic sanitizers that use steam or soundwaves instead of UV light. The steps to use them will be mostly the same, but the duration of the cleaning may differ. Also, the sanitizers using steam have almost the same rate of eliminating bacteria similar to the UV ones.

, Sometimes the best policy is to simply get a new toothbrush. The American Dental Association recommends replacing your brush every 3-4 months. However, closer examination of the bristles can tell you if replacement needs to happen sooner. Look for the bristles to be individually fraying (splitting at the ends). Also if you see whole sets of the bristles bent in one direction without returning to an upright position even after drying, then it is time for a new brush.Some toothbrushes have some colored bristles on them, which indicates when to change the toothbrush. As the color starts to fade and becomes almost the same as the other bristles, it is time to get a new toothbrush.

Be particularly mindful of wearing gloves to protect your hands from exposure during the winter months when the air is typically drier.

, Damage from exposure to the sun can aggravate your condition.


Avoid mixing the sunscreen with other products on your hands for the duration of your excursion.
Make sure the SPF (sun protection factor) number on the sunscreen you are using is adequate for conditions you are experiencing.
Use the cleaning methods, especially the soaps, above to thoroughly clean off the sunscreen after use before you switch back to your regular cleansing routine.

, Unless you already know you have a more severe condition, like eczema, you might ask to your dermatologist for recommendations on specific products you can use to accelerate your hands' skin improvement, healing, and protection.Ask your dermatologist for suggestions on creams and ointments that you can use on a daily basis.
If you are using products at night, see if your dermatologist has any ideas about what else you might use, or change about your application technique if you are not seeing results.
Consider bringing any home-made products by your dermatologist for confirmation on their correctness.

, Find a few ways to add a little moisture to the air in your home without compromising other health factors. This is more important during the winter.Use a humidifier. These machines will pump moisture directly from a water source into the air.
A bowl of water near your heaters will also draw moisture into the air.

, Similar to the recommendation of not washing with hot water, you should avoid washing with hot water in other places to avoid it affecting your hands.


Find a ""luke-warm"" setting to adjust your bath/shower to instead.
Consider applying bathing oils to your hands before you enter the bath/shower, and then moisturizer afterwards.

, Placing your chosen moisturizing products and exfoliate products at your sinks will encourage their use.If you wash up at multiple locations, try to have multiple bottles/pumps of soap, moisturizer, and exfoliate at each sink.
You can keep a large bottle of product at your primary wash location, and smaller bottles at others.

Use as many drops as it takes to form a mixture you can rub into your palm until the sugar blends with your skin.

, Because there are large varieties of oatmeal, you might have to experiment a bit to find the right combination, but the basic process is the same as with sugar.


Mix a couple teaspoons of oatmeal and few drops of olive oil. Rub the mixture on your palms until it blends in with your hand. Let the rub set on your hands for fifteen minutes before washing it off., These should be two readily accessible ingredients for a hand-softening rub.Combine two teaspoons of butter with one teaspoon of almond oil for the mixture to rub on your hands. Let the rub sit for 20 minutes before washing.

, These also should be relatively easy ingredients to gather at home or from a store to produce a rub to soften your hands within a week.


For this rub you will need to mix one teaspoon of honey, half a teaspoon of almond powder, and a few drops of rose water to form the product. However, it is essential that you make sure this rub is evenly distributed on your palms with several minutes of rubbing and then leave it on your hands for an additional ten minutes before washing it off.

Take a half-slice of lemon, pour sugar onto the juicy part, and rub the juicy/sugar part onto your palms until the sugar has dissolved. Repeat for the other hand.

, Among the more accessible solutions is this one, but you will need to keep the rub on for 20 minutes before washing.


To produce this rub, combine a tablespoon of honey with a tablespoon of sugar and then rub the result into your palms until the sugar component dissolves for each hand. Start the twenty minute wait at that point.

, This also has mostly accessible ingredients you can use for a hand-softening rub which can be completed within a week.

Check your soaps to make sure they fragrant-free and don't contain any other harsh ingredients that may irritate your skin.

, After you've used the home remedy rubs, you should use your chosen moisturizer to lock in the effect the rub has had. Wear your gloves to protect your hands from damage.

Put the toothbrush in a dry place.,
Stand the toothbrush upright.,
Move the container away from other surfaces.,
Install a wall mounted toothbrush holder.,
Cover the toothbrush when mobile.",How to Sanitize a Toothbrush2," Keeping the brush dry after a cleaning session is important to avoiding bacterial contamination. Check the area you are storing your brush and its container for adequate ventilation. You want air to flow to prevent bacteria from concentrating on the brush., This will accomplish two sanitary features. Firstly, it will allow the water and any other fluids to drain from the bristles with gravity. Also, the bristles will not be sitting in any bacteria collecting in the bottom of the container. Make sure the container you select is short enough to allow the toothbrush to lean so the bristles are well above the rim, but not so high it tips over.Whether you use a cup or rack-style container—you might want to put paper towels under the area you store the toothbrush to catch its drippings. This way you can dispose of the contaminated fluids without them contacting other surfaces.

, You don’t want the toothbrush bristles coming in contact with other contaminant sources such as a toilet, wall, or cabinet. Keep any containers two to three feet away from a toilet to avoid spray-contamination from flushing.Another good option is to keep toothbrushes inside the bathroom cabinet.

, You can put the brush in a holster that has a mounting that keeps it stationary on a wall. Purchase a mounting bracket and holder from a hardware store. Use a screwdriver to fasten the bracket to the wall near the back of the bathroom sink at least 2-3 feet away from the toilet, shower, and/or bathtub. Place the toothbrush holder onto the bracket by sliding it vertically into place.These holders usually have room for several brushes. Make sure the brushes don’t touch each other. There is also usually a center holder for a cup to hold accessories such as toothpaste. Make sure the toothbrush bristles don’t touch the center items either.

, The only time you should cover your toothbrush is when traveling. There are plenty of commercially available covers, and some even have antimicrobial features. Use the latter if available. Whichever you choose will function mostly the same way--by slipping the brush head with bristles into the cover’s pocket, and sealing or snapping it shut on the top-end (non-handle end). Take the brush out as soon as you reach your destination to clean it and give it time to dry before usage."

Use good hygiene.",How to Treat a Yeast Infection on Your Skin," A yeast infection often looks like a rash that has a scaly surface. It will be dark red or pink, with pimple-like bumps spread throughout. Your rash could be small or widespread across a large affected area, so don’t dismiss your redness just because it’s small.Sometimes the patches will look circular, but they can also be more formless.
Check in warm, moist locations on your body.
The center of each patch might become lighter in color or shade than the rest of the patch.;
, A yeast infection on your skin will cause itching and possibly burning, so consider how often you catch yourself scratching the area or adjusting your clothes to help you find relief. If your rash is not itching, then it may not be a yeast infection.Itching alone does not mean that your rash is a yeast infection.
If the infection is on your foot, you may notice that the itching becomes worse after you take off your shoes or socks.

, The red pustules may resemble small pimples and are most likely to occur around the edge of your red patch. Itching makes the pustules worse, and scratching can cause them to ooze., Yeast infections are more likely to occur on skin that is warm and moist, such as the areas under your arms, around your groin, the folds beneath your buttocks, under your breasts, on your feet, or between fingers and toes. Yeast especially thrives in the folds of skin, such as under breasts or around skin folds.Warm, moist places are more likely to be effected by a yeast infection.
Take a closer look at redness near skin folds.

, People who are obese, have diabetes, are taking antibiotics, or have a weakened immune system are more likely to get a yeast infection. Yeast infections are also more common if a person has been experiencing poor hygiene or wears tight clothing.Hot, humid weather is also a risk factor for yeast infections, so consider the environment and season., Your doctor can examine your skin cells under a microscope to give you the most accurate diagnosis, ensuring that you’re on the right treatment plan.Yeast infections can require a prescription anti-fungal to properly heal, which you will need to obtain from a doctor.Your doctor can prescribe you both a topical cream and an oral antifungal.There are many skin disorders that look similar to yeast infections, such as seborrheic dermatitis, psoriasis, contact dermatitis, or Lyme disease. Your doctor will be able to tell you for certain if you have a yeast infection or one of these other conditions.

, Coconut oil and tea tree oil are both commonly available natural antifungals that you can use on your yeast infection. Both coconut oil and tea tree oil kill fungi, including yeast.


To use coconut oil, smooth it onto your skin 3 times a day. You should see reduced redness after about a week of treatment.
To use tea tree oil, apply 2-3 drops of oil onto your infection 3 times a day. Expect the treatment to take a few weeks before you see results.

, You can purchase several topical antifungals over-the-counter that will treat your yeast infection. While you will commonly find them in the department that specializes in footcare, you can treat your yeast infection with some of the same products used to treat athlete’s foot. Try antifungals like clotrimazole, such as Lotrimin AF, or miconazole, which includes Desenex or Neosporin AF. These antifungal brands are widely available at department stores and online retailers.Smoothe the product over the entire affected area.
Reapply twice daily.
You may not see an improvement until 2-4 weeks of treatment have passed.
Consult your product packaging for more information.

, When possible, allow air to circulate around the affected area by wearing loose clothing or leaving the area uncovered. Because of the locations where yeast thrives, it’s not always possible to air it out; however, it’s still possible to take steps to keep the area dry.Avoid hot, humid areas.
Towel off throughout the day.
If you can, allow air to circulate around your skin. Don’t bandage the area, and choose clothing that either leaves the area uncovered or hangs loosely around it.

, Cornstarch and talcum powders soak up moisture, including sweat. They can also act as a soothing agent on your skin, which will improve your comfort level while your rash heals. You can find several options available on the market, or you can choose to use basic cornstarch.Avoid breathing in the powder.
Some people are concerned that using talcum powder around the genital area in women can lead to ovarian cancer, so you may want to minimize your use of the powder if your yeast infection is near your groin., Choose breathable clothing options such as natural fibers or moisture-wicking microfiber. Avoid tight-fitting clothes, which encourage yeast to grow.Try to wear cotton underwear and socks. Cotton may be able to help prevent yeast infections because it is breathable.Avoid layering your clothing on warm days. On cold days, wear more layers so that you can take off heavy clothing when you’re indoors.

, Good hygiene is essential for healing and preventing yeast infections; poor hygiene can actually make your yeast infection worse. In addition to taking regular showers or baths, you can use disposable cleaning cloths to refresh yourself after you get sweaty."

Keep the soap away from water.,
Let the soap air dry.,
Always keep your soap in an appropriate soap dish that allows for drainage.,
Store smaller pieces in a soap-saving pouch.,

Take cooler showers.,
Use small, leftover scraps of soap all the way to the end.,
Consider the ingredients in the soap.,
Let the soap cure.,
Cut the bar of soap into smaller pieces.,
Convert bar soap into liquid soap.",How to Make Soap Last Longer," Nothing will make your soap disintegrate faster than keeping it constantly wet. Water breaks down the consistency of the soap and makes it necessary to replace your soap much more frequently.Avoid storing your soap in a place that is constantly in contact with water, like in the direct stream of the shower.;
, Allowing the air to dry out its moisture will make a bar of soap harder (and therefore less likely to crumble), so that it lasts longer. The more time your soap spends completely dry, the longer it will last.Because of this, the more people who use a bar of soap, the faster it will need to be replaced. More users means less time between showers and more time that the soap will spend wet.

, A wire rack or a self-draining soap dish is best. Soap dishes without drainage keep the moisture longer and will make it harder for your soap to dry out in between uses.Although some of the more fancy plastic and stainless steel soap dish designs are funky and cute, unless they have drainage, they are liable to make your soap soggy.

, Once your soap bar breaks down into smaller pieces that are difficult to use, put those smaller pieces inside a soap-saving pouch. This small bag will work to contain the pieces for reuse, but it also acts as a type of exfoliating washcloth that you can use to bath yourself with the soap remnants inside., Skin is less able to produce and retain lather from soap than other materials. If you use a washcloth instead while you are bathing, the whole process will use less soap overall because the washcloth will create more lather and it the suds it creates will go farther in cleaning your body than simply using your hands alone.Additionally, you can use a loofah to help the soap last longer.

, Hot water will make your bar soap dissolve more quickly and will require more effort to make lather. A cooler shower will help your bar soap last longer by allowing it to maintain its shape and consistency for a longer period of time.Softer water will also help prolong the life of your soap over hard shower water.

, Put small leftover pieces inside a washcloth or a bag sewn from a washcloth, and use the whole thing like a bar of soap.


If you like using soap this way, you can put the entire bar inside the bag from the beginning.

, One factor to consider when trying to make your soap last longer is the type of soap you are buying in the first place. Soaps made out of harder fats and oils will last longer than those made out of softer, liquid oils., Unwrap the bar of soap and allow it to sit out in the open air for 6-8 weeks. This will allow the soap bar and its ingredients to harden more completely so it will last longer once you start using the soap and it starts getting wet regularly.When unwrapping the bar of soap from its packaging, make sure to do so carefully in order to avoid scraping off parts of the soap itself.
Some handcrafted soaps come pre-cured, so this is not a necessary step if you have purchased this type of soap.

, Smaller bars of soap will last longer because you are taking smaller pieces into the shower with you each time. This means that only the smaller piece gets wet during each shower, so the other pieces can remain dry the entire time until you are ready to use them.Cut your soap bars into halves, or even thirds, if possible. Only use one small piece at a time until it is gone.

, Diluting your bar soap into liquid soap will help it stretch farther over many more uses. Follow these simple instructions:Use a grater to scrape pieces off your bar of soap.
Take 1oz. of the grated soap and put it in a jar or other kind of container.
Add 1-2 cups of clean, filtered water and let it sit overnight.
Stir the mixture well before use.

Be positive.,
Be demure.,
Be friendly.",How to Be Cute1," Cute people are always fun to be around, and spread their joy for life to others. A cute person's warmth should be able to fill a room and should be felt from a mile away. If you want to improve your positive nature, there are a few things you can do:



Smile. Do not look like a goof when you smile; just smile like you always do. Be cute and happy, but not over the top!

Laugh heartily. Laugh to feel good, laugh to cheer up others and laugh with others. Make sure not to overdo it. Most people find excessive laughter annoying, not cute.

Have fun. Everyone likes a person who is fun, social, and outgoing! If you're hanging out with people, tell silly jokes, or play fun games.;
, Shyness isn't a bad thing. It gives you a mysterious edge. If you're shy but approachable, people will keep asking you questions and will want to get to know you more. Shy, but sweet and bubbly people are absolutely adorable. Remember that you can maintain a positive vibe and be friendly while being demure at the same time. Here's how to do it:


Talk softly. You should still be able to firmly state your thoughts, but your voice shouldn't be heard from two rooms away. If you talk softly, people will lean in to hear what you have to say, and that will make you even cuter.
Act very innocent. Don't be overly vulgar or engage in conversation about inappropriate topics. Cute people are shocked by some of the more unseemly aspects of life.
Don't dominate a conversation. You can still be smart and state your opinion, but cute people let other people talk too.
Learn to blush. If you blush because you're a bit embarrassed or shocked by a particular topic, you will look very cute.

, Cute people may be a little bit shy, but they are always friendly to the people they know and the new people they meet. Cute people are approachable and people always want to get to know them. Here's how to be friendly while being cute:


Be interested in others. Attractiveness comes from being happy, vivacious and bubbly. This translates to being a person who engages others in conversation, takes an interest in what others say, and shows a genuine concern for the other person's interests.
Take the time to really listen to people. Active listening is a very important part of appearing attractive to others.
Give compliments. Everybody loves someone who sees good in others and makes them feel good. It can be a great conversation starter sometime too.(""Where'd you get your shoes? They're so cute!"") Just make sure you mean it; say it in your normal tone of voice, not a squeaky, overenthusiastic one.

Have a cute face and cute hair.,
Have cute clothes.,
Have cute body language.",How to Be Cute2," Your face will be the first thing people see and it can go a long way in showing people just how cute you really are. If you want to be cute, you should make sure to wash your face and hair as often as you need to, and to always look clean and have a healthy glow. Here are some other things you can do:


Wear minimal makeup. While a little bit of eyeshadow or pink lipstick can help you look cute, you should focus on having a natural appearance. Decide carefully how much or how little makeup you think is appropriate.

Have soft, natural-looking hair. Your hair will look cute if you don't straighten it too much or douse it in oily products. Let your hair dry naturally and fall at your shoulders, or wear it in two loose ponytails.
Wear just a tiny bit of blush. This will make you look even cuter when you blush for real.

, You don't need an entire wardrobe makeover to look cute. Having just a few key cute items and wearing them the right way can help you put together your cute appearance. Here are some tips for wearing cute clothes:


Wear a lot of pastel colors. A light purple, pink, or shade of blue can give you a softer and cuter look.
Wear cute skirts instead of pants - you'll look and feel much nicer and more feminine.
Don't wear high heels. Instead, wear cute clogs or sandals. Paint your toes a cute color.
Have a cute cardigan to wear over a white tank top.

Dress comfortably. Cute people should never look uncomfortable in their clothes. Wear comfortable clothes that fit your style.
Don't dress provocatively. Showing your shoulders or calves off is one thing, but wearing clothes that are too tight and showcase too much of your body will give people the wrong impression. Exposing your bra straps, showing too much cleavage, or wearing skirts that are too short or tight is not cute.

, Cute body language can help you project your cute look. The trick is to not be too forward, but to move in ways that are just plain adorable. Here's how you can have cute body language:


If you're standing, shift your weight from one foot to the other.
If you're sitting, keep your feet together and keep your hands in your lap.
Play with your hair.

Use eye contact. Eye contact is a way of engaging others directly. It shows interest, it shows that you are attempting to bring this person into your sphere and keep him there. But don't forget to look down at the floor or at your feet once in a while to show that you're a little bit shy.
Don't touch the person you're talking to too aggressively, but remember that giving the occasional light touch on the shoulder or knee will be just plain cute.
Cover your mouth when you laugh. When you cover your mouth with your hand as you laugh, it shows a sweet, cute, and slightly timid side of you.

Brush your teeth.,
Floss your teeth.,

Rinse with mouthwash.,
Eat a mint.,
Chew gum after you eat.,
Use a breath strip.,
Drink plenty of water.,
Give up tobacco.,
Stay away from pungent foods.,
Limit your coffee and alcohol intake.",How to Make Your Breath Fresh," In most cases, the easiest way to get fresh breath is to brush your teeth. That will remove any bacteria that may be in your mouth, as well as any food that’s trapped in your teeth. You should brush at least twice a day, but you may want to do it after each meal to keep your breath fresh.When you brush your teeth, do it for at least two minutes to ensure that your teeth and mouth are fully clean.
To make it easier to brush on the go, you may want to keep a travel size toothbrush and tube of toothpaste in your purse, bag, or even the glove compartment in your car.;
, While brushing your teeth can help freshen your breath, it’s a good idea to follow up with some floss. Food, bacteria, and plaque can become trapped between your teeth, and flossing removes them so your breath stays fresh. Floss at least twice a day.Keep a container of floss with your travel toothbrush and paste, so you can floss whenever you feel the need.
For flossing on the go, it may be easier to keep some floss or dental picks in your bag. Floss picks feature a small plastic handle and a single strand of floss suspended across it. A dental pick is a small brush-like pick that can easily fit between your teeth for flossing.
If you feel the need to floss and don’t have any on hand, you can use a toothpick to remove food from between your teeth. You can also run it gently between your teeth to get rid of plaque that may be hanging around., Even if you brush and floss your teeth, foul-smelling bacteria can still linger on your tongue. You can use a tongue scraper to remove it or give your tongue a quick scrub with your toothbrush to make sure that your breath stays fresh.You can find tongue scrapers or cleaners in the same aisle at the drugstore that you find toothbrushes.

, When you’re done brushing and flossing your teeth, it’s a good idea to use mouthwash. It contains antiseptics that help remove bacteria that might cause bad breath and typically has a minty flavor or scent that it imparts to your breath. Swish a small amount of the wash around in your mouth for at least 30 seconds and spit it out in the sink.Consult the instructions on the mouthwash packaging to determine how much to use.
Choose a mouthwash that’s alcohol-free. Alcohol can dry out your mouth, which can lead to bad breath.

, If you need fresh breath in a hurry, a mint is the go-to solution. Any breath mint can temporarily freshen your breath after you’ve had a meal or drink. They come in a variety of flavors, such as peppermint, spearmint, and even cinnamon, so choose your favorite and chew or suck on it to freshen your breath.Opt for sugar-free mints, which are better for your teeth. Those that include Xylitol are the best option because it is a natural sweetener so it doesn't encourage the growth of mouth bacteria like sugar does.
Keep in mind that breath mints are just a temporary fix. If you’ve having chronic bad breath, you may need to use more long term solutions.

, Just like a breath mint, a piece of gum can freshen your breath quickly -- and temporarily. Gum in particular is effective because chewing it generates saliva that can wash away bacteria that might cause bad breath. Pop a piece of your favorite gum in your mouth whenever you’re worried about your breath.Just as with the mints, choose sugar-free gum that contains Xylitol to protect your teeth.

, When you’re on the go, you may not be able to rinse with mouthwash. A breath strip contains many of the same antiseptics that kill bacteria that mouthwash has, but it dissolves instantly on your tongue so you don’t have to spit anything out. Just place the strip in your mouth and wait for to dissolve and freshen your breath.


You can find breath strips in the same aisle as toothpaste and mouthwash at the drugstore.
Breath strips usually come in small containers that are easy to keep in your bag or pocket so you always have one when you need it.

, Residue from the food and drinks that you’ve consumed can linger in your mouth, along with bacteria, and cause bad breath. Drinking water can help wash the residue and bacteria away so your breath stays fresh no matter what you’re eating and drinking.Staying hydrated is also a good idea because having a dry mouth can lead to stale breath.
Gargling with salt water daily can also help make your breath fresh. It helps remove bacteria and mucus from your mouth that may form into stones on the tonsils that often cause bad breath.

, Whether you smoke cigarettes, cigars, or a pipe or chew tobacco, the habit can leave you with stale or bad breath. To freshen your breath -- and improve your overall health -- it’s best to give up tobacco.While you’re working to quit smoking or chewing, be sure to brush, floss, and rinse with mouthwash regularly to keep your breath fresh.

, Some foods are delicious but can leave you with bad breath. Avoid pungent foods, such as garlic, onions, cabbage, and certain spices, that can leave a strong odor behind when you’re concerned about your breath.If you can’t resist your favorite foods, brush, floss, and rinse with mouthwash after you eat a meal.
If you’re unable to brush your teeth after eating, use a mint or piece of gum to cover up the scent of pungent food on your breath.
If you’re out at restaurant and can’t brush your teeth, rinse with mouthwash, and don't have any gum or mints, chew on the piece of parsley used to garnish your plate. Parsley is a natural deodorizer so it can help freshen your breath when you've eaten pungent foods.

, Just like tobacco or pungent foods, coffee and alcohol can leave a strong scent behind in your mouth. When you want fresh breath, try to drink small quantities of these beverages.Brushing, flossing, and rinsing with mouthwash after you drink can help freshen your breath.
A breath mint or piece of gum can mask bad breath from coffee or alcohol too.
Following up each drink of coffee or alcohol with a glass water can also help keep your breath fresh.

Coconut oil: a light oil with antibacterial properties
Jojoba oil: a light oil that's quickly absorbed by the skin
Shea butter: a thick cream for very dry skin
Argan oil: a light oil that fights inflammation;
, Measure out 1 tablespoon of aloe vera gel into the mixing bowl with the oil. If you want to use aloe vera gel directly from the plant, score a piece of aloe vera using a knife. Peel away the sides to reveal the cool gel in the middle of the piece. Squeeze or scrape this into your measuring spoon. Or, buy an aloe very gel that contains few additives.








Some early studies show that aloe vera may be effective in treating dry skin., If you want to add a nice fragrance to your natural moisturizer, add 4 to 5 drops of essential oil to your mixing bowl. Essential oils won't necessarily add moisture to your face, but many have antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and antifungal properties which could help clear up skin irritation. Essential oils with benefits to the skin include:Lavender oil
Geranium oil
Lemongrass oil
Tea tree oil
Chamomile oil

, Once your carrier oil, your aloe vera gel, and your essential oils are in your bowl, whisk the mixture. The moisturizer should be completely smooth and combined so that no oil sits on the top.








You can also use a handheld electric mixer to combine your moisturizer.

, Pour your moisturizer into a clean and sterilized glass jar with an airtight lid. Screw the top on and refrigerate the moisturizer. Since there are no preservatives in the moisturizer, you'll need to use it within a few days.









If you find that you don't go through very much moisturizer, consider making half of the recipe so you aren't throwing it out after several days.

, Scoop out a pea-sized amount of your natural moisturizer using your fingertips. Dot the moisturizer around your face and then use your fingertips to gently rub the moisturizer into your skin.








Try to moisturize after cleansing your face so that your face retains the most moisture.

, Grind a few tablespoons of oatmeal in a blender until you have a powder. In a separate bowl, steep 1 tablespoon of fennel seeds in 1/2 cup of boiling water for 10 minutes. Strain and discard the fennel seeds. Mix together 1 tablespoon of the cooled fennel tea with 1 tablespoon of the ground oatmeal powder and 1 tablespoon of honey.Fennel is great for preventing wrinkles and moisturizing normal skin. Oatmeal can help slough off dry dead skin.

, Mash up half of a ripe avocado in a bowl until it's completely smooth. Stir in 1 tablespoon of plain yogurt and 1 tablespoon of pure honey until they're completely combined with the avocado. The mixture should be a pasty consistency.The natural oils in the avocado can replenish your skin's oils and hydrate your face.

, Take one of your face masks and scoop out a large dollop of the moisturizing mixture. Spread the mixture on your clean face. You can either use your fingers or a clean makeup brush to evenly coat your face with the mask.


Avoid applying a face mask to your eye area and avoid covering your lips.

, Depending on what natural ingredients you used, your mask may begin to dry out quickly or will remain wet and lotion-like. If you're using the oatmeal-fennel mask, leave the mask on your face for 20 minutes. If you're using the avocado mask, let it set for 10 to 15 minutes.Most moisturizing masks won't dry out as much as facial masks designed for oily skin. If your skin seems irritated or begins to dry out, remove the mask immediately.

, Use tepid water to gently wash off the mask using your fingertips. If you're having trouble getting the mask to wash off, you can use a very soft clean cloth that's moistened with warm water. Once you've gotten most of the mask off, rinse your face will cool water.You can apply a moisturizing mask a few times a week to keep your face hydrated.

, If you wake up to dry skin because you live in a dry climate, your skin may need extra moisture in the air.

The hot water can remove your skin's oils and dry out your skin even more.

, Since you can easily control what oils you use when you make your own moisturizers, you can adjust your moisturizer as the season's change. If you find that your natural moisturizer isn't keeping your skin hydrated through a very dry winter, try swapping the oil you're using for a thicker one (like shea or cocoa butter).Remember to switch back to a lighter oil when the seasons change and the temperatures rise.

, Carry an herbal spritzer to spray on your face whenever your skin feels dry. To make a spritzer, mix a few drops of your favorite essential oil into a spray bottle filled with distilled water. Screw on the nozzle and shake to combine the oil.Try using rose, sandalwood or bergamot essential oils which can keep your skin hydrated.

, To keep your skin hydrated, you need to be drinking at least 6 to 8 eight-ounce glasses of water every day. This will help improve the look of your skin and keep it from drying out. Remember that you can also get water from eating fresh fruits and vegetables.If you struggle to remember to drink water, you can also drink herbal teas, juices, and milk.

Read widely.,
Make a plan.,
Start with the question.,
Be mindful.,
Avoid routine.",How to Be Curious1," Choosing something you are already interested in makes it easy to start becoming more curious. Reading is one of the best ways to widen your knowledge base. There are books and articles written on every conceivable topic, from politics, to cooking, to gardening. Think about your interests, and choose one to start learning about. Grab a book and find out more.For example, if you are curious about technology and how it has changed society, there will be a book for you. Try to read publications by various authors so that you are exposed to more than one viewpoint.
Browse the stacks. Head to your local library or bookstore. Spend some time wandering up and down the aisles, picking up anything that looks interesting.
Ask for recommendations. People who work in libraries and bookstores love to talk about books. Ask them to recommend something interesting that they've read recently.
Use social media. Ask your friends and families to tell you their favorite book. Make a list of the ones that sound appealing.
Read the news. There is a lot going on in the world every day. If you take a few minutes to browse some news sites each day, you are sure to come across something that interests you. You could also subscribe to a daily newspaper to get your information.
Enjoy fiction. Fictional tales can spark your curiosity just as much as non-fiction. For example, try reading a crime thriller. You'll be dying to find out how the cops solve the case. It will certainly cause you to start wondering about how the justice system works.;
, Take a tip from Leonardo Da Vinci, who was known for having an amazing array of interests. He famously had a ""to-do"" list that included things to draw, places to go, and people to talk to. Da Vinci had a plan. As you start becoming more curious, make a list of things you would like to do or learn. This will give you inspiration to be more curious about new things.Traveling is a great way to build curiosity. When you go somewhere new, you will naturally want to learn about your new environment. You'll wonder about the foods people eat, where to go for fun, and what you can check out at the local museums. Make a list of places you want to go, and get started.
Keep an idea journal. Every time something sparks your interest or raises a question, jot it down. For example, maybe you see a man in your neighborhood walking his dog every day. If you wonder what dog breed would be right for you, this is a topic you can start looking into.

, Studies show that as adults we are too eager to get to the answer. That means that we spend most of our time as parents, managers, teachers focusing on finding a solution, and we forget to acknowledge the importance of the question. Take time to thoroughly consider and reflect on questions.Questions are what foster the most curiosity. So the next time you are trying to figure out what to buy your partner for Christmas, start with a series of questions. What does he like? What sort of reaction are you hoping for? By consciously asking yourself questions, you will open up your mind to new possibilities and ideas.

, Being mindful means being more aware of your emotions and your surroundings. Try to become more conscious of curiosity. Make an effort to remind yourself to find something to spark your curiosity each day.Scientists say that curiosity is a valid emotion, but one that is often overlooked. If you focus on it more frequently, you will find yourself automatically becoming more curious.
The next time you see a movie, challenge yourself to find something to investigate. If you are watching a movie about James Bond, try to learn something new about martinis. Become curious about cocktails.

, A set routine is considered an active enemy of curiosity. Many people are creatures of habit. In order to stimulate curiosity, change things up a bit. Try to find a different way to do some of your daily tasks.Take a different route to work. Whether you walk or drive, take a different path. Chances are you'll notice something new. Maybe you'll see a new Korean restaurant and you'll be curious abut what kind of food they serve.

Smile shyly at him.,
Flirt with your eyes.,
Use body language.,
Change your wardrobe.,
Play with your hair.",How to Be Coy1," If a new, cute guy has just approached you, smile softly at him. You don't want to seem overly eager or too enthusiastic. This might scare him away. Just grin at him, batting your eyelashes a few times. He'll know that you are at least somewhat interested in him but aren't desperate for his company. This will make you seem approachable without seeming overzealous.


This works on a guy across the room as well. If you see a guy who you want to come talk to you, smile at him across the room, making eye contact. This will send out the signal that you see him and are open to him talking to you.;
, Using your eyes is a great way to attract the attention of a guy. When you first meet a guy, don't stare at him too much and look over too eager for his company. Bat your eyes at him, looking away only to sneak looks back at him. This will let him know you are interested and playful but not desperate. Give him a smoldering look as he says something nice to you. You want him to know that you like what you are seeing when you look at him.If you are on your morning train commute or in the grocery store and you see a guy you like, try making eye contact. When he looks up at you, hold his gaze for a second, but then look away. Then, look back at him and wait for him to look back at you. Once you catch his eye again, smile at him shyly and then look away again. Try to let him know your interested without looking desperate. He will eventually get that you think he's cute and come talk to you.

, Coming off as coy has a lot of do with your body language. When you interact with him, you want to let him know you are interested without telling him. Stand or sit closer to him as you talk. When you want to tell him something, lean closer to him and say it in his ear. Find a way to touch him, such as leaning on him for support while you fix your shoe or try to regain your balance. When you are thinking about an answer to a question, bite your lip or put your finger near your mouth. This will make you look alluring.Being subtle in your body movements toward him does not mean you need to hang all over him. Make subtle advances into his personal space, but make sure you read his signals. You don't want to give off desperate vibes or come on too strong.

, You don't have to wear revealing clothing to attract the guy you have your eye on. When you go out with your friends, wear something feminine that reveals just enough to peak a guy's interest. Wear a shorter skirt with a blouse that covers you or show a bit of cleavage in a modest length dress. This will be alluring without being trashy. You don't want to seem overzealous, easy, or desperate for attention, but you want to catch his eye.Pair these outfit ideas with a nice pair of high heels and a coy, innocent smile. The high heels will make you look amazing and catch his attention. This will make you seem confident but sweet, which will pull his attention to you.

, A great way to come off as coy is to play with your hair. While he is talking, twirl your hair with your fingers. You can also gently run your hands through your hair with a flirty smile on your lips. This makes you look slightly nervous, which will let him know that you are interested in him.Don't do this too much. Subtly act nervous and slightly jittery, so he thinks you are nervous. You don't want him to think that you are bored or uninterested.

Question everything.,
Funnel your questions.,
Keep going.,
Be humble.",How to Be Curious2," The number one thing you can do to become more curious is to ask questions. Try to avoid taking material for granted. For example, if someone tells you, ""Immigration reform is important"", don't just accept that as fact. Ask questions, and figure out why. Then form your own opinion.If you are a student, you should ask questions about the material you learn in school. If your teacher says, ""The Great Gatsby is the great American novel"", don't be afraid to say, ""Why? What makes it great?"".
Ask follow-up questions. Don't accept simple answers. If your landlord raises your rent, ask why. Make sure to get specifics. You'll learn more and be more informed., You can ask questions in one of two ways: begin with a broad question, and then ask gradually more specific follow-up questions. Or, do the opposite; begin with a narrow scope and gradually widen your focus. Both ways are known as ""funneling"" questions, and are great ways to spark new ideas and learn more about the topic.Imagine you are curious about women's rights. You could begin with a broad question, such as ""When did people start thinking about equality between the sexes?"" Then you could gradually get more focused, and ask something such as, ""What was life like for women in Oklahoma during the 1980s?""
To funnel the opposite way, you could reverse the order of those questions. Funneling is useful because it can help you brainstorm new questions to ask.

, Once you have a good question, figure out how to further break it down. Use your original question as a starting point, and then branch out. Thinking of new questions will encourage your creativity, because you'll be coming up with new angels from which to consider the topic. For example, you could start by asking, ""Why do Americans vote along party lines?"" Keep going by asking, ""Does religion influence voting?"" Then you could continue with, ""To what extent does morality influence voting?"" Each question can lead to another. The more questions you ask, the more things you will find to be curious about.

, One of the most important lessons to learn is that there is no shame in not knowing something. The only way to learn is by asking questions and gathering information. Don't ever be afraid to be humble and admit that you don't know something.At work, your boss might ask a question that you don't know the answer to. Instead of trying to pretend that you are knowledgeable, say, ""I don't know. But let me brainstorm some ways to figure out a solution."" Then let your curiosity guide you as you explore new ideas.

Strengthen your relationships.,
Improve your memory.,
Improve your health.",How to Be Curious3," Obviously, you are going to learn a lot of new information with by expanding your curiosity, and that's great. But there are several other benefits to being a more curious person. Research shows that people who are actively curious often have stronger personal relationships.People who are curious tend to have better conversations. You will naturally ask more questions and be more engaged when you are speaking to others.
When you ask a lot of questions, your friends and family members will appreciate the fact that you are interested about their lives. Even a simple curious question such as, ""How did that big project at work turn out?"" can let someone know that you care.

, Being curious can help you retain information. If you are interested in a topic, you are more likely to dig deeper into it. When you are invested in finding the answer, you will be much more likely to remember that information in the future.Studies show that when a brain is actively curious it acts like a vortex. This means that it pulls in as much information as possible, and retains it.

, Being curious literally improves the health of your brain. Curiosity causes your brain to act as a muscle. The more you learn and engage that muscle, the stronger it grows. This can improve all around brain function. People who are more curious are generally happier. Asking questions and learning new things causes your mood to be elevated.
Being happier can cause positive benefits for your physical health. Happier people typically have lower blood pressure and a decreased risk for strokes and heart attacks.

Don't be too available.,
Avoid oversharing.,
Be playful.,
Leave him wanting more.",How to Be Coy2," Even if he is your boyfriend, you don't want to seem like you have no life outside your relationship. When he asks you to hang out, don't accept his terms every time he asks. Refuse the times or days every so often, telling him you have plans with your friends or are too busy. Try to reschedule for another time, one that works for both of you. That way, he knows you have a life outside of him but lets him know that you are still interested.This can be applied to electronic means of communication as well. In the current age of social media and electronics, it is easier than ever to get in touch with each other. Don't jump to respond every time he texts, calls, or tweets you. Make him work a little for your attention, which will make you seem more alluring and interesting., When you are dating someone, you want to get to know them. However, try to avoid oversharing about your life early on in your relationship. Don't lie or evade direct questions, but be coy about your answers, leaving him guessing about what else there is to know about you. Leave a little mystery for later in your relationship. You want to keep his attention by making him chase you, not annoyed because you talk too much.If you are talking about your past, don't divulge every little detail about your life. He doesn't need to know about each embarrassing moment you had at school dances or information about each of your exes. You can also save the family history lessons for when you are farther along in your relationship. You want him to know you, not be able to write your family history.

, Being playful is a great way to coyly flirt with your boyfriend. Even though you are together, flirting with him keeps your relationship fresh and exciting. Try to giggle at him when he tells a joke. While you and he are talking, playfully push him if he says something outrageous. You can be playful with the way you talk to him as well. Slip subtle, sexy compliments to him while you're in public, like: ""You look great tonight. I wish we were not in a room full of people so I could show you how great."" It's subtle enough to be coy and lets him know that he is on your mind.

, Even if you've been dating for a long time, you always want to leave your boyfriend wanting more. Flirt with him all throughout your date, but leave him right after dinner is over. During your date, call attention to your body. Slowly rub your hand along your neck while you talk or bite your lip while you're looking over the menu at dinner. While you eat, gently nudge his foot under the table with yours, but pretend you don't notice. At the end of the date, hug him tightly, running your hands up and down his back. When he goes in to kiss you, lean to his ear and whisper ""I had a great time."" before turning around to leave. This will drive him crazy and make him want you more.

Stay aloof.,
Be private.,
Avoid being the center of attention.,
Listen.",How to Be Coy3," When you are in a group of people, don't jump into the conversation right away. Wait until you are introduced, then you can join the conversation a little bit at a time. You still don't want to be over exuberant, just talk to one or two people at a time. Make sure your body language doesn't seem closed off. You want to seem open to intimate conversation but not overly interested in every detail of each conversation.


This is true for the kinds of activities you undertake as well. Avoid loud parties or large clubs. Being coy means hanging on the sidelines, trying not to be noticed. You want instead to attend small, intimate gatherings., Whether it is at work with your colleagues or with people you don't know, you should keep to yourself. Don't divulge unnecessary information to people at work or tell them about your personal problems. If you are around your closest friends, feel free to talk about how your boyfriend dumped you or the problems you are having house training your new puppy. If you just met someone, however, keep your distance and keep your thoughts and feelings to yourself. You want to feel out how people are and how they act in order to know what kind of person they are before you try to instigate a friendship.You should also try to avoid over sharing when asked questions. You don't want to divulge information about yourself to random people. Once you get to know someone, then you can start telling them more intimate details about yourself.

, When you are trying to be coy, you don't want to be the center of attention. This goes for attitude and dress. You shouldn't wear clothes that try to grab the attention of those around you or put you in the center of the action. It is harder to make close friendships if you are constantly surrounded by tons of people. If you try to stick to the sidelines, those people that do notice you will be more likely to be interested in getting to know you for who you are., If you are typically on the outskirts, listen to those around you. Take in the information that others divulge Try to ease into new relationships, listening to what they say in order to get to know them better. Once they become more than just an acquaintance, you can open up around them and limit your coy, shy behavior when they are around."

Maybe you're mad at your roommate and want to tell her she's too messy, or you want to ask your best friend to stop calling you so much. Well, before you have a conversation about how you really feel, you need to think about how the other person would react, and to put yourself in their frame of mind. While you shouldn't have to change what you want to say completely to suit another person's needs, thinking of the situation from the other person's perspective can help you best articulate what you want to say while minimizing hurt feelings.


Maybe your roommate is really messy, but she's also the one who does all of the grocery shopping. You should find a way to compliment her good qualities as well as her bad ones so she doesn't get defensive or feel like you don't appreciate her as a roommate.
Maybe your best friend is calling a lot because she's been lonely ever since her boyfriend broke up with her. You can still say what you want to say, but be considerate of her feelings and try to think of it from her perspective before you proceed.;
, Part of being considerate is knowing what people will need before they even realize it themselves. If you're going out for lunch with your coworkers, put down enough napkins for everybody. If you're going to the beach with some friends, bring an extra umbrella for them. If you know your husband is going to have a late night at the office, leave some dinner waiting for him in the fridge. Keep an eye out for what people need, even before they realize it themselves, in order to be a truly considerate person.


People will be grateful and impressed by your thoughtfulness.
You shouldn't do this because you want something in exchange, but because you genuinely want to help people.

, A lot of people tend not to think of their surroundings when they're out and about in public. The next time you're out, think about how what you're doing may be perceived by other people, and how they would react. You may think that loudly talking to your best friend on the phone at a coffee shop where everyone else is trying to study is inoffensive, when in reality, you may be driving the people around you crazy. Here are some other ways to make sure you're being considerate in public:


Try to keep your voice at a normal level, whether you're on the phone or talking to friends
Avoid taking up too much space
If you're in class, avoid unwrapping something loudly or shuffling around so much that you cause a distraction
Look where you're going instead of texting and walking

, Before you ask your friends or people you know to pony up for something, you should consider their financial situation as much as you can. If your friend is broke, don't suggest that you go out for dinner at the fanciest place in town — unless it's your treat. You may not think about this if your finances are settled, but you don't want to put other people in an uncomfortable situation because they can't afford to pay. Here are some ways to make sure you're being considerate of other people's financial situations:


If you're throwing a wedding, think about your guests. Can your bridesmaids really afford $200 dresses, or a trip to a bachelorette party in Tahiti? Can your guests really pay to fly across the country to celebrate you? Of course, it should be your event, but you should make sure that the people involved don't have to break their bank account to participate.
If you're hanging out with people who don't have a lot of money, find cheaper things to do, like going to happy hour or a dive bar or watching a fun movie instead of going clubbing or going to the theatre. Don't embarrass people by making them admit that they can't afford to do things.

, Part of being considerate is knowing the best time that you should say something. The most innocuous comment can come off as offensive if you say it at the wrong time. Make sure that the person or people you are talking to are in the right frame of mind to be receptive to your comment, and that you're not interrupting anything or causing complications with what you're saying. Here are some ideas for choosing your timing:


For example, maybe you have some great news to share, like you recently got engaged. This news can be perfect for brunch with your friends, but if your coworker is talking about his mother's funeral, then you should absolutely hold off on your big news.
On the other hand, if you have some bad news to deliver, make sure the person is in the right frame of mind as well. If your friend is gushing about her pregnancy, it's not the time to talk about how you just got dumped.
If you have to give negative feedback to a coworker, make sure you to it when the person isn't caught off guard. Set up a time to talk to the person instead of casually giving negative feedback when the person least expects it.

, If you want to be considerate, then you have to know that the words you use are just as important as the message you're trying to send. If you want people to be receptive and to not feel bad, then you have to carefully think of the words you'll use when you're speaking. Whether you're finding a delicate way to give negative feedback or even finding the right way to praise somebody, it's important to remember that words do matter. Here are some things to consider as you choose your words:


Even if you're giving negative feedback, you can find a delicate way to phrase it. You can tell a coworker he ""could be more efficient"" instead of saying he's ""slow"" or you can tell a needy best friend that you feel overwhelmed by her instead of saying she is ""clingy"" or ""needy.""
You can also make your message sound less offensive if you don't directly use the word ""you"" all the time. For example, instead of telling your boyfriend, ""You are so paranoid,"" you can say, ""I worry about the trust issues in our relationship."" This still gets the message across without making your boyfriend feel like you're pointing a finger at him.

, Another thing inconsiderate people tend to do is to talk on and on without realizing that other people couldn't care less. It's one thing if you have a great story to tell, but if you're always the person who is talking and talking and don't let other people have their say, then it's definitely not considerate. The next time you talk in a group or individual setting, be aware of how much you're talking as opposed to everyone else. Make sure you give other people a chance to talk, ask how they are doing, and how they're feeling. This is very considerate.


If you have a quick chat with a friend in the halls or at lunch, make sure you both have time to say what's up. If you just tell your friend all about your day and what you're doing next weekend and then say goodbye, that's not very considerate.
You should also be considerate when you think about the subject you're discussing. Would your co-workers really want to hear about your drama with your best friend they've never met? Or would your best friend really want to hear a long discussion about the meeting you had at work?

, It's also considerate to be able to thank people truly and honestly for something they have done for you. This could be something big, like letting you crash with them for three weeks while you looked for an apartment, or something smaller, like picking up coffee for you. No matter how small the deed, it's important to thank people so that they know that you appreciate them, and understand that you don't just expect people to do nice things for you. Make eye contact and give the person 100% of your attention when you say thank you so that you show that you truly mean it.


If you were an extended house guest at a friend's house or a friend or person did something really nice for you, send or give him or her a bottle of wine or a gift basket to show that you really care. Sometimes, just saying ""Thanks!"" isn't enough.
Get in the habit of writing thank-you cards to show your appreciation. This is a thoughtful and oft-forgotten gesture.
You can also go beyond just saying ""thank you"" and explain how much the person's action meant to you. For example, you can say something like, ""Jackie, thank you so much for cooking dinner for me the other night. I was so stressed out with work that day, and you really helped calm me down.""

, Even considerate people can have flaws. If you've made a mistake, whether you've truly hurt someone or accidentally run into someone, you should make sure to apologize for your actions. Don't just say ""Sorry"" and look away like you couldn't care less; make a point of making eye contact, telling the person how sorry you really are, and mentioning that it won't happen again. Taking accountability for something is much more considerate than brushing it under the rug because you hope it'll just go away on its own. Though apologizing can be unpleasant, the other person will appreciate it.


People who are considerate known when to apologize because they're aware when they've hurt someone's feelings, even if they didn't mean to do it. If you've hurt someone, don't say something like, ""I'm sorry you felt bad when I..."" This kind of language actually blames the other person and avoids responsibility.

, Having tact is an important part of being considerate. Being tactful means knowing how to make a point without offending the people around you; it doesn't mean that you have to lie to get your point across. To have tact, you have to know how to give feedback or criticism in a kind, thoughtful way that gets the message across without causing any hurt feelings. You also have to be an active listener and be aware of the people around you so you can make sure they respond in a favorable way.


If you end up offending people, then they'll be much less receptive to your criticism. Giving information in a kinder way will make people feel better and will make them more likely to change; it's a win-win situation.
For example, if you want to tell your co-worker that he has been working slowly, you can say something like, ""I think your projects are always so detail-oriented and thorough. However, I'm wondering if there's a way that you can maintain the quality of your work while boosting your efficiency a bit.""

, Being considerate means recognizing when someone would need your help before they even ask for it. This can be anything from opening a door for a person on crutches to picking up lunch for your best friend when she's having a stressful day cramming for an exam. As long as you don't give help to people who really don't want it, you will be acting considerate. Keep an eye out for situations, big or small, when you could really help a person out. Always be observant to see if someone needs something, even if he or she is afraid to ask for it. Here are some examples of ways to be considerate:


Hold doors open for people
Pull out chairs for people
Make room for people who sit next to you
Let older people take your seat if you're on a bus or a train
Pick up coffee for a fellow coworker if you're going on a coffee run
Help your parents out by doing extra chores when they are clearly overwhelmed
Run an errand for a significant other or roommate

, Another part of being considerate is demonstrating good manners. If you want to be considerate of others, then you can't be rude, loud, or annoying in social situations. You don't have to be prince charming, but you should be able to have basic good manners so that the people around you feel comfortable and cared for. Whether you're hanging out with your friends or hanging out at your Grandma's 80th birthday party, you should demonstrate good manners, even if the meaning of ""good manners"" changes slightly depending on your audience. Here are some ways to have good manners:


Avoid cursing or being overly vulgar
If you burp, excuse yourself
Put a napkin on your lap when you eat and avoid getting food all over yourself
Don't loudly slurp your drink
Make room for people on the sidewalk
Avoid gross or inappropriate topics in front of the wrong audience

, Another way to be considerate is to share with others. Maybe you brought a delicious box of your mother's cookies to lunch and can't wait to devour them all, but you should ask your coworkers if they want any. Maybe you brought some awesome stickers to school that you can't wait to use to decorate your notebook. Well, ask your friends if they want in on the fun! You can also share your clothes, your space, or something else that means something to you with the people around you. Remember that, if you're sharing something you don't really care about, then it's not really sharing.


Sharing isn't just for little kids and siblings. It's an important quality of a considerate person at any age.

, One of the most inconsiderate things you can do is to act like your time is more important than someone else's. You may not be doing this intentionally, but if you show up late — especially if you make a habit of it — then this is sending people the message that you don't really care about their time. Whether you show up five minutes late to class, half an hour late to work, or you show up forty-five minutes late to meeting a friend for lunch, this is definitely going to make the other person feel annoyed and like you don't care about his or her time.


Of course, if you're going to a party or an event with a lot of people, then showing up exactly on time may not matter — in fact, getting to a party the second it starts can actually be a bit awkward. But if it's you keeping another person or two waiting, then that is just plain inconsiderate.
If you know that you're going to be late, don't lie about your location (""I'm just a few blocks away!"") because you think that'll make it better. Be honest about the fact that you're running 10 or 15 minutes late.

, This is another part of being considerate. Instead of just being considerate of the people you know and love, you can also be considerate of complete strangers, especially those who could use a bit of attention. You can hold doors for people, put some money in the tip jar at your local coffee house, give a compliment to a person you pass on the street, give your parking ticket with an hour left over on it to a person who just entered the parking lot, or help carry an old lady's groceries to her car.


Making a habit of looking for opportunities when you can help people will make you a more considerate person.
Of course, you have to make sure the person truly welcomes the random act of kindness. You don't want to overwhelm someone who wants to be left alone.

, It's important to keep your space clean, whether you want to be a considerate house guest, a considerate roommate or family member, or just a considerate human being. If you live by yourself, then it's a good idea to maintain a clean space anyway, but you should be especially considerate of other people around you. Make your bed, throw out your trash, do your dishes, and don't leave other people to do it for you. This is an important part of being considerate at any age.


People who are inconsiderate expect the world to revolve around them, and expect people to clean up their trash for them. This shows that they think they are more important than other people and expect that others will act accordingly. You don't want to be this person.

Don't smile often.,
Master the icy glare.,
Use cool body language.,
Speak in an even tone.,
Don't talk about yourself.,
Don't ask a lot of questions.,
Never repeat yourself.,
Be willing to hurt someone's feelings.,
Be fiercely competitive.,
Be extremely practical and realistic.,
Don't bother helping.,
Be negative.,
Be careful who you trust.,
Be cold in public.,
Be cold when it helps you excel.,
Don't be cold to your family and friends.,
Beware getting a reputation for being cold.",How to Be Cold," Having a smile on your face looks inviting and warm, drawing people to you. It's more difficult to read someone's face when it has a serious expression. If you want to be cold, you should smile very rarely. You want people to look at you and wonder what you're thinking. Be generally expressionless and hard to read.


When you do smile, keep it contained - don't break into a wide open grin. Keep your smile small and mysterious. Flash it every once in a while to keep people guessing what's going on in that head of yours.
Men might benefit more than women from smiling less, as studies show that smiling men are less attractive to women.;
, When someone crosses you, look them straight in the eye and crinkle your brow as if you are confused and perturbed by their behavior. Purse your lips ever so slightly to show your cool disdain. Lift your chin a little and look down past your nose. Don't let yourself look outright angry or upset. You want your expression to stay controlled, distant and cold as ice.

, Mastering the art of body language is key when it comes to being cold. Maintain an air of mystery and control by avoiding speaking when you can use a more subtle technique to communicate.



Have excellent posture; stand up straighter than those around you.
Don't be fidgety with your hands and feet. Don't play with your hair.
When someone says something that annoys you, be expressionless and turn slightly away. Stop making eye contact.
Shake hands lightly instead of hugging.
Stiffen slightly when someone touches you.

, When you do speak, don't let your voice rise and fall dramatically. Keep a cool, calm, even tone, even if you're feeling wildly happy or angry inside. Don't lose yourself in laughter or tears; keep it together and try not to convey too much emotion. Be aloof and detached whenever you're talking to someone., Keep some distance from those around you by not saying too much about your thoughts, feelings, habits and personal life. People who are cold don't tend to share in this way. Say only what you need to say, and avoid telling stories or jokes that might reveal too much.

, Asking other people questions implies that you care about them, and if your goal is to be cold, you want to have the opposite effect. You can exchange a few polite pleasantries, but avoid expressing too much interest. Make it seem like you're preoccupied with your own brilliant thoughts and ideas to discuss the trivialities of other people's lives.

, If someone does not hear you the first time it's their own fault. You shouldn't have to repeat anything to anyone.

, When you don't smile, ask people questions, or express any positive emotions, people's feelings are almost guaranteed to get hurt. That's the price you'll have to pay for being cold. Resist the urge to apologize or comfort people when you realize they're offended or upset.


If someone comes to you and asks why you were rude, gaze at him or her coolly and say you're not sure what they're talking about.
If someone expresses sadness or anger, say ""I'm sorry you were offended,"" then turn around and go about your day. Using this non-apology is sure to show the other person that you are quite cold.
Beware giving too many people the cold shoulder. Studies show that people who ostracize others may feel as sad as the person being ostracized., Work hard to be the best at everything you do, even if it means you aren't demonstrating good teamwork skills. Be ready with the smartest, quickest answers in your classes. Be relentless on the playing field during soccer practice. Excel at your job, even if others might look less capable as a consequence.

, When other people are excited about a big tournament coming up, mention it's just a game, and really a waste of people's time. Don't express excitement over holidays and birthdays.

, So the lady down the street drops all her groceries? Cross the street and look away, or walk right by her. If the first thing you think when someone asks you for help is, ""Darn, why do I have to help?"" Don't help. Don't second guess yourself, and don't let guilt affect your behavior. As a cold person, empathy and compassion aren't your forte., For cold people, the glass is always half empty. Imagine you are walking on the sidewalk when a car rushes by and sprays dirty rainwater on you. What do you say? Not ""Darn, my favorite shirt"" or ""Why me?"" No, the correct answer is 'C': glare murderously and say ""I hope you crash and die.""


Be critical of those around you. Don't give out compliments. If someone asks you if you like what they're wearing, avert your eyes and change the subject., Behaving coldly toward people is going to make you some enemies. As a consequence, there will be very few people you can trust. The only people you can really trust will be those who understand that you're not cold at heart.

, It's usually pretty safe to be cold in a public setting. You might cause a few strangers to feel miffed, but that can be a good thing - especially if the strangers were trying to hit on you or get something from you. Being cold in public probably won't hurt your reputation or cause any long-term harm.


That said, if you see someone in need of real help, lose your cold demeanor and lend a hand. Think about what you'd want someone to do for you in the same situation.

, There are times when being cold can help you win an argument, close a business deal, or score the winning point. There's nothing wrong with having a tough, cold attitude when it comes to getting ahead - unless you're taking it so far that you do real damage to another person. It's important to think through the consequences of your attitude and actions.

, The people who take care of you and are warm to you deserve the same in return. Being cold to family and friends will only make you feel isolated. After years of being treated coldly, it's likely that no one but your parents will still want to give you the time of day.

, Being cold can have its benefits, but in the end, those who are generous, warm and charming attract the most friends. Since having good friends leads to lifelong happiness,you might want to consider cultivating these personality traits once you've experienced what it's like to be cold. Don't worry, you can still flash your icy side when the situation calls for it.

Wash your face daily.,
Drink water or tea.,
Eat your fruits and vegetables.,
Use coconut oil.,
Wash your hair or keep it out of your face.,
Exercise!,
Use last minute fixes.,
Be prepared to use make-up.,
Don't touch your face.,
Be beautiful on the inside.",How to Prevent and Treat Impurities," It is one of the oldest tricks in the book, but you can bet it works! At first, when you use your daily cleanser or soap for the first time, you will see drastic changes. Gradually, it may become less effective for your skin. That's why you have to change up your soap every once in a while. Wash it day and night, and switch the soaps up daily or every once in 3 days to have an over all effect. in fact, change your routine every once in a while. Use cleansers for a bit, then maybe soap after a while. Scrub your face with a facial scrub, use a washcloth, or after washing thoroughly, your hands.;
, Yes I know, water. But it works. Without water, you will never be able to get completely pure skin. Drink 8 cups a day for the overall, blissfully natural look. Water can help with evening and balancing out all the excess oil in your skin, or lack of it, to replace it with moisturized, clear skin. And then there's herbal tea. The more sought out approach to clear your skin. It will also help you detox your system and boost energy levels and more. So water or tea, it's up to you. I prefer mine cold, but you may go for hot tea. Which works better, is unclear to me.

, Especially fruits with citrus, like oranges, lemons, limes, grapefruit, apples, and pineapple. Go for the more healthy approach, and opt away from salty, oily, greasy foods. You can have them once in a while, but you know your limits. It also helps to make a lifestyle change, perhaps even change your diet while you are at it! You will lose unnecessary weight and have clear skin. Try for more organic foods while you are at it.

, This works so well. But here's what you have to do. Every night, get as much as you can and slather it on your face. Go to sleep, preferably with a fan on, for reasons unexplained.Do not wipe any of it off on your sheets. If you stay up long enough, the moisture will lock in (and the benefits, which clear and prevent impurities) and your face will feel pleasantly different. It will have a cold, moisturized effect, and when you wake up, most of the impurities will be gone, and wherever you put coconut oil, there will be no new problems! This also helps with scars,and can help then fade away and become less painful.

, TO cover it up, you could use bangs, but it's better this way. Wash it every day to get rid of oils that cause skin issues with a good, moisturizing shampoo. Keep it out of your face with a headband or bobby pins. It will encourage T-Zone clarity and will help you look more sophisticated and smart. Curly hair does contain somewhat more oil in certain occasions, but treat your hair well, and it won't be a problem at all.

, Going outside and running around the neighborhood, enough to start sweating a bit, can help. When you sweat, you let out toxins and oils to help promote healthy skin. But make sure that when you come back in, that you drink plenty of water (and ice-cold water does have a lot of benefits) and eat something healthy afterward.

, Getting ready for a big day when all of a sudden, there is your latest blemish? We all may have days like that (I haven't yet, but still) so it is essential for you to know these last minute remedies... Use toothpaste. A dab on any impurities or surrounding areas should help reduce the size just a little, and sometimes, put a tiny amount on it, and put foundation on top. Or you could just use concealer. Use almond oil or extract. Warning: It will burn, so put a tiny bit by dabbing some onto a tissue and place it on the blemishes. Also, use coconut oil. Just dab a little, leave it on, and wait to see the results.

, Concealer and foundation work great. Just try not to put it on with your hands. Use a make-up brush or a cotton swab, put some on, and let it dry. Make sure you find one that fits your skin tone, or only use a scanty amount.

, This will add excess oils. However, whenever you would really like to, wash your hands thoroughly for 30 seconds, or until ready, and then it is OK. For some of you, like me, it is really hard not to, so if you REALLY can't stand it, touch the edges of your facial bone or under your chin so problems do not occur so visibly! When cleaning your face, it can be OK, but still, wash your hands for a while before trying any of these remedies.

, This is the most important thing ever. Be kind, help others when you can, and never, ever make fun of anybody for the way they look, for one day, you may be in the same definition. Remember that no matter what, you are beautiful on the inside and the outside. No one is ugly. Make your mark in the world. Take this step to hard.

Live off the grid.",How to Be Country," One skill you'll definitely need to master if you want to embrace a country lifestyle is the ability to start a fire. Use this skill when camping or cooking with a wood stove.Gather kindling. You can use small, thin pieces of dry wood as kindling, or you can use other flammable objects like dryer lint.
Place the kindling in a pile and light it on fire. You can use a match or lighter, or you can try lighting the fire with a more basic method. For instance, the sparks created by striking flint and steel together can be enough to catch the kindling on fire.
As the fire starts burning, add small pieces of firewood to continue building and maintaining the flames.;
, Fishing is a classic recreational activity in the country. Even if you can't teach yourself to love it, learning the skill can come in handy in case any of your country friends ask you to tag along on their next fishing trip.


Do some research and find out where popular fishing sites are located in your area. If possible, ask someone who already knows how to fish to teach you since learning will be much easier that way.
Make sure you have the basic gear, too. This includes a fishing license, fishing rod, fishing line, and bait.

, Gardening is fairly popular in suburbs and cities, but it's even more common in the country. When creating a country garden, focus on practical plants like fruits and vegetables instead of ornamental flowers.


If you don't actually live in the country and have limited space to work with, consider growing a few easy plants in containers. Herbs are a good choice, but if you have a little yard or patio space, try something like tomatoes or peppers.
Regardless of how much space you have, starting small is a good idea. Gardening can be challenging work for somehow who has never done it before, and small gardens are less likely to seem overwhelming.

, As convenient as TV dinners and boxed meals can be, learning to cook from scratch is more traditional and conducive to a country way of living.


Cooking from scratch also tends to result in healthier, more nutritional meals.
If the idea of cooking from scratch seems intimidating, start small by focusing on a few simple meals. Specifically look for cookbooks aimed at beginners and ask for help from more experienced cooks when you work on your first few meals.

, Knowing how to can food is another useful country skill, and it's one that makes a lot of sense once you start maintaining a garden and learning how to cook.


Pressure canning can be difficult to learn, so when you're starting out, consider focusing on water bath canning instead.
If you're unable to can food, you can also learn to preserve some foods by freezing or dehydrating them.
Start with simple items like fresh produce, jams, or pickles. Once you grow comfortable with the process, you can gradually work on more challenging options.

, If you plan on actually spending time in the country, learning how to drive vehicles with stick or manual transmission can open up more possibilities.


This is especially important if you plan on helping out at a farm. Most farm equipment will have manual transmission, including the majority of tractors and lawn mowers.
If possible, consider practicing driving stick shift in a car before attempting to operate heavy farm machinery. You may still have some trouble at the beginning, but if you've driven a car with automatic transmission already, you might find yourself more comfortable practicing manual transmission in a car than in an unfamiliar type of vehicle.

, This skill may not be a necessary one if you're trying to be country while living in an urban or suburban setting, but it's a good one to know if you plan on spending time in the countryside. Learning how to hook up a trailer will make it easier to use cattle trailers, travel trailers, and other similar devices.


The two basic trailer hook-up types are gooseneck and ball hitches, the latter of which is easier to learn.
You'll need to raise the coupler before backing the vehicle up to meet it. Once the two are lined up, lower the coupler onto the ball and lock it in place. After hooking up the trailer, you'll need to crisscross the safety chains under the coupler and hook them into the holes of the receiver.

, Find a hobby that interests you and practice it regularly. Look at hobbies that require the use of conventional skills that have gone out of fashion in a fast-paced, digital world.


If you're interested in something serene, you might consider quilting, sewing, or knitting.
For something a little more active, consider bee keeping or carpentry.

, Much of the country life is spent outdoors. To really be country, you'll need to stop spending all your time indoors and start spending more of it outside.If you're not sure where to start, try doing some simple outdoor activities. Go for a walk. Pack a picnic basket and eat at a nearby park.
Even if you live in a big city, you can still apply this principle to your own surroundings. You might not be able to hike through the woods, but you can still take a walk around the neighborhood.

, With all the time you'll be spending outdoors, you should expect to get very dirty at times. Routine bathing is just as important in the country as it is in the city, but you can't be afraid to get dirty in between baths.


For that matter, you'll probably get sweaty and greasy at times, too, especially if you spend time pursuing common country hobbies or working on a farm. Living in the country involves plenty of hard work, so these things are to be anticipated.

, Embracing nature partially means appreciating the animal life you'll find there. Consider spending some time watching and caring for the local wildlife.


You might set up bird feeders and squirrel feeders in your backyard. If that isn't an option, you can still nurture some appreciation for wildlife by engaging in bird watching or other forms of animal watching.

, If you really love animals, consider raising a few pets. Dogs and cats can be found in the countryside as much as they can be found anywhere else, but you could also try raising something a little less common, like a hutch of rabbits.


If you have the time and space for it—and if zoning regulations don't prohibit it—you might also want to consider raising chickens or ducks. With proper care, you may also be able to collect and use the eggs produced by these birds.

, Insects are a part of nature; this is an undeniable fact of life. You don't have to love the bugs you run across, but you should at least try to remain calm and avoid panicking every time you see one.


That being said, you should also familiarize yourself with potentially dangerous insects and similar pests. Black widows, brown recluses, and ticks are some of the most common insect hazards you'll need to watch out for. You should also keep a wary eye out for venomous snakes.

, As long as the weather is sunny and dry, try hanging your freshly washed clothes and linens on a clothesline instead of tossing them into a dryer.


Idyllic visions of country living can include many images, and a fully loaded clothesline is frequently among them. In addition to be ""country"" in style, drying your clothes outside is also cost-effective.
If you are unable to hang a clothesline due to space or neighborhood regulations, consider drying your clothes on a drying rack by your living room windows, on a balcony, or on a patio.

, Ponds are another big element featured in the conventional image of country life. If you don't have a nearby pond you can travel to and enjoy, consider building a small pond in your own backyard.


Choose a large enough area in your backyard and dig out the dimensions of your pond. For backyard ponds, you'll need to lay out a pond liner, then install a skimmer and filter. Once everything has been set up, you can fill the pond with water and appropriate plants and animals.

, Country life goes hand-in-hand with slowing down and appreciating the silent stillness. Life may throw plenty of busy, noisy demands your way, but you should try to slow down every now and focus simply on living in the moment.Step away and spend at least 20 to 30 minutes in quiet isolation. Turn off your phone and put away your computer. If possible, sit somewhere with a good view of the world outside your home. Spend time reflecting on the blessings in your life and the vastness of nature.

, You don't need to live completely off the grid to be country, but the two different lifestyles do have a lot in common.


Minimize the amount of electricity you use. Handle digital devices less and opt for analog alternatives.
Teach yourself some basic survival skills, like outdoor cooking, gardening, and fishing/hunting. Even if you don't plan on using these skills in your everyday life, you should try to perfect them well enough to live off them if the need ever arose.

Make gestures and expressions.,
Avoid distracting mannerisms.,
Practice good posture.,
Don’t lean on things.,
Make eye contact.",How to Be Convincing1," Moving your hands and making facial expressions while you speak can make you seem confident and convincing. For instance, when you say something positive, smile a bit and open your eyes a little wider. If you don’t move at all while you are speaking, people might become suspicious. On the other hand, it is important to not to overdo it. For instance:You can laugh a little if you say something funny, but don’t slap the table and act like its the most hilarious thing you’ve ever heard.
Likewise, if you are trying to convince your parents to increase your allowance, don’t start breaking down and crying. Instead, calmly present them with real reasons that you think you need more money.;
, Certain gesture and actions can signal that you are nervous. While you are talking to someone, you will have to be conscious of your actions and make sure that you are not doing things like:Twitching
Swaying
Pacing
Tapping
Licking your lips
Playing with your hair.

, Standing up straight while you speak radiates confidence and makes you seem more convincing. However, don’t stiffen up. Just keep your head up, your back straight, and your feet slightly apart., Propping yourself against a table or something else while you speak can suggest nervousness. On the other hand, standing firmly signals believability. If you are speaking to someone and don’t know what to do with your hands, try propping them slightly on your hips. This posture can seem confident, and will keep you from leaning on something else., Looking someone in the eye while you speak is one of the easiest ways to seem convincing. However, don’t open your eyes too wide. You should also break the eye contact every now and then. Remember that you are trying to bond with someone, not win a staring contest.Even when you are speaking to large audiences, it is important to make eye contact. Find a few audience members that you can see clearly, and take turns looking them in the eye. Periodically look up to scan the rest of the audience.Remember that in certain cultures, it is considered rude or inappropriate to look someone in the eye while talking.

Remain authoritative and firm.,
Refuse to reminisce or wallow in sentimentality.,
Be taciturn.,
Remind yourself of the reasons you have decided the relationship must end.,
Show no signs of lingering affection.,
Buy a wall calendar.,
Welcome a new beginning.",How to Be Cold Hearted," Do not accept any apologies. One of the most important steps to becoming cold-hearted is to remain firm in your decision to do so. There can be no room for ambivalence. In order to become and remain a cold-hearted individual one must live with a slightly cynical disposition.If he does apologize, you cannot believe what he says. You must view each and every attempt at reconciliation as the perpetrator’s desire to put you back into a position to hurt you again. If possible do not accept phone calls, emails, Facebook messages, etc. If you give him a chance to explain himself, your resolve will be weakened. You will give him the opportunity to regain your trust and once he has it you will be betrayed, thus the cycle of abuse will continue.;
, Do not reflect on the ""good times"" you might have shared.If you wish to be cold-hearted one of the worst things you could do is recall good memories. Doing such a thing will tempt you to give whoever has hurt you another chance. You will think of the laughs you shared; the gentle hugs; the tender kisses and you will be tempted to put your hurt pride aside. You’d be wrong to do so. Remember, the person hurting you is counting on you to become sentimental and he will use this to his advantage. If you find yourself able to do so, delete all texts, emails, etc. Rid yourself of anything that reminds you of him (pictures, shirts, gifts, etc). Remind yourself that if things were so good, you wouldn’t be reading this article to begin with.

, Give short, meaningless replies such as I don't know,What do you want, or I don't have time. Then walk away.


Or, pretend not to notice or hear them.

, When you become weak you will find that anger is a very good motivator. When times get tough, and you feel tempted to answer his calls, get angry. Get enraged. Remind yourself about all the times you felt mistreated by him; all the times you needed him and he wasn’t there for you. (It’s important to get angry now so that you have less baggage later so that you do not take this anger out on the next guy.)

, Do not wear his shirts or any gifts he gave you. Don’t even glance his way. If you can, try not to talk about him. To be cold-hearted, you must appear as if you do not care about him at all. If he asks why you don’t answer his texts tell him that you’re busy. If he compliments you, brush him off. Be callous, curt and distant. Make yourself seem different than the woman he knew. Doing so will make him feel uncertain. The more uncertain you make him feel, the less he will continue to bother you until eventually he leaves you alone altogether.

, It’s important to occupy your mind during this transitional period of your life especially if you were a couple that did everything together. Find yourself a hobby. If you’re someone who constantly must be with someone else, give yourself a break. Find out who you are. Work on being a good friend, a good sister, etc. Make yourself as unavailable as possible to this person. Being single is not a bad thing. Sure, it’s lonely at times but it’s not necessarily a bad thing. Being single will give you the opportunity to discover yourself and hopefully build self-confidence.

, Surely you don't want to be cold all your life, you want new friends, a new love, new everything. As soon as you have moved on, try to loosen up a bit, and forget about the past.

Place emphasis on important points.,
Choose natural sounding speech.,
Breathe deeply to regain composure.,
Give others room to speak.,
Avoid hedging or deferential language.,
Use vivid rather than abstract language.",How to Be Convincing2," When you come to something that is really significant, speak a little louder or more slowly. This doesn’t mean that you should shout at someone, or make yourself hard to understand. Speaking a little more emphatically at points, however, will make you seem convincing.For instance, if you are telling a potential client that your product is the best on the market, slow down and emphasize as you say something like “Our product beats ALL of our competitors’ by 25%.”

, Generally, you should just try to talk normally, even when you are trying to sound convincing. A natural tone and normal phrasing will do the job all by itself.Using big words and clichéd phrases aren’t going to make you sound credible. Stick to language that is easy for listeners to follow.
Speak at a volume that is close to others' around you rather than sounding high-pitched or like you are mumbling.

, If you sense yourself getting nervous, starting to speak too fast, or doing something else that makes you seem unconvincing, slow down for a moment. Take a deep breath, and then continue., A good speaker will stop when appropriate and let others take a turn. Sharing rather than dominating a conversation shows that you have the confidence to listen to others and still hold onto your own thoughts. This will ultimately make what you say more believable.This is important even when you are talking to your parents. Give them a chance to talk, hear them out, and try to convince them of your point of view.

, The way you phrase what you say matters as much or more than the actual content of it. If you are trying to sound convincing, this means avoiding saying things like:“Well, um..”
“I think that maybe I…”
“This might be the case…”
“I don’t really know.”
“If I were , then I could .”

, Being as specific as you can while you speak shows that you mean what you say. Try do include as many details, stories, facts, etc. as you can when speaking to others. For instance:If you are making a sales pitch, don’t just say something like “Our product has improved efficiency for a lot of people.” Instead, say something more detailed, like “99% of our customers report that our product has improved their efficiency by tenfold or more.”
If you are trying to convince your parents to let you stay out late, don’t just say something like “You never let me do what you want!” Try saying something more specific, like “You said if I improved my grades we could talk about letting me have more privileges.”

Let it be you.",How to Be Convincing3," Overblown language can pop up even when speaking, but it has a tendency to pop up in writing even more frequently. Don’t be afraid to write simply. Remember that your goal is to seem clear and convincing. If your audience doesn’t understand your writing, it might seem that you are hiding something or don’t really have anything to say.Don’t use lofty language when it’s not appropriate. For instance, if you can say “improve” instead of “ameliorate,” then consider doing so.
If you use technical terms like “synergy,” make sure they are ones that your audience knows and uses.
Likewise, if you use slang or informal language, make sure your audience will understand what you mean.

, Writing something that is sloppy, filled with errors and typos, or not formatted correctly will cause you to seem the opposite of convincing. Show your readers that you are credible and mean what you say by polishing your writing.Always proofread before submitting something.
Back up claims with specific evidence whenever possible.
Cite any sources of information you have used.

, Showing your personality and coming across as natural in writing is more challenging than doing so while speaking. This is because readers will not have the ability to see you and read your body language. Try to do everything you can to have your writing show who you are, and what you are trying to convey.For instance, if you are writing a college admissions essay, don’t just say that you want to become a doctor because you think that sounds good to admissions committees. Instead, paint a picture of what your interests and goals really are, no matter what you think someone else wants to read.
Have someone you trust read your writing, and tell you if it “sounds like you.”

, They say the eyes are the window to your soul. Our sullen expressions may be hidden or camouflaged with a false smile or cover up expressions, but the eyes will give you away. Drink in, the beauty around you, and get rid of the mean eye expressions. Be aware of moments when you narrow your eyes that display bad thoughts or internal anger.

, Authentic people are in touch with their moral compass. Ensure that you haven’t adopted a partner’s, parent’s or friend’s beliefs without figuring out if they are right for you.

, This can be through classes, volunteering or hobbies. Regularly doing hobbies that inspire you to improve skills is a great way to define what makes you happiest.

, Most people can work a job without loving it, but a job that forces you to act differently or be uncomfortable all day doesn’t align with your core self.

, You may find yourself filling a role that has been assigned to you, instead of how you really feel. When you start to feel uncomfortable with a situation, ask if you feel pressured into acting a certain way, rather than responding with your intuition., Many people describe themselves as a parent, wife, or teacher. Try describing yourself according to your desires, hobbies and outlooks on life, rather than social roles.

, Being comfortable with yourself requires you to accept that you are not perfect. If you know your flaws and make efforts to avoid hurting others or yourself with them, then you are much more in touch with reality., Playing up to what other people like when you are networking can help you professionally, but you are unlikely to be comfortable with the people if they don’t know what you really think.

, Intuition can lead you to choose friends who complement you. Although a pro/con list is still a good way to analyze big changes, intuitive choices may be your moral compass leading the way.

, Talk about your opinion when it matters to you. Authentic people are comfortable speaking their mind and communicating when they have a problem.


If you are uncomfortable with communication, then focus on building this skill. Talk to others, take classes or be part of a group that encourages open communication.

, Build trust and respect with other people. These two relationship values are not built overnight and are very rewarding and self-affirming.

, Striving for benchmarks can give you confidence to develop and grow.

, Talk to friends and family regularly. If you need additional support, seek help from a counselor or a support group.

, Genuine people accept that they aren’t perfect and ask for help when needed.

, You can remain authentic despite a lie or two; however, if lying is commonplace, you are not following your moral compass or your intuition.

Display your cockiness in the way you move.,
Show off your best features.,
Appear bold, not defensive.",How to Be Cocky," Cockiness comes from a confidence (many would say ""arrogance"") that you're the most competent, most interesting, best-looking person in the room (even if you're not!) You also need to believe the reverse - that most of the people you meet are all dull, boring, and/or incompetent. If you sincerely believe that you're number one and that almost everyone else can't touch you, the following steps will be much easier. They may even start to fall into place on their own.


Try to mentally elevate and venerate the things you're good at while giving little importance to the things you're bad at. Are you a great student but a bad athlete? Then think like this: ""I'm the smartest person I know. I'm going to land a sweet job one day. Who cares about these meat-head jocks that people seem to like so much? Sports aren't important - these guys will be washing my car in just a few years."";
, A cocky person is the life of the party - any party. S/he is the reason that people are having fun. Keep this mentality at social gatherings - since everyone already likes you, you can skip boring small talk and get right to the interesting topics, like yourself! Assume a certain level of familiarity with everyone - if everyone's your friend, you can jump right into their conversations and even lightly tease them (like a friend would.)


For instance, let's say a cocky person has just arrived at a party. She sees a semi-close acquaintance having a conversation with someone in the corner. The cocky person might, without hesitation, wordlessly sneak up on her acquaintance, remaining just out of his line of sight, then chime in to the conversation unexpectedly as a shocking, funny prank. The assumption of familiarity is crucial - a less cocky person might have simply walked up to her acquaintance, made an awkward, stilted introduction, then excused herself from the conversation.
Sincerity is key here. People naturally look to others for social cues, so the more you sincerely believe that you're the center of attention, the more other people will too.

, The only time a cocky person is indecisive is when s/he is deciding which supermodel to ask out first. Cocky people have a strong opinion on almost everything and they're almost never afraid to share it. They don't worry about offending others because they know that they're right - if someone else doesn't want to admit it, that's not the cocky person's problem. A cocky person isn't afraid of a good debate - after all, he's sure to win because he knows he's right.


On the other hand, a cocky person won't ever embarrass himself by getting too emotionally invested in an argument. He feels no need to waste energy yelling or resorting to personal insults. After all, he's right, so why would he need to?
A cocky person won't refrain from correcting someone out of politeness. Let's say his history teacher mistakenly says that East and West Germany reunited in 1989, not 1990. He will raise his hang and politely (but firmly) explain the teacher's mistake: ""Excuse me, I think Germany was formally reunited in 1990. My Grandma was there.""

, Knowing that someone desires you is a big confidence booster - imagine how your confidence will skyrocket if you simply assume that everyone thinks you're hot stuff! Take great pride in your looks and your charm. Are you wearing a new outfit for the first time? Hold your head high - be confident that everyone's admiring you. Give an alluring smile to the guy that you're interested in. If you believe that everyone already is in love with you, you've got no reason to worry.


Truly cocky people exude an air of easy confidence, so even if you've put a great deal of effort into your appearance or behavior, act as if it's effortless. If complimented on a bold style choice, say ""Oh this? Just something I found in the closet"" rather than ""It took me four hours to put together, so I sure hope it looks good!""

, It's sad, but true: no matter how excellent you are, you'll eventually run into people who refuse to give you the respect you deserve. You might even run into the occasional person who doesn't like you. Don't bother with such small-minded people. If they don't love you, there's something wrong with them, not you.


Haters often are aiming to get a reaction out of you. Don't give haters what they want by letting them get you angry or flustered. Casually dismiss them with a line like, ""You're just jealous because you share my impeccable taste in everything.""

, Cockiness is an exaggerated form of personal confidence. To be truly cocky, you've got to have a good, self-confident foundation to work with. Cockiness without real confidence comes across as pathetic posturing, which is the opposite of what you want. Rather than seeming like you're not worried about what people think, you'll seem to be worried about what everyone thinks.


If you're not confident, there's no magic way to become so overnight, However, to start down the path towards confidence, begin by working towards achievements that make you proud. The good feeling you get from making these achievements will fuel you make bigger achievements, and, ultimately, become more skilled, experienced, and confident.

, Don't be afraid to share your greatness. If you've gotten the hang of thinking of yourself as the top dog, it's time to start spreading the word. Here, a little finesse is required - if you simply walk around telling everyone you meet that you're great and they're garbage, people will think you're a bully or a psychopath. Instead, just use the opportunities you get in normal conversations to slip in cocky mentions of yourself.


For example, if your friends are discussing last weekend's big soccer game, you might say, ""Yeah, Beckham's goal was alright, but his passing game was pretty sloppy. When I played club soccer, I wouldn't have let the ball get away from me so often.""
When you're in a competition against someone, it's very cocky to engage in a little trash talk. If you're competing against a romantic interest, it can even be a little flirtatious. Just make sure to keep away from low blows - if you're really cruel, you can get penalized or ejected.

, If you get a compliment (and you will), take it while subtly acknowledging that you already know you're the best. Instead of saying, ""Really? Gee, thanks!"" when you get a compliment, instead say ""Thanks, that's great to hear."" You want to give other people the impression that you're not surprised that everyone's jealous of you. Show the world that you expect to be adored.

, Truly cocky people have things to be cocky about. Be proud about whatever you've achieved in life. Bring these things up whenever you get the chance. Whenever you make a new achievement, relish your victory. Celebrate with your friends. Act especially confident and self-assured afterwords. You might even consider changing your appearance after you've achieved something (within reason.) After a big sports victory, you might, for instance, wear your jersey or letterman jacket to school the next day.


Be warned - rubbing an opponent's nose in his or her failure is not good cocky behavior. It's embarrassing for everyone involved, especially you. Being a sore winner reeks of low confidence - cocky people know they're going to win ahead of time, so they're not hard on their opponents when their prediction comes true.

, A cocky person doesn't have to have millions of fake friends and hangers-on. In fact, a person who worries too much about how many friends s/he has seems insecure - the opposite of cocky. You should, however, have a posse of people you can confidently call homie, dog, bud, or pal. The knowledge that you have people you can turn to when life gets tough will make you more confident and willing to take risks. Also, good friends are great companions or wingmen for your cocky pursuits!

, Properly applied, the sense of touch can be used create a lasting impression that you're confident about your body. However, if you're too generous with when and where you touch people, you'll be labeled a creep. This distinction can be a thin line, so to start with small, simple shows of affection. When greeting someone, give him or her a hug instead of a handshake. If someone says something funny, gently touch his or her shoulder as you laugh. Stand close to someone you like, brushing up against him or her ""accidentally."" Making these small affectionate gestures can go a long way towards showing you're confident and not worried about peoples' reactions to your affection - in a word, cocky.


Cocky touching is great for flirting as long as it's used within reason. Adjust your body language to suit your partners' - if at any point s/he seems uncomfortable or creeped out, ease off on your shows of affection.

, Cocky people know they're universally desired, so they have no trouble flirting with the people that they're ""in to."" They approach romantic interests without hesitation. They're cool and confident when they talk to people that they ""dig."" They're never afraid of being rebuffed. After all, they know that people should be flattered by the opportunity to be hit on by an absolute stud!


Cocky people are shameless when they flirt. Be scandalous! Let a person you're interested in know exactly how you feel, while stopping just short of things that you think will creep him or her out.

, No one's life is perfect. Even the most confident, self-assured people in the world have to deal with periodic setbacks and problems. Take these as they come - there's no way to avoid every single hardship in life. Don't feel the need to keep up a cocky façade when you're hurting. If, for instance, you lose a beloved relative, your normal cockiness will seem very unnatural and forced. Everyone has occasional bad spells - if you pretend that you don't, you'll only make if harder to move on. Give your problems the attention they deserve and you'll eventually be back to your old cocky self.


Cockiness is partly self-deception. Cocky people create idealized visions of themselves in their mind and and act as if these ""perfect"" visions are the reality, when in fact, they are not. Temporary difficulties are great opportunities for self-reflection. Ask yourself questions like ""In what ways have I had an unrealistic image of myself?"" and ""Have I been too cocky?"" Life's difficulties can act as checks on out-of-control egos and keep us from becoming insufferable narcissists.

, One great way of telegraphing to everyone in the room that you're cocky is to display this trait with confident body language. You'll want to have a broad, erect stance as your default way of standing. Keep your shoulders back and your head up while holding your chest up. It sounds crazy, but it works - changing from a slouched or slumped default posture to a more dignified one can make a marked difference on how people think of you (and how you think of yourself.)

, Cocky people know that they're the coolest person to walk the face of the earth - their faces should reflect this. A cocky person is perpetually amused with himself. Keep a proud smile on your face whenever you can. When you're interacting with someone, especially if it's someone you're interested in romantically, you might want to add a little mischievousness to your expression, as if you consider the conversation to be an amusing game.


These relatively small changes to your expression can cause significant changes in your behavior. Pretending to feel a certain way can actually make you feel that way, which will make your cockiness seem all the more natural.

, Cocky people always know what they're doing and where they're going. Your movements should reflect this. Walk with confidence - keep your head up and your shoulders back as you take fairly quick strides toward where you want to go. Whenever possible, walk in a straight line to your desired location. Don't slow down or dawdle unless you come across something or someone who interests you.


Ideally, you want to create the impression that everything you do is important, so walk as if you need to make an important appointment. Most people will naturally assume that you are important.

, Cocky people know they're hot! Dress to show off the hottest aspects of your body. If you've got great, muscly arms, wear short sleeves to have the ladies swooning. Have you got long, sexy legs? Show them off with some tight jeans! Don't be shy - you're the best-looking person you know, so it'd be a disservice not to flaunt what you've got.

, Cocky people have confidence in their opinions - the way they gesture and position their body should reflect this. Always face and make eye contact with whomever you're talking to. Generally, you should position yourself so that the front of your body is facing whoever you're engaged with - a good rule is to keep your belly button pointed at whoever's most interesting to you at a given moment. This way, even if you have to momentarily avert your gaze for some reason, the full weight of your body language is still brought to bear on who you're talking to.


Don't appear defensive during confrontations. For instance, if you're engaged in an argument or debate, don't cross your arms and look away. Instead, point your body directly at your opponent and look him or her in the eye.
Make gestures with confidence. If someone asks you which way is North, instead of feebly pointing with a finger held close to your body, extend your entire arm.

The very best, classiest and most respected kind of human is the kind that never stops learning and exploring new ideas - being the best you can be. There are several ways to ensure you are functioning at your highest potential, and the first step is to prepare yourself to tackle them! If you want to be classy and fabulous, you must work at that reputation. It won't happen for you.;
, Broadening your mind is an excellent place to start if you want to come across as a really great human being. Think of strong female leaders like Aung San Su Kyi and Margaret Thatcher - for all the controversy that (unfortunately in this day and age) inevitably surrounds women in leadership, those who do succeed and those who make a difference are sharp and intelligent. All women should take pride in their education, and there are things one can do every day to boost educational credentials.

, Always use correct spelling and grammar when writing.

, Try not to use slang or drop your consonants.

, Look up words you don't know.

, Even if it's just a quick scan of the headlines over breakfast, make sure you are keeping up on what is going on in the world.

,, You have a say in the running of this world, so make it your business to understand it - but don't discuss your views openly unless specifically asked. That would be inappropriate and boorish.

, Remember: it always, always, always pays to put that little bit extra effort into your intellectual life, because anybody with a hint of class knows that there's nothing less impressive than a dimwit.

, If you want to remain healthy and active until the day you die, and have a dignified life right until the end, it's imperative that you keep yourself running smoothly. Your health is your most precious possession - without it, everything else in your life takes a back seat. So do that 20 minute DVD workout three times a week, or join a dance or martial arts class, or a sports team, or take up marathon training (this can be truly addictive after the first couple of weeks). Look at Wonder Woman - a female powerhouse with an Amazonian body, which not only packed enough of a punch to save the universe but also looked stunning in a ballgown. Make her your idol.

, One piece of advice is that you should never eat anything that doesn't have a root or a mother, and it's very true. Keeping preservatives and additives to a minimum. Instead, eat wholesome, natural foods - these are what make the body work best, because that's the kind of food it's supposed to eat. Besides, would you rather be seen snacking on wholemeal toast and a fruit smoothie, or cramming a saucy, greasy McDonald's sandwich into your mouth (and likely spilling the contents on your lap in the process)? Which do YOU think is more fabulous?

, It's sad but true that looks count. This article is not going to tell you what clothes to wear or what colour your hair should be, but there are five basic rules one can follow that make the way you look a positive influence on your reputation.


Your body and clothes should always be clean and odourless.
You shouldn't expose your legs above mid-thigh, your midriff, or too much cleavage. It's basic decency. Keep it private.
Your underwear should NEVER be visible when out and about. Remember that even white bras show through white tops - neutral is best.
Your hair and make-up should be neat and simple.
Your hair and make-up shouldn't take more than ten minutes to style.

, So now you're well-informed, well-nourished and well-presented - excellent! You now have to be well-behaved to finish off the complete classy picture. We all have a friend or acquaintance who is a little 'gauche' and awkward, and in order to avoid those traits all you have to do is remain aware of yourself and your actions whilst in company. Of course, whilst home alone, nobody's watching to see if you lounge around glamorously in a satin robe or just slob about in PJs, but in company, poise is everything. The following steps are pointers regarding social behaviour for classy ladies who try to uphold a standard.

, I can't repeat this enough. Imagine you are a ballerina holding a position on stage. Imagine you're having dinner with royalty. Imagine anything, as long as it keeps your shoulders firm and straight and your neck elongated. Good posture improves circulation and digestion (helpfully avoiding unladylike moments of wind at the table), as well as brightening the eyes and smoothing out your figure. Never slouch, lean or hunch. You are a lady!

, This is the most flattering pose for them and doesn't give you pins and needles.

, Cut off one mouthful at a time (it's rude to take little bites off a larger piece on your fork). Naturally, close your mouth when eating. Basically avoid anything that involves exposing the contents of your mouth, overfilling your mouth, or the possibility of a spillage or mess. Also don't clink your cutlery and crockery together. When you have finished eating, put your knife and fork side by side in the centre of the plate.

, for example, scratching one's nose, touching a pimple, picking at a hangnail, re-arranging one's clothing etc. Hands off if there are people around! It just makes you look awkward and socially unaware. You should seem effortless, as if you don't have to think about mundane things like that. Even if you're thinking, ""Oh my God, my back is really itchy!"" - do not scratch it until you're in private. The only exception is moving hair out of your eyes, but please, if this happens frequently, get a haircut!

, The biggest rule of holding a classy conversation is that people with class do not, under any circumstances, start a topic of conversation about themselves. Don't mention yourself until asked (which you will be if you ask first, as long the people you are with have basic social skills. If they do not then either slowly educate them by example, or avoid them in future). It's all right to talk about yourself if asked, just don't be the first to bring yourself up.

, This is a sign of insecurity. If you find yourself wanting to ask if you hair's okay, if your clothes fit all right, if your label can be seen, what you should do with your hair - please bite your tongue unless it's your best friend. Discussing your own appearance is just not done. However, if in receipt of a compliment, you may naturally smile gratefully and give a humble thank-you before returning it pleasantly.

If you want to figure out how to be more carefree in your daily life, it's important to make time for fun and to keep it. Most people schedule their day around work or school. It's unavoidable for most of us. In the same way you schedule this time, schedule time for the things you want to do as well.


As you get busier, it can be too easy to use the free time you have to do nothing. Cue up the Netflix. Instead, start actively planning out leisure activities. Schedule in a fishing trip for next weekend, or book reservations to take your partner on a date. Make a point of making time for fun.;
, Surround yourself with people that you enjoy being around, and who make your life easier and more fun, as opposed to more stressful. If you want to be carefree, it's important to be around people who have common goals. Social time should be easy, not a chore.


Don't let ""downers"" drag you down with them. Only make a point of socializing with people who will support each other and who want to have a good time with the time you have. This kind of attitude is infectious.

, Even mundane things like shopping, driving, and going to work should be causes for celebration in a carefree life. If you're going out and doing something, treat it like the biggest adventure that you'll have today. If you can't spend today scuba diving in Hawaii, at least you can spend it adventuring on public transportation!


Heading out to the grocery store? Give yourself a little challenge. Decide that you'll take five pictures of ridiculous things that you see on your walk and text them to people in your phone you haven't talked to in forever. Just send them the picture and say, ""Reminded me of you.""
Stuck in the house cleaning? Blast the music and do a Risky Business dance routine, or give yourself the challenge of rearranging the whole house, just because.

, Some studies show that increasing the amount of natural Vitamin D you get from sunlight can boost your serotonin levels, helping you to feel less stressed and more carefree.Even if you don't have any particular reason to be outside, make a point of getting out in the sun and breathing the air for 15 or 20 minutes each day. This can do wonders for your mood.


It's hard to be carefree when you're sitting around watching television and doing nothing. Don't trap yourself inside if you don't need do. Get outside and get active.

, Light exercise can induce a feeling of euphoria, improving your mood and helping you feel much more carefree. Sometimes called ""runner's high,"" the exercise effect is a documented psychological phenomena.If you want to help yourself feel more carefree, try finding a regular exercise routine that works with your life.


You don't have to go jumping into a marathon. Just try going on a 30-40 minute walk at a brisk pace after you get done working for the day, or start out your day with a walk before you settle in.Find competitive team sports that you enjoy, so you can have the thrill of competition and of socializing with some people aside from the benefits of exercise.

, Every now and then, life calls for some serious leisure. If you want to be truly carefree, take the time to treat yourself. Just sit in the sun in the middle of the day with a cold drink. Don't let anyone bother you. Read your book on the couch with a hot cup of tea. Book a spa day. Just relax., Get out a piece of paper and write down everything that causes you to feel stress, or to feel overwhelmed. What people, places, and situations make you feel anxious? Try to be as comprehensive as possible, considering the times in your daily life that you feel like you can't be carefree.


Who causes you to feel stressed out? A particular friend? A partner? A coworker? Try to cut as many of these stress-causers from your life as possible. If you can't, avoid them.

, Once you've identified the things that cause you to feel stressed out, Try to anticipate those situations and causes so you can avoid them if possible, and expect them if unavoidable. Everyone has to deal with stress as a part of their life. But if you can figure out a way to put stress in the back seat, you can be a lot more carefree.


If you're headed into a busy day at work, you know it's going to be busy. Expect nothing less. That doesn't mean you have to feel stressed because of it. Just focus on getting through the day and getting finished.Try doing a short ritual with your stress list to Try to let it go. Tear it up. Look over your big stress causes one last time, then rip it into little pieces, or toss it into the fireplaces, or just throw it in the garbage. Or, alternatively, keep it with you in your pocket so you can remind yourself to stay ahead of things.

, When someone annoys you or is in a bad mood, the best thing to do isn't to walk away, it is to be the better person and remain polite. Conversations aren't about ""winning"" or ""losing,"" they're about connecting with people. Eventually, this will become second nature, and you'll feel a lot lighter and better about yourself.


If you feel yourself getting angry when you're provoked, just try the 10 second rule. Stop talking and just breathe for a full 10 seconds. If they stare at you, they stare. When you speak, say in a calm, even voice, ""I don't want to get upset about this. Maybe we should talk another time.""

, Remember that the only person you need to impress is yourself. Friends may come and go, but you will always have who you are. If people are telling you to change how you are, they aren't important enough to you for you to take their opinion into account.Be willing to listen when your friends offer good advice, however. If your close friends and trusted family members are telling you to change by stopping a bad habit, that is a different thing altogether.

, That doesn't mean going to the hair salon or buying that ridiculously expensive pair of shoes. If you want to be carefree, learn to accept that you look a certain way and love that. You are a unique individual and one of your gifts is your unique appearance.


If you are a bit larger than ""normal,"" you can either accept that and know that you look fine or work out and get skinnier. If you're tall, don't look at how awful it is to be tall, look at the good things, like reaching the higher shelves and seeing over everyone's heads in a crowd.

, If you decide to do something because you want to do it, you'll be able to stay a lot more carefree about the task itself. If you feel like you're forced into your job, or that you're forced to have to go to the gym, those things will become chores. If you treat them as opportunities, they'll be fun. Make the choice to do them.


Changing your attitude doesn't have to be complicated, or require a lot of complex psychology. If you want to do something, do it. If you don't, find a way to make it work for you, or cut it from your life. Sometimes it's that simple.
Hate your job? Quit and get another one. Sick of the town you live in? Move. If something isn't supporting you or helping you live a happy, carefree life, make a change.

, It may sound silly, but you will feel so much happier when you smile widely at a friend or a random stranger and they smile back. You will feel a lot lighter if you laugh as well. Laugh at whatever you find funny, even if the people around you don't see the humor.


Being carefree doesn't mean you should be a laughing fool. Taking a funeral or a memorial service lightly isn't appropriate. It's still important to stay tactful.

, Just look out the window and you'll likely see something ridiculous. You're a human who lives in a little box plugged into a computer box. Someone walking dogs around the neighborhood and picking up their poop and carrying it with them. How weird! Try to remember that life should be something to laugh at, and something to appreciate. It's not something to endure.

, Worrying about your past mistakes will leave you stressed. Instead, embrace the potential of your life. Who cares if people don't like the you? You can change over time and become a new person or find new friends. You could move to another country and within 10 years you would have new friends and think in a new language, you would be a new person. Anything can happen.

Be clear about your intentions.,
Make sure you are both on the same page.,
Refrain from meeting each other’s friends and family.,
Always practice safe sex.",How to Be Casual2," If you’re interested in dating someone casually as opposed to committing to a monogamous relationship, be sure you are clear about these intentions with the man or woman you are dating. Try saying, “Mark, I really enjoy spending time with you but I am not in a place for a serious, committed relationship. Can we keep it casual?”

, It’s key that everyone’s on the same page about being in a casual relationship. Once you’ve made your intentions clear, talk with the other person about what is and what is not permissible in your casual relationship. You can try sitting down with them and making a list – paper or mental – of dos and don’ts such as sleeping with other people., If you are involved in a casual relationship you shouldn’t be making the emotional investment of spending time with the important people in each other’s lives. Meeting and hanging out with someone’s best friends or parents should be reserved for a serious, committed relationship., You should always practice safe sex and this is especially important if you are involved in a casual relationship where one or both of the partners may be having sex with other people. A sexually transmitted disease or unwanted pregnancy are the last things most casual daters want to deal with. Make sure you and your partners are using protection each and every time you have sex, which includes oral sex."
"
Don’t take yourself too seriously.,
Go with the flow.,
Try to relax.",How to Be Casual3," If you want to develop a casual attitude it’s important to not take yourself too seriously. Keep your sense of humor when unexpected things happen in your life and remember that you are a tiny fish in a big ocean. Your problems today will likely seem less important tomorrow., This is especially important in group settings. If you want to have a casual attitude around friends, family, and even your co-workers, it’s important to go with the flow of the group. For example, if you are going to the movies with friends and everyone but you wants to see a certain flick, don’t push the issue. See the movie your friends want to see this time.

, Part of having a casual attitude is learning how to slow down and relax. Instead of treating every minor mishap as a life-altering event, try to look at things in a broader perspective. Try breathing deeply when something unwanted occurs in your life instead of letting it ruin your day.

If you can answer a teacher's question in words everyone else knows, people will be impressed. Only then will you will be called smart rather than ""geeky"".;
, Try to run fast especially. If you are slow with the mile or PACER test, don't worry. You can practice at home by jogging around your neighborhood (in daylight, of course). Sometimes girls like self-deprecating people. If you get an unsatisfactory score, just laugh and joke, ""Oh, wow, I really am a klutz,"" or something like that. Your classmates may like this sense of humor.

, If people are playing a game and you want to join, go up and say, ""Hey, what's going on? Can I play?"" In most elementary and middle schools, kids are supposed to let new classmates join a game, and if they're mean to you, a teacher can get involved. When you have to leave, say, ""See you later, (their names)"" or something like that. Try not to just walk away or disappear.

,, Wash your face with water every day. Apply lip balm. Have perfume.


Boys don't need too much looks. Try to bathe regularly, as boys have been known to sweat more. Use a deodorant, and style your hair in a cool way. Try to have a clean shave or little face hair marks. In markets, there are many men's products. Use them.

, Hang out with friends, and go places outside of school if your parents approve.

, Ask about a solution to a problem or anything related to academic studies.

, Don't do anything people would gossip about, and also don't start gossip about others. When you have something negative to say, don't say it. This will make others trust you.

, Present yourself by showing others your art. Participate and get involved.

,, In all likelihood you two will soon be friends. Common interests is one of the biggest friendship-starters.

, So many people who want popularity make the mistake of trying to act ""cool"" or using words nobody else knows. Don't sacrifice your personality and act like someone else just to be popular.

Most importantly: HAVE FUN!",How to Be Awesomely Awkward," If you mess up then hey, it'll just be even more awkward.;
, If you don't know exactly what that is, just do something that humans don't usually do because it is generally uncomfortable.

, For example, wearing a slightly baggy turtleneck can give a person character.

, If you're just a mean person, then people will probably make fun of you for your mannerisms, or you may across as strange. However, being nice to everyone prompts them to get a good impression of you and your unique character.

, They are probably just jealous and thinking, ""Man, I wish that I could be like that person and do whatever without worrying about ruining my normal person image.""

, For example "" Man I'm so jealous of Ryan Seacrest! Did you see his hands yesterday? They looked just looked so supple!""

, Just don't use them all the time, or else you may get annoying. If your accents are bad, even better!

, For example if you are a fifteen year old girl, one day you could just start acting like that old man across the street who likes to make his own jam.

, For example: dutch poodle breeding.

, For example ""Oh my lanta!"", ""Gee Wilikers!"", or ""Confound it!""

, The main reason people convert to awkward is to have fun doing unusual things. So go enjoy!

Take a deep breath and smile.,
Meditate for a few minutes.,
Remind yourself that your opinion matters.,
Understand that you can't control the actions and feelings of others.,
Think carefully before you speak.,
Make an assertive request or statement.,
Use specific declarative statements.,
Self-reflect and empathize with the other person.,
Validate the other person’s feelings and point of view.,
Establish what changes you need to see.,
Collaborate on a plan and a singular vision.,
Thank the person and walk away.",How to Be Assertive Without Being Aggressive," By taking a moment to breathe and smile you not only prevent yourself from acting rashly and aggressively, but you release endorphins in your brain. Endorphins are released when you smile because your brain has been trained to recognize these muscle movements as positive. Endorphins, along with serotonin keep your mood up and stable.
Breathing and smiling also relieves stress because it lowers cortisol levels, which is a stress hormone.

, Meditation doesn’t have to be done by sitting on the floor with your legs crossed. It can be done by going for a walk or finding a quiet place to be alone. Whether you’re in an office environment or social situation you can always remove yourself from a stressful situation for a few minutes.
Meditating and clearing your mind for a few minutes will help you formulate a positive plan of action where your can be assertive.
Acting rashly without thinking can cause you to be aggressive and immature.
Try sitting down and placing both hands on your belly. Take in a few full breaths. Feel your stomach rise as you breathe in and fall on the out breath.
Breath through your nose and take long, calm breaths.

, You are within your rights to feel the way you do. You are also capable of confidently and respectfully expressing your point of view. Giving yourself a pep talk may sound silly but it can help to boost your confidence and express what you need to in a confident and succinct manner.
If you try to confront someone without having had time to cool down you are more likely to act aggressively. Aggressive behavior means bullying someone instead of working together to find a solution.

, You can only control how you act and feel. Being assertive means focusing on how you handle situations.


While your goal may be to get someone to change her behavior in a certain manner, you can't force your will on that person. All you can do is communicate what you need and how you feel.
Aggressive behavior involves trying to assert your will and force a person to change to get what you want. Being assertive involves keeping a cool head and dealing with how you feel and behave.

, Even though you’ve taken a few moments to decompress and compose yourself, you may get heated during a conversation. Therefore, remember to always take a moment before speaking.


You can ensure that you are taking a moment before speaking by listening intently to what the other person is saying.
Don’t interrupt the other person. Wait until this person has finished speaking before you talk.
Being assertive means really listening and understanding so you can express what you need.
Being aggressive means interrupting the other person and speaking over her.

, Find a moment to talk to the person or persons who you are dealing with and practice direct communication.


Direct, assertive communication involves understanding where the other person is coming from and expressing your contracting opinion without placing blame.
Use “I feel” statements. Instead of accusing the other person by saying “you did this” or “you’re behavior is”, express how her actions make you feel.

, Declarative statements help you to paint a clear picture of the situation. And when followed by an “I feel” statement, can be an effective and assertive way to begin resolving an issue.


Instead of saying something like “You’re always letting me down,” or “You think you’re better than me because you do more work outside of office hours?” Use a statement that's similar to what you might read in a news article. It should be factual and specific.
""You missed the last three deadlines,” or “You’ve come in ten minutes late three days this week,” are harder to argue with.

, Now that you have clearly expressed your feelings on a situation, take a moment to reflect and try to empathize with the other person.

Use your own experiences to try and find a parallel to the current situation. You’ve probably been in the other person’s shoes before in some sense. How did you react or feel when you were on the other side?
Try to connect with this other person through your shared emotions or experiences.
Try to incorporate some humor if you can. Humor is a great way to break the tension and make people feel more comfortable. Humor doesn’t mean of making fun of a person, however. Humor means making light of a situation without blame.

, Now you can further connect with this person by explaining that how she feels is valid. However, it's her actions which aren’t valid.


If you’re in a workplace scenario where you are talking to a coworker you can say something like “I understand that the workload and meeting deadlines can be stressful. And you’re right to feel angry or upset, I feel that way sometimes.”
By connecting with this person, even if it’s hard to, and validating her feelings, you are changing your relationship in a positive way. Instead of being enemies, you are now on the same team.

, Be clear about what kind of changes you need, and don’t get emotional or irrational. You need to set boundaries with the other person. If you outline boundaries for what’s acceptable or what you will put up with, you can begin to work on a resolution.
If you know that certain things won’t change, focus on things you can change. If you’re in a workplace scenario and this person is never meeting deadlines and always coming in late, focus on one problem at a time. Assertive people will be clear about what is needed but without berating a person. Aggressive behavior involves piling on and being accusatory.
If having this person meet deadlines is more important than coming in a few minutes late, be clear about it. Say “You haven’t met the last three deadlines, and I need you to meet your deadlines going forward. And if you can’t, then I will have to review your employment status with the company.”
You’re not circumventing the situation at hand and being vague when you are concrete and specific.

, Now ask this person what the two of you can do to make what you need a reality. Formulate a plan that puts both of you on the same page.


Being assertive means working together while resolving an issue. Aggressive people will demand a change but not help. And passive-aggressive people will solve a problem without communication at all.
If you need this person to start meeting deadlines, then together, communicate on how that can be achieved.
Offer alternative solutions and ask questions. Maybe you need to be better at handing out assignments with more notice. Perhaps the work for this person is too much and she feels that she would perform better in another department or area.

, Once you have reached an agreement, politely thank the person for taking the time to listen to you and work with you.


Though you may still not be very happy with this person or have more to work on, saying “thank you” shows respect and can make a person feel validated.
Leave the situation and don’t simmer in it. You’ve asserted yourself and expressed how you feel and what you need. Now it’s time to put the situation behind you.

When you’re choosing a shampoo, it’s important to know what color tones in your hair you want it to correct. Examine your hair in a mirror in both natural and artificial lights to determine which tones you want to remove.With blonde and gray hair, it’s typically yellow or gold tones that begin to show when your hair becomes brassy.
Depending on what shade of blonde your hair is, orange, copper, or red tones may appear when your color starts go brassy.
Dark hair with highlights can start to look a brassy orange or red.;
, Once you know what color tones you want to neutralize in your hair, it’s easier to choose a toning shampoo. That’s because you can use the color wheel to figure out what color pigment you need to correct the brassy tones in your hair. You want to find a toning shampoo that contains pigments in a shade opposite the tones in your hair on the color wheel.If you hair has gold or yellow tones that you wish to neutralize, look for a violet or purple shampoo.
If your hair has golden coppery tones that you wish to neutralize, choose a blue-violet or blue-purple shampoo.
If you hair has copper or orange tones that you wish to neutralize, go with a blue shampoo.
If you hair has red copper or red-orange tones that you wish to neutralize, opt for a blue-green shampoo.
If you hair has red tones that you wish to neutralize, search for a green shampoo.

, It’s best to purchase toning shampoo in person, so you can check the color and consistency. For dark colored hair, you want a formula that’s extremely pigmented and has thick consistency to ensure the best results. If possible, remove the cap from the shampoo bottle to check its appearance before buying it.Keep in mind that if you have fine or thin hair, you may actually be better off with a toning shampoo that’s lighter in color or not as pigmented. Formulas that are richer in pigment can actually tint your hair when you use it. For example, if you use a deep, dark purple toning shampoo, your hair may wind up a light purple shade.

, Just as you would before applying a regular shampoo, thoroughly wet your hair in the shower or sink. It’s best to rinse your hair with warm water because it opens up the hair’s cuticle, which allows it to better absorb the toning shampoo., Once your hair is completely wet, squeeze some of the toning shampoo into your hand and work it into your hair, starting at the roots and working your way down to the ends. Massage the shampoo gently into your hair to create a rich lather.If you have short hair, use approximately a nickle size (1.5 cm circle) amount of the shampoo.
For hair that ends between the chin and shoulders, use approximately a quarter size (2.5 cm circle) amount of the shampoo.
If you have long hair past the shoulders, use approximately a half dollar size (4 cm circle) amount of the shampoo.

, After you work the toning shampoo into a lather, you must leave it in for a few minutes to allow the toning pigments to penetrate your hair. Check the directions on your shampoo, but in most cases, you should leave it on between 3 and 5 minutes.If you have fine or thin hair, you may not want to leave the toning shampoo on for the full time recommended because it may tint your hair if you leave it on too long.

, When you’ve allowed the shampoo to sit on your hair for the recommended time, rinse your hair with lukewarm water to remove all of the shampoo. Next, follow up with a conditioner and finish with a cold water rinse to seal your cuticle.Many companies that make toning shampoos sell conditioners in the same color to further help the toning process. You can use one of these color correcting conditioners after the toning shampoo or opt for your regular conditioner.
If you wind up with tinted hair after using the toning shampoo, the color will lessen with repeated washings. You can hurry the process along by using a clarifying shampoo the next time you wash.

, To make it easier to apply the toning shampoo to your hair, it helps to divide it into sections. Use clips or bobby pins to pin back the sections that you’re not working on to keep them out of the way., Once you’ve sectioned your hair, you can start applying the shampoo. Start with the sections that need the most toning and are the most resistant to treatments and work your way to the other sections. Make sure to apply the shampoo all over your hair to avoid an uneven look when you’re done.You should be more generous with the shampoo that you would be if you were applying it to wet hair. Use enough to thoroughly coat all of your hair.
Using toning shampoo on dry hair can produce more dramatic results because there’s no added water to dilute the pigments. As a result, it can sometimes tint hair, so you want not want to try the treatment if you have fine or thin hair.

, After you’ve applied the shampoo to all of your hair, give it time to penetrate your hair completely. Consult the shampoo’s instructions to see their recommendation for how long to leave it on, but you can leave it on for up to 10 minutes.The thicker and coarser your hair is, the longer you can leave the shampoo on. It’s best to err on the side of caution, though, and start with a shorter amount of time to see how your hair reacts.

, When you’ve allowed the toning shampoo to sit on your locks for several minutes, rinse it thoroughly with lukewarm water to remove it completely. Follow up with a conditioner, and rinse one final time with cold water."

Pat yourself dry when finished.",How to Take a Sitz Bath1," You’d be amazed by how dirty your bathtub can get, for a place where you go to get clean! Since you’re taking a sitz bath to promote healing to injured tissue, you want to be extra sure that the environment is sterile.


Use a bleach-based cleaning product to sterilize the bathtub before drawing your sitz bath.
Scrub the tub thoroughly to make sure you’ve removed all the soaps and other bath products that have accumulated on the surface.
Rinse the tub thoroughly to remove both the soaps and the cleaning products.;
, It’s very important that the water you use in your sitz bath is warm, but not scalding hot. The temperature should not cause any discomfort that could cause irritation or inflammation. Warm water, though, will increase blood flow to the injured tissue, speeding up the body’s healing process in that area.Dip your finger into the water, or place a drop or two on the sensitive skin on your wrist to test the temperature.

Massage your belly and move gently back and forth from the bent-over position.",How to Take an Internal Bath," You can choose from a standard detoxification cleanse, which utilizes baking soda and sea salt, or an herbal one, which typically entails the usage of such ingredients as coffee. Coffee is known for its laxative properties, and when used in an internal bath, offers an ideal alternative to the baking soda/sea salt option.;
, You will need an enema kit to conduct your cleanse. This is an essential component of learning how to take an internal bath. Enema bags, hoses, and nozzles are available in a variety of price ranges and quality levels. Find one that best matches the goals of your cleanse. For instance, if you plan on taking an internal bath regularly, you may want to invest in a higher quality enema kit than if you were planning on conducting the cleanse once or twice or to treat an intermittent health problem.

, The recipe for a standard cleanse is 1 tsp. baking soda, 1 tsp. sea salt, and 4 cups (32 oz.) water. Make sure the water is warm as this will create the most comfortable internal bath. If you're opting for a more alternative option, follow your recipe carefully and, again, be sure the water is lukewarm and comfortable in temperature.

, This can best be achieved by bending over and sliding the nozzle of the enema bag into your rectum. Gently apply pressure to the bag so the cleansing mixture flows slowly and smoothly into your body. When the bag is empty or you feel full, remove it and set it aside.

, This will help the cleansing ingredients properly disperse around the colon and bathe the entire area. Stay in the bent-over position for a few minutes or until the need to expel the mixture is strong. After you release the contents, you can repeat this process as necessary.

, Using the proper brush or sponge will speed up application. Using your fingers is actually slower than using the appropriate application tool, which allows for quick final adjustments. Here are some examples of the best tools to use:


Foundation: Use a round blending sponge or a foundation brush.
BB and CC creams: These products blend easily, so a sponge pad or bare hands should work.
Other products: You can find a specialized brush for just about any purpose. Check out angled or stippled brushes for highlights and contouring, and use softer, rounder brushes for blush or blending.
If you don't mind spending some money, buy vibrating sponges that blend in the makeup as you go.

, If you keep your makeup at home, line up the products in the order you put them on. If you keep everything in a make-up bag, store the products you use most near the top. Don’t waste time digging through your bag for your lipstick or wishing you had put that brush where it’s supposed to be.


If you have separate morning makeup and ""touch up"" makeup, store them in separate bags.
If you have a large makeup collection, set aside a separate area for products you only use on special occasions.

, Put on makeup in the same order each day so it becomes an automatic process and you're relying more on muscle memory than active consideration. Work on one area of your face at a time, instead of bouncing around.


If you're seriously pinched for time in the mornings, practice this routine in your free time to work out the kinks and improve your speed.

, Don't try a completely new style ten minutes before you leave the house. Whenever you test a new product or decide to switch up your look, pick a moment when you have plenty of time.

, If your daily routine still takes too much time, consider toning it down. While your style is up to you, most workplaces do not expect eyeshadow and detailed contouring every day. You might find that a pat of blush and a touch of lipstick are sufficient.


If you prefer not to skip your usual products, learn to apply them more lightly. This will save time on blending.
If you're looking for a middle ground, focus on your eyes and eyebrows. When these draw attention, you can afford to take a simple approach with your lips and contours.

, Depending on how dry your skin is, applying night cream before you sleep may be enough to last you through the next day.


If you live in a dry climate, consider running a humidifier in your bedroom.
This isn't possible for everyone. If the makeup won't apply evenly, or if your skin gets dry and scaly, go back to moisturizing.

, If you have healthy skin with only minor blemishes, you may be able to skip foundation altogether. Just apply a thin layer of concealer instead.

, If you normally use a layer of lip balm or primer underneath your lipstick, switch to a lipstick that you can apply directly to dry lips. Creme lipsticks tend to be more moisturizing than matte lipstick.

, You have many product options for this part of your beauty routine. Explore a few of them to see if you can get away with a shorter process:


Kohl or eyeliner pencils are faster to apply than liquid eyeliner.
Mascara is faster than fake eyelashes.
If you normally go for a subtle eyeliner, consider skipping it altogether and curling your eyelashes instead.

, Applying eyeliner can be very time-consuming if you don't have a steady hand. Try eyelining the top of your eye, then ""smoking"" down the edges. You don't have to be as careful with this method, since you'll smooth out minor mistakes when you create the smoky look.


If you're already confident with eyeliner, winged eyeliner can be relatively quick. If you use liquid eyeliner, try creating a guide with an eyeliner pencil, then filling it in with the liquid.

, If you get mascara on your eyelids or cheeks, let it dry, then wipe it off with a cotton bud. Wiping it off while it's still wet can lead to a long chain of smudge correction.

, Instead of filling in your eyebrow with powder or a brow pen, just brush on a brow gel or a light brown mascara. This can save you minutes each day.

, Pick a moisturizer/sunscreen combination so you only have to rub in one product. Apply just a small dab so you don't have to wait for your skin to absorb it.

, Apply a little more concealer than you usually would, skipping the foundation. Optionally, use a lighter concealer for the under eye area. Quickly set your concealer with a powder for a matte look that lasts longer.

, Brush on white shadow on your eyelids, under the crease. Apply light brown into the crease, blending well with the brown. Finish by blending in dark brown at the corner of your eye.

, Avoid thick, clumpy mascara that you have to waste time cleaning up.

, Pink or nude colors are generally more forgiving for a fast makeup session. Reds and other bold colors are more likely to look messy when applied in a hurry, as is lip liner.

, None of the suggested additions are necessary but could be added for special occasions or when you feel more confident with speedy application of makeup. If you have more time you could add blush, bronzer, or highlighter.

Purchase a sitz bath kit.,
Clean the basin.,
Set up the sitz bath.,
Put the basin and bag in place.,
Sit on the basin.,
Unclamp the tube.,
Relax.,
Pat yourself dry when finished.",How to Take a Sitz Bath2," You can often find a sitz bath kit in the medical supply section of the grocery store, or your local pharmacy. If you can’t find a sitz bath kit locally at a store, you can purchase them easily online.


The kit will include a bath basin that fits over a toilet seat; a solution bag for the bathwater; a plastic tube to spray the water; and a clamp to control the flow through the tube.

, Even if your kit is new out of the package, you want to make sure that you’re not exposing your damaged tissue to possible infection. Clean the basin thoroughly with a bleach-based cleaning product. Scrub well and rinse with water.

, Once you get your bath set up, you can just sit and relax while it does its work. But first, you have to set it up.


Place the tube through the hole in the basin that’s used for circulating the solution throughout the bath. Consult the directions that came with the kit if you’re having trouble locating the tube hole.
Snake the tube all the way to the center of the basin and clip it into the bottom of the bowl. Consult your kit’s instructions for a diagram if necessary.
Use the clamp to cut off flow through the tube; you don’t want it to start leaking before you’re ready!
Fill the solution bag with warm water, or whichever solution you’d like to use to treat the damaged tissue.

, Making sure the toilet seat is up, place the basin over the inner rim of the toilet. It’s best if the bag can hang from some sort of hook, but all that matters is that it’s elevated, so the liquid will drain downward.

, You’ll likely have to adjust a bit to find a comfortable position. Feel free to adjust your position as necessary throughout the duration of the bath to make sure you’re not causing yourself unnecessary discomfort.

, Release the clamp that’s holding back the warm solution in the elevated bag. The hose at the bottom of the bowl will begin spraying upward, so make the necessary adjustments to ensure that the bathwater is being sprayed onto the damaged tissue that you wish to treat. This might include adjusting your position or adjusting the position of the hose.


If you must adjust the position of the hose, make sure to cut off the flow of water using the clamp. Otherwise, you’ll make a mess!

, The solution in the bag should be released slowly, not all at once, if your kit is working properly, so you’ll have a few minutes to relax into the spray. Even after the bag has emptied and the hose has ceased spraying, you can simply soak in the water that’s been collected in the basin for as long as you’d like.

, You must be very gentle with the damaged tissue after your sitz bath, so don’t rub yourself dry as you normally would. Use a clean, soft towel, pat and dab until the area has been dried.


Scrubbing or rubbing can cause irritation and further injury.

To begin your Barbie look, use makeup remover to remove any leftover makeup. Then, wash your face with fresh water and an antibacterial soap to leave it clean and fresh for your Barbie look., Once you've removed your makeup and washed your face, apply a moisturizer. A quality moisturizer will prevent your skin from looking rough under the makeup.Make sure to massage the moisturizer deeply into your skin. Just buffing moisturizer on can cause makeup to slide off.
It's a good idea to use a moisturizer that contains SPF. Sun protection every day is important to keeping your skin healthy, but you may sometimes forget the added step of sunscreen. Having SPF embedded in your regular moisturizer can help., Once you've washed and moisturized, you can begin applying your makeup. To start, massage a layer of primer onto your face. As you want doll-like looking skin, do not worry about the primer looking overdone or caked on. For Barbie makeup, you actually want your skin to look somewhat fake and exaggerated. Normally, you may just target discolored areas with primer. For Barbie makeup, however, you should apply a layer of primer to your entire face.








You can dab primer on your skin in dots and then massage it into your face. You can use your fingers to work primer over your skin. You can also use a clean makeup brush.

, Highlighter is important to the flawless Barbie doll look. After applying primer, use highlighter to brighten a few key areas in your face.









Add a dot of highlighter to the following places: underneath the outer end of your eyebrow, in the corner of each eye, on the tip of your nose, just above your upper lip, and on the top of each cheekbone.
Take a makeup brush and blend the highlighter into your face until it looks smooth. Your face should look brighter and younger now.

, Barbie has a very specific facial structure that you can emulate with the use of contouring. To start, you'll use concealer to highlight certain areas of your face.








Choose the lightest foundation you have. Use a small tipped makeup brush to apply foundation to the bridge of your nose. Add a dab to your chin, about half an inch below your bottom lip. Then add two dabs to the corners of your mouth.
Add two large circles of foundation underneath your eyes, as well as on the outer corners of your eyes. Then, add two lines of foundation running down your jawlines. Add some foundation between your eyebrows, as well as your lower forehead.

, Once you've applied the lighter shade, you can begin the shading process. Take a darker shade of foundation. Something with a brownish tone works. You can use this to shade the brightened areas.Draw a line of the darker foundation just below your bottom lip. Then, add another dab below the line of brighter foundation on your chin.
Add two lines of darker foundation on either side of your nose, as well as around the nostrils.
Add some dark foundation to your temples.

, Once you've applied your dark and light layers of foundation, you can blend. Use a makeup sponge to dab the contoured makeup into your skin. Use gentle, patting motions as you move the sponge around your face. Keep dabbing until all the makeup has blended into your skin. You should not notice any caked on or bumpy patches. Your face should look smoother and more defined.







, Barbie's makeup is usually somewhat exaggerated, so you want to choose dramatic and girlish colors for your eyes. Your crease is the indented area between your eyelid and the curve of your brown bone. You'll want to color this area with a darker shade of pink or purple. There is no super specific rule for color here. Simply pick a dark, girlish color you like.Dab a small makeup brush in your chosen eye shadow. Swipe the brush back and forth along the crease in slow, steady motions. Keep going until you have a visible line of your chosen color blended into the crease.
Feel free to mix colors. If you want something slightly darker or slightly lighter, experiment with adding another shade. You can mix several colors as long as you stick to colorful shades. You do not want to use a beige or nude shade, as Barbie always has somewhat dramatic eye shadow.

, Once you have your crease done, you can add eye shadow to your outer eyelid. Add a similar, but somewhat darker, color to your outer eyelid near the corner of your eye. Use a make up brush to make small, circular motions as you color your outer lid in a darker shade.







, For this step, you'll need to take a slightly darker shade of eye shadow. Take a smaller brush, like a corner brush. Dab it in a shade that's slightly darker. Stick to girlish colors, like a dark pink or purple. Run the tip of the brush along the bottom of your eye, just below the lash line. Make back and forth motions with the brush until your eye is outlined in a bright pink or purple shade., Once you have your eyes outlined, you'll want to get the rest of your eyelid colored. Choose a lighter shade that goes with the color scheme of the eye shadows you used to outline your eye. For example, if you were using purple, a light lavender would work.








Dab your eyelid with your chosen shade until your full eyelid is covered.
Take a blending brush and swipe it across your eye. Go back and forth until the colors blend together and there are no uneven patches or drastic changes in color.

, Eyeliner can really help your eyes look bigger and brighter, helping solidify the Barbie look. Take a liquid eyeliner. Using the brush that came with the eye liner, run the liner along the top of your lash line on your upper lid. Start at the inner corner of your eye and draw a line until your reach your outer corner.








Go slowly here. It can be very easy to accidentally smudge eyeliner.

, You want to make your eyes look bright, like Barbie's do. Highlighting the inner corner of your eyes can make them stand out more. Use a bright highlighter and a corner brush. Dab the corner brush in the highlighter and then apply to the inner corners of your eye.








The idea is to encase your eye in something like a sidewards ""V"" shape. You'll want to apply highlighter just below your bottom lash line and then more just below your upper lash line.
Use somewhat circular motions as you apply, especially in the corners of your eye near your nose.

, Barbie has distinct, dramatic eyelashes. You can use eyebrow makeup and brown or black eyebrow gel and liquid eyeliner to draw on doll-like eyelashes.Start with your bottom lashes. Dip your brush in the eyebrow gel. Then, draw on six to seven sideways lines jutting out of your bottom lash line. These should look like the drawn on eyelashes Barbie has. The lashes should get shorter as you get towards the inner eye.
Move onto your upper lashes. Add mascara to your natural eyelashes. Make sure your eyelashes are curled up slightly. You can push them up using the tip of your corner brush in order to make them more pronounced.
Then, take your liquid liner. Draw a series of slanted lines across your lash line. They should run from your upper lash line to the curve of your brown bone. When you're finished, you should look like you have painted on eyelashes similar to Barbie's.

, Barbie is known for her bright cheeks. Therefore, the blush you use to emulate Barbie should be fairly dramatic. Choose a very bright pink shade of blush that you would not use everyday. Take a large make up brush and sweep the blush on your cheeks, running from the apples of your cheeks to the indent of your cheek bones. Sweep the blush on in sideways, back and forth motions., To solidify the dollish Barbie look, add some glittery highlighter to your blush. Swipe this just above where you applied your blush. Use the same back and forth, sideways motions to apply the highlighter., Barbie's lips are very defined, so you'll want to use lip liner. Take a somewhat neutral shade of lip liner. Run the liner across the top and bottom of your lip. You want to outline your lips in a thick layer of lip liner.







, Barbie has bright lips. Once you apply your lip liner, fill in your inner lips with a bright, pink lipstick. As with your blush, choose a dramatic shade. Rub the tip of the lipstick across your lips. Then, rub your lips together slightly so it disperses evenly throughout your lips., A nice lip gloss can leave your lips looking shiny and somewhat plastic-like in appearance. This can help you look dollish, like Barbie. Apply lip gloss the same way you would apply lipstick. You should be left with bright, neat lips that look similar to the lips of a Barbie doll., You want to keep your Barbie makeup intact, especially if you're going to an event like a costume party. Take a setting spray and hold it about a foot away from your face. Close your eyes and mist the spray all over your face. This should help your makeup stay on throughout the day."

If you have dry skin, you may want to use a liquid or cream foundation. For added hydration, you can mix a few drops of moisturizer into your foundation before you apply.;
, If you choose to make foundation a part of your beauty routine, it's important to find a product that's as close as possible to your natural skin tone.


Never use a foundation lighter than your skin tone. This can make your skin look patchy and your makeup caked on.
When shopping for foundation, swatch it against your forehead or jawline. It's common for people with darker skin tones to be a little lighter at the face, so using your hand may not give you an accurate match.Foundation shopping is often trickier for people with darker skin. Try researching which locally-available brands work best on darker skin to narrow down your choices.You can also go to a local beauty shop or the makeup counter at a department store and ask for help there. These businesses often employ skilled makeup artists who might be better able to find the perfect match. Many will also offer a free makeover with your potential new foundation to help you decide.
You should make sure the foundation you're thinking about buying is perfect in all lights, not just under the ones in the store. Try shopping without foundation or concealer on your face when trying out new foundations. Go outside and use a hand mirror to make sure the product blends in perfectly in the sun.

, Dark under eye circles are common in people of Indian descent. They are caused by an excess amount of melanin being deposited in the skin, which is a process controlled by genetic predisposition. If you have these dark under eye circles, you may want to take extra care to cover them, as an even skin tone will give you a more youthful, vibrant look. Pick a concealer that is the same shade as your natural skin tone but with a slightly warmer undertone.









To apply, swipe the concealer under your eyes and blend at the edges.If your under eye circles are still a problem, try applying orange color-correcting concealer under your skin-tone concealer. Orange concealer is applied the same way as conventional concealer and helps make under eye circles disappear. In addition, it is a great all-around color corrector for blemishes on darker skin., Many blushes that look too bright to be used in everyday makeup actually blend beautifully into darker skin. Bright oranges are especially great for adding a touch of color to your cheeks.









More subdued colors like rose and coral also complement darker skin nicely. These are great choices for daytime looks.
For nighttime makeup, consider using deep, rich colors like plum, wine, and bronze. The metallic in bronze blush is particularly great for creating a healthy glow.
Avoid neutral browns and beiges. These tend to make already brown skin look dull., You can use a powder that matches your skin tone or one that is translucent and matte. Setting powder will both help your makeup last longer and reduce shine. This step is especially important if you have oily skin.








Be cautious when using illuminating powders or ""illuminators."" Make sure it has been especially formulated with darker skin in mind. These contain warm gold tones that will prevent the ashiness that other illuminators can give to dark skin., While tanning is the trend in Western cultures, skin ""bleaching"" treatments are incredibly popular in India, especially among women with darker skin. It's best to stick to natural methods of lightening your skin, as many pharmaceutical products can have dangerous side-effects.


Examples of natural skin lighteners that some people find effective are lemon juice, turmeric, and dairy products.
The best way to make your skin a little lighter is to avoid sun exposure and to apply sunscreen when you can't.Bleaching your skin is by no means necessary. Dark skin is beautiful in its natural state. Don't lighten your skin to conform to some beauty standard. Only do so if it's your own personal preference., Using an eyeshadow brush, apply just a bit of white eyeshadow under the arc of each of your eyebrows. This will create the illusion of a more dramatic brow and bigger eyes. This trick is especially effective on dark Indian skin.







, While not usually thought of as a traditional look in India, shimmery white eyeshadow used as a base on the lids make a great everyday makeup choice for dark skin. When properly blended, white eyeshadow can look natural on darker skin while highlighting the eyes.


A touch of white eyeshadow by your tear ducts can also make your eyes look brighter without covering the entire lid.
Remember that darker complexions can pull of all colors. Feel free to explore any eyeshadow that suits your tastes., Lining the lower eyelids with kajal (either from homemade powder or a commercial stick) is a ubiquitous look in India. This tradition began with a belief in kajal's medicinal properties, but many people around the world now use kajal for purely aesthetic reasons.You can also use kajal to give yourself smoky eyes. Smoky eye makeup is another classic choice for Indian skin of all shades, but it is especially stunning when paired with dark skin.
Heavy black eyeliner looks much less stark and more flattering on dark skin. People with lighter skin have more difficulty pulling off this look, especially when lining their lower eyelids.
Liquid eyeliner is another staple of Indian fashion, both in India and among people of Indian descent living abroad, that looks great with dark skin., Simply spread on a layer of foundation the same way you use it on the rest of your skin. This trick helps when applying brighter lip colors to darker lips. Otherwise, these colors may not show up very well.








Foundation will also help your lip color to last longer.
You can also use concealer or lip primer instead of foundation., This deep red suits all complexions and is a staple part of many Indian women's makeup regime in India and abroad. It is especially flattering on darker skin, as it is typically not far off from one's natural lip color. Unlike people with paler complexions, if you have darker skin, you can pull off burgundy as an everyday lip color without looking overdone.







, While much more bold and adventurous than burgundy, bright reds also pair well with dark skin.









Orangey ""fire"" red shades are great for bold daytime makeup.
Use cooler and more neutral bold reds for a dramatic nighttime look., While they may look great as blush and eyeshadow, these colors don't work as well when used as lip colors. They can make your skin look dull and lifeless. Lip colors that are very glossy, frosty, and shimmery can cause the same issue.


When you do choose to go pale and glossy, favor pinks and corals with intense rather than muted hues. http:

Be sure to look for one for sensitive skin if your skin reacts to products.
Look on the bottle to see which one is appropriate for your skin type. You'll find ones for oily, normal, and dry skin, so focus in on the one that's best for you.
A tinted moisturizer can help cover up splotchy skin.;
, If you feel like you need a foundation, you can work it into your skin with a sponge now. Use a concealer where you need it. Mostly, you just want to focus on any problem areas, such as areas that are broken out, red, or splotchy. Smooth the concealer into your skin.








Set everything with a powder when you're done.
When picking these products, make sure they match your skin by testing them on the back of your hand.

, One option for a casual look is to simply add highlighter in place of blush. Run it along your cheekbones and across your nose. Blend it in with a sponge or brush so that it goes smoothly into your powder. The highlighter gives your skin a nice glow.








You can also use a little bit of blush.
Choose a light color like pink that looks good with your skin tone. Brush just a little bit along your cheek bones., For a casual date, you may not want to go for something too bold and dark. Instead, pick something light and flirty. A pink lipstick is a good choice that says you want to look nice, but you're still keeping things casual.








Try lining your lips with a similar color, then filling it in with the pink lipstick or covering your lips with a pink gloss.
You can also go for a nude color that blends in with your skin.

, If your eyebrows aren't as dramatic as you'd like, you can use an eyebrow pencil to help fill them in. Pick a pencil that is similar in color to your hair color. Use it to make gentle strokes across your eyebrow, going in the same direction as the hair grows.








Brushing can help blend the color out.
Use a small spoolie brush to comb out your eyebrows in the direction the hair grows. A spoolie brush is what comes in your mascara, but you can buy them separately, too., For a really simple eye, pick a pretty, light color that shimmers. Brush it along the bottom edge of your eyelid, then blend it upward. You don't want a line of color. Rather, you want it slightly darker at the bottom, and then you want it to get lighter as you brush it upwards.








You can also work with separate colors. Start with a base color that you apply along your crease and most of your eyelid. For a casual date, go for something light, like a peachy taupe.
Next, add a highlight color. This color should be brighter than the first color. It goes along your brow bone, just under your eyebrow.
Pick a darker color for the edge. You can use something like a navy for a bit of color, then run it along the bottom of your eye, creating a small wing past the corner of your eye. You can also use it or another dark color under your eye, if you wish, though only do about a third of your eye underneath.
Pick a contour color. Select a color that's a little darker than your skin. Use a brush to run along the socket of your eye, creating a contour. Stop when you've gone in about a third of your eye., If you've already lined your eyes with eye shadow, you can skip the liner here. However, you can also go with a standard black liner. A liquid liner works best, and you can run it along the edge of your eyelash, creating a little tip at the edge.








A simple way to line your eyes but not go overboard is to use a matte color eye shadow that's a little darker than your shadow and is in a dark skin tone.
Run it across the bottom of your eyelids to line them., Start by curling your eyelashes with an eyelash curler. You can use fake eyelashes, but it may be a little too much for casual date. Next, add mascara to your eyelashes, brushing upward on the top lashes and downward on the bottom lashes. Be sure to add several coats.







, One simple look is to create shiny hair that you wear mostly down with a headband. The headband can be small and cute or big and bold, though you may not want to go overboard for a casual date.For shiny hair, try an at-home oil treatment or leave-in conditioner.
When blow-drying, guide the hair with a round brush. Once it's dry, create large curls with a curling iron. Make sure to curl away from you face.

, For a quick fix, part your hair down the middle. On one side, pull some of your hair up into a clip. The clip can be cute and whimsical or romantic and bold. You can go as small or as big as you want for the clip, from a tiny bobby pin to a big, bold sparkly clip.







, As you blow dry your hair, guide it with a round brush so you have a bit of curl. The brush also helps develop volume. Also, be sure to plump your hair near the roots by using a comb to tease it upward. Once you're done, you can pull it into an updo. Part your hair down the middle first.








One easy updo involves a simple twist. Gather your hair at the base of your head, then twist it around a few times. Pull it upwards, then hold it in place with bobby pins.
This updo is supposed to be a bit messy, with the ends hanging out and some hairs framing your face.
Hold it in place with a bit of hairspray.

, Blow dry your hair, using a round brush to help shape it. Once it's dry, use a large-barreled curling iron to create some large curls, always curling downward. Next, pull your hair up into a large ponytail, making sure to keep some of the volume you've created.For extra chicness, wrap a strand of your ponytail around the band a few times, and then pin it down with bobby pins.
If your hair is already wavy, you can use a mousse then let your hair tousle dry.

Ask a trusted sighted person, preferably a female, if it looks ok.

",How to Apply Makeup if You Are Completely Blind," For example, learn where your cheek bones are and where your hairline is. This will help with further steps.;
, You may need a sighted person to assist you with this. An in-depth list of products you might want are listed in the Things You'll Need section.

, This is optional but strongly recommended.

, First, wash your hands. Make sure they are cold, as this helps you feel where your putting your makeup.

, If you use moisturisers, apply them. Wash your face. Do what ever you usually do with your face.

, Ideally, a table. Place any protective items on the table. Also, it may be useful if you place something you don't mind getting messy on your clothing., This may be difficult. First. if you use a liquid foundation, tip the bottle slightly so that a few drops come out. Make sure it's not too much. Gently spread the foundation between your fingers. Then apply in this way:


Circular motions on chin.
Circular motions on cheeks.
Small circle motions on nose.
Circular motions from nose to temples.
Circular motions on forehead.
Small circular motions under nose. Don't apply too much in this area as it tends to lie here. Make sure you rub your foundation in well.

, If you use a powder, either a foundation or for over the top of your foundation; you will need to apply this correctly as well. First, get your powder brush and get some powder on it. Gently spread this on your face. Wait until you believe it has covered your whole face and then rub it in, but not too much.

, Smile big and feel just under your eyes. When you feel the apple of your cheek, your cheek bone, drag your blusher brush from here towards your ear. Blend your blusher slightly by gently rubbing it in but don't let it get too low on your cheek. Ideally no lower than the bottom of your nose.

, This is extremely difficult, but with practice, you will get the hang of it. Get some eye shadow on your applicator. Then place the brush on the inside of your right eye. Gently drag the brush from the inside to the outside of your eye. Do this as many times as you would like and until you think it's covered your whole eyelid. Repeat on your left eye.

, This is only for advanced makeup appliers. Pull the mascara applicator out of the bottle. Do not pump the lid; this gets air in to your mascara and makes it dry out very quickly. Next, place the pad of your finger on the very end of your applicator. Open your eyes. Gently place your finger against the bridge of your nose. Pull the mascara brush up your eyelash until you think that you have enough. Transfer over to the other eye. Note, you don't have to switch fingers; just place your same finger on the far left side of your eye. Remember to wipe off your finger with a makeup remover wipe. Give under your eyes a wipe as well. Try to keep your eyes open

, This one is easy. Just drag witch ever applicator you use across your lip a few times, then rub your lips together.

,, Wash your hands again. Wash your table if need be.

Determine your skin tone and undertone.,
With your skin tone and undertone in mind, choose your foundation carefully.,
Invest in a good concealer to remedy dark shadows.,
Groom and define brows daily.,
Eyeliner and mascara are crucial.,
Experiment with eye shadow shades.,
Use blush to contour and sculpt the face.,
Choose the correct lip color.",How to Apply Makeup for Middle Eastern Skin Tones," Middle Eastern skin can range from a light cream color to a deep brown shade and can have either cool or warm undertones. In order to determine your skin's undertone, consider whether you feel you look better wearing white or cream, silver or gold. If you think you look better in white and silver, you are considered to have a cool undertone, and if you prefer cream and gold, you are considered to have a warm, yellow or tawny-based undertone.;
, If you must guess your shade, err on the darker side, which will warm your complexion. A foundation that is too pale can look masky and unflattering, particularly on darker skins. If you have a darker complexion, try to avoid foundations with titanium dioxide (a sunscreen that can look ashy on darker skin, especially in photos) in them. Some foundations, such as Revlon Custom Creations, allow you to customize your shade for a more accurate match, which can be useful if you are unsure about the correct shade. Powder is not necessary, but helps control shine on oilier skin and add longevity to makeup if you choose to wear it.

, Many Middle Eastern women suffer from dark shadows underneath the eyes and around the lips. A separate concealer should be used for these areas, with another used for blemishes. A blemish concealer should be light in texture and match your skin tone, while concealers for dark shadows should be heavier and creamier and slightly lighter than your skin tone. Apply concealer before foundation to avoid a patchy look.

, Brows are a very important facial feature and should be shaped regularly. When applying your makeup, brush your brows, and if you choose, fill them in with a brow pencil. Some Middle Eastern women have sparse brows, and filling them in adds necessary fullness, but be careful not to ""overdraw,"" making your brows look unnatural.

, As women age, eyes can begin to look droopy and tired. This is of particular concern for Middle Eastern women. In general, stick to black or black-brown shades for eyeliner and mascara. The darker your complexion, the more intense black you should use. Always curl your eyelashes to lift the eye and enhance the look of the lashes. If you have dark shadows, avoid using eyeliner and mascara beneath the eye, as it can add to darkness. Instead create a dark, defined line on the top lid to make eyes appear bigger, brighter, and lifted. Apply black mascara as your last step in doing your eye makeup.

, A vast majority of Middle Eastern women have an eye color in the brown range. Brown and copper eye shades will complement your eye color, while blue and purple shades will contrast it. Both will enhance and beautify your eyes. Gray, silver, gold, black, and cream shades are universally flattering, but avoid peach, coral or pink shades as they can clash with your eye color and skin tone. Paper-white shades are also not the best, unless used in very small amounts on the inner corner of the eye or just below the brow bone. Darker tones can handle brighter and darker colors, while lighter skin demands slightly subtler shade choice.

, Avoid pink, red or plum shades and instead choose dark, tawny peach or bronze shades. Bronzers make excellent blushes for Middle Eastern skin, especially darker-toned skin. If you want more sculpted, defined cheekbones, apply blush just beneath the cheekbones and use a highlighter (YSL Eclat Miracle is a popular brand) on the cheekbones themselves. For a fuller, less sallow face, apply blush on the apples and sides of the cheeks.

, In general, lighter skin looks best in dark mauve, dusty rose, shimmery bronze, light brown and burgundy shades. Darker skin is flattered by wine, plum, raisin and chocolate brown shades. All Middle Eastern skin tones should generally avoid lip colors with too much silver in them (commonly seen in pink and red lip colors,) which looks metallic and unnatural. Bright blue-red colors are also not the best. Warmer, crimson reds should be worn instead.

If your face is always shiny, you breakout easily, and you tend to have larger pores, you probably have oily skin. If your face has rough or red patches, barely visible pores, or flaking skin, you probably have dry skin. If your face has parts that seem oily and other parts that seem dry, you have combination skin.If you have oily skin with larger pores you should use a matte foundation to help dry up your skin’s natural oils.
Girls with dry skin should moisturize first, and then use a creamy foundation rather than a matte one. This will keep your skin moisturized and looking fresh.
If you have combination skin, you should pick a foundation that will give you your desired end effect.;
, Undertones are the base of your skin’s color, and they are divided in three different categories: cool, warm, or neutral. Your foundation color should be in the same category as your skin’s undertones. You can do some simple tests to figure out what undertones you have.








The white vs. cream test: get two articles of clothing, one white and one off-white. Hold them up to your face, look in the mirror, and decide which color complements your skin tone better. Make sure you don’t have any makeup on when you do the test. If the white looks better, you have warm undertones. If the off-white looks best, you have cool undertones, and if both look great, then you have neutral undertones.
The vein test: Look at the veins on your wrist and try to see if they look green, blue, or blue-green. Green veins means you have warm undertones, blue veins means you have cool undertones, and blue-green veins means you have neutral undertones.
The jewelry test: Get some gold jewelry and some silver jewelry to do this test. Try on both sets of jewelry and decide which jewelry flatters you the most. If wearing gold jewelry looks best, you have warm undertones, but if the silver jewelry looks best, you have cool undertones. If both types of jewelry flatter your complexion, you have neutral undertones.

, Sometimes dark skinned girls have a difficult time finding the right color foundation because many girls are naturally two toned and have a complex color. The best way to find the perfect foundation is to use several different colors together to match your skin.You might find that your skin is lighter towards the center of your face and darker towards the outer edges. Using two different colors on the different parts of your face and then blending them together where they meet will help you get a very natural look with foundation.

, You need to wash and dry your face before applying foundation. If your skin is dry, apply moisturizer prior to putting foundation on. If your skin is oily, try using a face priming gel to prep your face for the foundation., A foundation brush is a larger makeup brush with a rounded edge. Using a brush will apply your foundation consistently and smoothly on your face. Put the foundation only on the tip of the brush to avoid over saturating the brush.








Make sure to rinse the brush after every application to keep it clean and sanitary.

, Before every application you need to shake the foundation bottle well. The colors of liquid foundation can slightly separate and create an uneven tone if not mixed before applying., Start in the center of your face and blend the foundation out and up. Continue applying until your entire face is covered and evenly blended.If you are using two different colors of foundation on your face, apply the lighter tone first, then apply the darker tone, and then use the brush to blend them together where they meet.

, Use a buffing brush or sponge to blend the foundation into your skin. Gently brush or sponge your face in a circular motion to blend the foundation and soften the look.








Make sure to buff around your jaw line and neck so you don't end up with a foundation line.

, Girls with darker skin can wear very bright colors on their eyes and look great. The best bright colors for dark skin are bright jewel tones like blue,emerald, or purple. Bright colors really pop against dark skin and give you a dramatic look., Using two complementing colors on your eye will create a fun, dramatic look. Try pairing gold and purple by applying the purple on your eyelid and layering the gold on top, closer to your eyebrow., Wearing neutral eye shadows in shades of brown or nude can highlight your eyes and still look very natural. Blending several different neutral colors can create a unique look to wear everyday.Stay away from whites or very light neutral colors. These colors can create a dry or ashy look on darker skin.

, Metallic, or shimmering, eye shadows look amazing on dark skin because they are such a contrast to your rich, dark skin color. Eye shadows with shimmer really gleam on darker skin making it a perfect choice for a date night.


Try using metallic jewel toned eye shadows to give you a dramatic look.

, Eye liner can make your eyes look bigger and create a dramatic look. Black and brown eye liners are great for a natural look, and colored eyeliners are fun to use to create a more dramatic look. Use mascara to lengthen and thicken your eye lashes to complete your flawless look. Find a good black mascara to use daily to enhance your lashes.








, A great trick for girls with dark skin is to use a bronzer as blush or applied over a neutral blush. Bronzer gives the cheeks a little extra color and highlights the cheek bones.Apply the bronzer right under your cheekbones to create sculpt on your face.

, Bright colors can look great on dark skin if they complement the skin’s undertones. Bright pinks and corals are great colors to try out.For a round face, apply the blush on your cheekbones and extend it up to your temples.
For a heart shaped face, apply the blush below the apples of your cheeks and pull it to your hairline.
For a long face, apply the blush below the apples, but don't extend it all the way to your hairline.

, Using both blush and bronzer can give you a beautiful and elegant look. Apply a matte blush to your cheekbones and then sweep the bronzer over the blush to finish it off. You can also add more bronzer underneath your cheekbones to create a sculpting effect.








, Bright colors look exceptionally well on girls with dark skin. Reds, oranges, and deep purples all are great choices for your lips.To look the best, make sure the color matches your skin’s undertones. For yellow undertones, stick to warm colors like oranges or chocolate browns. For pink undertones, use cool colors like purples or colors with a blue tone in them.

, If you want to wear neutral colors make sure you find a color that’s close to your natural skin tone. Light-colored nudes like white, tan, or pale browns may look less natural., Applying lip gloss on top of lipstick can be a great way to finish off you look. The lip gloss can help keep your lips moisturized throughout the day or night.


You can get a clear lip gloss or a colored gloss to enhance the lipstick.
Try using an oil like coconut oil as a natural lip gloss.

If you will use a pore-cleaning strip, do it the day before to avoid makeup get caught in your newly cleansed pores. Exfoliate to feel that silky smooth texture of your skin.;
, Help anchor your makeup over your freshly washed face using a lightweight moisturizer. Try a primer if you need something stronger. On the day of your shoot, bring cream or lotion to keep your skin (not only the face) retain its moisture.

,  Smoothen out your skin tone by adding a layer of powder or foundation if you prefer it. Translucent powder is light and easy to apply. Use them to blend the color of your face. When using foundation however, make sure to apply it on your neck and ears as well.

, Blending with your fingertips, dab few dots underneath your eyes and on the sides of your nose bridge. If you have gotten a bit too much sun recently, dab some more and gently spread it. Hit any other small blemishes on your face. Be careful not to get too cake-like look. While concealer is good for spots where your skin has a different tone, using it in an attempt to hide scars will actually make them more conspicuous. So just leave scars as they are and let your photographer hide them in the post process of your photos.

, Surely you want to keep natural looking brow. You can get your brows done in a salon for dramatic look but if you want to be more in control, just get your tweezers and remove strays around the main brow shape. Never create an inadvertent asymmetry. Find the shape and proportion that works for your face and style. For a cleaner shape, scissors can help you to trim the brow hairs. Also keep in mind that hair removing should be a ritual done day before the shoot.

People with laid-back attitudes know all too well that even the worst problems are temporary. If you often overreact in the face of issues, it’s time to take a chill pill.


Instead of stomping off in anger or frustration or running what went wrong through your head over and over, take a deep breath. Breathe in through your nose for a few counts. Hold it, and then release the air through your mouth for a few counts. Repeat this until you feel calm and able to view the issue more objectively.Accept that “This, too, shall pass” by repeating the phrase to yourself whenever you encounter a problem that causes you to want to overreact. Remember that you don’t own all the problems of the world.
Practice mindfulness to help maintain emotional composure. Let in comments, ideas, and opinions without judgment or offense. Realize that these are a reflection on the person saying them and have little to do with you personally. Remind yourself that you are competent and able to deal with life’s problems as they arise.;
, Does it really matter if you have to bend down and pick up the papers you dropped? Does it really matter if you miss your bus? I think you will find that most times it doesn't really matter. Most issues we encounter on a daily basis seem important, but are truly minimal and inconsequential.


Question whether what you are getting upset about really is a big deal. Doing this helps you identify unnecessary stressors before they explode out of your control. Ask yourself “Will this affect my life in 1 year? 5 years?” If the answer is “no”, let it roll off your back like a bead of sweat and keep on with your day., If it should turn out that it matters, be sure to consider if there is anything you can do about it right now. Sometimes, you may find yourself getting caught up in circumstances that are really out of your control. Ask if there is something you can do. If there is, go ahead and do it. If there isn't, what's the use of letting it get to you?


You can’t control things like the weather, politics, or the stock market, so there’s no use getting yourself upset when these types of things don’t go your way. Instead, focus your attention on all the things that you can control like your productivity, creativity, thought patterns and your character., Conflict doesn’t have to increase the distance between two people. It can actually be a benchmark to bring people closer together. When in disagreement, try not to focus on your differences with others. That is, what you believe to be true versus what they believe to be true. You can make more of an impact by highlighting mutual interests.An easy-going person respects the differences of others and is willing to listen and negotiate. Don’t get stuck in the mind frame that one of you has to be wrong. Look for the common ground and use that to resolve the issue.
For example, you and a friend are in disagreement over where to go for lunch. Both of you have different opinions and don’t seem willing to bend. To move the discussion forward, suggest to your friend that you both list all the places or types of cuisine that you absolutely do not want to go to. Then, you can use that common ground to find a place where you both wouldn’t mind eating.

, A great way to develop more laid-back thinking habits is to notice when you are being negative and put a positive spin on it.After you bring awareness to a bad attitude, you are more likely to catch it mounting in the future and not let it get the best of you.


For example, if you find yourself saying “I can never catch a break,” you should immediately look for an example that renders that statement untrue. Did you catch a break last week or even last month? Remind yourself of that opportunity and revise your statement: “I’m having a hard time right now, but it will get better.”

, One of the best antidotes for beating worry is to focus on the good. You can do that by taking time each day and pointing out what you are thankful for in your life. Grateful people heal from sickness faster, are happier, and are more resilient to life’s problems. Plus, when you are aware of all that you have to be thankful for, you are less likely to ruminate over a bad situation and get stuck in a negative rut.Take some time at the end of each day to write down at least three things you are grateful for in a gratitude journal. When you feel down, review your journal and remind yourself of the positive things happening in your life.

, Easy-going people have warm, happy, and supportive social connections. Having positive social interactions with friends, co-workers, and family can motivate you to make better health decisions and even live a longer life. The quality of your relationships does count thought. Be sure your relationships include satisfying interactions with people who make you feel better about yourself and your life., Laid-back and happy people are that way because they know how to have fun. When it comes to fun, having a sense of humor is an essential ingredient. Laughter provides relaxation, boosts cardiovascular functioning, and makes you more resistant to illness.Tell a joke to a friend. Watch a hilarious comedy TV show or movie. View crazy cat videos on YouTube. Make a commitment to laughing a few times a day—it’s the best medicine., Being overly serious can work against you if you are hoping to become more easy-going. Laid-back people tend to move with the tide rather than pushing against it. Even if you’re an adult with an important job, that doesn’t mean you have to be totally serious all the time. When it’s necessary to take a serious approach, do that. But during leisure time, make a commitment to lightening up some. Doing this will even make you more likeable to others.Say yes more. Make an effort to be more spontaneous. Even if you are more comfortable planning things out, once in a while say yes to a friend's random idea or spontaneous adventure.

, Assigning the job of keeping you happy to someone else will keep you frustrated and dissatisfied. You alone are responsible for how you feel. No one can make you happy without your permission. Just as no one can negatively affect your mood without your permission. The same goes in reverse: you are not responsible for anyone else’s happiness., You can help yourself become more easy-going by attending to your physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual needs.


Eat well, exercise, and do relaxation exercises to improve your physical health and well-being.
Hang out with friends, engage in fun activities, and schedule in some down-time to manage stress.
Nurture your spiritual health by journaling, meditating, taking walks in nature, or praying. Do whatever works for you!

, Without a doubt, a guaranteed way to transform your mindset is to change what you are doing with your days. You may feel too serious because you spend your days doing something you do not enjoy. Perhaps, in an effort to become more easy-going, you will find that what you are doing is not inspiring you to have a positive, laid-back attitude.Consider what you do every day and what you really wish you could do with your time. Is there any way to change your schedule to do more of what you love? Of course, not everyone will be able to overhaul their life and start a career based on their passions.
If this is you, then try to dedicate a few hours a day or week to doing something you are passionate about, whether that is volunteering, teaching, making art, or planting your garden. Notice how improved your attitude is after doing more of what you love., Being self-conscious about who you are and what you are doing will never result in a care-free lifestyle. Easy-going people focus on their own goals and happiness, not what other people think. If you have to live your life on guard of what you say or how you look, you will miss out on all the opportunities to bask in self-love and acceptance.Overcome this habit by reminding yourself that “What other people think about me is none of my business!” Tell yourself this whenever you catch your thoughts going into the direction.
Another strategy is to extend love and compassion to yourself. Give yourself a hug. Pat yourself on the back after even your minor achievements. This releases you from the need to seek approval from others. When you feel good about you, it doesn’t matter what others think.

Always remember to be sensible.,
Evaluate your ""yes"" skills from time to time.",How to Be More Spontaneous," Before you start to change, pinpoint the areas of your life that are somewhat rigid and could use some loosening up. What patterns do you repeat?


Start when you get up in the morning. What's the first thing you want to do in the morning? When does your routine start?
Keep a notebook with you on a normal day and make a note of every time you do something that feels routine. If you walk to work, do you walk the same way every day? Do you sit in the same desk during classes? Bring the same kind of things for lunch? Always order the same meal at a restaurant? Always ride the same bus? What about your clothes?;
, Often, repetitive behaviors are the result of deeply ingrained anxieties and limiting beliefs that show up in unexpected ways. As you begin to note the content of your routine in a given day, consider the possibility of changing each item. Does it make you nervous to consider NOT ordering that drink at Starbucks? Or taking the bus instead of walking? What's scary about the idea?


Write these down next to the steps in your routine. Try to be as specific as possible. What's scary about sitting next to a stranger and being drawn into conversation? What keeps you from visiting that new restaurant?
Ask your friends and family for help. Often, your friends will know you better than you know yourself. Ask simply, ""Am I predictable?"" If you suspect you are, they'll probably have particular patterns identified that you may not even be aware of.

, Part of spontaneity is being active. During the day, make note of the times that you're sitting around the house with nothing in particular to do, or times that you're bored. What do you choose to do with that time?


When you list these, also make note of ""dream days."" If you were doing anything with that time, given unlimited resources and opportunities, what would you do? What would make for the perfect evening after work or school?

, Look back over your list and decide what you'd like to change. Some routine is good--having habits can keep us productive and comfortable. But some routine is the result of our limiting beliefs and anxieties keeping us lazy and unwilling to stretch out and experience new things.


In particular, note things on your list that you're embarrassed about. If your perfect evening would consist of going dancing but you typically spend it playing video games you feel guilty for playing, that's a sign of a changeable routine. If you always order the Americano because you love espresso and because it's the cheapest thing on the menu, why change?

, Mix your patterns up just a little bit, based on your list of changeable routines. Take a different route to work. Bring your lunch instead of visiting the cafeteria. Call a friend and meet for drinks downtown instead of going straight home after work. Study in the library instead of at a coffee shop. Does it make you feel any better? More anxious?

, Often a lack of spontaneity leads to feelings of loneliness. We think everyone else is out having fun and you're stuck at home. Yet, when you're thinking of making plans, you go solo.


Invite people along for simple things. If a few beers on the porch is an average night for you, it can suddenly be a significant event if it includes an old friend from high school. Catch up, make plans to do more.

, Spontaneity involves ""keeping people guessing"" as much as it does keeping yourself entertained. Next time someone asks about your weekend, try saying something like, ""It was thoroughly exhausting. And yours?"" Cryptic responses to questions will make people curious about you and how you spend your time, drawing them in and giving you more options for spontaneous adventures.

, It's easy to come up with reasons not to do things. Instead of worrying about whether your whim will eventually fail or whether you'll regret eating after 10pm, just do it.


If you find yourself regretting not acting on these whims, especially, learn to recognize them and act upon them.

, When talking with friends, it can be easy to make vague plans for the future: ""We should go camping sometime"" or ""Let's meet for lunch soon."" Instead of doing this, decide on a date and an activity and set it. Turn ""I hope we do something for spring break"" into ""Let's book a flight right now.""


Alternatively, if you are a habitual and intricate planner, decide to actively NOT plan. Maybe say you'll meet up with someone later, but don't think of anything to do together. Meet in an unfamiliar part of town and explore it together.

, Sometimes it's easy to get locked in a routine when you're in the same place all the time. Particularly if you live a medium-small town, you can exhaust the possibilities for activities relatively quickly.


Spend time planning a trip but also leave blank days to allow for new plans and possibilities. If the worst case scenario is that you walk around a new place aimlessly for a day, you're in pretty good shape.
It doesn't have to be expensive. Even hanging out in the adjacent town's cheap coffee shop open-mic can be a new thrill compared to a usual Friday night in your own town.

, Saying no creates a cycle of things you do every day. Do you get offered karate classes but turn them down because you're not into it? Does a friend ask you to go to a new place, but you say no because you're skeptical? Taking ""no"" out of your vocabulary opens up a world of possibilities.


Saying yes can take you on a journey. Just think, do you know exactly what you're going to do tomorrow? If you're open to opportunity, anything could happen.

, All of us have different voices we listen to. We have the one voice that's full of crazy, creative, spur-of-the-moment thoughts and ideas. The one that sees that new Japanese-Italian fusion restaurant and says, ""Go in!"" The one that sees the online coupon for a pottery class and thinks, ""I could like that."" Don't ignore that voice! Say yes to yourself, too.


And then there's the voice that's much more practical and logical. The one that likes routine and simplicity. Don't let that voice take center stage. If you find yourself using it, ask yourself why this voice should win out. Odds are it shouldn't!

, Let's be clear, here: if a friend of yours tells you to jump off a cliff, don't say yes. If you have the opportunity to get so drunk you'll black out, don't say yes. If your neighbor asks you for a million dollars, don't say yes. Think of it this way: there are few situations where ""yes"" just isn't an option. If yes is an option, than you should probably go for it. It's important to know the difference!


Always act in your best interest. If you have no desire to go to that glow-in-the-dark bubble rave, don't go. You'll just have a miserable time. Saying yes isn't about forcing yourself to do things -- it's about forcing yourself to do things you might like and never get around to.

, This whole open-to-everything life philosophy is going to lead to some great opportunities. However, it's also going to lead to a few duds. After you've been at it for a while, take a look at what works and what doesn't. Maybe you should only say yes to one thing a day. Maybe you should only say yes to things you know you won't regret. How can you make the ""yes"" system work for you?


Be sure to look for what seems to be the most effective for you. If you're finding new restaurants, cafes, and places to hit up in town, great! Concentrate on that. If you're hanging out with people you'd rather not be hanging out with, you may want to start declining invitations on that front. Use your spontaneity to make life more enjoyable -- not more hectic or challenging.

, If you are addressing someone who is taller than you, suggest sitting down so you are at the same height.

Look for opportunities to make mischief.,
Take life less seriously.,
Have mischievous role models.,
Avoid taking things too far.",How to Be Mischievous1," Every seemingly normal situation can be made funnier and more interesting when you add some mischief. Change the way you see everyday life in order to create something fresh and act differently.For example, instead of seeing a banana on the table as just a piece of fruit, pick it up and start talking to your dentist. Cultivate your impulsive side by acting in ways you might not normally act.
Being mischievous relies on your ability to act spontaneous. The point is to always be on the lookout for an opportunity.;
, Risk taking is a critical aspect of being mischievous. Live to your fullest potential by not worrying too much about the consequences. If you tend to be a serious person, this can be a difficult. Try to replace your feelings of stress or anxiety with lightheartedness.For example: it’s late at night. You and your friends are bored and hungry. That's the perfect opportunity to go outside and find an adventure. Why not take a late night walk to the 24-hour diner across town?

, There might be someone in your friend group, class, or at work who is considered mischievous. Observe how they crack jokes or play practical jokes for fun. There is no need to seek out people who vandalize public property. These people aren't being mischievous; they're just being jerks.


Don’t ask for advice from this person, but instead observe how they act. You could even try to hang out with them if it is appropriate.
There are many famous characters who are mischievous. For example, Peter Pan values play and friendship over anything else. Peter Pan can be reckless, but that is what makes him an influential and mischievous leader to the Lost Boys., While you are first starting to get the hang of acting mischievous, you need to be careful you don't take things too far. If you are ever in a situation where somebody may be hurt physically or emotionally, back out of the prank. Avoid anything that is illegal, like graffiti or arson.


There is a line between mild jesting and being a nuisance. It is not always clear, in the beginning, what side of the line you stand on.
Take advice from your peers seriously. If your friend says you are acting hurtful, you are becoming more of a nuisance than a mischief.

Withhold excessive displays of emotion.,
Be yourself.",How to Be Macho1," A macho guy can take care of himself and his family. If you want to cultivate a macho persona, learn to do more things for yourself and rely on others less for basic tasks. Can you change the oil in your car or do you take it to the shop? A macho guy should know how to intelligently approach any situation that calls for it without panicking. Here's a brief list of macho stuff it would be good for any guy to know:


take care of your car



 



fix a leaky faucet







throw a knife







cook a steak properly







shoot a gun







drink whiskey







shave with a straight razor







find water







butcher meat







survive in the wilderness







win a fight





;
, Playing Xbox is fun and all, but there are probably more macho things you could be doing. A macho guy gets outside and does things with his hands. Masculine hobbies can be a great way of bonding with other men and feeling the testosterone flow freely. Try out a few macho activities to see what you like:


fishing







soccer







golfing







boxing







motorcycling







reading







skeet-shooting







, A macho guy is an intelligent guy who makes learning as much as he can about something a big priority. Whether it's for work or a hobby, you should actively try to learn and master a subject. People should want to come to you for help because of your expertise in a particular subject, not the other way around.Never take others down for knowing more than you do about something. It doesn't make you macho to treat ignorance like it's some kind of ""cool"" thing, it just makes you stupid.
If you're really talented, you'll be able to back up your talk with action. Bragging to your friends about how great you are in the sack, how fast your new car goes, or how great your outside jump shot is may be macho, or it may just be a load of lies. Brag about something worth bragging about.

, Being macho is no fun if you don't have an A-team of like-minded macho dudes ready to stomp around the woods getting wild and howling at the moon with. Every man needs other men to bro-down with and get in touch with their jerky-eating, beer-swilling, shadow-boxing, knife-wielding genes. Get some macho friends and do macho things.

Find masculine role models that you respect and learn from them. If you're learning a trade, apprentice yourself to a man that you admire personally and professionally and learn everything you can from him.
Spend time with your male family members to get to know them a little better. Try to strengthen your relationship with your father, your uncles, and your male cousins. Blood between macho men should be thick.

, When a macho guy scores a touchdown, he calmly walks over to the referee, hands him the ball, and gets back to the scrimmage. Business as usual. Showing off is for guys who have to compensate, because macho guys are cool and detached and unaffected. A macho guy should look like you'd want to give him the leadership role when the post-apocalypse goes down, because he's the one staring into the crowd of zombies with a bored smirk. Macho guys should neither be crushed by a failure or overcome by a success. Treat anything that happens, good or bad, as a curiosity.

If you ever have to cry in public, be stoic and calm, speaking without a cracking voice. Macho tears are like rain in the desert: it should be shocking, but not unappreciated. People will know the situation is serious if a macho guy like you is shedding a single gravely tear.

, Being macho doesn't mean you have to drive your car recklessly, drink too much, and treat everyone like dirt. A real man acts like himself, stands up for what he believes in, and is a genuine person, first and foremost. A real macho guy isn't putting on an act, he's just being a man.

Be a family man.",How to Be Manly," Manly men don't have to look like Conan the Barbarian, but they do need to take care of their bodies. Fellow men and women alike admire strength and athleticism. If you're not already in good shape, immediately set aside some time in your schedule to exercise every day. Exercise will make you look and feel better. It can also help thwart depression, making you much better-suited for pursuing your other manly goals.Here are some steps you can take to develop your own manly physicality.


Lift weights. Strength-training exercises help build manly muscles and burn fat. Use proper technique and proceed slowly if you're new to weightlifting - you can hurt yourself with bad form.

If you're unsure of how to proceed and you can afford it, hire a personal trainer. S/he will help you craft an exercise routine that fits your precise needs.


Manly men are aware of the image they project - stand up straight and walk with purpose. An erect posture makes you look confident and may even make you feel more confident. A slumped posture appears beaten or submissive.
If you have high body fat, consider dieting. Dieting isn't womanly. It's responsible. Losing weight can decrease your risk for heart disease and other common health issues later in life.;
, Real men don't run from challenges or try to shirk their obligations. Rather, they take pride in being reliable and responsible. If other people feel like they can trust you, you'll quickly learn to trust yourself, which will bring increased confidence. Responsibility comes in many forms, depending on the roles you take on. Here are just a few aspects of life that may require you to take on new responsibility:


If you're a husband or father, become a leader in your family. Take an active role in child-raising and/or balance the household budget, for instance.
If you're a boyfriend, be a mature, reliable one. Plan dates and outings without being asked. Be emotionally available for your significant other when s/he needs it.
If you have a career, commit yourself to it. Take on challenging projects, even if it occasionally means staying late or working overtime. Be the one person your boss can trust - you'll earn much respect (and also job security!)
Emulate manly role models who excel in their careers and home life, whether they're familiar friends or famous heroes.

, Now for the fun stuff! Manly men are sexually confident - they know they're the most attractive person in the room, so they don't make idiots of themselves by trying too hard. Instead, they coolly and confidently approach people they find attractive and allow their charming, friendly personality to naturally steer conversations toward flirtation. Manly men are direct about what they want, but they're not boorish or arrogant. They like to have fun, but they always remember that their sexual prospects are human beings with their own needs and wants.


If you're single, work on your sexual confidence. Try to be dominant in your flirtatious conversations and in the bedroom. Don't get emotionally invested in relationships that don't exist yet!
If you're inexperienced, begin simply by getting out more.Talk to attractive people you meet without fear - if there's a mutual attraction, you might hit it off, and if not, you'll still get better at talking confidently.
Apply these principals to any committed relationships you find yourself in. Keep your confidence around your wife or girlfriend - surprise her by seducing her like you'd seduce someone you're meeting for the first time.

, A common misconception is that manly men have no emotions other than anger. Nothing could be further from the truth. Manly men experience a full spectrum of emotions - joy, sadness, regret, contentment, and every shade in between. However, a man never loses control of his emotions. He never allows himself to get so angry that he does something stupid. He never allows himself to get so sad that he ignores his responsibilities. He does what he needs to do to ensure he's emotionally ready to take charge of his life.


Honestly critique your emotional state - do your experience certain emotions illogically? Tackle your weaknesses head-on. Talk to friends or a counselor to put your emotional state in a new perspective.
Men and women both experience clinical depression, but depressed men are more likely to commit suicide.Depression can also lead men to neglect their family and career. If you are depressed, seek medical help. It's not manly to pretend nothing's wrong.

, Manly men aren't just sexy, strong brutes - they're clever as well. They don't have to be ""book-smart,"" but they do have to be open to learning throughout their whole life. A manly man has an opinion about almost everything, but his opinions won't be well-informed if he's not open to learning. Whatever your level of education, be as smart as you can be - it'll help you negotiate business deals, defuse arguments at home, make better decisions, and, most importantly, live a full, well-rounded life.


Take up a hobby! It's never too late to learn a musical instrument or a new language.
Join a debate team! Learning how to effectively argue is an important skill in almost all aspects of life.
Take classes at your local community college. You'll find new passions.
If you're ever proven wrong about something, admit it and move on. You gain nothing by obstinately refusing to change your mind.

, Manly men should be confident on their own, but they shouldn't be loners. Cultivating an active social life is great for your career aspirations (networking is a great way to get job referrals), but it's also a great way to meet single people. Plus, it's just plain fun. Get out there and meet people today!


Seek leadership roles in organizations. You'll meet plenty of people and earn their respect.
Join sports teams. Sports are a great way to improve your social life and your health at the same time.
Save your tenderest, most intimate emotions for your relationships, but be a rock on whom the more emotional can lean on.

, Manly men may prize certain people as role models, but they aspire to be no one but themselves. Be unique - don't buy in to fads or trends. Cultivate your own style and you'll never be mistaken for anyone else.The way you dress, speak, and carry yourself makes a lasting impression on people. Make sure it's an unforgettable one.


Never agree with someone just to fit in. Real men are self-assured, comfortable respectfully disagreeing with others when it's needed.
Do things that you like to do, without considering what other people will think. Do you like knitting, for instance? Then work at becoming the world's manliest knitter.

, Don't rest on your laurels - continue to work out every day, even if it's just to maintain the progress you've already made. A strong, healthy body makes every other aspect of life easier. You'll have more energy to work, play, and love like a man.


Enjoy your new strength and athleticism, but don't let it go to your head. Don't boast or show off unless it's in good humor - doing so is a sign of desperation for others' approval, not of confidence.
Pay attention to what you put into your body. Count your calories and avoid unhealthy foods.


, Stubborn close-mindedness often gets mistaken for manliness. In fact, it's far manlier to actively seek out new experiences - you can't strive for personal growth if you never step out of your comfort zone. Always try new things, provided you do so safely. It will broaden your horizons. You'll begin to learn what you like and what you don't like. You'll discover skills you didn't know you had. You'll be more interesting to your friends and sexier to women.


Be open to relationships with new kinds of people. Talk to everyone - you may find that people with different perspectives on life can inform your own opinions.
Take on new responsibilities at work and at home. Even if, for instance, you discover that you're not the best at paying your household's bills, you'll learn the process, which is a gift in itself.

, ""Manly"" isn't an easy thing to be. It's a quality marked by hard work and struggle. Teddy Roosevelt, one of the manliest men to ever live, had to work hard for years to overcome his poor health and achieve manliness. By overcoming obstacles, you move closer to the manly ideal. Tackle life's difficulties head-on!


Often, the biggest challenges can come with the day-in, day-out grinds of sustaining a career and a home life. In this case, the challenge may be something as simple as going to bed earlier so that you can wake up to take your child to school. Just because these challenges aren't glamorous doesn't mean they're not hard!
Seek new challenges out. If your career and home life aren't challenging, make new challenges for yourself! Sign up for a marathon

, You're not the only manly man in the world - eventually, you'll find yourself in competition with someone who's also confident, strong, and self-assured. Give it all you've got - a genuine competition is a great chance to test the manly skills you've worked hard to develop. Even if you don't win, you'll learn, and you'll be better-prepared to succeed the next time you find yourself locking horns with another alpha male.


If you win, be a gracious winner. Shake his hand, look him in the eye, and never gloat. Reflect on the qualities you possess that led you to victory, as well as the ones that made victory more difficult.
If you lose, lose like a man. Never give up before the competition is over, even if your odds seem slim. Don't whine or make excuse for yourself. Instead, try to find out why you lost so that you can devote extra practice to these areas,

, No man is perfect - even the manliest men make mistakes and experience great difficulty. Adversity is no reason to quit. Strive for the confident, strong manly ideal even when it eludes you. Remember, no one is born manly. It's something that must be eked out through hard work, struggle and sacrifice. When in doubt, remember that some of the manliest people ever had their own periods of darkness. Here are just a few examples:


John Wayne, once the epitome of American Masculinity, struggled through three marriages and a cigarette addiction that gave him cancer. Still, he kept his manliness to the end.Long before he was Rocky, Sylvester Stallone was a desperate, struggling young actor. For three weeks, he was homeless, sleeping in the New York Port Authority bus station until he got his first starring role - in a porno.He didn't become well-known until years later.
Mr. T. had a very rough life before he found fame. Raised in one of Chicago's roughest housing projects and expelled from college after only one year, he worked as a bouncer and bodyguard for years before landing his first film role., Whether you're dating a woman or not, you should treat her like a gentleman would. This doesn't mean subscribing to outdated ideas of chivalry (like, for instance, pushing in her chair for her). Rather, it means that you should extend her the respect and goodwill you would give a serious colleague. Listen to her when she talks. Respect her opinions, even if you disagree with them. Most importantly, treat her like an equal - she is.


No need to handle women with kid gloves. Many women love raunchy humor as much as men do. Making jokes (even lewd ones) with women isn't treating them disrespectfully - it's showing that you consider her enough of an equal to let your emotional guard down. Get a sense of a woman's personality first, then, if she seems game, joke away.
On the other hand, avoid the use of gendered insults like ""bitch,"" even if you're just joking. It's easy to make a bad habit of using these words and even easier to have your intentions be misunderstood. Manly men don't hurt peoples' feelings on the basis of their biological sex.
Never, ever commit an act of violence against a woman - it's one of the least-manly things you can do. That of course does not mean that you have to allow to a woman (or anybody else) to be violent, abusive or disrespectful toward you or anybody. Strength and violence are different things. To stop an abuse is a must, but does not necessarily need violence; use your brain power, instead.

, It's easy to respect your guy friends. It's much harder to respect the creep in the office who always breathes over your shoulder. A manly man does both. Manly men never bully or humiliate people. They also avoid participating in gossip. Anything you would scold your son for doing on the playground, you should avoid doing in the adult world.


Many times, annoying men won't even know they're annoying. If someone at the office has really bad breath, take them aside quietly and recommend some breath mints. Don't tease them in front of everyone at lunch. There's no reason to make someone suffer for something they're unaware of.
Life will sometimes require you to compete with other men. Compete as hard as you can, but remember that these men aren't evil just because they're in competition with you. They deserve your respect even as you work against them.

, Pursue excellence in your career and enjoy the rewards that you earn through your hard work, but never compromise your integrity or your family life for material wealth. The happiness you get from money is a fraction compared to what a happy home and family can offer. Act ethically in all your business dealings. Be competitive, but don't be a backstabber - a manly man never throws someone else under the bus for his own advancement.


Being honorable at work is its own reward. Coworkers and supervisors will notice your hard work. You'll earn the respect of your workplace and, more importantly, job security.
Seek out new responsibilities at work, but don't become so invested in your career that you neglect yourself or your family. If taking on a new duty means you won't ever be able to see your children before they go to sleep, pass it up.

, Your family should come first - before your career and even before yourself. This responsibility becomes even bigger if you have children. Make sure to spend time with your family, even if you're already working very hard. They'll return your love. Take your children to visit their grandparents. Spend an occasional weekend at the beach. Attend your children's sports games and school plays. The time you spend fostering love in your family is the time you'll remember most fondly in your old age.


A survey of over 1,000 UK parents showed they overwhelmingly valued time with their family over material wealth.If given the chance between working the whole weekend to put money away for a new car and spending the weekend with your family, opt for the one that will make you happier.

Stand up for yourself and push back.,
Use words and phrases that are direct, but not judgmental.,
Adjust the tone of your voice so it is even but firm.,
Refuse someone.",How to Be More Aggressive2," Express your point of view or needs in a way that is clear and direct. You want to come off as aggressive, not disrespectful.Make sure you have someone's full attention before talking. Talk face-to-face, not to their back.Say their name when addressing them.Be honest with the person you are confronting, but remember to listen to their point of view as well.

, Sounding condescending, accusing, or overly aggressive can make a situation escalate.


Words such as ""always"" or ""never"" tend to exaggerate statements and are good to avoid.Bring the conversation back to yourself. Use ""I"" instead of ""you"" statements, such as ""I feel..."" or ""I don't like it when..."". Follow these with facts., Shouting, whispering, or speaking with a shaky force will undermine anything you say.Speak at a level you would use for a normal conversation.
Pleading or whining will make you sound desperate or emotionally dishonest.
Speak in a clear, steady voice and do not hesitate.
If you are preparing to confront someone, practice what you want to say in advance in front of a mirror.

, If you feel like someone is trying to take advantage of you or asking you to do something you feel is unreasonable (e.g. borrow money), do not feel guilty telling them ""No"".


Follow these basic principles of saying ""No"": be brief, clear, firm, and honest.You can justify your response, but be brief and avoid excessive excuses.
Do not start every sentence with ""I'm sorry"". Being overly apologetic will make you look immature or insincere.
Reinforce your refusal with assertive body language. Maintain direct eye contact, hold your head up, keep your back straight, and relax your face and shoulders."

Listen to music.,
Participate in sports.,
Meditate or relax.,
Confront overly aggressive or passive-aggressive behavior in others.",How to Be More Aggressive3," Music can have the effect of stimulating emotional or physical arousal.Select a genre of music or songs that have a tempo of 80 to 130 beats per minute.Increase your heart rate by creating a playlist that organizes songs based on tempo, from slow (70-80 beats per minute) to fast (120-130 beats per minute).
You can also alternate between fast and slow, loud or soft songs.
Avoid music that triggers emotions such as anger or hostility.

, Physical exercise can help you develop discipline and self-control.Examples of sports that help reduce tension and positively channel aggression include:


Martial arts, especially Tae Kwon Do and Kung Fu.Running or aerobics.Weight-lifting or boxing.

, You can use relaxation techniques to prevent your aggression from developing into anger. Examples include:


Take slow, deep breathes that come from your gut and not your chest.Repeat a word or phrase in your head such as ""Relax"" or ""Calm down"" while breathing deeply.
Employ any of these techniques if you feel yourself getting tense or angry.

, If the source of your aggression or frustration is another person, you have a right to stand-up for yourself and be treated with respect.


Use humor to counter hostile behavior or unfair treatment.
Do not overreact. This will only lead to more drama and unnecessary aggression.
Deal with controlling or manipulating personalities by following a negative statement with a question or asking them to clarify their position. This will keep you in charge of the conversation.Choose your battles. Ask yourself if the other person's behavior is hurting you or just annoying. Sometimes keeping your distance is the best option."

Act on your impulses.,
Seek out competitions.,
Swear.,
Stall your time.,
Be untidy.,
Listen to loud music.",How to Be Mischievous2," If a thought of action enters your mind, go for it. Try to adjust your brain’s filter and act more spontaneously on what you want to do. Make a snowball and throw it at your buddy if the idea pops up. Spook a coworker by hiding behind their door. Draw a mustache on a poster on the side of the road.One aspect of acting on impulses is to take a step outside of your comfort zone. For example, instead of taking the same route home, go a different route, even if you’re unclear about the directions. You’ll be forced into a new area and will rely on your instincts to direct you.
Try to spend a day channeling your inner-practical joker. You could pick up a whoopee cushion from the dollar store and test it out on people. Another easy joke is the fake gum pack: purchase a trick gum pack and offer a stick to your friends. Instead of a stick of gum, they’ll get a small pinch.

, Creating contests everyday between your friends or yourself can enhance your days.Competitions can add fun and even a sense of danger to typical routine. Here are some examples of easy competitions you can try out:


You and a colleague play a contest of who can say “meow” in professional conversations the most.
Play a game of who can get through a crowded hallway or sidewalk the fastest.
See how many high fives you can get in a day.

, Swearing is not appropriate in many situations and can even get you grounded. The act of swearing can be viewed as a common trait to being mischievous. When you’re feeling flustered and don’t know where to turn; say a ‘’bad’’ word. Swearing allows people to release pain or anger by activating the brain's circuitry that is linked to emotions.Don’t cross the societal boundaries by swearing at the bank or in school. Use swear words with caution.If you're uncomfortable cursing, you can use safer words that give off the cursing effect like: ""dang,"" ""frick,"" or ""shoot.""

, In today’s culture of instant gratification, slowing down can actually be mischievous. Slowing down in aspects of your life can have positive mental benefits. If you are asked to speak for a presentation, begin by stalling with a joke. It can be more effective for the audience and yourself to stall for comfort.


You can use this idea for any part of your life. For example, try walking as slow as you can on the sidewalk or into class.
Use it in your speech for fun. For example: during a conversation with a family or friend, start slowing down your words. It will add a small bit of mischief to an everyday event.

, Don’t live a messy life, but don’t be afraid to create a mess. Though it may be your ritual to make your bed every morning, try leaving it unmade one day. Kick your shoes off and leave your socks in the middle of the floor. Go see a movie instead of doing your laundry or washing the dishes.


Being untidy signifies a carefree mentality, which can be interpreted as mischievous.If you tuck in your shirt everyday, leave it loose one day and see how you feel.

, Turn up your speaker to 7, instead of 3, and rock out. One of the best feelings is playing your favorite music in the summer with the windows down. You can irritate those around you by blasting music out of your car.


The punk rocker is a classic icon of mischief. Be a punk who values loud music and has an in-your-face attitude.
To get inspired, try listening to classic punk bands like The Ramones, The New York Dolls, or The Clash.

Cover someone's room with celebrity pictures.,
Wrap up someone's belongings.",How to Be Mischievous3," Mischief does not have to be a large act. Use your situation to create a prank without exerting much effort. Approach any situation as an opportunity to pull a mischievous prank. Act on your spontaneous thoughts as they enter your mind. Look at these examples of how to interact with an everyday situation:


When your teacher steps out of the room, run up and either erase something or write something unusual.
The same thing can be done to your boss. If they step away at lunch, move their pencil cup or rotate their computer in a new position. Do this in small increments each time. Then they are left to wonder at the change.

, Do you have a desire to make strange noises? Pick a moment when there are just 2-3 people in a room. Say something random or just make a silly noise. Pretend you didn't notice anything odd. You could also sing one of your favorite songs at a random time. Pretend you have headphones on, even if you don't. Keep your eyes closed for effect.


Be aware of angering people around you. Try not to annoy somebody on the street. If you’re confronted by someone, apologize and be silent.

, There is nothing more annoying and attention-grabbing. Use duct tape to tape an air horn’s base to a door stopper. Make sure the horn is facing towards the door. When someone enters the room, they’ll be shocked by the sound of the air horn.


If you’re in an office, you can do the same technique, but on an office seat. Use duct tape to tape the base of an air horn to legs of an office chair. When your colleague goes to sit down, they bounce back up with a fright from the air horn.

, You can pull this prank on a family member or on an office colleague. Print off a dozen different photos of the same celebrity. Then tape the pictures to the walls of their room or office.Use a celebrity that this person is annoyed, by like Justin Beaver or Martin Shkreli.


You could even take the prank further by writing out ""I love Kanye"" or whichever celebrity you plan to use. Write out this phrase several times on multiple sheets of paper.

, This is especially a good prank for the office environment or for a teacher. Take a few things on their desk, like a computer, stapler, textbook or keyboard, and wrap them up. You can use aluminum foil, Christmas wrapping paper or even old newspapers.For an added effect, wrap their entire desk with the same wrapping paper.

Provide for your family.,
Carry yourself with a macho swagger.,
Say what you mean and mean what you say.,
Lose graciously.,
Make people come to you.",How to Be Macho2," Be reliable and keep a good job so other people will be able to rely on you. Make yourself available and be a good role model for the other male members of your family. Teach them what you know and learn as much as you can about them.

Sometimes, what gets called ""macho"" is really just a guy compensating for a lack of confidence in himself and his ability to care for those around him. Guys who can't keep their own household together have to lash out at other guys, brag to everyone around them about how great they are, to keep up the status-quo. If you really do provide for your family, keep a good job, and make your partner happy, there's no need to compensate with faux-machismo.

, A macho guy is a confident guy with friends, strangers, and coworkers. People should notice when you walk in a room. Sit up straight, walk with good posture, and look people in the eye directly. Speak clearly and loudly and with conviction that the things you say are trustworthy, correct, and worth listening to.


A macho guy lets his presence be known physically and vocally, but without trying actively to intimidate others. There's a difference between being macho and being a jerk. Don't insult people to tear them down and hold yourself up. If you like to get into trash-talk sessions with your friends, draw the line somewhere.

, A macho guy stands up for what he believes in and speaks from an intelligent and informed point of view. Don't be afraid to speak your mind honestly and clearly. If you disagree with someone, let your disagreement be known respectfully, even if it would be easier to let it slide.

, Have the confidence to let failures and losses roll off your back. Learn to lose calmly and move on. A macho guy can lose graciously, win with humility, and learn from his mistakes, rather than letting them turn him into a defensive jerk.

It's also important to learn when you're wrong and admit it. If you're having an argument and start changing your mind, or if your decision turns out to be the wrong one, say so. Own up to it. Be a man.

, Macho guys will often cultivate a mysterious presence that acts like a magnet for people, especially women. If people think you're a man with secrets, a man who has something to say, they'll gravitate toward you and become interested. It's part sex appeal, part charisma, and part machismo.


Be quiet. Be a good listener, and don't speak unless it's absolutely necessary. It's hard to be macho when your mouth never stops moving.

Be serious. Mysterious macho guys aren't usually goofballs. Think of the grave seriousness of veterans and old sea captains.

Be sensual. Understand the loving arts of massage and pleasure. Be a sexual Olympian.

"
"
Be courteous and respectful to women.,
Eat vegetables and have a well-rounded diet.,
Drink responsibly.,
Drive safely.,
Have protected and responsible sex.,
Ask for help when you need it.",How to Be Macho3," If one thing gives macho guys a bad name, it's that they treat women poorly, talking down to them, objectifying them, and being rude in general. A macho guy treats all the women in his life respectfully. Learn to talk to women one-on-one, calmly and with courtesy.


You don't have to put on a big show to attract women. It's a turn off and shows that you're just putting on an act. Remember: Be a man. Never cat-call or use pick-up lines to talk to women. You're better than that.

, Some men think it's ""cool"" to only eat meat, and develop a dislike of green vegetables and other foods because they think it's non-masculine. Unfortunately for them, a diet that consists mostly of red meat and avoids green vegetables leads to things like prostate, stomach, and bowel cancer. There's nothing macho about having your prostate removed and becoming sexually impotent and incontinent., Being able to ""hold your liquor"" isn't a sign of masculinity, it's a sign of alcohol abuse. There's nothing wrong with enjoying a couple of drinks among friends--especially a straight bourbon, dark beer, or a Manhattan--but you need to know your limits and avoid pushing them as a way of showing off to your friends. It can lead to serious problems.


This also goes for other self-destructive vices, like smoking and using other drugs. Abusing substances is a sign of insecurity, not a sign of manhood.

, There's nothing macho about speeding, cutting people off, or revving your engine at stop-lights. If you're a real man, you don't need to overcompensate by showing off in a big car.


If you've got a jacked-up ride that you're really proud of, show it off to your friends in your driveway, or on open road, but don't show it off in the middle of traffic. Strangers on their morning commute don't care about your horsepower, and it won't make you look more macho to peel out from stoplights in front of them.

, A macho guy doesn't need to be promiscuous to prove it. Practice safe sex and move at your own speed. Ignore guys who brag about sexual prowess. They're probably just watching too much porn and making stuff up anyway. You're a real man and you know it.

, This is maybe the oldest macho stereotype: Being unwilling to pull over and ask for directions. Sure, it can be embarrassing to admit that you're wrong, or to admit that you need help with something, but it's worse to get in over your head and make the situation worse. A macho guy wants to do something right first and foremost, not do it shoddily by going it alone. You can't do everything solo. Ask for help.

"
"
Take care of your appearance.,
You can't go wrong by wearing jeans.,
Start working out.,
Get some scars.",How to Be Macho4," A macho guy should perform basic grooming on himself without spending too much time or money on his appearance. To look macho, you need to be clean, smell good, and dress appropriately, but not look like you spent more than 5 minutes getting ready in the morning, or that you care about your appearance.

Skip things like manicures and expensive haircuts. Instead, learn to trim your own neckline and beard with a trimmer to keep yourself looking good between basic cuts. Trim and clean your fingernails regularly, but don't worry about your cuticles.






Shower and wear clean clothes that fit appropriately and highlight your masculine physique. There's nothing macho about stinking and wearing the clothes a teenager wears. Learn to dress yourself.







, What does a macho guy wear? The simpler, the better. A basic look that features any style of jeans, a clean white t-shirt, and work boots looked good in the 1950s and it still looks cool today.


Dress appropriately for work. Don't wear flip-flops and board shorts to your job, or you risk looking like a chump. Get a solid pair of shoes or boots and get the job done., A macho guy has a macho physique, probably not from spending time at some expensive gym doing pilates, but from lifting heavy stuff in his garage. Develop a muscle-building routine that you can do at home with materials you already have. You don't need to buy expensive weight equipment or trendy gear. Barbells will do the trick.


Focus on your abs and biceps above all other muscle groups. Do sit-ups of different varieties and at different angles to build your six-pack muscles and perform bicep curls and bench presses to work on your chest and arms.

, A macho guy gets his hands dirty and leads a physical life that will probably result in some dings and dents in the ol' dude. Don't worry about it. Embrace activities that you know you can handle, and be adventurous. You only live once.


This doesn't mean that you should be irresponsible and put yourself at risk. Get scars because you dirt-bike and work on your car, not because you get into bar fights or drive like an idiot.

Value the small moments.",How to Be Lovely," A lovely person has a good heart, hands down. They're empathetic and aware of how other people are feeling and how they can help. Here are two things to get started on the one-way train to thoughtfulness:


The next conversation you have, ask someone how they are. But when you say it, don't say it like you mean, ""Hello."" Look at them and say, ""How are you?"" And when they answer, listen. See if the conversation is any different than your usual conversations.
Think of two things you could do right now that you've been putting off that might make people in your world smile. An email to that aunt you haven't spoken to in forever? Cleaning the dishes for your super busy roommate? And here's the kicker: Go do them!;
, The root of the word ""lovely"" is ""love,"" after all! If you're caught up worrying how others perceive you and drowning in insecurities, it's pretty hard to come off as lovely. There's no room for gentle, understated grace and kindness if you think the world is out to get you.


Yeah, this is a lot easier said than done. It's a process that can take years, and even then you'll have slip ups. But make it a point to make baby steps every day. Write a list of things you love about yourself. Wake up in the morning tell yourself you're beautiful. Spend ten minutes each day purposefully thinking positive thoughts. Do little things to make it seem more natural if it's an issue.

, If you are not yourself, you cannot be lovely. You can be a lovely version of someone else, but you can't be a lovely you! And since ""you"" is good, why would you bother trying to be anything else? Being fake is just about as not lovely as it gets.


Sometimes it's hard to know where we end and the person society tells us to be begins. Take a second to sit back and think about why you want to be lovely and what it means to you. Do you want to be lovely so people will like you? So men will be attracted to you? Hopefully the answer is no -- ideally, you should want to be lovely for yourself.

, Go read the wikiHow article! Being elegant isn't something that can be summed up in a paragraph, but here are a few pointers:


Keep your look natural and chic. Nude nail polish, a sophisticated hair-do, minimal make-up.
Always be clean! There's no room for grunge in elegance.
Opt for classic, timeless pieces. A nice sweater, dark jeans or skirt, boots, etc.

, Alright, yeah, you're pretty awesome. By the end of the article, you'll be leaking loveliness. But that doesn't mean you shouldn't be modest about it! In fact, being arrogant and being lovely are mutually exclusive; you cannot be one and the other. A girl who's lovely knows that everyone is on her level, that everyone has something she doesn't.


If you're thoughtful and genuine, arrogance shouldn't be a problem. If you're unsure, think about your conversations. How often do you steer it back to you? Do you dominate them? How often do you feel like you're judging others? Just things to think about!

, A lovely person has her act together. She knows when she needs to work hard, she keeps her word, and she's organized. A lovely girl probably doesn't live in a pigsty, you know? What area of your life could use a little cleaning up?


Take a look at your room -- could it use a little organization?
Do you procrastinate? What's keeping you from getting your work done?
Are you punctual and honest? Do you mean what you say and what you do?

, Humans have a bad tendency of judging books by their covers. If something isn't pretty, it isn't good. That's obviously not how it works, but it's a natural go-to for most of us (it saves a lot of time and energy on thought). So save yourself the struggle and shower, brush your teeth, run a comb through your hair, and dress like you give half a ferret. The world will be a lot kinder to you and thus be more readily convinced of your innate loveliness!


Choose a scent and stick to it. People will smell your loveliness from across the room. Mmm. Loveliness. If they wanted to capture it, they'd ask you to sweat into a bottle.

, Psych! The first step was just to ease you in to the process. Showering is all well and good, but it's probably not enough. Being clean is very, very important, but being lovely has a certain ""put together-ness"" about it. So slap on some lip gloss, some eyeliner, and turn that ponytail into a neat bun.


You don't have to dress to the nines (sometimes that's just inappropriate), but do have a look that says ""I didn't play Russian roulette with my closet today."" Spend five minutes picking out your outfit. Give yourself a glance to see if your pieces fit together. If someone were to see you, what's the first impression they would get?

, Being a klutz isn't something you can really help, but it's something you can consciously try to be aware of. If you keep good posture, your chin up and shoulders up (if you don't trip over yourself!), you'll move like Audrey Hepburn or Grace Kelly. The ultimate picture of class.

, There is a certain aspect of loveliness that is very feminine. Very soft, very gentle. There is nothing loud, brash, excessive, or macho about being lovely. While everyone's version of femininity is different, play up whatever that word means to you.


You can be feminine in an oversized plaid shirt and jeans. You can be feminine while you're bossing people around. You can be feminine rolling out of bed with no makeup on. It doesn't necessarily have to do with what you're wearing or doing; it has more to do with how you project yourself.

, A lovely person generally makes people feel good. They light up a room with their energy. The simplest way to do this is to be generous with your smile. Be delighted at the tiniest of things. Marvel at small beauty in the world. Show you appreciate the world around you (and the people in it) with a smile.


Here's a blow-your-mind thought: There are people in this world who haven't been smiled at today. There are people in this world who haven't been smiled at for weeks. Think about that. The only thing you have to do to make their world brighter is smile at them. That would be awfully lovely of you.

, Though it's a bit stereotypical, a lovely woman has proper etiquette down pat. ""Please"" and ""thank you"" should be mainstays in your vocabulary. And then there's things like sneezing into your elbow and not chewing with your mouth open, but you knew that already, right?


While things like using the right fork have their place, the more important things are like holding the door for the person behind you, cleaning up after yourself, and sharing. Manners make the world a little bit easier for everyone -- hopefully people will be polite right back!

, If you're constantly being surrounded by negativity and people that drag you down, there's no way you're going to be lovely, for starters, but you definitely won't be happy and you definitely won't be the best you. So keep this is mind -- do the people around you bring out your best, loveliest side?


In other words, cut out your toxic friends. It may be awkward for a day or two, but it's totally worth it in the long run. If you sit back and think about it for five seconds and a name comes to mind, at least make strides to hang out with them less. You need to be the best person you can possibly be to truly be lovely.

, No one has ever uttered the sentence, ""Man, that Debbie Downer sure is a lovely girl."" The fact of the matter is that being lovely has a positivity about it. The lovelies of the world don't often find themselves complaining (unless something is downright unfair -- they do stand for what they believe in) -- and they don't complain because the glass is always half full. Why waste your energy on negativity?


In addition to not having a negative worldview, don't be negative about others! Don't poke fun at people and draw attention their flaws or their flubs. While it may be tempting to have a good laugh at someone's expense, resist. To be lovely, you need to create lovely world.

, Whenever you find an opportunity to help someone, take it! You'd be hard pressed to find a good reason not to (being lazy is not a good reason!). And if you can't find one, you may not be looking hard enough!


Is a friend super busy and could use a buddy to get errands done or do some easy tasks? Do you know an older person who needs a young, agile spring chicken to help around the house? And if they're not asking, initiate! Sometimes people don't like asking for help.

, You know who's not lovely? That friend of yours that is incurably late and doesn't seem to care when you tell her you've wasted 30 minutes of your life waiting on her. Not lovely at all. Don't show other people you don't value them -- be punctual!


And show them you value them in other small ways, too! If a friend made dinner one night and you got the extras, bring over a dessert later in the week. Offer to get them coffee. Pay back the favors you get to show how grateful you are.

, To be lovely is to put others first...sometimes. You can't please everyone and you definitely should not be a doormat. But if someone needs or wants something from you and it wouldn't hurt you to agree, why not do it?


That being said, if someone wants the shirt off your back, know where to draw the line. You have to protect yourself first and foremost -- no one else will. So if it goes against your belief system or leaves you to the dogs, don't feel obligated to do it. It's not you not being nice, it's you being smart.

, Part of being lovely is being lovely to everyone, regardless of their status in life or the crazy opinions they're asserting. When you come across someone different from you, don't assign them a label. Be open-minded and try to see their point of view. If they think they're right and you don't, why might that be?


Try your hardest to treat everyone the same. That means your waiter, your best friend, and the old man crossing the street. We're all humans and we all deserve attention and care.

If someone does you wrong, treat them civilly. You do not, by any means, have to go out of your way to be nice to them, but do treat them as a human. Nothing more, nothing less.



, Just like acting isn't only when you're talking, being lovely isn't only when the spotlight is on you. It's the small moments that truly make a lovely girl lovely. The way she watches a child, the way she adjusts her towels just so, the way she goes in for a hug. It's in the tiny things just as much as it's in the big things.


Being lovely is a 24/7 thing. It's not a hat you wear outside and take off when you get home. It should be part of you, not a show you put on. Find a woman who you think is lovely by nature and watch her. She's probably just like you!

This is the person you'll be working with, so get to know yourself! You'll be more comfortable in your own skin -- you'll be a better person, a better friend, a better boyfriend/girlfriend, a better employee, a better everything. You'll be less stressed and you'll be more confident. You'll know what you're working with and how to work it. Sold yet?


Know that you are not your brand or what people think of you. This has nothing to do with anything. You will not be happy if you create an image that caters to the world around you and not to you. If you became the best lyrical soprano this side of Vienna, would that really matter if you truly wanted to the next John Lennon? No. So cater to no one. Find yourself and work with it.;
, There is no one else out there who is you. Therefore, you are the best you there is. But if you are trying to be someone or something else, that logic goes out the window. You become a second-rate copy of whatever it is you're trying to emulate. No matter who you are (or who you think you are), commit to it. This is the hand you've been dealt. Can't win if you don't play it.


To be the best, you can't reinvent the wheel. You can't copy others. You have to do new, innovative things. You have to study biology when you want to become a computer scientist. You have to be yourself to avoid being someone else. Crystal clear?

, For the rest of your life, you will be your greatest obstacle. You will be the reason you don't walk up to that sexy guy/girl, you will be the reason you don't ask for that raise, you will be the reason you do or do not succeed. Thinking positively opens the door to so many opportunities. When you think you're capable of something, you try. When you view life-like shooting fish in a barrel, you aim the gun and shoot. When you get negative, you put down the gun, walk away from the barrel and go to bed with the covers over your head. No one ever became the best doing that.


If positive thinking doesn't come naturally to you, make it a point to do it. Wake up in the morning, take a look in the mirror and say out loud, ""I'm awesome. Today is going to be great and I'll get closer and closer to my goals."" And when the negative thoughts start creeping up, squash 'em. You pick your thoughts, you know.

, You're about to be the best at whatever it is you choose to be the best at. If you cannot get excited about that, what can you become excited about? Exactly. So get excited! Start thinking in exclamation points! When you're excited, things happen. You get filled with inspiration, creativity, and drive. You practically burst at the seams with possibilities.


So much about succeeding in the real world is about actually wanting it. Remember all the times you turned in a crappy project to your English teacher and got an A because the rest of the class' works were even worse? You got complacent and stopped caring. You lost your excitement. Heads up: Life ain't like that. You gotta stay excited to turn in those papers that are actually worth the A. The real world is full of valedictorians and go-getters that are turning in A papers, too. It'll be a lot easier to keep up if you're chomping at the bit.

, There is no one path to greatness. You cannot say, ""I'm going to go to school, get a job, fall madly in love, buy a house, knock out a few kids, and live happily ever after."" For most of us, that's not exactly how it's going to work. If you want to be the best at something, you have to realize there's an entire web of possibilities in front of you. If you close your mind, you may not see the most direct way to your goals.


So the next time you're sitting with your team and you're devising a project on say, how to get Lindsay Lohan to star in your next documentary for film school, don't laugh off Yoon's comment on tunneling into her swimming pool via her old babysitter's uncle's backyard. Remember when people thought Galileo was crazy, too?

, If you don't have a drive to be the best, it'll never happen. And part of being the best means having a thirst for competition. How else will you know if you're the best unless you compare yourself to your peers? Compare yourself to your peers and win, that is.


If you're not comfortable with competitions, contests, and races, sour news for you: that's gonna have to change. And the only way to do that is to immerse yourself full in. Once you get a handful of who's-the-best contests under your belt, they'll phase you less and less. And after a dozen, it'll feel like breathing.

Don't go overboard. If you're the friend that turns everything into a competition, you'll soon find yourself friendless. Keep the contests to the skills that you're actually trying to master -- not life in general.



, In case you weren't aware, you can't be better than everyone at everything. Even you are the best human being on the face of the Earth, you can't, by definition, be the best at, such as, winning and losing. So instead of spreading yourself thin, choose something that speaks to you. What's the first thing you want to be ridiculously awesome at? Odds are it popped into your head in about .3 seconds.


Remember to be realistic. Don't aim to climb Mt. Everest if you don't have legs. While your mom was sort of right when she said, ""You can be anything you put your mind to,"" she was sugar-coating it a bit for you. If you're capable of it, it can happen. Just remember that.

, Even the best need guidance. No baby learns how to walk, talk, and play without being shown. People are around you to help you grow. So whatever it is you want to be the best at, find someone who does it. They don't have to be the best, but they should be better than you. At least for right now. Having someone show you the ropes is so much easier -- and faster -- than learning it for yourself.


When Bobby Fischer was 3, he didn't pick up an advanced chess book and start taking notes. He was handed a chess set and shown how to play. He worked with competitors to improve his game. He worked with friends to devise strategy. He studied under chess greats. Two heads are better than one, remember?

, You know what's scary? Trying things. You know what's scarier? Trying new things where you might fail. And this will be the rest of your life. To rise to the top, all that scary stuff will be involved. It will make you uncomfortable. But when it's uncomfortable, you know you're putting yourself out there, taking risks, accepting challenges, and improving. If it's easy, you're not going anywhere.


Henry Ford had two failed companies before he succeeded.Steve Jobs had a lot of things under his belt before he truly hit success. There will be trials and tribulations; there will be failures; there will be times when you're unsure. You gotta go through with it anyway.

, Wanting to be the best is all well and good, but it's not enough. You have to decide. Decide that it's what you're doing. There are no two ways around it. If you have a plan B, you might use it. What could plan B possibly consist of? Being slightly above average? No thank you.


This ""being the best"" thing just is. It's not an idea, it's a not a goal, it just is. You just are. You are doing it. Done and done. Accept it. You've decided. Now it's only a matter of time.

, You know that thing that you love? Well, how are you going to do it? Since you're well aware there are a dozen ways to go about it, which one's for you? Start brainstorming. Come up with six things that will propel you on your path to being incredible. Six things that get you on track.


Once you have your six, pick one. Do it today. Let's say you want to be a famous actress. Your six things are taking an acting class, contacting an old friend of yours who did it, contacting your local theatre/acting agency, making a budget to save money for moving, planning a new workout routine, and scouring Craigslist and other postings in your area. How easy is it to do one of those things? Once you've done one, replace it. Always have six things on your list.

, If you're spending 14 hours in your basement genetically engineering a man-eating plant, eating only Ramen noodles and drinking Kool-Aid, not showering and pulling out your hair, you're not the best you can be. Make sure other aspects of your life get attention too. Ideally, you want to be the best at everything, right? So that means looking the part, acting the part, being the part, and feeling the part. In other words, take care of yourself!


It's hard to be the best when we don't feel the best. So shower, do your hair, throw on some clothes that say, ""Here I am, world!"" and get started being fantastic. Exercise, eat right, and get some sleep.

, In Malcolm Gladwell's book, ""Outliers,"" he talks about the 10,000 hour principle. That you don't get really, truly prodigal in something until you've practiced for 10,000 hours. He talks about how the Beatles were mediocre until they hit the 10,000 hour mark playing small German pubs. He talks about how Bill Gates spent nights in the computer lab for years on end before anyone else even thought to. To really be great at something, you gotta put in the time.This is also a long-winded way of saying ""be patient."" You're not going to be the next Paul McCartney or Bill Gates overnight. Even they weren't! You're going to spend 1,000 hours being pretty terrible, the next 3,000 hours being okay, the next 4,000 hours being pretty good, and the the last 1,999 being super until you finally get so amazing you can barely fathom your own superiority. Then you know -- so no need to time yourself.

, You've probably studied a foreign language. You've probably read textbooks, done exercises, watched videos, etc. and so forth ad infinitum. That gets you started, it gets the ball rolling, but the ball loses momentum with time. If you wanted to be fluent in that language, you'd move to the country. You'd actually do it. It's the same with any large idea. You can't watch a video. You can't just observe. You can't study it for years on end until you have a piece of paper. You have to go out there and do it.


The next time someone offers you an opportunity and you're not sure whether to take it, don't listen to yourself and just do it. It doesn't matter if you're ill-prepared or unsure or doubtful of your abilities. Do it anyway. Turn that voice off; it's doing you more harm than good.
Get your hands on whatever you can. Do you want to be an astronaut? Don't just read a book. Go to your nearest planetarium and stay until they ask you to leave and then do that every day until they know you by name and offer to show you around the back. Suck up to your professor until he breaks out the special telescope just for you. Just take action. Go.

, Alright, here's a fact of life for you: There is not enough time in the day to have your cake and eat it, too. If you wanna ace all your Organic Chem tests, you can't spend every night in the bar with your friends. You will have to prioritize. You'll have to skip out on things you want to do to make time for the things you need to do. You'll need to spend hours upon hours building up your skills, which you can't do if you're doing anything else.


There may come a time when instead of doing a sport, you pick up a part-time job. There will be weekends you need to spend in the library. There will be times when you can't go out with the hot guy or girl even when it's the only night they're in town. These things have to happen in order for you to be as good as you can possibly be. You have to think of it as you ultimately doing yourself a favor. Your future self, sure, but still yourself.

, Make horrible, terrible, ugly mistakes. Get people hating you. Do things so differently that people think you're crazy.Fail so miserably that you come out the other side knowing exactly what not to do. Take pride in it. You're doing something.


The only way to avoid criticism and failure is to do nothing. Making a target of yourself means you're doing something. You're living. Thus, failing is good. It is natural and it is right. If nothing else, it's strategizing and narrowing things down. When you have 10 possibilities and you know 9 of them don't work, guess what?

, At the end of the day, it's imperative you sit down and think about the day's events. What worked out? What didn't? What could you have done better? What are you glad you did and not so glad you didn't? If you don't step back to think about these things, to think about where you are, you'll never know where to go and how to get there.


While it's important to analyze your successes (how can you recreate them?), it's doubly important to analyze your failures. This can get frustrating and demotivating to an extreme, but it must be done. Don't let it set you back! Remember: even a failure is progress. Being the best is about fine-tuning your skills.

, You don't live in a vacuum. You have dozens of people around you that want to help. That can help. Everyone you know knows something you don't. Because of that, they can all help you -- even if it's in the tiniest of ways. Use their knowledge to put you on the fast track to being the best. Strength in numbers, after all.


No one has ever gotten to where they are without help from other people. Not only will you avoid doing things that have already been done, but they can tell you ways they've tried that haven't worked, too. When you put your heads together, you automatically cut the work into parts. Being the best isn't about being the best all alone -- it's about being the best with what (and who) you have to work with.

, ""Even if you're on the right track, you'll get run over if you just sit there,"" is a quote attributed to Will Rogers. And a very, very insightful and truthful quote at that. In order to be the best, there's gotta be constant progress. Constant practice. Constant self-analyzation. Constant teamwork. Constant determination.


If you're doing what you love, you'll be happy. You'll know you're on the right track. If you keep on learning and challenging yourself, you'll know you're making progress. With time and effort, you'll keep getting better and better. Setbacks happen, failures can wreak havoc, but at the end of the day you'll still be pretty damn good.
Once you hit 10,000 hours it doesn't mean you can stop! Did Steve Jobs stop when he made the iPod nano? NO. HE DIDN'T. If anything, your best work will come after the 10,000 hour mark. Don't you wanna see what you're capable of?

, When you become the cream of the crop, it's all too easy to look down on the Plebeians below you. You can become out of touch and, quite frankly, an ass. Don't do it! Think of all the people it took to get you where you are. How would you want to be treated?


When it comes to most things, there will always be someone who is better than you. By the time you become better than them, there will be someone else in the picture. And if you are better than them at something, there's something else where they take the cake. Remember this. It's how you treat those below you that determines your character, not your equals.

Try to control your eyes.,
Try to get help from someone else if you can.,
Find other things to do.,
Realize that you are not alone.",How to Control Your Lustful Actions," Believe it or not, a vast majority of human beings on this Earth have sexual desires! However, some people have allowed their sexuality to become such a huge part of their lives to the point where it is corrupts them. This is especially common in teenagers who are just being introduced to the world of sexuality. If this is you, then don't worry! There is a solution to your problem.;
, A key to control your temptation is to keep your eyes away from the parts of people which might invoke lustful thoughts, or keep them off of certain people in general. This is especially important to do in environments such as the beach or the gym; where there are often people who are in skin-tight and very revealing clothing. If you can keep your eyes clean, then eventually your thoughts will become clean. So when you're looking at someone, try to keep your eyes focused above their shoulders.

, Think of temptation like a sumo wrestler. Every time you fall into temptation and do what it wants you to do, it will be like giving it food. It will become bigger every single day until it's uncontrollable. Then when you realize you need to get rid of that sumo, you can't defeat it by yourself. What you need to do is to have someone you can trust help you with your lustful thoughts. You may even find out that they went through the same things you went through!

, Often times we commit lustful actions when we are alone or have nothing else to do, so it's best to do other things to keep your mind off of lustful thoughts. Some good examples include hobbies such as games and sports, or socializing with other people.

, You are not the only one who is struggling to control your lust. These problems are especially common in teenagers who are going through puberty and are discovering their sexuality. But many people who struggle with lust tend to forget about this, or don't even know this fact at all! So not only is what you're going through natural, especially if you are a teenager, you are also not the only one going through this! You'll lose that ""guilty conscience"" once you do, and find the strength to overcome your lust!

Become a pacifist.",How to Cope in the World of Ego," Thy should be humble first in order to cope up with the ego of others. You should be aware of your ego and should restrict its imposition on others - unnecessarily.;
, People impose their ego or are ""egoistic"" due to want of acknowledgement and/or acceptance from others. They may not seem like your average attention seekers but they do crave for it - unconsciously.

, Remember the points of imposition of ego and try not to impose yours in those 'dangerous' waters.

, Understand that ego is the image that a person associates with himself and it is natural to be present. It by understanding that everyone is different and unique in their own way that we can cope in the world of ego.

, When its the war of egos, the first one to lose is actually the winner. If a heated argument is one, lose it. As the argument ends - you win. Though know when you can afford to lose and when it is required to win.

, Always be ahead of the matters in order to escape the trap of ego conflict. Once the opposition knows you are no longer in their league, you will never be bothered.

, Learning how others exert their ego on us, how we exert/impose our ego on others, what is the cause for it, why we do it are some questions worth contemplating over. When we tend to find answers to these questions, coping with ego will seem a lot more easier.

, All egoistic people tend to expect something in return from us, either in form of appreciation or favour or applause or flatter or respect or acknowledgement. Knowing this demand and catering to it in our bounds & comfort zone is the right way to tackle and cope with the world of ego.

, Being a pacifist, not being too aggressive or offensive in your opinions or views or speech can be quite helpful in coping with ego. People tend to use their ego as a defense mechanism to protect themselves or their beliefs from what they find to be threatening or offensive.

Curtail your responses.,
Tune out negative behavior.,
Find strengths in numbers, if necessary.,
Be formal with the person.,
Do not taunt the person.,
Acknowledge their presence when necessary.,
Walk away when necessary.,
Stand up for yourself in the moment.,
Document negative behaviors at work or school.,
Talk to the person about their behavior calmly.,
Bring in an outside authority figure.",How to Ignore People You Don't Like," Avoidance is sometimes the easiest way to ignore someone. If someone is getting on your nerves, try to keep your distance as much as you can.You can avoid places they're likely to hang out. If an annoying co-worker always eats lunch at noon, try eating lunch outside of the office or taking a later lunch.
Avoid social situations where you're likely to see that person. If annoying person from school is going to be at party this weekend, try making other plans.;
, When you're in the same room with someone who annoys you, be aware of your eyes. If you accidentally glance at the person, this could result in eye contact. This can be misinterpreted as an invitation to come over and talk. When you're around the person, try not to look at them. This will help minimize interactions., If you work with someone, you sometimes have to communicate with them. It may be easiest to do it through others. You don't have to be rude about this. Do not, for example, say within the person's earshot something like, ""Could you tell Jeff, who I'm not speaking to, to put his dirty dish in the sink?"" You can, however, ask others to deliver information when necessary.


For example, you're working in a group for a work project. The annoying person is in your group.
Late at night, you realize you need to let the person know about an aspect of the project. If you know the person will get hostile and difficult when confronted, ask another coworker to talk to them. Say something like, ""For some reason, Jeff doesn't love hearing suggestions from me. Could you let him know we have to reframe the conclusion of our report? Thanks.""

, You can't completely avoid talking to someone, especially if you see them at work or school. You don't want to give a complete silent treatment when someone's talking to you, so work on curtailing your responses. When someone talks, give curt responses like ""Hmmm"" and ""Okay."" This will hopefully send the message that you want some space.

, If someone's annoying behavior takes the form of bullying, such as name-calling or taunting, try to ignore it. Bullies tend to love getting a reaction out of people. If you don't deliver that reaction, the bullying may stop.If a co-worker always teases you, to the point you feel uncomfortable around them, try simply ignoring the teasing.
For example, you walk to the water fountain to get a drink and the co-worker makes a negative comment about your outfit. Simply pretend you didn't hear and carry on with your day.

, If the annoying person is very aggressive towards you, adopt the buddy system. Try to have friends or co-workers accompany you places you're likely to see the person. Friends can, for example, walk with you between classes or eat lunch with you to keep the annoying person away., There is no reason to be rude simply because you're ignoring someone. In fact, being rude will only escalate the situation. When you have to talk to the person, do so with formality.Say things like, ""Please,"" ""Excuse me,"" and ""Thank you."" Show the person basic manners while maintaining a somewhat stiff demeanor. This will show the person you're not being hostile but you don't want a lot of interactions with them.

, Ignoring someone should not be an aggressive act. Do not make faces at the person, roll your eyes when they talk, or blatantly pretend not to hear them when they address you. You are now being annoying in return, which is not a good way of dealing. Never taunt someone while you're ignoring them., You cannot completely tune someone out, especially if you work with that person. When necessary, acknowledge their presence in a manner that's polite but not overtly friendly. For example, offer a brief wave or nod when you pass them in the hallway. Reply to their question of, ""How are you?"" with ""I'm fine. Thanks."", Sometimes, people may not take the hint. If someone continues to annoy you, even when you've tried to subtly indicate you don't want to talk to them, it's okay to make an excuse and walk away.For example, a co-worker is being very critical about an aspect of your personal life. Even though you're giving non-comital responses, they keep at it.
Say something like, ""Okay, I appreciate the input, but I don't really need it and I have somewhere to be."" Then, leave the situation.

, Sometimes, an annoying person may cross a line to the point you feel uncomfortable or threatened. In these scenarios, it's okay to stand up for yourself in the moment. Be assertive and address the situation.Calmly tell the person they crossed a line. Let them know you do not tolerate this type of behavior.
For example, ""Don't talk to me like that. I don't need unsolicited advice.""

, If you feel uncomfortable because of an annoying person at work or school, document this. You want to make sure you have information to give to a higher authority if it comes to that.Each time the person gets on your case, briefly jot down what was said, who saw it, and the date and time.
If you ever need to raise a formal complaint, you'll have a lot of information from which to pull.

, If someone is consistently annoying you, it's okay to calmly address the behavior. Wait until you can get a moment alone with the person and calmly and collectively explain what they are doing wrong.For example, ""I know you don't mean anything by it, but I don't love getting teased about my outfits.""
Let the person know how the behavior makes you feel. ""It makes me feel uncomfortable at work, because people are always pointing out my looks now.""
Lastly, tell the person where to go from here. ""I really don't want you to make comments like that anymore. Do you understand?""

, If someone's behavior does not improve after a direct confrontation, call in a higher authority. If you're in school, let a teacher or principal know. If you're at work, talk to someone in the HR department. You have a right to feel comfortable at your place of work or your school."

Shorten your name.,
Create a cool nickname using your initials.,
Describe a unique physical attribute or personality trait.,
Call someone by their last name.,
Make sure the name is short and easy to remember.,
Test out the name before using it in public.",How to Come up With a Cool Nickname1," The most basic and common type of nickname is a shortened version of someone’s real name.For example, Alexander is shortened to Alex or Al, Katherine to Kate or Katie, Richard to Rick, Rick, or Dick, and so on., Take and combine the first letter of your first and last names, or first letter of your first and middle names. Going by your initials can help differentiate you from others if you have a common name, or make a difficult or long name easier to pronounce. This works well if your middle or last name begins with “J”, “D”, or “T” – for example Daniel Joseph can be shortened to “D.J.”, Andrew Johnson to “A.J.”, Jonathon Jameson to “J.J.”, or James Taylor to “J.T.”.

, Think of a good feature about yourself or a friend and use that as inspiration for a nickname. For example, the 16th president Abraham Lincoln is often called “Honest Abe” for his integrity.Be careful not to offend anyone and focus on positive, not negative attributes.


If someone is really smart, call them “Prof” or “Doc”, or a creative person could be called “Muse” or “Da Vinci”.
In China, many American and British celebrities have nicknames based on their appearance or reputation. For example, Katy Perry is known as “Fruit Sister” for her colorful costumes, Benedict Cumberbatch is “Curly Blessing” for his curly hair, and Adam Levine is “Flirty Adam”., This works well in sports or at work, especially if you have a common first name. Also, most athletes go by their last name, since it’s on the back of their jerseys. You can also abbreviate or shorten your last name.

, You can abbreviate someone’s first or last name to 3 syllables or less. You want something that is catchy and easy to say.

, If you are trying to come up with a cool nickname for a friend, try it out on them first when no one else is around. See how they respond – you want a nickname to be flattering, not offensive.Stop calling the person by that name if they find in annoying. Inappropriate nicknames include those that reference bad habits, negatively portray someone’s physical appearance or weight, or are sexually explicit.

"
"
Look at your name.,
Look at your hobbies and talents.,
Check your family heritage.",How to Choose Your Own Nickname to Fit Your Name1," Think about shorter names that might be hidden inside it. For example, the name Steven contains the shorter name Steve. The name Alfred contains Al, Alf, Fred, and Red. Those names in turn might also have nicknames, such as Alfie (for Alf). Many people choose a nickname based on their own first name because it is easy for themselves and others to remember.


Last names can also be a good source of nicknames. For example, people whose last names begin with Mc- or Mac-, as in John McClane, sometimes choose to go by the nickname Mac. A last name itself can also be a nickname.
Consider letter combinations in your name that might not be regular names, but which are easy to say. Someone named Steven might think about going by Te or Ven.
Nicknames based on your name can be spelled however you like. ""Mack"" works just as well as ""Mac."" The pronunciation is more important than the spelling.;
, If you have a reputation for doing something well or standing out in some other way, it can lead to a nickname. Someone with a loud, booming yell might go as Boomer. A very smart person is sometimes called a ""brain;"" Brain can also be a great nickname. To ensure that the nickname you choose references your own name, look for nicknames that share a first letter with your name, or that rhyme with it.

, The places you grew up, as well as the places your ancestors lived, can sometimes provide great nicknames. People with ancestors in the Netherlands could choose the nickname Dutch; a person who grew up in Texas might go as Tex or Texie. A strong sense of connection to an ancestral culture can also provide nicknames that mean the same thing as your name means, but in another language or cultural tradition.

Stay in touch with your accountability partner.",How to Change Yourself Completely," As simple as that, ask yourself, “Do I want to make this change.” In order to make such a drastic change, you need to be sure that you truly desire it. Think about every aspect of your life and if you’re willing to change them.Evaluate the direction of your life.
Understand that the activities of your life might have to change.
Be realistic about what it will take to get the consequences you desire.
If you don’t honestly believe you can to change all of these things, you’re setting yourself up for failure.;
, Now that you know you want to change, you need to find out if you can change. Sit down and decide if you have everything you need to make a serious life change.You need the ability to change.
You need the tools to change.
You need the time to change.
You need the right support to change.

, You may think you’re being honest with yourself about your characteristics. If you’re portraying someone completely different than you believe you are, you’ll never understand what’s standing in your way.Ask your peers what they think about you. If it doesn’t match up with your perspective of yourself, you aren’t being honest.
Evaluate the choices you make throughout the day and why you make them. When you do this, you’ll see that the reasoning behind your choices is what got you where you are. In order to change yourself completely, you’ll have to form your choices behind new reasoning.
For example, when you choose to stay in versus meeting friends, evaluate why you chose this and what it says about you.

, Make an end goal for this process and write it down. Make it a measurable goal. It can have multiple parts to it, or it can be a big picture goal. Either way, put the written goal somewhere you can see every day to keep you motivated.

, A role model can be absolutely anyone: younger, older, friend, relative, stranger, or celebrity. Find someone who genuinely embodies the pure person you want to be. Maybe one person dresses like you want to and one person acts like you want to. You can use those pieces of each person to get inspiration from.If it is someone you know, set up a meeting to pick their brain. Find out how they do what they do.
If it is someone you don’t know, do some research. Find out everything you can about them and see what you can do to emulate their characteristics in your everyday life.

, Even better than finding your role models is surrounding yourself by positive people. When you sit in someone’s presence, you have much more of an ability to model how they act. Find people that have similar goals as you, or people that have already reached your goals, and spend time with them.For example, if you wish to become more outgoing, surround yourself with outgoing people. If you wish to be more financially successful, spend time with the people who have financial success.
Avoid people that will negatively influence your change. If you’re trying to live a healthier lifestyle, it is very hard to be around someone that lives a sedentary lifestyle and eats fast food for every meal.

, An accountability partner is someone who keeps you on track. In return, you can help keep them on track. It should be someone that you can be in touch with any time that you’re having difficulty. Also, you should set up weekly meetings with them (via phone or in person) to talk about your progress.


Making your role model into your accountability partner would be a great idea. They know what it takes to get what you want, and they can help you better than anyone.

, You have a “big picture goal,” now you need to make smaller ones. Every goal you make should be a step toward your outcome. It should also be tangible, or measurable. Make your accountability partner aware of these goals.


“Be a nicer person,” is not a tangible goal. Change it to, “Perform 2 nice things for strangers every day.”
Don’t make a goal saying, “Workout more.” Make it tangible by saying, “Workout 4 times a week.”., If you’re having difficulty reaching your goals, feel free to switch them up. Don’t use this as a cop out, but you need realistic goals or you’ll get upset and never accomplish the change. If you fail to reach your goal once, don’t automatically adjust them. Sit with your accountability partner and talk about if you really tried everything that you could to reach your goal. If you did and it was still unreachable, come up with a new goal together.


For example, if you’re trying to start studying more and you made a goal to study 6 hours a day, you might have trouble doing so because of school or work schedules. Change your goal to be 4 hours a day and attempt to reach that.

, Take a moment to realize every little success you have. Each time you reach a goal, you’re getting close to your outcome. This is a great thing to have happen. However, don’t get complacent when this happens. Take the time to appreciate it and stay driven toward your next goal.

, When you’ve completely changed, you may not notice it at first. However, if you take the time to sit down and look at the end goal that you wrote when you decided to change, you might surprise yourself. All the little changes have become a part of you and you’ve completely changed yourself., Don’t stop here. Use this success as motivation to drive yourself to become a better version of the person you’ve become. Just as you did before, make a big picture goal and then break it into daily or weekly goals. You’ve likely become a goal oriented person through this change, so keep it up.


For example, if you were aiming to change the way you look, make goals to stay focused on this. Tell yourself to go shopping once a season and buy 2 brand new outfits.

, This will help keep you from regressing. Continue to share with them all of your little goals as well as your new, bigger ones.


Offer to help them with their goals moving forward. Show appreciation for the help they’ve given you and offer it back.

Instead of seeing tasks as something you don’t want to do, look at your to-do list as a mountain to conquer. Dominate that list, cross each item off as if you’re Molly Weasley right after she killed Bellatrix Lestrange. Most. Satisfying. Moment. Ever.;
, The lovely councilwoman is a serious fan of this series, referencing it with affection fairly often. In loving Harry Potter you show a love for reading, magic, fantasy, friendship, determination, wit, quirky, crazy cool bad guys, and the unanimous adoration of three unexpected troublemakers turned heroes. A staple in both our generation’s pop culture and Leslie’s heart, this series has a lot to offer all who read it. In loving Harry Potter, you love all the lessons it has taught you, some notably being determination and loyalty, which can help you follow through on any assignment needing completion. Leslie’s love for Harry Potter shows the fun loving side of her, and makes her relatable to the huge fan base that the books and movies have gained. If you have yet to do so, experience the magic and connections you can make from Harry.

, Every good government official has an intricately detailed schedule to organize and prioritize day by day. Leslie’s weekly schedule was chock full of meetings, cleaning the beloved polluted town river, and planning the Parks and Recreation department’s year on top of her council duties. The only way to properly be everywhere you need to be and remember everything you need to do is having a place you write it all down and check. Taking these tasks head on with a determined and positive attitude is the best way to accomplish them efficiently. Leslie looks at her life as well as those around her as something that can be constantly improved. Her optimism, no matter how ridiculous at times, is what spurs her to continue bettering herself along with everyone she comes into contact with.

, No one wakes up every day with a smile on their face and a song in their hearts. Some days suck. But the only way to not let it affect your plans for the day is to try to stay positive. Turn your day around with the age-old rule-- fake it till you make it. When the things that make you smile don’t work to cheer you up, turn to the Leslie Knope state of mind to enjoy the simple things in life. Waffles covered in whipped cream, Ben Wyatt’s derrière and calves, chatting with Beautiful Anne and public forums with the crazy people of Pawnee are just a few of the many wonderfully silly things that make Leslie happy on a daily basis. She thrives on three simple parts of her life that she categorized for us in one of the show’s episodes.

, Or waffles, friends, work, doesn’t matter. But work is definitely third. While Leslie understands that work is an important part of her life, she never lets it come ahead of the people (and breakfast food) she loves. While getting all work done is necessary and satisfying, it shouldn’t become the ultimate derivation of happiness in your life. Relationships and the little things (like your favorite food) are where the fulfillment lies in Everyone’s favorite couple, Leslie and Ben, was developed because they wanted each other more than they cared about advancing in the political world. While they originally broke up to not disrupt Leslie’s campaign, she decided to say “screw it” because she’d rather be with the person she loved than have politics be the center of her life. Even after this scandal, her core values won her the spot of councilwoman. Follow your heart, win in politics…

Be graceful.,
Be kind.,
Be shy.,
Act dreamy.,
Be respectful.,
Act romantic.,
Go strolling outdoors.,
Show your emotions.,
Care deeply about what's important to you.,
Quirks.",How to Have Aurora's Personality from Sleeping Beauty," Graceful meaning delicate with her movements, as if floating in the air. Aurora is always graceful with her movements. When strolling in the forest with her animal friends, she walks with such poise and has perfect posture. When she picks some berries, her arms are fluid - she never does any harsh movements, like a ballerina. For you to become graceful, you first need to perfect your posture. Your shoulders should be slightly back and down, head held high and spine straight. Next you need to be more aware of your movements and practice been graceful. Lastly, you could go to dance classes or even gymnastics. This will help you become very graceful.;
, Kind means being friendly and sweet to others. Aurora is never rude to anyone. She makes friends really easily, and even if she wasn't blessed with this trait, she would still have no trouble making friends anyway! You can be kind by thinking more positive thoughts instead of negative about others. See the good in people and give genuine compliments. Smile more and be genuinely sweet.

, This means being nervous and not confident around strangers. Aurora shows this when Prince Philip startled her and even though an encounter like this was what she had only dreamed of, she reacted in a shy manner and tried to get away. You can be shy by acting nervous around new people. Speak with a soft and sweet tone of voice.

, Dreamy meaning often has head in the clouds and thinking of wonderful things such as meeting a prince. This is what Aurora was dreamy about anyway. She even had dreams about him she told her animal friends. You can be more dreamy by thinking about the perfect guy, a place you have always wanted to go or your dream job. Think of all the wonderful possibilities.

, Respectful means having admiration and treating with kindness. Aurora shows respect to her three guardians. When they ask her to do chores, she doesn't fuss and does exactly what they say. She respects them so much because they show her respect in return and love her dearly. It is all about returning the favor. For you to be more respectful, if your mum or dad are always doing housework and they ask you to help out occasionally, then just do it. Even better, offer to help out yourself and they will respect you back.

, Aurora is naturally a romantic. After the shyness fades when she first encounters Prince Phillip, she smiles sweetly at him, holds his hand and they dance, go wandering and then watch the sun set in the distance while she leans on his softly. When you have a boyfriend, be romantic by day dreaming more about him, look at him lovingly in the eyes, smile sweetly to him and gently kiss him.

, Aurora isn't the type of girl who would sit at home all day. She likes going into the woods to feel at peace and openly by dreamy, telling her animal friends her thoughts. She also loves singing, humming and dancing in the woods. It's almost like she becomes one with nature. You can do this by getting outdoors more and soaking in the beauty. Go for a walk in a forest or some woods and even sing and dance. Even pretend to talk to the animals.

, Aurora shows her emotions, them being shy, happy, sad, dreamy etc.

, When Aurora was told she was actually a princess, this news didn't seem to impact her so it didn't matter to her. But when she was told she couldn't see the man she fell in love with again, that caused her to lose it and run to her room and cry. This was something she cared deeply about. Be like this by just caring deeply for things important to you such as your family, a talent of yours, pets, etc.

, There are many things that Aurora does that are distinctly her. She uses hand gestures quite frequently such as cupping her hands together to her chest and softly putting her hand on her collar bone. Aurora has very distinct arched eyebrows which she is very expressive with. When showing emotion, her eyebrows are the main focus. She also waves by holding up her arm at about a 45 Degree angle in front of her and uses her wrist to wave. She does this with such grace. Another thing she does is smirk, such as when the guardians told her to go pick some berries (again) and she knew they were up to something. Start doing these things regularly and eventually, they will be natural to you!

Live with honesty and keep your promises.,
Show compassion and sympathy/empathy towards others.,
Create a personal mission statement for your life.,
Maintain a dedication to your values.",How to Improve Your Personal Integrity1," Honesty is one of the most important aspects of integrity. If you are dishonest or misleading with others, you cannot live a life of integrity. Part of being honest with others also includes keeping any promises that you make. A broken promise is effectively a lie, and lying is inconsistent with living with integrity.Always be truthful with others, even when it lands you in trouble.
Lying is almost always the wrong thing to do, especially when you lie for your own gain.
If you're worried honesty might hurt someone's feelings, it may be best to say nothing at all. Excuse yourself by saying something like, ""I don't think I'm the best person to give an opinion on _____.""
Living honestly includes being honest with yourself at all times. Check in with your thoughts/feelings, acknowledge how you feel, and be aware of how those feelings influence your behavior.;
, You cannot live a life of integrity without being mindful of and concerned for others. A lack of compassion or sympathy for others can often result in poor judgment, acts of selfishness, and ultimately a damaged relationship with someone you care about.Try to be understanding of how others feel. If someone did a poor job at work, for example, consider that they might be having an exceptionally bad day.
Be kind to other people, even in minor ways. For example, when you go to the store, ask the hard-working cashier how their day is going, and wish them a good rest of the day.
Help others whenever possible. You can do this through acts of charity, or by simply offering a helping hand to someone in need at work or on the street.

, A good way to ensure that you're living a life of integrity is to lay out a roadmap for yourself. Assess where you are now in life and consider where you want to be in the future in terms of your personal integrity and moral character.Write out your goals and your values. Think hard about what kind of person you want to be and what you hope to achieve in your lifetime.
Commit to developing yourself in meaningful ways. Remember that personal transformation takes a lot of work and dedication.
The goal of your mission statement should be to provide you with guidance on a day-to-day basis. Whenever you feel lost or uncertain, your mission statement should help ground you.
These statements should not be something you have to make up on the spot. Even if you've never articulated them, you should have a clear understanding of what guides you in life.
Keep this list hung in a place you'll see every day. Stop and take a moment each day to ask yourself whether you're behaving in a way that will help you live out your statement.

, Your values are what guide you through life. They're often shaped by your formative experiences, but your values may change as you grow and adapt to new stages of life. This is normal, but it's important to maintain a commitment to your values, no matter what they happen to be at a given stage in your life.Focus on what matters most to you. Let the things that are important to you determine how you treat others and how you live your life.Never compromise your values. Anything that is truly a personal value to you will not be compromised because it's convenient.

Figure out what is most important to you.,
Choose a cause selflessly.,
Find ways to support your cause.,
Make sure that your efforts adhere to your values.",How to Improve Your Personal Integrity2," If you want to take your personal integrity to the next level, you'll need to decide what is most important to you in life. Only by knowing what you want to stand for can you begin to make that cause your own.Think about what you are most passionate about.
This can be derived from your moral, ethical, spiritual, or artistic values, or it may simply be based on an injustice that you believe needs to be corrected.
The things that are most important to you may be rooted in your life, your community, or the world as a whole. However, it's easiest to implement changes if you focus your efforts on what you can do locally.
It may be helpful to remember the popular phrase, ""Think globally and act locally."" Let your cause be of interest to others, but work on affecting change at home before you expand outward.

, A pillar of personal integrity is acting without self-interest. If an issue is primarily important to you because it affects you personally, you may want to consider choosing a different cause to stand for. However, you may still be able to maintain integrity while championing a personal cause if you do so in a way that focuses on the experiences of others without benefiting yourself.


If your cause is important to you because a given change would make life better for you, you may not be thinking outwardly enough. However, that isn't necessarily an absolute.
For example, you may be motivated to raise awareness of cancer and organize donations for cancer research because a family member was afflicted by the disease. This is still community-oriented and does not serve to gain you personally, so it is a cause with great integrity.

, Once you've found a cause that you can get behind, you'll want to find ways to help further that cause. There are many ways to help support a cause, though every organization may have different needs. Talk to someone at an organization you're interested in to find out how you can help lend your support.


Monetary donations are always helpful to existing (and legitimate) nonprofit organizations. Just make sure your money is going to actually help further the cause by asking how donations are spent.Search online for an organization to volunteer with. You can spend your time helping social, civic, environmental, cultural, and educational causes while also improving your community.If an organization does not yet exist for your cause, start one!
You can find some helpful information on starting a nonprofit organization by browsing through the National Council of Nonprofits' website, or by reaching out to your state association of nonprofits., Through all of your efforts, make sure that you never lose sight of your values and your personal mission statement. Every effort you make to support your cause should further your own personal values and should help you get one step closer to living the life you dream for yourself.


If you're sacrificing your values in favor of an easy gain, you're not adhering to those values.
Your values should guide your efforts to help the cause you've chosen. Make sure you live with purpose and dedication.

Assess what you consider to be the meaning of life.,
Consider whether your life serves your purpose.,
Find ways to live with greater mindfulness.",How to Improve Your Personal Integrity3," Many people mix up having a moral purpose with having religion. While religion certainly helps many people find meaning and purpose in life, it is not essential for someone to live a meaningful life.


There is no absolute meaning to life. Every person creates meaning from their own lives. Life means something different to everyone.The meaning of your life should be what you believe your life is ultimately building towards.
Do you want to dedicate your life solely to getting rich, or do you believe life should include helping others in some way?
You may find that living a life of integrity and strong moral character can give life meaning in itself. However, this is something that only you can decide for yourself.
If you believe religion can help you find your purpose in life, then pursue it. Find a religion that speaks to you, do some research online, and join a congregation near you.

, Once you've identified what you believe is the meaning of your life, you'll need to step back and honestly assess whether you're living in a way that serves that purpose. You may find that you're well on your way, or you may realize that there is room for improvement.Be honest and critical in your assessment. If there's room for improvement, acknowledge it.
If you haven't been living in a way that serves your purpose, that's okay. The important thing is recognizing this and making changes going forward.
If you currently spend any of your time, money, or efforts thinking about or actively working towards your identified purpose in life, then you're already on your way to living with meaning.

, When you live with mindfulness, you are aware of your purpose in life and you actively try to demonstrate integrity. Mindfulness requires you to be conscious of the way you think, speak, and behave every day, and to work towards carrying out those activities in a more meaningful way.Focus on your senses. Think about the way things look, sound, smell, feel, and taste, and try to be aware of your reaction to all of that sensory information.
Concentrate on your breath. Breathing mindfully, being aware of the sensation of each inhalation and exhalation, can help you remain focused and in the present moment.
Try meditation. Meditating, whether through mindful breathing or mantra recitation, can help you gain a deeper awareness of your thoughts and your actions every day.
Consider exploring religion. Not everyone needs religion, but many people find it gives their lives greater purpose and a sense of morality.
You can find meditation and mindfulness classes in your community by searching online. You can also find information about religious organizations near you by searching the internet or by talking to practitioners you know.

Look for the funny side of situations: While it can be difficult at times to find the funny side in unfortunate events when you’re having a bad day, try to think about how the situation might look like to other people, and endeavour not to get too angry.,
Learn some basic jokes.,
Look at joke or humor cards.,
Learn from friends.,
Learn from kids.,
Go along to stand up gigs.,
Draw cartoons.,
Avoid being offensive.,
Don't go overboard with your humor.",How to Improve Your Sense of Humor," Laughing over minor accidents, trips and falls will help you in preventing a loss of temper that you will regret later.;
, Some people find it hard to remember jokes, and feel left out when others are telling them. It’s worth trying to learn a few jokes that you can pull out the bag when you need to, or regularly think about how you can turn a funny situation that occurs in daily life into an entertaining anecdote for later.

, There are many different kinds of funny cards available, which can be a great inspiration for finding ways to improve your sense of humour. Giving an appropriate funny card to friends and family on the right occasion will show that you have a good sense of humour and are thinking about them.

, Look at friends that you think have a great sense of humour. How do they deal with situations, and what kind of jokes do they make? Is there anything you can take away from their actions?

, Spend time with children, and see where they find humour in strange situations. Children’s humour can offer an alternative perspective, and be refreshing if you want to go for a more light-hearted approach occasionally rather than constantly trying to develop jokes for adults.

, The atmosphere and the performance of stand up gigs can give you a perspective on how people react to jokes, as well as what kind of routines and jokes that you personally find funny. If you don’t have time to physically go, try watching comedians and comedies on TV.

, It’s a good idea to experiment with drawing cartoons on a frustrating day, even if your drawing skills aren’t great. A simple cartoon with a funny caricature or pun can put a bad situation into perspective.

, Always think carefully about the kind of jokes you tell, and how they might cause offense. What might seem funny to you may actually end up offending someone close to you, even if you don’t realise it at the time. Steer clear of using racist, sexist or other demeaning ways of cracking a joke––not only are these not funny but they entrench the marginalizing effect on the people targeted by the jokes.

, Forced and awkward humour isn’t going to be much fun for anyone, least of all you. Something that’s been clearly planned out isn’t going to work well in a social situation, so try to relax and let humour come naturally over time. The best jokes are spontaneous and unplanned.

Spend time with your family, friends and people that care about you.",How to Improve Your Looks and Personality (Teen Girls)," You have probably heard this tip a gazillion times, but it's more important than you think. When you meet someone new, you look at their face first, don't you? Your face tells a lot of things about you, and if you take good care of it, it would show everyone that you respect yourself and your looks. You can easily take care of your face at home.


First of all, you should find out what kind of skin you have. Search for tips about finding your type of skin on the Internet and in magazines. The way you take care of your face depends on how your skin is. Do you have pimples? Then, you have oily skin. Is your skin coarse, dehydrated? Then, you have dry skin.
Clean your face twice per day, in the morning and before you go to bed. Use a cleanser suitable for your type of skin. Don't rub your face too harshly. When you apply the cleanser, use warm water, but not hot, to open your pores. When you rinse your face, use chilly water to close your pores. Then, buff your face gently with a towel.
Apply a moisturizer suitable for your type of skin: a gentle one for oily skin, a stronger one for dry skin. You should apply it rightly after you clean your face, when the skin is slightly wet, as it would be better absorbed.
Use a scrub twice per week, right between the cleanser and the moisturizer, to remove dead cells.
Use a face mask once per week. You can prepare a mask with things from your refrigerator, or buy a mask special for your type of skin. You can ask a dermatologist about this, or search for recipes on the Internet. The mask should be applied after the cleanser and the scrub.
If you are suffering of acne, you should talk to a dermatologist, who can give you the best advice to cure it.;
, Your hair is also really important, in fact, you always study people's hair, even if you don't realise it. Taking good care of your hair is easier than you might believe. You can do it cheaply with a few basic products.


Again, you should study your hair and the way it presents itself during the week. The hair can be oily or dry, too. If your hair gets dirty and stiff really fast, and it glows in the light, then it is oily. If your hair is wiry, then it is dry. Figuring out what type of hair you have helps you pick the best care schedule.
Wash your hair. Don't wash it every day, it can get wiry, or oily even faster. The best choice ( and the one that particularly works for the author of the article ) is washing it twice a week. Choose a shampoo that suits your hair type; you can pick it according to the ingredient list, or to the advice you might receive from other people with similar hair type or specialists. Shampoo your hair, rinse, then shampoo again, and then rinse again. The second shampoo-rinse sequence has to be longer and more careful. Be sure to completely rinse your hair, so it won't be any more shampoo.
Apply conditioner ONLY if necessary ( so if you have dry hair ) . Conditioner might make your hair more oily. Pick a good conditioner, and apply it at the ends.
Dry your hair properly. Blow-drying is not quite recommended, but you can do it once per week, or slightly twice per week. Don't over-blow-dry your hair, as it can grow more sensitive, and it can have the tendency to be easier destroyed.
Brush your hair properly. Don't brush it too harshly. Be careful especially when your hair is wet, and it is more fragile.
Tie your hair up properly. If you have oily hair, you should tie your hair up more, as it can become oily if it touches your face. Tie your hair up when you are doing sport. Don't tie it too strongly, as it can affect your hair, or make it even oily.
Don't use too much products on your hair. Embrace your natural straight hair or your curls. Sometimes, a natural look is the key to success.
Hair masks are a solution, too, but search for professional advice if you decide to have periodical hair masks ( they are recommended for more serious hair problems, like hair loss ) .

, A beautiful person always flashes a smile to the people around. Having healthy teeth is extremely important. As with face and hair, you have to take good care of your teeth, too.


Brush your teeth daily, at least two or three times a day. Use a good toothpaste and a good toothbrush ( change your toothbrush once at three months ) . When your are brushing your teeth, your should pay attention to the cleaning of the tongue, the gums and the inside of the cheeks, too. Brush your teeth for around 1-3 minutes, and don't forget to rinse.
You can use other special dental products like mouthwash or dental floss.
Chewing gum is not ideal, but it can be useful from time to time. You shouldn't make a habit from chewing gum, as it can become unhealthy if excessive. Still, you should have a packet of gum in your bag, just in case. If you suspect your breath of smelling badly from some reason, chew some gum and the problem is solved until you arrive home to brush your teeth.
If you don't have any problems with your teeth, still have a dentist appointment once at six months.

, We use our hands and legs a lot, so our nails are subdued to a lot of things during the day. That's why we should take good care of our nails, and give them attention periodically. There a few basic things to know about treating your nails right.


Clip your nails and give them a beautiful shape. For this, you might want to talk to someone specialised in this domain. The ideal shape for your nails depends on the fingers' length, hand shape and other stuff. You can keep them short and natural by clipping them periodically. If you want long nails, clip them less.
Paint your nails. You can choose bold colours for short nails, and suave pastels with drawings for long nails. You can paint your nails at home, or go for a mani-pedi session at the beauty parlour, after all, it's your choice. You can find catching tutorials all over the Internet, that teach you how to give your nails a beautiful look. You should take care of your mani-pedi at least once a week.
Don't apply coloured nail polish too often; give your nails a break of 2-5 days after wiping the nail polish off.

, A lot of teenage girls are concerned about their weight, and they think it's not normal for their age. They see their friends looking skinnier, and they also see unbelievably thin models on the catwalks. This is just a MISCONCEPTION. If you think you are fat, then there are 90% chances that you're wrong. Fat means an abnormal state, when your weight is much bigger than the normal one. Fat doesn't mean a little thicker thighs, which appear huge to you. Instead, having curves is much more attractive than looking like a walking stick. If you really want to change something about your weight, you can do a few healthy things.


Don't start diets. Diets mostly mean self-harm at your age, and they recommended if you're older than 20, when the growing process is finished. If you really think you need a diet, talk to one of your parents and ask them for an appointment with a nutritionist. Internet diets are NOT a good idea. A specialist can help you properly.
Don't cut off food. This is one of the biggest mistakes you can do. Skipping meals can only cause harm to you; also, it's not important how much you eat, but WHAT you eat.
Try eating more fruit and vegetables. It really helps. Also, try to have a diversity of products in your meals: diary products, meat, carbohydrates.
Avoid junk food. Still, if you would like to eat an ice cream, don't refuse this to yourself. A little chocolate will never harm. It's also really important to drink lots of water.
Pick up a sport that you enjoy. It's one of the best decisions you can make, no matter what your opinion on your weight is. Physical exercise is essential for leading a healthy life. The activity can even be a hobby, like dancing or gardening, that involves physical exertion.
For a professional piece of advice, talk to a specialist.

, This is another really popular, but extremely useful tip. Water is really good to your entire body. It's said that there isn't a certain recommended quantity of water, and it actually depends on age, height and weight. You can approximately drink 8 glasses of water per day ( or four bottle of 0.5 litres ) . Drink a few sips from time to time, so you would keep yourself hydrated during the day. Still mineral water is preferred, but you can also drink sparkling water. Processed juices can't replace water. After all, always pick water.

, Sports are a good thing to add to your daily schedule. It doesn't matter if you are a sporty person or not. You should have a workout session of 30 minutes once per day, and when I say workout session, I mean even walking around your neighbourhood. As long as it involves moving around, it can be included in your daily schedule. Don't run away from the PE class; instead, enjoy moving with your friends. Start going to gym, or take dance, yoga, fitness or zumba classes. You can even start doing a certain sports, like football, volleyball, badminton or whatever. You can even add music to your sport session. And most importantly, enjoy the sport(s).

, Sleep is really important, as it helps our body rest and our cells to regenerate. One of the keys of natural beauty is a good sleep. You should sleep around eight hours a night, and plan the going to bed hour to fulfill this amount. Don't sleep with your TV turned on, as it may affect your sleep. Also, don't drink caffeine in the afternoon or evening, because it can keep you awake. Prepare a comfy bed, tuck yourself in and relax. You should fall asleep quite soon.

, Clothes say a lot of things about us. Think about it! If you see a girl wearing ripped up jeans and a black T-shirt with a rock band, you would say she's a rocker, wouldn't you? Clothes express our style and our personality. You should apply this idea to your own outfits, too.


Check your wardrobe. Donate all the things that no longer suit you, someone may need them. If you know the content of your wardrobe, there are bigger chances to make stunning fashion combinations. If you have the possibility, go shopping with your mum, sister or best friend. This way, someone who knows you well may suggest you a few pieces of clothing you have never expected yourself to wear.
Express your own unique style. Wear clothes that suit your body and your special personality. Don't copy anyone, just inspire yourself. Try to diversify your fashion choices, if you can. Don't be afraid to make mistakes. You'd better wear a horrible outfit today, at school, then go for it for a date, for example!
Add accessories. It can be a cute necklace, or a bold bracelet. It just has to say something about you. Accessories are a final, sweet touch for a perfect outfit. A plain white T-shirt, for example, can be completed by a silver chain with a funny pendant and ta-daaa! your outfit is ready!
NEVER think only clothes from popular brands are looking good. This is a huge misconception. You can find beautiful things even in second-hand shops and thrift shops. Don't be ashamed if your clothes don't belong to a brand. Nobody will check the label, but everyone will admire your beautiful pieces of clothing.

, Depending on your hair length, texture and type, you can choose various hairstyles which suit your face and express your personality. There are plenty of tutorials on the Internet about how to wear your hair, and you can choose something from there. Again, choose diversity. Even going for a wrong hairstyle teaches you not to do the same mistake again. There are a lot of choices available for girls with short hair, too: try a few elegant pins or a bold hat. You'll see that everyone will appreciate your outstanding looks.

, Make-up makes you look girlier, and it can emphasize your most beautiful face features. There a few secrets about the applying of the make-up, which every girl has to know.


Apply make-up carefully and sparingly. If you put too much product on, it would look all caked up, and ridiculous. You are young, and the best make-up for an everyday school look is natural, but slightly obvious. This means the basis, then a little eye-shadow, mascara and a pink gloss.
Don't forget to wipe the make-up off at the end of the day. If you sleep with your make-up one, you will get your pores all clogged up. Also, a lot of unwiped make-up can lead to future wrinkles.
Not all types of make-up can suit your face shape, eyes shape, lips shape. For doing the best choices, talk to a specialist who can recommend you effective tricks. After you learn what you need to learn, search for tutorials online or articles about make-up in magazines. Then, start to exercise. It won't be perfect at the beginning but, you know, practice makes perfect.

, Perfume is the final touch you can add at your daily look. Choose a perfume that represents you and, of course, that you like. Spray a medium quantity ( not too much, as it would be irritating ) on your neck, wrists and behind your ear. You'll see that you'll turn heads wherever you go!

, Everyone has bad habits, but some of them are not that obvious. Bad habits include biting nails, touching your face and hair constantly, popping pimples and others. They are all enemies of your ascent to being a natural beauty, so we must eliminate them from our lives. Sometimes it may seem to be really hard, but it all depends on you wanting to do this change. You can talk to one of your parents, or a specialist about this. You have no reason to feel shame. Everyone has a bad habit. Maybe someone doesn't bit their nails, but they shake their knee constantly or something similar. It's admirable that you want to make a change, when others are caught in their own bad habits and deny that. Instead of acting like nothing happens, take action.


You should identify when you have the bad habit. Maybe when you're nervous or concentrated, or when you're influenced by a powerful emotion. After you decide what causes the burst of your bad habit, try to avoid such situations. Sometimes you can't, like when you're at school and you're concentrated at the lesson, and you start biting your nails. You need to have the power of reaction. As soon as you realise your bad habit is in process, hide your hands under your thighs, in your pockets or under the desk. It all depends on you.
If you bite your nails, you can paint them, although you might have the temptation to bite the dried polish. Get a cute drawing on your nails. Probably the sight of your beautiful manicure would convince you not to bite your nails.
If you have the tendency to pop your pimples, stay away from mirrors as much as you can, as the sight of the acne would make you lose yourself to your bad habit. If you're looking in the mirror, though, focus on your eyes.

, You can't look outstanding all the time. After all, this is kind of ridiculous and artificial. Sometimes you won't be in the mood of pimping yourself up. This is ok and COMPLETELY normal. If you understand this, then it's alright. Don't aspire to perfection, because nobody's perfect. Still, try to look your best all the time. You don't have to step inside your class in a dress and high heels every day. A pair of jeans and a large anorak is acceptable for bad look days, too. Think about the message you're trying to send: it isn't ""Today I don't feel in the mood of looking good."" , but ""Today I look good even in comfortable clothes.""

, If you read this article, then you have a reason for your desire to make a change at yourself. Think about this reason. Write it down, if you want. This reason would be the basis for your inner change. Maybe you're shy, and you don't talk too much to people. Maybe someone has made you suffer, and pushed your self-respect and love down, in the puddle I was talking about at the beginning. No matter what it is, now it's the past. The fact that you read this article is only the first step to change. Of course, it all depends on you and on the decisions you make. As soon as you develop the answer for this question, plan your next step. If you're shy, what do you plan to do? Talk to more people, of course! Try to develop your own solutions, before reading the rest of the tips. Mostly important, don't forget that you are special in your own way, and no-one ( I mean, NO-ONE ) can prove you contrary.

, I know it may look like a cliché taken from teenager movies, but it can help you more than you can think. You don't have to write daily or to write everything that happens to you during a day. Instead, the journal has to be your support during your ascent. If you're concerned about something, put it down, then start doing something else, not related to your worries. You can write about your feelings or emotions, about your thoughts and opinions. Put down your successes and your achievements, and remember yourself constantly that you're special.

, Think about it: why is a certain girl beautiful, apart from her stylish outfits and her beautiful make-up? The posture is important, too! In fact, nobody will glance twice at someone who hides their face and acts like they would like to be anywhere else. Keep your back straight and your chin up, walk relaxed, arms swinging on your sides. Don't hide your hands, as it may look like a sign of insecurity. Don't be afraid to walk in a sassy way: you have all the reasons, in fact, you're amazing!


To be sure that you'll always remember about keeping up your posture, draw a little star on your writing hand. At school or work, you'll most probably write, you'll see the star, and remember about the posture.

, Smiling always brings the others close to you. You would most probably talk to someone smiling, instead of someone who wears a permanent frown on their face. From the personal experience of the article's author, forcing a smile is quite hard, especially if you're that type of person who smiles only when there's a reason to. Still, you have to try to fake it. For example, you run into a friend on the street. As you walk towards them, think about the experiences of your friendship, the inside jokes, the funny bloopers and everything else that's amusing. You'll see that a smile would unconsciously appear on your lips! You'll gradually learn how to smile friendly in all types of situations.

, Everyone talks to themselves, even if they don't admit it. Inner-talking is something common and logical for anyone, and you may not believe it, but it has a major impact on your opinions and feelings. If you continuously tell yourself things like 'I am ugly.' , 'Nobody likes me.' or 'I'm dumb.' constantly, you will start to actually believe them. Instead, you should do exactly the opposite. Compliment and praise yourself, offer you a kind reply every day. You can do it in your mind or out loud, it doesn't matter. Do this periodically, and you'll see that it will work better than you have imagined.

, A relaxed person is a happy person. Sometimes we're too stuck in the affairs of the day, that we forgot to take a break and do something calming or fun. You're young, and this is the time to enjoy yourself in every way possible. Stop studying for around one quarter of hour, and do something else: read a magazine, take a walk, eat something, listen to some music, or whatever relaxes you. Enjoy everything that surrounds you, let yourself daydream or do crazy things. Maybe you would like to dance in the middle of the supermarket. Just do that. People will probably judge you, but who cares? I don't.

, Hobbies are great. When you go to university, then work, and then you start a family, you won't probably have time for your hobbies. So, you have to enjoy your favorite things to do now. In other words, read, listen to music, watch movies, go out with friends. Develop your own daily activities that relax you and get you concentrated. Don't be afraid to try something new. It can be anything, from being a drummer in a rock band to study a difficult language. Being busy with your hobbies makes you feel fulfilled, relaxed, calm, you.

, This is like a puzzle piece which can't be replaced by anything. They are the people that love you and accept you, no matter what. Give love and care back to them, constantly showing them that you care. Planning common activities is an idea worth to try. A picnic in family, or a chick-lit movies night with your best friends can bring a smile on everyone's face. Realise that, if you weren't so special, these people would not love you so much!

Identify your learning style.,
Use mnemonic devices.,
Study with images.,
Engage your senses.,
Make connections.,
Emphasize recall.,
Tell a story.,
Create a mindmap.",How to Improve Your Ability to Learn Quickly1," By determining your learning style, you can determine the best techniques to help you retain information more effectively. Many people have multiple learning styles while some people may just have one dominant style. Figure out which style works best for you.Auditory learners pick up information by listening to it. Lectures, podcasts, discussion groups, and videos may work best for you.
Visual learners gain new information by watching it. Charts, diagrams, pictures, films, and written material is most beneficial for these types.
Kinesthetic learners adopt new practices by doing them. Participation in an activity, such as a science lab, discussion group, or hands-on class, may help you learn more effectively.;
, These are quick tricks designed to increase the amount of information that your brain can remember. They work by getting you to organize information into memorable patterns. The song “I can sing a rainbow” is one example; it is used to remember color names.If you need to recall a set of numbers, break them down in sections containing three numbers each and memorize the sequence. This is called “chunking” and is one reason why social security numbers and telephone numbers are broken up into groups.
Recall a set of letters by creating an acronym. This is a word formed out of the first letters in a word or phrase. For example, musicians looking to remember the bass staff note order ACEG could memorize the phrase, “All Cows Eat Grass.”
Keep tricky pieces of information in your mind via rhyming. For a college history exam, “Columbus sailed the ocean blue in fourteen-hundred and ninety-two.”

, Transform written information or numbers lists into visuals, such as a chart, graph, or map. Creating images like these increases your mind's flexibility which, in turn, helps with its ability to remember new information. Don’t worry if the final product isn’t perfect; assigning images is a very individual thing.Associate a person’s name with a particular image, such as Robin with a bird. Or, when you meet Brad, picture him alongside the famous Brad Pitt. The visuals do not have to be similar for the memory to stick in your mind.
Learn the mobile numbers of all your friends by making a mental picture of every number (0-9). Think of a pencil for 1; for 2, think of the head of the duck and so forth. After keeping a picture in your mind for every number, develop a story based on those pictures. Make sure the sequence is not altered.

, If you need notes, take them by hand and via audio recorder. Then, type them up afterwards. The more ways that you experience something, the better you learn it. Use as many of your senses as you can, perhaps by playing a song as you study., You come to every task with tons of prior knowledge; use it. Ask yourself where you have seen this particular type of information before. For example, if you are writing an essay, remember what worked the last time you turned something in.Connect dates that you are trying to learn with important ones in your memory. It can be your school team winning, your mother's birthday, father's birthday, or any date that is significant to you. You can even break up the dates and remember months based on Zodiac signs.

, Push your mind to remember every detail in the moment and to make the larger connections later as you talk with others about your experience. Watch a lab demonstration and then discuss your observations with your lab partner afterwards. Pay attention to what your partner noticed that you missed and vice versa., Benefit from the power of an interesting tale. There is a reason why creation stories are remembered and passed from generation to generation. They excite while also passing along knowledge.


If you are working with a group, build a story together. For example, if you are studying the history of U.S. presidents, make up a story about each one. Or, better yet, find a real story to remember.

, A mindmap is a visual chart that uses branches and lines to demonstrate the relationship between ideas. These are great for visual learners. Write the main idea in a box in the center of a piece of a paper, and draw branches off the center to identify similar ideas. Keep drawing out branches to new sources of information, and connect ideas with lines or images."

Be aware of your strengths.,
Test yourself.,
Keep it different and new.,
Seek out difficulty.,
Check your motivation.,
Stay single-minded.",How to Improve Your Ability to Learn Quickly2," Set aside a few minutes every day to think about how you learn. Ask yourself, “Do I understand more with notes or highlighting?” Write down a list of what you consider to be your strengths and weaknesses when learning something new. For example, do you quit easily when you are frustrated?, Don’t wait until the formal exam date to see how you perform under pressure. Set up rounds of practice testing well beforehand. Give yourself a prep exam or ask a friend to give you a pop quiz.


If you use flashcards, do not remove cards as you feel comfortable with them. It is best to keep all cards in play and to practice frequently until the date of an exam., Brains can get lazy, especially when they are good at certain tasks. Once you reach mastery at a certain task, you need to move on to a new one. For example, if you can easily play poker, push yourself to learn blackjack. You want your mind to be constantly challenged., Set a high bar for new learning tasks. Try to make a difficult recipe or change your own oil. Keep it challenging, but not impossible. This will help you to remember how to learn quickly by improving how your mind performs under stress.For maximum benefit, try setting aside your technology, such as the spell checker on computers, and going manual for a bit.
Playing fast-paced action video games creates a high level of difficulty that pushes users to adapt to new physical skills. This can result in gamers having an advantage when learning to ride a bike, for example., Before you start a task, ask yourself, “Why am I doing this?” The more passionate that you are about a task, the better. Your excitement will let your brain know that it is time to learn., Focus all of your attention on one task before moving on to another. Finish your game of chess before moving on to checkers. If you switch actions mid-stream you lose valuable time. You also have to get your mind 'back in the game' every time you switch jobs.The exception is if you are completely stuck on a task. If so, leave that math problem behind and work on writing for a bit before coming back to it.

Practice yoga meditation.,
Stay fit.,
Eat right.,
Drink water.,
Get enough sleep.",How to Improve Your Ability to Learn Quickly3," Find a quiet place and do a few stretches before a big test. Or, take five deep, calming breaths before walking in to the boardroom. You want to achieve a relaxed and focused mind. This is especially helpful prior to completing a particularly difficult or time-intensive task.


Watching your breathing, along with other yoga techniques, improves both long and short term memory., Try to work out at least 30 minutes three times a week. Strength training, intervals, and cardio all improve brain function.Exercise also boosts productivity and energy levels, leading to more production in the long term.


Students have been shown to work faster on a memory task after exercising. It is believed that these benefits are immediate., Get three balanced meals a day, even you are faced with little time. Quality food is fuel for your mind. For example, cinnamon not only improves memory, it reverses the damage associated with memory loss.Likewise, eating dark chocolate leads to a better memory.


Polyunsaturated fatty acids (especially omega-3), found in salmon and walnuts, help with memory as well. Forgetfulness is often a sign of omega-3 deficiency., Carry a water bottle with you to stay hydrated and refill it often. If you are even a little dehydrated, your mind will move slower. Drinking water well in advance, and immediately before, a test has shown the best results.


Children offered additional drinking water perform better on tests involving memory, such as pairing letters., Aim for 8-10 hours of undisturbed sleep a night. Sleep allows your mind and body to rest in preparation for a new day. It also helps to approach a complex task from a new perspective the following day."

Get organized.,
Make lists.,
Keep to a specific schedule.,
Limit distractions.,
Don't multitask.,
Get exercise.,
Take breaks.,
Practice using memory cards.,
Use ""what's wrong with this picture"" puzzles.,
Hone your math skills.,
Memorize an image.,
Learn to meditate.",How to Improve Attention to Detail," You will need to have organization in your life to have any hope of paying attention to the small things. This means having organization in your work or school life by keeping track of appointments and tasks that need to be accomplished so that you aren't surprised when it's time to turn them in.;
, Lists are one really useful way to be organized and to make sure that you know when and how everything needs to come together. You'll be less likely to lose track of the details when you have them written out and kept somewhere that you see every day (a lost list is about as useful as a lead balloon).


Have a long-term list and a short-term (weekly or daily) list so that you are able to plan for things in advance. When the items on the long-term list come up, put them on your short-term list, but this way you won't be surprised by anything in your schedule.
Once you've completed an item on your list, check it off. That way you'll know that you actually did do it and you won't be in a dither trying to remember whether you've completed each step of a certain list item.

, If you're running around willy nilly and each day is a different mess of times and items, try to sort it into a routine that follows the same general rhythm. Your brain will be quicker to notice when you've dropped the ball on a detail than when each day is a hodgepodge of different things.


Make sure that you go to bed and get up at the same times each day. For example, you go to bed at 10:30 pm every night and get up at 7:30 am every morning. This way your body will be in a single routine and you'll be getting enough sleep so that your memory will be working better anyway.

, Distractions come in a variety of forms: your family, your friends, that annoying coworker who won't stop talking, everything ever on the internet, even being hungry. When you're distracted and you're trying to pay attention to the details of a project or your homework, you're not going to be able to recall things as easily and you're more likely to forget the details.


try to work in an area that is conducive to focus; not too hot, with good lighting and fewer people coming in and out (for school, a nice corner in the library is usually a good choice; at work, do your best in your office or cubicle to be cool and well-lit).
Put your phone on silent and tell your friends and family members not to call you when you're working unless it's an emergency.
If you're working at home, avoid working in your bed and try to have a designated, organized workspace.
For your annoying coworker, if you can keep your door closed do that, otherwise simply say to them ""I'd love to catch up, but I really have to get this project finished. I'll come by and chat with you in a bit."" Or you can tell them to go away, depending on what your relationship with them and your co-workers is like.

, Multitasking spreads your attention out over a variety of items instead of focusing it on one specific item, which means that you end up unable to give full attention to each item and you won't be able to get all the details in order.


Using the list that you've drawn up, you can go from project to project, giving each your full attention without checking your phone and your Facebook and planning what you're going to eat for dinner.
If you find yourself doing things like planning for dinner or wondering whether you've paid your bills, write down your idea or concern (you can add it to your list) and return to the project you're supposed to be working on. This way you know that you will remember to take care of the concern and you don't have to obsess over it.
Sometimes you have to multitask, or you have to conserve your energy by letting some of the details of a project slip because you have so much to do. Focus your attention on the most important projects so that they get your attention to details, while giving less attention to the less important projects.

, Exercise helps improve your memory and your concentration abilities while also being good for your whole body. To help improve your attention to detail and to keep your memory strong, you'll want to engage in at least 30 minutes of exercise each day.Your exercise routine could be as simple as walking to the grocery store after work, or biking to and from work (remember to bring your work clothes with you in case of rain or mud). You could do 30 minutes of yoga, or go for a run, or even just put on some music and dance.

, A good way to keep your brain sharp and willing to focus on the smaller details is to allow it to take breaks. Make sure that you schedule them around the same time each day and try for 10 to 15 minutes each. This will give your brain a chance to relax in time for the next project.


A break can be something as simple as stretching and taking a short walk around your office, or going for coffee down the street.
When you find that you are getting really distracted or sleepy, this is a good time to find a place to do a little exercise, like jumping jacks, to get the blood flowing.

, There are good ways to practice paying attention to the details so that your brain stays sharp and engaged. One of these ways is by using memory cards. You'll gather a group of pairs (start small, maybe 8-10 pairs) and place them face side down. Flip two over, look at them, and turn them face side down once more. Each time you find a pair, remove it from the game.


Your ability to remember where the cards are on the table will help you to pay attention to the details in all the different parts of your life.
You can also play this game with a friend (especially once you're really good and you can show off your impressive skills!).

, These can be found in any children's magazine ever. The child-level ones are pretty easy, but you can easily find more difficult puzzles. The more you practice these puzzles the better you'll find that you are paying attention to other details.

, Mathematics is a subject that requires a lot of attention to detail (after all, if you get one number wrong the whole answer ends up being wrong) and are a great way to improve your attention to detail.


Do things like balancing your budget by hand. Pay close attention to the numbers and make sure to double check your work.

, Look closely at a scene (you can do this anywhere: at work, on the bus, at a coffee shop) and close your eyes. Recall as many details about the scene as you possibly can. The more you practice the better and more attentive to the details you'll become.Another easy way to do this is with an unfamiliar photograph. Look at it for a couple seconds and then flip the photograph over. Recall as many of the details as you can. Repeat this exercise with a different photograph each time.
Memory sketches are similar to the memorizing an image exercise. Look at a scene for about a minute and then turn away. From memory, sketch what you saw in the scene, or make a list of the things you saw. When you've finished, compare what you saw with what was actually there.

, Meditation is something that is incredibly useful for a wide variety of things. It can help you with your physical health, your mental health, and it can help you with your memory and your attention to detail by calming your mind and by reducing your stress (it helps put your brain on more positive neuro-pathways).Find somewhere quiet to sit for about 15 minutes each day (when you're more advanced at meditation you can do it anywhere: at your desk at work, on the bus, etc, but it's good to start somewhere without many distractions).
Close your eyes and take deep breaths all the way down into your belly. Focus on your breathing. When you find distracting thoughts coming into your head, acknowledge them but do not focus on them. Return to your breathing by saying to yourself ""Breathe in, breathe out.""

See that it's pointless to resist change, because change isn't going away.,
Examine your premises.,
Recognize that the rich have only money.,
Cultivate real friendships.,
Dump those ""high maintenance"" items.,
Offer something you don't need.,
See if you can't dump a bunch of the low maintenance items, too.,
Co-opt, and Co-op.,
Develop some enjoyment for the real things.,
Stick with it.",How to Join in the End of the Profit Motive," Change is a flowing constant. See that things aren't going to be the same, and getting angry at elected leaders that you are secretly or openly envious of is pointless; they are mostly good people trapped in a rotten system. While this isn't meant to be dire, understand that adjustments will have to be made, and that it's largely your attitude that will determine how they ""feel"".
Your attitude can either come along for the ride, or lead the way!


Recognize that you may be in a better position than many people--if you're able to read this, maybe a lot better.
If you let go of what you may hardly have anymore, anyway, it might help you to find what you can't seem to get.
See that you've probably never been starving, or otherwise near death, although it may have seemed like it for a while there, after High School...trials build character. Feel that instinctive shrinking away, just hearing that? It's that feeling that we're trying to get to.;
, People generally float along on their premises; the word is hardly ever spoken. If you have to look it up, trust that you're not alone; and yet, premises are what you run on -- your starting point; it will pay you dividends to insure that they are sound.
The truth is never shouted; it doesn't need a commercial, and it won't come as spam in your inbox.
The truth, whatever that is for you, has to be sought, and is easily drowned out by your attention to other things.Har Meggiddo is Armageddon, to you -- but if your whole concept of Armageddon was given to you by another, you might want to relieve yourself of some of those related misconceptions, too, by reading this article.

, Of course there are certainly exceptions ~ people who are more blessed than ""rich""; but they have had to insulate themselves from the ""aspiring rich"". When you're ""well off"", you have a big load of worry, and no friends that you can really trust--they all want to be well off, too; and you know, not very deep down (because striving for profit keeps you on a ""surface""), that they probably wouldn't mind getting well off on you.


The ""rich"" aren't, by and large, the consolidated ""Builderbergers"" you might think they are; this gives you a distinct advantage over someone who is an ""aspiring rich"", and probably distracted with thoughts of eating their young, etc., that don't burden you.
See that ""opting out"", an option promoted more by the dis-enfranchised, is really just ""copping out"" -- and following those who would seek to amass billions of dollars for themselves.
It might seem impossible to separate ""good"" from ""bad"" in what you hear, but it's not; just completely ignore what is being said, and look at what is being done. Talk is cheap~contrast rich people calling you from their ""island"", commiserating about how horrible ""things"" are, with (both?) rich people currently in Haiti, doing something about it.

, The saying goes, ""If you want to have a friend, be a friend. Opt in to an opportunity that you might have normally passed on, even a year ago (you were so busy), for the sake of lending a helping hand; unseen benefits always seem to accrue from these. You might call back someone that offered you an opportunity to volunteer, or something, even a year ago--that might possibly be a great connection that ""they"" were just a little more sensitive to than you, at that moment.
Currently, your school system, local government, and local giving organizations all need assistance. Even if it seems...different, at first, not what you're used to, stick around long enough to understand why your ""new friends"" seem to call this the best part of their day.


If you haven't been offered any such opportunities lately, you might want to take a look at that, and recognize that opportunities to make a difference are...anywhere you look, all of a sudden.

, Escalades, motorboats, the second home? Recognize that most everything you ""own"", right down to your cell phone, could seem like a necessity; but much of the world has gotten along fine without most of that stuff (and had a happier life than many in ""developed"" countries), even if they may have been striving to be like you (in jealousy and admiration, no less).
Anyone who really matters to you should be able to get hold of you, with or without a phone; even people in other countries. Your city has busses, libraries pretty much all have internet now (at least for the time being); with computers you can get on for free, and Skype, etc. Losing the cell phone alone brings an amazing...lack of constant ringing.

Do many of the things you own, really own you? Don't forget to appreciate how your maintenance load is so much lighter in a month or two.

, It often works like this--it occurs to you that some unused piece of...something shiny, has just been taking up floor space for a year; sure, you should Craigslist it, maybe (but, for what? a third of it's ""value""?)-- why not just commit to giving it to the next person that evinces a need for it? When you have a need later, don't be surprised when it gets as quick a response.


This is great for your mind, a ""letting go"" type of thing; it can be a good place to start, mentally. Encourage your kids to let go a little, too, and they may quickly take a lead, here, even if they seem reluctant, at first; kids are more naturally giving. (although this might sound untrue; they are just following their societal ""training"").

, you might be amazed, even stunned, at what you spend in paper products in a year! Paper towels, newspapers, coffee filters, and a whole host of other things that you spend money on right now have quite serviceable replacements; you'll come to see that many are superior.

, we'll look at these two together just because they sound alike! Get your kids, who may be completely trained out of ""chores"", or ""helping"" (is it like punishment, to them?), involved -- you may start them out slow, at first; an older kid can be put in charge of ""composting"", maybe (learning it and all! he's on the computer enough, probably?).


It's winter right now--which means spring is right around the corner. Get started planning a garden--a driveway sized patch of dirt will feed your family of 6, with a bunch left over for the neighbors you should be getting to know better, anyway.

A younger kid will be easier to get engaged, here; especially after some of their favorite veggie starts to pop through! Let them shop for seeds with you; they'll be more enthused than you might be. Get what you can't grow from a Co-op; they'll take your extras, too.



, All this takes is a minute or two, every time it occurs to you; little steps at a time. Is your dog happier than you are, most of the time? All of the time?. Reflect on what that means! (they get in fights, too)
A little exercise that can pay you dividends, if you take it seriously--finish this sentence: My dog is happier than me most of the time because______. Whatever you put in the blank is where your dog has the advantage of you, and only you can change this.
Get, or get rid of, whatever you put in the blank.
Don't say you can't.

, If you'll commit to this lifestyle (and you may not soon have a lot of choice here), before you know it, you'll see that you're suddenly surrounded with what matters--good food, good friends; and a more fulfilling life.""If there were in the world today any large number of people who desired their own happiness more than they desired the unhappiness of others, we could have paradise in a few years"". -- Bertrand Russell

Watch for a change in behavior.,
Examine the people around them.,
Check out their social media profile.,
Look for short-term relationships in their past.,
Look at their appearance.",How to Identify a Narcissist1," Most relationships with a person with narcissism will start off well. They will initially come off as friendly and confident, and seek to find ways to show that you two are similar. They really are listening to you, at least at first, because being friends with you reflects well on them.Their pleasant demeanor may vanish when he or she does something that might show weakness. Rather than turn to you for support, as a friend will, they will retreat further, focusing on the special circumstances or the unique nature of their situation.
This change may come when they think something about you changes. They will find something about you that doesn’t fit into the vision they have for you and your relationship. These differences suggest that you aren’t the same as them, making you not a good as they are.;
, People with narcissism like to keep the focus on themselves, and so they tend to surround themselves with people who will mirror this behavior. A person with narcissism will be surrounded by people who help inflate those feelings of superiority, and rarely (if ever) challenge them.Narcissism involves a certain emptiness, a concern that the person doesn’t live up to their own expectations. To compensate, they will like to be surrounded by admirers who tell them that he or she is smart, attractive, or whatever else the person with narcissism needs to hear.

, Because people with narcissism are focused on status, they use social media as a way to reinforce their position. A person with narcissism on social media will have lots of friends and a large network. They may even comment on their large network as a way to reinforce how important they are., Because they are so focused on themselves, people with narcissism tend to have very short relationships. They look for partners who will reinforce their sense of self-worth, which can be unsatisfactory to the other person. This leads to a lot of short-term relationships.In some cases, this sense of self-worth can be expressed as infidelity. A person with narcissism will look for someone else who can focus on taking care of his or her needs, implying that their current partner cannot.You can find similar backgrounds in business leaders with narcissism. They stay at companies for a short time, end up wrecking or damaging the business, then quickly move on to the next one. They will also always have an explanation or excuse for how they couldn’t have done any better.

, People with narcissism place a high value on good outward appearance, and they use their appearance to promote their status. They spend a lot of time working on their appearance, such as by styling their hair or choosing clothing. The clothing they choose is often flashy and expensive. Women are also more likely to wear makeup and show off their cleavage.If you suspect a person might have narcissism, looking at the way they present themselves outwardly can be a good sign. Many people with narcissism can draw you in at first because they are trying make a good first impression.Part of the reason why people with narcissism may like expensive flashy clothing is because they use these items as a way to show off high status and improve their own status. One comparison is that a shopaholic will talk about a great deal they got on something, while a person with narcissism will talk about how prestigious the item is.

"
"
Listen for self-references.,
Notice a grandiose sense of self-importance.,
Listen for fantasies of success.,
Listen for authoritative statements.,
Listen for name-dropping.",How to Identify a Narcissist2," A person with narcissism will always keep the conversation on themselves. It doesn’t matter how relevant it is to the topic, a person with narcissism will always find a story or anecdote that places him or her in the center of discussion. The important thing to a person with narcissism is that you and your circle of friends is talking about him or her.Relevance is one key to understanding a person with narcissism’s self-reference. People will naturally try to relate conversations to personal experiences and things they understand. A person with narcissism is different because he or she will always look for a way to interject their experiences or perspective, even if it has nothing to do with what you are talking about.

, As you might expect, a person with narcissism keeps the focus on themselves and their accomplishments. People with narcissism will expect to be recognized as important, influential or superior, even if their accomplishments do not necessarily warrant it.A person with narcissism will likely try to exaggerate his or her accomplishments. He or she will try to make him or herself look like the most important person in every conversation.
Because these are exaggerations, a person with narcissism might not always be successful. If he or she fails at doing something, you can be sure there will be excuses or other explanations for why it didn’t work. The answer certainly won’t be an admission of fault or making a mistake. Someone or something else will always be at fault., It’s certainly natural to dream of being successful, but a person with narcissism will fixate on it. He or she will talk about unlimited success, power, beauty, or any other signal of greatness. These fantasies will be the obvious end result of the individual’s personal greatness, even if he or she has not done anything to deserve that.In many cases, these fantasies will be unattainable, causing him or her to lash out at people who suggest they aren’t possible.

, People with narcissism tend to avoid using “I” statements. When a narcissist makes an assertion, it is not meant to start an argument, but end conversation.It seems counter-intuitive, but narcissists don’t want to use “I” when talking about their ideas. Beginning a statement with “I think” or “My opinion is” suggests that what they are saying may not be completely correct, or is open to critique.

, A person with narcissism will want to show how successful or powerful he or she is, and will make references to other famous or important people they know as proof of this. Listen for referrals to notable people, especially if he or she is using them as a way to show how smart or talented they is.This is different from citing authorities to back up a position. A person with narcissism isn’t interested in providing a background for their assertions. Instead, it is about using this authority to stop conversation and get you to admit he or she is correct.

See if they can find empathy for others.,
Watch for an inability to hear criticism.,
Pay attention if someone lashes out when challenged.",How to Identify a Narcissist3," People with narcissism like to show their superiority by treating those they see as weak or inferior with disdain. When you talk about other people, either specific individuals or more impersonal groups like “the poor” or “cancer patients,” see how they respond. A person with narcissism will find a way to hint, or outright say, how he doesn’t have those problems because of something he does better.Some people with narcissism will even find pleasure in other people’s discomfort. This isn’t because they take pleasure in misfortune, but rather because it reinforces their own sense of superiority because these troubles don’t affect them.

, Nobody likes receiving criticism, of course, but people with narcissism cannot stand it. They are hyper-sensitive to the suggestion that they aren’t as great or wise as they want you to believe. Because they tend to be insecure, people with narcissism may lash out at you or become severely depressed in response to criticism.A person with narcissism may not always lash out at you. Instead, the person might offer excuses, mentioning outside forces that made their success impossible. Sometimes they can tend towards conspiracy theories, ideas that someone else “has it out for me.”

, Someone who lashes out at you if you challenge him or her may have narcissistic tendencies. A person with narcissism does not like weakness, especially in themselves, and will likely lash out at someone who challenges them and the things they say. Their goal will be to shame, guilt, or intimidate you into silence, which they can interpret at acceptance of their viewpoints.Avoid challenging a person with narcissism. The result might be confrontational or even violent.

Listen to others.,
Speak sincerely.,
Know “how” vs “what.” How you say things is arguably more important than what you say.,
Help others communicate.,
Laugh at yourself.,
Show enthusiasm for everything.,
Make laughing a priority.,
Have confidence in how you speak and act.,
Have confidence in your body.,
Know the difference between confidence and cockiness.",How to Have an Attractive Personality," Listening is a trait that is often forgotten about in today’s society. Instead of responding to a text, opening an email, or thinking about your next meal, pay attention to what the other person is saying. Show them you’re listening and interested by commenting on the story or asking questions.;
, No one likes to be duped. Tell people the truth. If you can’t commit to something, it’s better to be honest about it than to have to tell them last minute that you can’t make it. When people ask for your opinion, you should be honest.


There is a difference between honest and rude opinions. For instance, if you don’t like your friend’s shirt and they ask you about it, respond with, “I really like you in blue instead,” rather than, “I hate it, it’s ugly.”

, If you try to give someone a genuine compliment, but they think you say it with a sarcastic undertone, your compliment won’t mean a thing. Be aware of the way you speak.If you notice that people often take things you say the wrong way, there’s a good chance you can change how you speak. Ask your friends to make you aware of the way you’re coming across.

, Get a bunch of people together for a fun get together. It can be as simple as a gathering at the park, or as extravagant as an elegant dinner party. Either way, it shows them that you care and want to spread friendship.

, If you do something silly, laugh at yourself instead of feeling embarrassed. It shows that you’re comfortable in your skin. A sense of humor makes someone more engaging and delightful to be with.Remember that there is a time and place for humor. It is a great ice-breaker or stress reliever, but don’t ruin a serious conversation with inappropriate jokes.

, Even if something makes you slightly uncomfortable, attack it with a smile on your face, an open mind, and a sense of humor. Not every day is going to be perfect, but being enthusiastic can help you accomplish anything. When you act this way, people will love being around you.

, Laughing at yourself isn’t quite enough if you want the most attractive personality. If you see value in making others laugh and keep laughter higher on your priority list, you’ll be a happier person.A great way to remind you to laugh more (and to share it with others) is to have daily jokes on your phone or email. Set them for a time of day when you notice yourself start to feel drained.

, You should always say what you believe in, be willing to take risks, and have the ability to admit your mistake without being worried about what other people will think. Doing this shows that you have self-confidence. This helps create an attractive personality because it shows that you’re comfortable with yourself and that makes others comfortable around you.Asking questions is important when it comes to confidence. The more you know, the more comfortable you’ll feel when speaking about things. Never be afraid to ask questions.

, Dressing appropriately and having good posture show confidence. You don’t have to have the “perfect body” to be confident in it. People will be more attracted to you if you dress well, respect yourself, and carry yourself well.


If you need a little boost, place post-it’s around your mirror that remind you of the parts of your body that you love. Focus on these rather than the things that you’re self-conscious about., While confidence is endearing, cockiness is very unappetizing. People will turn away from your personality if you’re all about yourself. A great way to avoid this is to remind yourself to compliment others. Every day, find 5 people to give compliments to. They can be strangers, co-workers, or friends. Either way, this will help you stay grounded.

Be a problem solver.,
Be aware of your surroundings.Whenever you arrive somewhere, immediately locate and memorize the possible exits.,
Act with confidence.,
Learn to read people and interpret body language.,
Keep your emotions in check.Mental agility was something the ninja trained hard for, and this included making emotions secondary to logical thought.",How to Have a Ninja Personality1," The ninja had to be alert at all times and be prepared to solve complicated problems on the spot.They did not believe anything was impossible for them to figure out and they looked at obstacles as opportunities to learn.


Try to approach your daily problems with that same mindset.
Along with solving problems, also practice being able to identify exactly when problems occur and what caused them.;
, Scan all areas of visibility and look for any red flags. Work on your navigation skills – always look for the best route when you’re on the move.


Rely on your GPS as little as possible by becoming very familiar with the areas that you spend a lot of time in.
If you use public transportation, memorize as much of the system as you can.

, The ninja trained themselves to be confident and act without fear in all situations.Even when you don’t feel particularly confident, stand up straight and try to channel the feeling of confidence. The mere act of trying can actually boost your confidence!


Spend a little time each morning on your grooming ritual. This is a very simple way to feel more confident about yourself.Keep your body language positive. Stand upright, keep your movements fluid and avoid crossing your arms.

, The ninja needed to be totally aware of their environment, and that included the people in it. They studied body language and psychological techniques so that they could interpret their interactions. Pay attention to other people’s body languages and learn to read their nonverbal cues.


For example, when you scan a room, what postures are you seeing? How do they correlate with what you know about that person’s personality?
Note who meets your eyes easily and who has problems looking at you directly. People who are anxious or worried generally avoid meeting anyone’s gaze., If you allow your emotions to take control in a stressful situation, things generally don’t go well. Emotions cloud your judgment, preventing you from thinking clearly enough to get yourself out of a bad situation.


Managing your emotions doesn’t mean you have to become an emotionless robot!
Instead, practice staying calm and keeping your wits about you in difficult situations.

Use “I” statements.,
Display assertive body language.,
Stay in control of your emotions.",How to Have an Aggressive Personality1," Being assertive and powerful around others can help you gain self-confidence and self-esteem. It can also allow you to gain more acknowledgement and respect from others, in the workplace, at school, or at home. One way you can act powerful and assertive is to always use “I” statements when you speak to others.You should always try to use “I” statements during a discussion or argument, such as “I think you are wrong” or “I disagree with what you are saying.” This will be more effective and assertive than using “you” or “they,” such as “You are wrong,” or, “They don’t know what they’re talking about.”
You should also use “I” statements when you are stating your opinion or your thoughts. For example, you may say, “I think it’s important to be honest with each other,” or, “I believe the client should come first.”;
, You can also demonstrate your assertiveness in a positive way by using body language that is assertive and confident. Make sure you always stand straight and upright. You should also make regular eye contact and maintain a positive facial expression, such as a welcoming smile.You should also avoid wringing your hands, pulling on your clothing nervously, or picking at your face. Nervous ticks often as a sign of a lack of confidence.
It may help to practice assertive body language in front of a mirror at home so you can get comfortable presenting yourself in this way. If you are around someone who seems to demonstrate assertive body language, you may study her and try to mimic her gestures.

, A person who is confident and assertive will maintain firm control over his emotions and not let his anger show. Rather than scream, shout, or yell when you get upset or frustrated, try to take a deep breath and remain calm. Keep your voice even and firm when you speak to others to show you are in control of your emotions.If you feel your emotions are getting out of hand during a discussion at school or an argument at work, you may try excusing yourself and taking a timeout on your own. Letting your emotions settle and calming down alone can help you think about the issue and process it. Then, you can return to the discussion with a clear head and firm control of your emotions.

Realize that you can’t control everything.,
Accept that you can’t control others.,
Practice exposing yourself to the unknown.Try doing a small unpredictable thing each day.,
Let go of the idea that things need to be perfect.Things are never going to be perfect.,
Look at the big picture.Overall, will going along with a change of plans have any long term effects on your happiness?,
Think about what you have to gain by going with the flow.,
Breathe.,
Live in the moment.,
Try to focus on the positives.If you are stuck brooding over things that have gone wrong try to shift your thinking to focus on the things that have gone right or that you have done well so far.Maybe your presentation at work didn’t go quite the way you expected, but you can still focus on the work you’ve done for the project overall.,
Keep a journal.,
Trust that other people’s ideas can be as good as yours.,
Focus on someone other than yourself.,
Express your concerns.",How to Go With the Flow," No one can plan for every potential problem that might arise.The important thing is that you understand that you have the ability to problem solve in the moment. Part of this is accepting that problems will arise. Going with the flow is having the confidence that you'll be able to handle the unexpected.


A presentation at work that relies heavily on Powerpoint might get derailed because the projector breaks down or a file won't open.
A person planning a party might have a good idea of how many people are going to show up, but must also be prepared for that number to be more or less than anticipated and adjust accordingly in the moment.
A teacher with a well thought out lesson plan must always be ready to answer questions they did not anticipate.
Don't be afraid to ask for help if you find yourself in a situation where you don't know how to proceed. For example you might ask if anyone in the meeting knows how to fix the projector. Or you might see if anyone at the party wouldn’t mind running out for more snacks if you find that you are running low.
See the humor in a situation that has turned out completely different than you expected. Say you wore a suit to a party where everyone else is dressed much more casually. This can be embarrassing, but a person who knows how to go with the flow understands that it is also not the end of the world. Using humor can lighten a stressful situation. ""I'm just trying to class this place up."" ""I have a movie premier to get to after the party."";
, Going with the flow means sometimes giving up control, not only of the situation, but of other people. A situation might become more stressful because of the behavior of another person. Perhaps someone is late to a dinner outing and you have to wait for them to arrive before ordering. You may be at a party where someone is monopolizing the conversation, which is leading you to become frustrated. Remember that in situations like this you can’t control someone else, but you can control your own actions.Try to empathize with the other person. Why might they be acting the way they are acting?
Give them the benefit of the doubt. Most people are just trying to do their best to be happy. The person might not know that their behavior is being perceived as disruptive.

, Walk or drive a new way home from work without planning it ahead of time. Go to a new place for lunch. Order something you’re not sure you will like. Start a conversation with someone at school or at work that you don’t know very well. The more comfortable you get at putting yourself in situations that are unpredictable, the more easily you will be able to go with the flow no matter where you are.

, We may set up an idea of how we want things to go, but rarely do they work out exactly that way. Striving for perfection is striving for something that does not exist.You don't need to completely let go of your goals for a project or outing, just be sure to make room for the fact that things don't always happen precisely the way you would like them to.


Focus more on the experience than the outcome. Whether you are cooking a new meal for the first time or attending a dance class, expecting that you’ll get it perfect the first time is only going to distract you from the joy of learning how to do something new. Instead, focus on the method and the joy of each moment, rather than obsessing about the outcome.
Avoid seeing yourself as a set of accomplishments. The things we achieve in life can give us confidence and make us feel good, but it becomes dangerous when we lean too much on them for all our happiness. Think about the other things that give you joy like a sport you play, a hobby you have, or a friendship or relationship you cherish.

, Putting things into perspective can be a great tool for helping you go with the flow. When you find yourself in a situation where a loss of control is becoming stressful, take a step back and ask yourself what the actual consequences will be if things don’t work out the way you originally wanted them too.


If you and some friends planned on seeing a movie only to discover it is sold out when you get to the theater, what is the harm of agreeing to see something else that you may not be as excited about? There is always the possibility that you might like the movie even if you don’t think you will and even if you don’t, you’ll still get to hangout with your friends.

, Being surprised can be one of the best parts of life. When you are struggling to go with the flow, ask yourself what new things you may learn or experience by letting go of control.Embracing a last minute change of plans can be rewarding. The restaurant you planned to go to is too crowded? Great! This may force you to try a place you would have never gone to otherwise.
Your favorite seat in the lunchroom is taken? Look at this as an opportunity to sit next to someone you don’t know very well and get to know them better.
Maybe your boss gives you an assignment you weren’t expecting. This is a great opportunity to expand your role at work and to show how adaptable you can be.

, It can be difficult to go with the flow if you are feeling overwhelmed or anxious. Practicing some deep breathing techniques can help settle your nerves and clear your mind. Try shifting your focus to your breathing for a few minutes. Count your breaths up to seven and then back down again. Do this several times until you start to feel calm again., Dwelling on things you could have or should have done in the past will only make it more difficult for you to enjoy what is actually happening in your present. Accept that what is happening in this moment is your reality and that beating yourself or spending your time searching for someone to blame is not going to change anything. Instead, focus on what feels good about the moment. “I’m still able to spend time with my family, even though the Thanksgiving turkey is burned.”
Remember that you may not be able to change your surroundings or your situation, but you do have control over how you react to them., Maybe you taught a class where you feel like the lesson wasn’t communicated as efficiently as it could have been. Remember that you’ve also taught other successful classes and that you still have the ability to learn and grow.


Avoid “if only” statements.If you catch yourself saying things like “If only I had stayed at home,” or “If only I had planned my night more thoroughly,” stop yourself immediately. This type of thinking will only pull you out of the moment and make you feel worse.

, Keeping a journal is a really helpful way to keep track of situations where it might be difficult for you to go with the flow. Write down what it is about those moments when you feel like you need to be in control and what makes those moments so difficult for you. You can also write down times when you found going with the flow to be easier than usual. What is similar or different about those moments?, Be open to the idea that someone else can take control of the situation if need be, and that they might be able to do just as good a job as you when it comes to leading everyone through something like rain on a wedding day, a lost dinner reservation, or a boring board game night. This will not only help you feel like you can more easily go with the flow, it will take some of the pressure off of you. Don’t make yourself responsible for every decision that needs to be made. Let someone else choose where to go dancing on Saturday night and be okay with whatever comes of it.
If you are working on a group project be sure to get input from everyone involved. Don’t put yourself in charge, or allow yourself to be put in charge, of all the different parts of a project. Listening to other’s ideas will make the project seem more manageable and allow you to let go of some control., Try putting some effort into helping others have a good time. Sometimes bringing the focus off of yourself can be a great distraction when you are having trouble going with the flow. Putting your focus on someone else will also help you stay present in the moment rather than sinking back into regret or guilt.Engage them in conversation. Ask them to join your team on board game night. Offer to dance with them or get them a drink.

, Be confident and clear about how you feel about a change in plans or idea. As long as you are open to what others have to say, your contribution will come off as helpful and you may be able to compromise with your friends. Think about a night out as a collaborative effort.


“I think seeing the movie after dinner is a good idea, but I’m worried we might feel rushed to finish our meal in order to get there on time. Perhaps we should see an earlier show and eat after? Or see the midnight showing and just get drinks in between? What do you guys think?”
“I’m fine finishing up the spreadsheets but I don’t think I will be able to give them the attention they deserve if I’m also responsible for assembling the materials for the meeting. Could we split that task up among the group?”

Become self-aware.,
Make a list of personality traits you want to develop or strengthen.,
Jot down some habits you want to minimize.,
Go from small to big.,
Create a plan.,
Put new actions into practice.",How to Groom Your Personality1," You are a complex human being who is faced with many complex experiences daily. Because of this, you may forget to focus on your inner-self, and pay attention to how your words and behaviors not only affect you, but others as well. Becoming more self-aware of your current personality traits and how they affect you and others will help you to identify areas you may want to change. The primary areas of self-awareness include: personality traits, values, morals, and beliefs, habits, emotional and psychological needs.


Self-awareness of your personality can help you navigate your world better by gravitating towards situations that provide you with positive experiences and rewards, and avoid those situations that can be destructive and cause you too much stress. In other words, self-awareness of your personality will help you analyze how you react and feel about things to help you make better choices in life.;
, These can be traits you already possess to some degree. They can also be traits you don’t currently have, but wish you did.For instance, you might be a naturally shy person who wants to become more outgoing.
If you’re already a creative person, you could decide to work on applying your creativity in more areas of your life.
Don’t work on too many personality traits at once. Choose just one or two at first, so you don’t get overwhelmed.

, If you have any qualities that you don’t like, write them down. Traits that bother you or make your life more difficult are good candidates for this list.For instance, if you have a tendency to interrupt people, you might decide you want to break that habit.

, Personality traits are constructs that make up who you are as a person. These traits are further broken down into daily habits. Keep in mind that your habit change should involve the overarching personality traits that influence negative habits.


For example, you might dislike your habit to disrupt people. This habit aligns with the personality trait of self-centeredness. Such a trait may show up in other habits like throwing tantrums when you don't get your way or gossiping.
Look closely at your habits to find the bigger trait. Then, try to identify other similar habits indicated by that trait.

, Look over your lists and think about how you can make them a reality. Make a new list of specific actions you can take to improve your personality.Make sure your actions are focused around everyday situations you deal with frequently.

, After you have devised a list of feasible actions, start implementing them into your everyday life. New habits are developed by replacing the negative ones with more positive, adaptive choices. Add in more positive habits, and you'll gradually extinguish the old.


For instance, if you’re trying to become more punctual, you could commit to leaving for work every morning five minutes earlier than you currently do.

Move quietly.,
Speak less and think more.,
Practice good posture and reduce unnecessary movements.Good posture will help you do things more energetically with minimal stress and fatigue on your body.,
Practice quiet and mindful breathing.By controlling their breathing, the ninja were able to take control of their stress levels and move more easily through dangerous situations.",How to Have a Ninja Personality2," One of the most important aspects of ninja training was learning how to move without being detected. Practice moving quickly, silently and efficiently. Only be seen in a crowd if you want to be seen. Learn how to disappear quickly from situations that you don’t want to be a part of.Avoid carrying things in your pockets that jingle or make noise. For example, car/house keys, loose change, etc.
If you have any buckles, straps or other gear that dangles off your person, get rid of them.

, Ninja didn’t spend a lot of time chatting and they kept their secrets closely guarded. Practice being comfortable in silence. Try to avoid filling awkward silences with mindless chatter. Allow yourself to be silent, focus on your breathing, and commit to doing more thinking than speaking.


If you have something to say, say it concisely. If you’re upset, take a deep breath and think before you speak.
Choose your words carefully. Speak in a low, controlled tone of voice.

, It allows you to operate at peak efficiency.Avoid pacing, twitching, fidgeting and other forms of unnecessary movement, which can make you seem either anxious or bored.When sitting or standing, pay attention to your movements. Do you tap your fingers or jiggle your foot without thinking about it?
Actively stop yourself from doing these things whenever you notice them.

, Breathe slowly in through your nose, then exhale slowly through your mouth. That is one breath – aim for sets of 10.


Practice holding your inhalation longer with each breath before you exhale.
When you’re practicing this, clear your mind and focus only on your breathing."

Wake up earlier.Self-control was a major part of the ninja personality.,
Eat a healthy diet.,
Exercise regularly.Physical training was one of the most important aspects of being a ninja and they mastered all forms of physical fitness.,
Learn to meditate.",How to Have a Ninja Personality3," They spent almost all of their time mastering physical and psychological techniques. By waking at dawn, they were making sure they put as much time into training as they possibly could. Use an alarm clock and start waking up earlier every day.


Establish a daily routine that begins early in the morning and stick to it.
Schedule specific days and times for tasks and get them done on time., The ninja avoided meat, dairy and sugar. Instead, they ate tofu, vegetables and brown rice every day. A healthy diet is one of the ways they kept themselves strong, agile and slender. Focus on eating fruits, starchy vegetables and whole grains throughout the day to keep you energized. These will also provide a large variety vitamins, minerals, antioxidants and phytonutrients.Don’t forget healthy sources of carbohydrates and proteins, such as whole grains and legumes, which will keep your brain stocked with serotonin.
Eat breakfast every morning, which will boost your energy levels and metabolism., Regular exercise will keep you fit, improve your mood and boost your energy, all important factors for the ninja.


Try to get a minimum of 30 minutes of physical exercise every day., Psychological training was just as important to the ninja as physical training. It was important for them to learn to clear their minds, and through meditation they were able to do this. To get started, aim for just two minutes each day and work your way up.Make meditation the first activity of your day so that it doesn’t get skipped.
Check online for guided meditation sources, especially if you need additional help getting started.

Don’t take “no” for an answer.,
State your opinions directly.,
Stand your ground in an argument or a discussion.",How to Have an Aggressive Personality2," You can demonstrate a stubborn, strong-willed nature by being persistent and not taking “no” for an answer. Try to figure out a way to get what you want and satisfy the needs of others. Finding a way to get a “yes” means you are able to channel your aggression into productive results.For example, perhaps you are trying to apply for insurance coverage for a family member who is ill. Insurance companies can be difficult to deal with and may end up turning your application down. Rather than accept their “no”, you may call them persistently or calmly refuse to leave their office until the matter is resolved or you speak to an authority figure who can help you. Do not yell, berate, or bully — instead, remain calm and be very clear about what you want, avoiding abusive language. It's ok to stand your ground, but do not get inflamed over it.

, Having an assertive personality also means that you are not shy about your opinions or thoughts. You should be willing to openly state your feelings to others and not try to hide them. Being honest and upfront will show others that you are strong-willed.For example, you may have a co-worker who asks your opinion on how to best serve a picky client. Rather than brush off his question, you should state your opinion and tell the co-worker how you would address the issue. Offer to work with your co-worker to make the client happy, using your assertive personality for something productive and helpful.

, You should also stand up for what you believe in and demonstrate your strong will during an argument or a discussion. You should be willing to stick to your stance. This will show others that you are determined and willing to act assertively.For example, maybe you get in a heated debate about abortion rights with a friend. Rather than back down on your stance, you may decide to stand your ground and defend your position. Though you and your friend may agree to disagree in the end, at least you will have stood your ground and made it clear how you feel about the issue.

"
"
Do not bully others.,
Use positive communication.,
Display empathy for others.,
Mediate conflicts.",How to Have an Aggressive Personality3," There is a clear difference between being aggressive in a negative and being assertive. Often, people who are aggressive end up being bullies. Being a bully means you act self-righteous or superior and have no regard for the needs, feelings, and opinions of others. Bullying others will only lead to conflict and negativity in your life, not respect.You should try to keep your aggression in check so it does not turn into bullying. Though you may feel a momentary sense of power as a bully, it will ultimately only lead to resentment and anger from others. This resentment could then cause people to avoid you or oppose you.

, You can also channel aggression into developing healthy habits like positive communication, becoming assertive instead. Positive communication means you practice active listening and always consider the thoughts and opinions of others. You should also try to take your ego out of any discussion or conversation and focus instead on how you can support those around you.Practicing active listening means not interrupting others when they are speaking and maintaining eye contact with the speaker. Once the speaker is done, you should repeat back what she said in your own words to show you were listening and paying attention. Then, you can respond to the speaker in a positive and open way.

, Displaying empathy for others means putting your ego aside and focusing on how others are feeling or what they are experiencing. Doing this will show that you can be assertive and strong willed without walking on the needs of others. Showing empathy for others is often a sign of confidence and maturity.For example, you may have an employee who is struggling with an illness in the family. You may then show empathy for the employee by approving his request for time off and checking in with the employee on a consistent basis to make sure he has everything he needs. Showing the employee compassion and empathy will show that you can be a considerate boss.

, Another way you can channel aggression into something productive and healthy is to focus on mediating conflict. Conflict resolution can be useful at home and in the workplace. You should strive to mediate a conflict rather than try to dominate it so it can be resolved effectively.Make sure you are addressing the problem or issue at hand, not the person involved in the problem. Focusing on how you can problem solve the issue will avoid making anyone feel bad or placing the blame on someone.
You should also work with others to try to mediate an issue so you are not dominating the conversation or being too aggressive towards others. Collaborating and listening to others will ensure the resolution is effective and satisfying for everyone involved.
For example, maybe there is a conflict between two of your co-workers. Rather than punish both co-workers or blame them, you may sit down with them and have a mediation session. You may act confident and assertive but also listen and empathize with both employees to reach a resolution.

"
Be attentive to your needs.,
Adopt a positive mindset.,
Develop your interests and hobbies.,
Have a purpose.,
Learn as much as you can.,
Present yourself in a way that reflects your ideal personality.",How to Groom Your Personality2," Just as Maslow discussed in his hierarchy of needs, humans have a variety of psychological needs that determine their behaviors and how they may react or respond in various situations. These are needs such as: power and control, belongingness, affection or love, esteem, achievement, and self-actualization.


Becoming aware and attentive to your needs and how they affect your behaviors will help you with understanding how this affects your interpersonal relationships.
Your needs drive your motivation. If your needs are not being met, you may experience a decrease in motivation, become more frustrated, and have more conflict and stress in your life.

, Positivity is an essential trait for a well-groomed personality. To become more positive, get into the habit of looking for the good in people and situations, instead of finding reasons to criticize them. When things go wrong, focus on the things you can change, instead of the things you can’t.A positive mindset will attract people to you, while a negative one will repel them.
Having a positive mindset doesn’t mean you have to be happy all the time or enjoy bad situations. Rather, it means looking for the silver lining and doing what you can to improve things.

, Maintain a balanced personality by exploring a variety of interests and activities. If you already have hobbies, set aside some time daily or weekly to work on them. If you think your personality could use some rounding out, teach yourself a hobby or two you’ve always wanted to learn, or look for a class or a club you can join.For instance, if you’ve been spending most of your time and energy on work, try taking a cooking class or a dance class to improve your work-life balance.
Classes, clubs, and groups are a great way to meet new people while you expand your horizons.

, Most people with strong, appealing personalities have some kind of mission in life. Think about what you want to achieve, and then set goals that will help you get there. Avoid squandering your time on things that don’t really matter to you.Your life goals don’t have to be big and grand, as long as they’re meaningful to you.

, Staying well-informed is an important aspect of grooming your personality. Keep yourself up-to-date on important events in the world by reading newspapers and magazines. If you’re particularly interested in a field like history or technology, read books and watch documentaries on the subject.Learning about the world will give you more things to talk about with other people.

, The way you dress, style your hair, and carry yourself sends a message to other people about who you are. Make sure that your posture is good, your clothes are well-kept and appropriate, and you’re proud of your general appearance.If you’re not happy with the way you present yourself, invest in something that will make you feel more confident, such as some flattering clothes or a good haircut. This doesn’t have to be expensive.

Smile.,
Connect with professional support for guidance.,
Use good listening skills.,
Practice good manners.,
Avoid gossiping.,
Help others.",How to Groom Your Personality3," When you smile, you immediately appear friendlier, more likable, and more trustworthy to other people. Smiling can also improve your mood and help you stay in a positive frame of mind, both of which will improve your interactions with others.Don’t try to smile all the time – that will look unnatural. Focus on smiling when you greet people and during conversations.

, Sometimes you may need a little extra coaching to help with developing improved interpersonal communication skills. For instance people with mental health concerns such as social anxiety, borderline personality disorder, and others may require the assistance of a professional therapist or coach to help them effectively interact and develop stronger relationships. How you communicate with other people has a significant impact on the quality of your relationships.


Professional support can be in the form of individual counseling or group counseling. The type of therapy usually used in such settings is dialectical behavioral therapy (talk therapy) and mindfulness training. The goal is to teach clients skills that will help with engaging in conversations in a more thoughtful and deliberate way, instead of reacting to their internal stress and emotions in a negative way.

, Be interested in other people, and focus on what they have to say. Take their body language and tone of voice into account as you talk. Ask questions to guide the conversation and find out more about them.When you’re genuinely interested in people, you’ll have more fulfilling conversations, and others will instinctively like you more.

, Follow the standards of etiquette, and always treat other people with courtesy. Don’t forget the basics, such as saying “please” and “thank you” and not interrupting people when they’re talking.If your manners need some polishing, look for an etiquette book at your local library, or search for manners tips online.

, Gossiping about other people makes you seem petty and insecure. It undermines other people’s trust in you, and it could even cost you important relationships. Don’t say anything behind a person’s back unless you would be willing to say it to their face.If other people try to get you to gossip with them, redirect the conversation. Ask a question like, “What are you doing this weekend?”

, Whenever you can, go out of your way to do someone a favor or brighten up their day. You’ll feel good about lending a hand, and other people will see you as a thoughtful, dependable person.For instance, take a friend out for lunch when they’re feeling down, or give your coworker a ride to work when their car is in the shop.

List qualities that form your personal definition of inner beauty.,
Think positively about your personality rather than your external appearance.,
Practice authenticity.,
Expand your self-knowledge and awareness.,
Pursue your personal potential.",How to Find Your Inner Beauty1," Make a list of people you admire, and write down the qualities they possess that you respect and appreciate about them. You will most likely find that none of them are perfect on the outside, but they possess admirable traits such as kindness, honesty, or dependability. You can keep these qualities in mind as you focus on your own path to developing internal beauty, and learn to reject the often impossible standards for beauty that mainstream society values.Remind yourself that external beauty standards change according to cultural and social mores.Women have, on average, 13 negative thoughts about their body daily.Note the ways that mass media create and perpetuate often unattainable physical ideals of beauty for both men and women.;
, Focus on what your positive traits, and practice replacing negative thoughts with positive self-talk. Positive thinking has numerous health benefits including increased life span and lower rates of depression.Challenge yourself to write down three things that you like about yourself that aren’t related to your physical appearance. Thinking positive thoughts changes neural pathways in your brain and can help reshape how you view yourself.Practice looking in the mirror, smiling, and complimenting yourself on an internal trait, such as your friendliness, kindness, or artistic ability, for example. The human brain cannot differentiate between a real and a fake smile, and smiling has proven psychological benefits.Stand taller. Working on your posture helps you project a sense of confidence, thanks to the “feedback loop,” where merely imitating something can have actual, tangible results., Inner beauty is a reflection of truthfulness and honesty about who you are. Reject trying to be “perfect.” Seek out ways to be comfortable being yourself and present in the moment.Focus on the future instead of the past. Part of living an authentic life is looking forward to trying new experiences. Getting stuck in the past stymies personal growth.Be flexible. Challenge the parts of your identity that need work and change, and don’t be afraid to grow. Give yourself permission to feel a range of emotions as you work on self-improvement., Self-discovery can give you the tools to make the necessary changes to your life that lead to cultivating inner beauty. Seek new experiences, ask advice from others, and set achievable goals for your life and career.


Take a personality test. These can help you identify your personality type, the jobs you are best at, and the traits you should spend time developing.Challenge yourself with new experiences and ideas. Take a class, try a new sport, or try a new hobby. Expanding your thought process can spark creativity and push your boundaries for the better., Assess what you do and don’t want from your life. Living the life you want imbues it with meaning, leads to overall life satisfaction, and develops the qualities that others find valuable, such as determination and perseverance.Reflect at the end of each day what went well, what didn’t, and what you’d like to pursue tomorrow. Making these kind of assessments can boost your performance and morale, and help you feel as though you are creating a path to your full potential.Take responsibility for your happiness and life choices instead of seeking validation from external sources. Inner beauty is a process that starts within."

Watch Bizarre Movies.,
Be Bizarre.",How to Have a Bizarre Mind," To be, you must know. It's as simple as it sounds, but at times (depending on the subject), is complicated and large. Being bizarre is, sadly, complicated and large. Hence why not allot of humans share that factor very boldly. Know that there are people that like this stuff, and are also very famous. This is because they're so different, that it's special. Do you want to be special? Not in the mental way, of course, but rather in the emotional way. Being special is doing something that someone else has a hard time with, easily. In this case, that ""something"" is being bizarre.;
, Picking your nose is, as humorous as it sounds, not bizarre. It's weird. If you think of bizarre, think about something out of the ordinary, or out of place. Something that stands out in a strange way from the rather ordinary crowd. If you think of weird, think of sticking you finger in a place that is, well, inappropriate for you to be sticking it. It be your nose, it could be you butt. It doesn't have to be connected to you, either. It can be someone else's nose, and, as nasty as it sounds, it can someone else's butt. Gross, isn't it? Bizarre is a culture, weird is not. Remember that if you want to stand out in a good way, say that your mind is ""bizarre"", rather than ""weird"". It not only sounds more interesting, but it's a more formal way to put it.

, Do you want to be bizarre to be different, or do you think a more interesting approach? You probably can't really answer this question that well, and just say ""I want to be bizarre because I want to."", and that is a good answer, too. This, actually, could be an optional step if you don't want to fry your noodle just yet.

, This is a very vital step in this guide. Culture can be Japanese Anime, Surrealism, Pinatas,anything that your own culture doesn't normally have. This article is written English, which is the most popular language in America. Language is French for language, for your information. So that means even if you don't understand this article, you at least have something new in your head. Back to the topic, in fact, rapping up the topic is more like it. Culture: important and almost mandatory to being a truly bizarre individual.

, You can look up more on the rest of the Internet, but the most known are David Lynch, Stanley Kubrick, Tim Burton, Johnny Depp, Jim Carrey, Salvador Dalí, and the man eating the extremely large burger that you often see browsing Google Images.

, Some suggestions are Eraserhead, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Begotten, Big Fish, The Thing, Spirited Away, and some others. (NOTE: Some movies listed above are not exactly appropriate for humans under the age of 17, more information in the Warnings tab)

, This guide may only at the moment be a rather rough beginning, but there are some suggestions that can really help out quite allot, such as the list of movies, or the cultural differences step. Also be aware that you can read the Tips tab for some suggestions of bizarre, everlasting material and actions. And remember, the true definition of the word ""Bizarre"" is a definition that only you can define, as the definition will always change from being to being.

Think kind thoughts.,
Create art.,
Treat yourself well.,
Directly express happiness through language.,
Encourage others to be the best that they can be.,
Take part in acts of kindness.,
Rise above negative situations and act as a positive force in someone else’s life.,
Ask yourself if you’re truly happy.,
Figure out what’s getting in the way of your expression.,
Figure out what methods of expression feel right for you.",How to Express Your Happiness," It’s normal for humans to focus on negative aspects of ourselves. Self-critical behavior is an evolutionary trait that keeps us on the road to progression. The downside is that this behavior weighs on our ability to stay positive. In order for you to express happiness to others, you need to be able to maintain that happiness without drifting into negative thoughts, and you need to be able to express that happiness to yourself.


If you’re feeling happy, let yourself feel good and do your best to steer clear of negative ideas. Be proud of your achievements and don’t let thoughts like, “I could have done that better” or “I don’t deserve this” get in your way. Congratulate, don’t flagellate.;
, Despite the common trope of the “tortured artist,” studies have shown that the creation of art can actually enhance happiness and prolong feelings of pleasure. During art therapy, people report that art-making is a source of joy, even when they’re creating art that may communicate a painful thought or memory. If you’re already happy, expressing that happiness through art may even enhance your already positive feelings.Paint, draw, sculpt or create something with your hands. People in art therapy often report that creating something physical is a joyful experience because they find pleasure in exploration and innovation. Some people thrive on having a tangible product in front of them.Create a gratitude journal. If you’re not much for visual art, writing your feelings can be a great way to focus on happy thoughts. You could also write a fictional story or poem and express those feelings in an abstract way, rather than just making a list of what you’re grateful for.
Make music. Imaging studies of the brain show that joyful music activates reward centers in our brains and releases dopamine; this gives us a hit of happiness, much like drugs or sex would.Playing a musical instrument and creating a positive song can amp up your happiness while you’re expressing it through music.

, Happy people tend to have balanced lives — which means that they know when to work and when to play.Simply taking the time to take care of yourself in whatever way you need is a great way to express your happiness and love for your mind and body. Doing nice things for yourself is the actionable equivalent of telling yourself positive affirmations in your head.


If you’ve been longing for a bubble bath, but you’ve been putting it off because you’ve been so busy — schedule it for later in the day so you can get much needed relaxation.
If you’re the type of person who will skip lunch while at work to finish up a spreadsheet, change it up and take an hour off to take a walk and get a sandwich.

, Telling someone you’re in a good mood is an easy way to communicate positive feeling. Try not to brag about being happy, though — as that can come off as over-confident or even annoying.


Also, try to avoid saying “You make me feel happy” instead of “I feel happy.” Even though it’s possible that the people you’re speaking to would be glad that they bring you joy, it’s also possible that they may feel pressured to respond, or they could feel responsible for continuing your happiness.

, This may seem like it’s not a direct expression of your happiness because you’re not telling the person why you’re in a good mood. But this is a common misconception. Expressions of happiness can be abstract. Technically, you express happiness whenever your behavior is influenced by that emotion.So simply by being a positive force in someone else’s life, your happiness is shining through. Examples of encouragement include:


Tell your friend how proud you are of their recent accomplishments.
Give your significant other extra compliments on their singing voice when they wail to their favorite metal songs in the car.
Urge your younger sibling to go for that scholarship, even when they’re discouraged.

, Verbal expressions of happiness are common, but sometimes actions speak louder than words. If you’re in a good mood, why not do something kind for someone else to share the wealth of positive feeling?


You could make your mother a card to let her know how much you love her.
You could show up at your sick friend’s house with soup and a DVD.
You could donate some money to a good cause of your choice.
You could give your significant more hugs than usual.

, When someone you know is in a bad mood, it can be easy to get swept up in their negativity. If you’re in a good mood, you’re in a place of power to transfer that positive energy to the other person and change the situation.


Avoid gossip. If someone you know is saying mean things about another person, try to steer the conversation away from hurtful topics and talk about someone you love or appreciate.
Leave negative environments. If you’re with someone who is cranky because they’re too hot, tired or uncomfortable, suggest that you both move to a different location to help change their mood.
Be there for someone in need. If a friend is going through a rough time, do your best to listen to their thoughts and feelings and don’t be judgmental. Don’t try to force them to be in a good mood with you, but use your happiness to try to channel it into being a sympathetic ear. Giving your time to those in need is an abstract way of expressing your happiness and lending positive energy to those around you.

, Some would argue that this question is impossible to answer because happiness is such a subjective term. But most psychologists believe that individuals can accurately self-report their emotional states; if someone feels happy, then they probably are.However, it is possible that one could pretend to be happy to please others or get through a tough situation in life.
Ask yourself if you’re truly happy, or if you’re just feigning happiness for one reason or another.
If you find that you’re not as happy as you would like to be, then this may be the reason you’re struggling to communicate happiness to others.

, Each individual has his or her own unique reasons for struggling with the expression of happiness. There isn’t one be-all, end-all solution to getting through an emotional roadblock. But don’t let this discourage you! We can often answer these questions for ourselves by taking the time to think about our relationship to happiness and how this can affect our behaviors.


Think about situations in your life where you succeeded at expressing happiness. Do any moments come to mind? What did you do in that situation that was notable? What parts of that moment could you reenact?
Think about instances where you weren’t able to express yourself. What did you do that you would change? What thoughts were you having at the time that made it difficult for you to share your feelings?
Are there any instances in your past where your happiness was stifled? Do you recall any moments where you were expected to express happiness when you weren’t happy at all?

, Expressions of happiness don’t always look the same for everyone. Just because your favorite TV character expresses happiness by smiling a lot and buying his friends lunch, that doesn’t mean you have to. Every human is unique and so are their methods of expression.


Test out some methods of expression to see how they feel. Buy someone flowers, treat yourself to an expensive dinner, or simply smile at a passerby.
If certain expressions of happiness feel more natural than others, then go with what feels right. Do what you’re comfortable with, and then in the future you might be able to push the boundaries and try methods of expression that you normally wouldn’t. Don’t be ashamed to take baby steps.

Get out your calender.,
Prepare in advance.,
Before you start your day, plan where this is going to take place.,
You may light some candles in the bathtub, but if there is a small window, open it a tiny bit so that there is some fresh air.,
Now lay the fluffy towel where it's easy to reach so you won't be cold, and your fresh comfy cloths (along with your hair tie so you can tie your hair into a high ponytail to get it out of your face) as well unless you have a robe you want to wear.,
Next, go buy some snacks and rent out a chick flick movie.,
If you want, you can turn off your cell phone or page so that you won't be bothered.

, And get the cream too so that you can put it in after you take that relaxing bath. You may put the face mask on while you're in the tub, reading a magazine afterwards, or during the movie, I recommend Devil Wears Prada, but if you're going to watch it, get the veggies with dip so that you won't feel guilty while you're diving into that tub of ice cream, but instead feel healthier and happy.

Decide when you are going to tell your crush your feelings.,
Use body language to let your crush know how you feel.,
Share your feelings with your crush.,
Be prepared with an appropriate response if your crush rejects you.",How to Express True Feelings when Shy1," People often develop crushes based on perceptions, but they sometimes do not actually know their crushes very well. However, it is important to get to know your crush first to determine if you truly want to attempt a relationship with that person.


Ask mutual friends to introduce you.
Strike up conversation with him in social group settings, where other people are around.
Find things that you have in common with him, like hobbies or interests.;
, While you get to know him, it is important to have other people around as a buffer.


If you are suddenly overcome with shyness, there are other people around to bring into the conversation so that the pressure is off of you.
Being in a group setting gives you a way to distance yourself if you realize that your crush is not the type of person you want to date, after all.

, Before trying to figure out how to express your feelings to your crush, learn how to be his/her friend first. Take information you learn about him as you get to know each other and build your friendship around those commonalities.


Accept offers to hang out with your crush or go to a party or event where he will be, whenever possible. If it is challenging for you to put yourself in social situations, then accept one offer and attend. Stay for as long as you comfortably can, without causing yourself too much stress and social anxiety. Practice this again, maybe once every few weeks, to help yourself become more comfortable.Share stories with him when you come across something that reminded you of him. For example, you could say, “I saw that your favorite band is going on tour soon. Are you going to try to go to a concert?”
Keep interactions casual. Be friendly and as outgoing as you feel comfortable, but remember that creating small talk, even when you feel shy, gives off the impression that you are friendly and approachable. One tip is to prepare a mental list of recent events or experiences you have had that you feel comfortable discussing, like a book you read or a restaurant where you ate., Each person is unique, and you might feel more comfortable expressing your feelings in one way than in another. Take time to think about how you want to do so.


Tell him in person, which allows you overcome your fear of expressing yourself in person and being vulnerable and also gives you the opportunity to see his reaction. This is the most authoritative method, because he will know that you are serious.
Express your feelings in a letter or note, which might feel more comfortable for you than telling him in person because you can think through what you want to say and save yourself some embarrassment of others overhearing.
Bring it up in a phone conversation, which allows you to talk the idea through without the pressure of being there in person. This way, no facial expressions or reactions or seen, and it stifles a bit of the awkwardness.
Explain your feelings in an email, which is a very similar option to writing in that it allows you to think out what you want to say and put yourself out there without anyone else knowing.
Let him know in a text message, but keep in mind that this will limit how much you can type in one text message (unless you both use iMessage on iPhones). You have the opportunity to plan out what to say and can avoid the pressure of a face-to-face conversation. This is also much more casual, but it runs the risk of him not taking you seriously.

, Once you have pinpointed the way in which you want to express your feelings to your crush, you need to decide what you want to say and practice it. Even if you are writing a letter, an email, or a text message, you want to express your feelings in the way that feels most comfortable for you. Practice speaking what you want to say to yourself in the mirror, or have a trusted friend or family member pretend to be your crush. You should practice often so that you become comfortable saying the words. Or, if you are writing, emailing, or text messaging, you can rehearse by writing drafts of what you want to say until you feel you have found exactly the right words to express yourself.


“I've really enjoyed being your friend, and it's time for me to admit that I have stronger feelings for you than just friendship.”
“I'm so happy that we're friends; you've been a really great friend to me. However, I have to admit that I have feelings for you as more than a friend.”
“You might have figured this out already, but I like you. I've had these feelings for a while.”
“We have so much in common! I'd really like to take our friendship to the next level.”

, Giving yourself a deadline will help you stick to it. On that day, be prepared to have the conversation, mail the letter, send the text message, or whatever you planned to do in Step 4 to tell your crush about your feelings.


Mark it on your calendar or in your agenda so that you have a visual reminder. You could “camouflage” it by titling it something simple, like “talk,” “email,” or your crush's initials so that someone else seeing it will not know what it is about.
You could also ask a trusted friend or family member to help keep you accountable by encouraging you to do it if you start to have second thoughts. Ask that person to encourage you to follow through and give you the tools you need to do it, such as getting you to the right place at the right time, putting the computer in front of you, or pulling up a new text message for you.

, As you prepare to let your crush know your true feelings for him, use body language to hint at it when you spend time with him. Using body language allows you to communicate your feelings in a way that does not require verbal communication. Become more comfortable using body language by practicing on a trusted friend or family member when you talk with them.


Lean in to talk to him.
Keep your body open and facing him when communicating (e.g. do not fold your arms across your chest).
Gently touch him on the hand, arm, or shoulder while chatting, but keep it brief.
Pay attention to whether he returns similar body language.

, When the day arrives that you decided you would tell your crush how you feel, be sure to follow through with it. Be sure to have practiced frequently leading up to the conversation, and do not be afraid to have some sort of “crutch” to help you through it, such as tapping your fingers on your leg or clasping your hands together. Especially if you are talking in person, having some kind of movement like this will help to calm your nerves a little bit.


If you are going to tell your crush in person, find a place where you can do so in semi-privacy. Think of a place where others will be nearby, if you need to leave or need a distraction, but where they will not be able to overhear your conversation.
Send your letter, email, or text message, if one of those was the option you chose.
Make eye contact, if talking in person, and say what you want to say.It does not have to be a long, elaborate conversation. Since it is more challenging for you to express your feelings, doing so efficiently is best.
Be yourself while telling your crush. Use language that you normally use, and put your personality into it. Being who you really are will help to calm your shyness and boost confidence., In the event that your crush does not share your feelings, you need to have something appropriate to say to end the conversation and let him know that you will not hold a grudge. It is important to recognize that perhaps the rejection has nothing to do with you and that being rejected is an essential experience to have in order to overcome shyness and social anxiety.“That's okay. I feel better now that I've told you, and I hope that we can continue to be friends.”
“I understand, and I really value your friendship. Can we still be friends?”
“That's okay. I'm glad we could have this talk, but I need to get going. I'll talk to you later.”
“I understand. Thanks for talking with me. My friend is waiting for me, so I'll catch up with you later.”

Understand that there is almost nothing that you will get on your hands that won't come off, but realise there are some substances that you may want to avoid, such as the following.,
Prepare before you get your hands dirty.,
Have a cloth rag or paper towels handy to easily wipe excess dirt from your hands if the need arises.,
Keep some soap and water nearby for more thorough cleaning if needed.,
Pick an activity you enjoy for your dirty hands experience.,
Prepare for the experience of getting down and dirty.,
Start out slowly if you need to.,
Use tools, as much as possible, to minimize contact with the soil.,
Be persistent.",How to Enjoy Getting Your Hands Dirty,"


Inks and wood stains. These are very difficult to remove, particularly permanent markers, oil stains used for wood finishing, and some fruit stains like blueberry or blackberry juice, so avoid these if clean hands are important in your near future. Even these, however, will fade and disappear in time.
Solvents and chemicals. These may not dirty your hands, but contact with them can have health risks.
Unsanitary substances. This may include stuff we think of being flushed down a commode, or otherwise has a potential to cause illness or disease. In first aid publications, for instance, it is almost universally recommended a caregiver never come in contact with a victim's blood, due to risks associated with disease transmission.;
, This article is geared toward working in soil, for instance, setting out plants in a flower garden, but its applications may also include doing mechanical repairs where you will get grease and oils on your hands. If you may experience a need to relieve yourself, go to the bathroom prior to beginning your work, have a snack and a drink before starting, and plan on missing phone calls or text messages, since you would probably prefer not to handle these devices with filthy hands.

, Having access to a sink, or outdoor hose bib for quick clean-up will make rinsing soil off to attend emergencies easier.

, For really dirty hands, you may want to plan on having a wash bucket that can be disposed of when you are finished, since cleaning really filthy hands in a bathroom sink will only add another job (cleaning the sink) to your project.

, Again, the focus here is on gardening, since this may be one of the most common activities where your hands will be soiled, pun intended. If you are a flower fancier, find a location in your yard, apartment balcony, or even a window to begin a natural enhancement project, ie, planting some flowers. For those who would rather eat what they produce, plan on planting some herbs, vegetables, or fruit-bearing plants. Peppers have ornamental as well as food benefits, but tomatoes, cucumbers, or other plants can be grown in usable quantities in a surprisingly small space using imaginative techniques.

, Choose some old cloths, buy a suitable gardener's apron, and even wear gloves if you need to so the experience can be as sanitary as possible.

, Handle some of the soil you have available, whether you have dug some out of your lawn, or purchased a commercially prepared planting mix. For people unfamiliar with the texture and feel of soil, this may be uncomfortable at first, so just get acquainted with how it feels. You can immediately put it away and wash your hands after your initial exposure, but resolve to try again until you overcome any reluctance or apprehension you have to handling it.

, Small scoops, forks, and other tilling instruments are available to decrease the actual amount of soil contact needed to successfully accomplish a gardening project.

, You must ultimately decide for yourself that you want to overcome your inhibition to dirty hands, and dedicate time and effort to achieving that goal.

Be trustworthy.,
Lead by example.,
Foster a nurturing environment.,
Suggest other role models.",How to Encourage Positive Change in Others1," If you are interested in inspiring others, you must first check your motives. People won’t see your intentions as good if you have a hidden agenda. Helping others to make you look good won’t work. They will be able to sniff out your agenda and be less likely to trust you.For example, some people are only interested in helping others to make themselves look good or to win approval. Your motive for positive change shouldn't be focused on you, however; it should focus on the other person. In other words, you need to be selfless. If you have trouble with this behavior, then try volunteering to get more perspective on other people’s struggles.
Tell the truth about why you are trying to help someone. Be upfront about your motives and make sure your reasons relate to actually helping them improve, rather than to advance yourself in some way.;
, The most basic step in encouraging others to improve is to set a positive example. It’s hard to motivate others’ behaviors when you have trouble bettering your own habits. This isn’t to say that you must be perfect, but you should be willing to lead by example.


For example, if you are suggesting to your child to stop telling lies, then you, too, should demonstrate honesty. It is important that you follow your own advice if you expect other people to do so.
The best way to encourage others is by engaging in the desired behaviors yourself. Plus, you are more likely to earn their trust and respect this way., Support positive change in others by setting up an environment that promotes the desirable behavior. People have greater chances of succeeding when as many variables are working in their favor.


If you are a teacher, for instance, your students are more likely to transition to new activities when there is a visible schedule on display. Also, prompting them a few minutes before a new activity is due to begin can also help them transition more easily.Think of ways you can support a person’s positive change with visual cues or reinforcements.

, It takes a village to inspire change. No one person is fully responsible for inciting change in another. Therefore, you should model a collaborative approach and recommend others who can help the person with the desired behavior.For example, if you have a friend who is trying to adopt healthier eating habits, it might be a great idea to share a healthy eating blog post with them. Or, set up an appointment for them to meet with a dietitian. This helps you further encourage positive change, and offers them additional resources for success.
You can also try to find someone who has made a similar positive change in themselves. Even a video of someone who has made a similar change can serve as a good example.

Keep your makeup simple.,
Go neutral for your eyelids.,
Don't forget the mascara.,
Keep your lipstick simple.,
Choose pink for your cheeks.,
Try a rosehip oil.,
Don't forget the sunscreen.",How to Emulate Kate Middleton2," Kate likes to put her own makeup. She generally sticks with brown eyebrow pencil for her eyebrows. On her eyelids, she prefers to line her eyes with a gel liner.Use the eyebrow pencil to define your eyebrows. Kate prefers a mostly straight brow with a curve at the edge.

, While Kate does add a bit of color to her eyelids, she tends to go for neutral colors, such as a light brown or gray, for her eyelids. Try stay away from less natural colors, like pinks, purples, and blues., Kate usually creates a smoky eye. To add to that effect, use a dark mascara to accentuate your eyelashes.

Check it first by applying it to the back of your hand., These types of treatment can help moisturize your skin, keeping it looking younger. Kate prefers rosehip to other types of oils and creams. Massage a couple of drops into your face when you wake up and again right before bed., Like many women, Kate uses a combination moisturizer and sunscreen in the morning. Pick one with an SPF of at least 15, and apply it before you go out. It will both protect your skin and provide moisture for the day."
"
Pick a classy hair style.,
Don't be afraid of practicality.,
Use a cowashing conditioner.",How to Emulate Kate Middleton3," Kate sticks with her natural hair color 4-5 inches below shoulder-length. She also has cascading bangs that go from eyebrow-length near the center of her forehead to just below her ears around the edges.Kate tends to keep her hair straightened, though curled under at the tips. She often wears it down, but she might also gather part of it up at the top or all of it up in an elegant updo., As a mom and a royal, Kate is often short on time. Therefore, she often chooses cuts that are easier to handle, while still being classy and stylish., To help get Kate's shine, consider using a cowash product. These products are designed to gently cleanse your hair and condition it at the same time, meaning you only need to lather and rinse once."
"
Focus on education.,
Cultivate an interest in art.,
Be discreet.,
Be down-to-earth.,
Do what's required of you.,
Play a sport.,
Have integrity.,
Follow proper etiquette.,
Strive for perfect posture.",How to Emulate Kate Middleton4," While you may not have the means to go to private school like Kate, you can put emphasis on your own education. Kate studied hard and did well on her exams in England, and she went on to study at the University of St. Andrews, where she met Prince William. Therefore, if you want to be like Kate, study hard and try to get into a good university., As noted, Kate got her undergraduate degree at the University of St. Andrews, a degree in art history. Therefore, to be more like Kate, you should encourage your own interest in art. Try taking an art history class at a local community college, for instance, or visiting your local art museum. You can also check out books from the library on art history., Kate has always been the picture of discreetness. She kept her relationship with the Prince secret for several years, mostly because he didn't want the press involved., Even amidst all the royal protocol, Kate and William often strive for a normal life. In fact, for the first two years of their marriage, they lived in a farmhouse out in the woods so they could enjoy each other's company. So while Kate may be a Duchess, she still very down-to-earth. Strive for being down-to-earth in your own life by grounding yourself in your family life.While living in the farmhouse, Kate often shopped and cooked for William, for instance., As a royal, Kate has many duties she must fulfill, usually backing up the Queen at royal events. She does what is expected of her as a royal. You, in turn, should fulfill what is expected of you by your family if you intend to copy Kate.While Kate's duties might be attending a royal event, your duties are more likely to look like showing up for a family event, preparing dinner for your family, or being there when you're needed.

, Kate has always been athletic. In high school, she played tennis, field hockey, and participated in track events such as the long jump. She continued playing field hockey in college. To model yourself after Kate, get involved in a sport.You can choose a sport to play at school, or you can check with your local parks and recreation department to see what sports leagues they offer. Many departments have leagues ranging from toddlers to adults.
Out of school, Kate typically runs, often with William, to stay in shape., Kate has always shown integrity when it comes to the royal family. For instance, when Kate and William split up in 2007, she didn't pass on any secrets about William or the family to the media. She kept that information to herself, even when she could have made some money off of it., Kate is always perfectly on point when it comes to etiquette. While proper etiquette does involve things like knowing who to curtsy to, it's also a lot more than that. It's more about being gracious to the people around you, and making them feel like they are welcome.For instance, when you host a dinner party, proper etiquette would dictate that you don't point out the fact that someone is slurping their food. You want to make your guests feel like they can do no wrong.However, it doesn't hurt to learn the proper rules for dining, as well. For instance, the proper way to stir tea (the British way) is to gently move your spoon back and forward in your teacup without clinking the sides., When standing, Kate always has perfect posture, and she doesn't give that up when she sits down, either. Kate keeps her back straight. She also doesn't rest on the back of the chair or the armrest. Instead, she keeps a small amount of space between her back and the chair back, crosses her ankles, and keeps her hands neatly folded in her lap.Also, make sure your chin stays up, so that it is parallel to the ground, not slouched over."

Find your voice.Before you can really start to overcome shyness in social interactions, it is important to find your voice as a unique individual.,
Identify what causes your fear or anxiety.,
Conceptualize the worst-case scenario.,
Practice communicating and expressing your feelings.,
Develop a breathing exercise when you start to feel overcome with shyness.,
Interact socially in group settings.,
Say what you are feeling.",How to Express True Feelings when Shy2,"


Identify things that you are passionate about or that make you unique.
Write in a diary or journal to express yourself, and make observations of trends found in what you write about it.
Express yourself creatively. Write stories, poems, or songs, create paintings or drawings, take photographs, or play musical instruments.

, Although shyness is a personality trait, there is something that triggers it. Take time to identify what it is that causes you to feel shy.Is it a fear of rejection?
Are you afraid to offend someone?
Is it scary to ask for something that is for your benefit, like a raise?
Is it a fear of humiliation?
Are you afraid of being criticized?
Is it a particular person who causes you to feel shy? Why?

, In any social situation that you envision that causes you anxiety, think about what the worst-case scenario will be.


What will you do if that worst-case scenario happens?
How will you overcome that fear?
How can you avoid the worst-case scenario?
Who is really at fault in the worst-case scenario?

, It is not uncommon for people to practice what they will say or how they will behave in a social setting. This helps to build confidence.


Ask a family member or close friend to practice with you.
Practice by yourself in the mirror, so that you can see your facial expressions.
Write out what you want to say, like a script, and rehearse it.
Watch movies or read books to study how characters overcome similar social anxiety.

, Prepare yourself to handle anxiety or shyness by practicing a breathing exercise. It will help to calm you and re-focus you on the task at hand, which is expressing your true feelings.


Calming Technique: Inhale for a count of four through your nose. Next, hold the breath for two. Lastly, exhale the breath for a count of six through your mouth.Equal Breathing: Inhale for a count of four, and then exhale for a count of four. Both your inhalation and exhalation should be through the nose. Repeat as necessary to calm down.Simply focus on making your exhales longer than your inhales. This is a simple trick to help you relax without any specific counting patterns while breathing., If it is hard for you to express yourself socially, becoming involved in group interactions will be helpful.


There are more people involved to carry on conversation if you freeze up.
You have the opportunity to talk to several different people and practice expressing your feelings to them.
Find ways to express yourself that feel comfortable. If talking about yourself is uncomfortable, then talk about something in which you have an interest, like music. You are still letting your conversation partner(s) get to know you without directly talking about yourself.

, As you practice and become more comfortable, get into the habit of saying what you truly feel. This will help you to build your confidence and gain respect, and it will become a learned behavior for you, helping you to overcome your shyness.If a friend or acquaintance says something that offends you, let them know in a respectful way. Your former shy self might not want to do that, but he needs to know if a line was crossed. Focus on using “I” statements so that he understands your feelings: “I felt hurt when you said that people from that town aren't very smart because I grew up near there.”Set goals for speaking up in particular situations. If you always find yourself remaining quiet and shy in the same types of situations, like when roles are decided for a group project, set a goal to speak up for yourself next time.You could say, “I'm really good at drawing. I'd like to take on the illustrations,” for example. Then, continue to practice those goals.
Simply continue to practice speaking your mind. Start with small things, like giving an opinion on where to hang out or what movie to see. Over time, as you become more comfortable sharing your thoughts, take on more challenging obstacles, like letting a friend know when she has hurt your feelings. The most important thing is to practice doing this over and over."
"
Highlight the positive traits you see in others.,
Personalize encouragement to the person.,
Deliver negative feedback properly.,
Arouse big dreams, but also focus on short-term goals.",How to Encourage Positive Change in Others2," One of the best ways to encourage others is to offer genuine praise. When you see something positive in other people, let them know. Praise is a great way to reinforce positive change, because when people feel good about themselves, they are encouraged to do good as well. Positive praise creates motivation and helps sustain motivation.


You might say, “I’ve noticed that your writing has really improved, Samantha. What’s your secret?” or “I admire the effort you’re putting into learning the violin, Jeremy.”

, Encouragement shouldn’t consist of blanket statements that you toss out to anyone who’s willing to listen. Offer genuine praise that relates to the individual and where they are in the change process.For instance, if someone is just beginning a new behavior, you should focus on highlighting any positive benefits. Say, “Jose, I can tell that you are really committed to raising your math grade. Great job!”
Once they are further along in the change process, you might begin to offer negative feedback, too. This is effective because people are less likely to be motivated by total positive messages as they get closer to reaching a goal. They need some constructive criticism to help them better refine the behavior.

, A common approach to giving constructive criticism is sandwiching the negative statement between two positive statements. Some experts believe this negates a person’s ability to learn from criticism. The helpful feedback is often lost by the padding around it. Instead when you do offer negative feedback, wrap it using five basic ingredients.The context: “I was reviewing your progress over last the few weeks and trying to see how I can better train you.”

The observation: “I noticed that you haven’t shown much improvement in weight-lifting since our last update.”

Your feelings: “I am surprised because I thought you had gotten the hang of the workouts.”

The value statement: “It’s important to me that you reach your fitness goals.”

The suggestion: “We can revise your plan to better suit your current fitness level or increase the number of trainings per week. Let me know how I can help.”

, As you cheer on others in their behavior change, be sure to urge them to dream big. Developing lofty goals helps people dismiss any shortcomings and increase their self-motivation. However, you should also encourage the person to create smaller, short-term goals, too.


Sit down with them and help them map out both small and big SMART goals. Such goals are specific, measurable, attainable, realistic, and time-bound.
In the midst of working towards larger, long-term goals, the completion of short-term goals helps build momentum and boost self-confidence."
"
Accept people without judgment.,
Listen.,
Be empathetic.,
Connect them with others who are going through a similar process.",How to Encourage Positive Change in Others3," Shaming someone into taking positive action is unhelpful and toxic. They will only want to make a change if they want to make the change. Never think that communicating harsh judgments will inspire change—it won’t. Instead lean towards a position of acceptance. You are more likely to find success this way.


For instance, refrain from telling a friend, “Is that a doughnut I see you eating? You don’t seem committed to change!” Offer acceptance by saying something like, “Changing ingrained eating habits can be hard. The next time you have a craving, call me so we can work through coping techniques, okay?”

, An effective accountability partner is one who knows the power of active listening. Behavior change is hard. Sometimes, people just want to vent their frustrations. Employ active listening strategies to hear their perspective and figure out how you can further encourage them.


Active listening involves making eye contact, reading their body language, prompting with short phrases (e.g. “Oh, really?” or “And…?”) and summarizing what the person said when they’re finished speaking., Empathy is an important tool in the change process. As a source of accountability, you can use empathy to acknowledge and validate the feelings of others. People appreciate you when you seem to understand and relate to them. Doing so can improve your relationship with others and boost performance, too.Empathy is also related to the process of active listening. You can display empathy by tuning into the emotional expression of others and validating those emotions. Do so by saying things like “It sounds like you’re upset.” Or, “This seems to be very challenging for you.”
If the person is struggling or experiences a setback, remind them that this is part of the process. Help them to plan for setbacks and come up with ways to deal with them.

, Be accountable in the change process of others by linking them up with others who are undergoing the same change. A support group of others or just one buddy who is making the same change can be a valuable resource. Change seems less intimidating when they are enduring trials and triumphs together.


Help your acquaintance identify at least one other person to go through the process with them. Or, suggest that they join a support group either locally or online."

Don't just plan for the things you know will happen (though you should obviously do this as well); try to anticipate the workload and needed time. Set aside extra time in case you need to stay late at work, or take projects home with you to finish over the weekend.Manage your time wisely. If you make sure that your immediate tasks are taken care of in a timely manner when you are not overloaded, you won't fall behind when something new comes up.
Prepare supplies and plans in advance as much as possible. If you can make preparations for something the night before instead of the morning of, you'll be far more ready for the known and anything else the day might throw your way.;
, When you get involved in a project, you might forget about other responsibilities or obligations of the day. This might be as simple as forgetting to send an email response, or as serious as missing an important deadline. The best way to stay on top of your workload, no matter what profession or area of studies you're in, is to make lists, update progress and check items off as you accomplish them.Make separate color-coded lists with different colored paper or ink for each list. Title them by day, week and month: ""Get Done Today,"" ""Finish This Week,"" and ""Complete by Month's End.""
Combine parts of your goals for efficiency. For example, instead of writing “get supplies for X project,” “get supplies for Y project” and “get supplies for Z project,” you could write “get supplies ordered for X, Y, and Z projects.”
Limit your list to three items. Many successful people limit to do lists to ensure that they do not try to do too much or become overwhelmed. Consider limiting your list to no more than three items.
Make sure that you prioritize important tasks. Larger or more difficult tasks may take longer to complete, but you'll feel better about yourself for completing these big items. For example, instead of adding “register domain name,” you might add “build new website.”
Write your to do list the night before. That way you can start your day knowing what needs to be done, how and when.

, Depending on your job description, your personality type, and available workers with complementary jobs, you may be able to work together with others. Though you might feel like it is simpler to do everything on your own, involve the others. Some jobs require you to work alone, but more often it's a matter of being willing and able to let go of some responsibilities that others should do. You may think that makes you an indispensable worker, but depending on the situation, it could actually be counterproductive and distracting.You may be tempted to try and do everything on your own, but that can actually waste a lot of your time, as well as your company's time when others could to do their part.
Teaching your subordinates and coworkers how to share some of the more time consuming tasks you perform each day can free up your time to focus on the bigger challenges.
Don't use your new found free time to surf the internet or take extra-long coffee breaks. Instead, manage your time by planning ahead and focusing on the weekly and monthly tasks you need to complete.

, Researchers have found that some of the most accomplished men and women around the world shared a common trait: grit. Grit, in this case, is defined as an unwavering passion for long-term goals, as well as an ability to remain committed to those goals in spite of failure and adversity along the way.The best way to set yourself up for success is to create S.M.A.R.T. goals: Specific, Measurable, Action-oriented, Realistic, and Time-bound.


Be specific in creating the end point of your goal. Ask yourself what it is that you hope to ultimately achieve.
Make the goal measurable. Consider how you will know when it has been achieved, and how you will measure incremental success along the way.
Create steps to meet your goal that are action-oriented. Your goal must have a well-defined strategy for achieving your goal, whether it's through weekly progress or day-to-day efforts.
Consider whether your goal is realistic. Don't create an unrealistic expectation for yourself, but make sure your goal does push you to work hard.
Put a time frame on your goal. You should set an end point that will challenge you while still being achievable, as well as intermittent timelines for minor accomplishments along the way.

, Experts agree that visualization techniques are an effective way to bring about positive change in your own life. It won't work like magic, but when you visualize your own success, it can give you the confidence and motivation to make your dreams a reality.Picture your problems being solved, your presentation going well, your promotion going through - whatever it is that you want, imagine it already happening.
Use that visualized image again and again. Any time you feel yourself giving up, return to that image and let it motivate you even more.

, Procrastination will quickly kill your will to persevere. If you start giving in to procrastination, you can quickly feel like all of your time is spent trying to catch up to where you should be.Take action when you notice yourself struggling to stay motivated. That is the time you need motivation the most.
Think about how much more stress you will experience if you put off the work that needs to be done.
Remember that procrastinating won't reduce your workload, and it won't even really buy you more time. If anything, it will make managing your time more difficult.
Try making a calendar and imposing deadlines on yourself. This might help you stick to a schedule and avoid putting off important work.

, For many people, perseverance is equated with pain and suffering. It's considered an uphill struggle that is difficult and often has no end in sight. The key to staying motivated is to find pleasure in your efforts, even when they don't seem to be paying off.Try to reframe your mindset about work and effort. See it as an opportunity to increase your confidence and better yourself.
Henry Ford took great pleasure in his efforts, even when they weren't paying off. So do many people who stick to a rigorous exercise regimen, even when they're not losing any weight.
Even if you're not seeing results right now, you're improving your skill set, expanding your strengths and knowledge, and making progress towards your goals.

, Whether you're a student or you're in the workforce, being punctual is important to success. Tardiness can cause you to miss important meetings, become left out of significant decisions, and may ultimately cost you your job or cause you to fail a class.Don't get sidetracked with distractions when you're preparing to leave for work or school. Develop a routine and stick to it, and don't deviate from your route to work/school unless there's an urgent emergency.
Calculate the distance it will take you to get to work/school on an average day, with and without traffic. One way to do this is by using an online mapping service (like Google Maps, for example) to see how long your commute takes without traffic vs. with heavy traffic.
Plan on leaving with enough time to take traffic into account. If your commute takes 25 minutes without traffic and 35 to 40 minutes with traffic, aim to leave 45 to 50 minutes early.
The worst thing that will happen if you leave too early is that you'll arrive early and have time to grab coffee. If you leave too late, though, it could cost you your job.

, Every day you're faced with countless choices, but one of the choices that may be most difficult for some people is the choice between diligent work and a fun, short-term distraction. While distractions are good in moderation to relax and ""unplug"" your brain, they should be restricted to evenings and weekends so that your work productivity is not affected.Think about how much time you waste on a given day checking your social media, like Facebook and Twitter. Spending 10 minutes on Facebook every hour of an eight hour workday adds up to 80 minutes of time wasted online.
Distractions don't just end with social media. You probably spend a lot of time responding to text messages, checking your personal email, and reading articles on your phone or computer.
There's nothing wrong with using things like social media in moderation, but if it's affecting your work productivity you may need to cut back.
Try turning off your phone (including the vibrating feature) so that you won't get any new notifications. Then force yourself to resist checking your social media, email, or text messages until your lunch break., Professionalism may mean different things for different people. Ultimately, though, your version of professionalism should place the needs of your employers and your professional responsibilities over your own personal interests.Ignore the little things at work that upset you. These minor squabbles aren't worth getting angry over, and if you react with anger it will reflect very poorly on you as an employee.Be more self-disciplined and keep yourself motivated. When you were a child you had your parents to remind you to get back to work, but you won't have those reminders as an adult.
Stay above the gossip that circulates through your workplace. Participating in it or trying to listen in on it will only distract you, frustrate you, and cause you to resent or judge your coworkers.
Show kindness and respect to everyone you work with. You don't have to like everyone, but you do have to show the same basic courtesy to everyone for the good of the company.
Make sure your personal attitude is professional, appropriate, and contributes to a healthy work environment.

, It may seem strange to think of your morning routine at home being related to your work productivity, but the two are inseparable. How you treat your body and mind in the morning before you come to work sets the pace for your entire day, and can either sabotage your efforts or set you up for success.Your morning routine can help you get motivated, as you'll learn to recognize that it's time to switch gears and get productive.
Establish some type of mental signal that it's time to start your day. It might be a morning meditation, a workout session, or simply drinking a glass of cold water.
Try getting some light exercise in the morning. If you don't have time to hit the gym or go for a three mile run, it can be as simple as walking your dog around the block instead of just letting him out in the yard.
Try to leave your home each morning in as calm a mood as possible. Try listening to relaxing music on your drive, if you're able to do so without distraction.
Take a moment to breathe deeply and consciously before you walk from your car or train stop to your place of employment to help de-stress from your commute.
Take slow, deep breaths through your nostrils, down into your lower belly, and back out. Focus on the sensation of air passing through your nostrils and your belly rising and falling to shed some of your stress and anxiety., Just as your morning routine sets the pace for the rest of your day, your evening routine could set the tone for what your morning will be like. Going to bed stressed, not getting enough sleep, or spending too much time in front of the television at night can affect how well-rested you are in the morning. Generally speaking, most adults need between seven to nine hours of sleep each night, though some may need 10 to 11 hours.Instead of binge-watching your favorite TV shows at night, try turning the television off and doing something relaxing before bed, like meditation or reading.Stay off your electronic products at night, or at least keep them out of view. The glare from your phone, tablet, or computer screen can disrupt your body's natural melatonin production, making it harder for you to get to sleep.Take the time to do things you enjoy at home and on the weekends. You'll feel more relaxed, rejuvenated, and ultimately more fulfilled.Make sure you eat a healthy, balanced diet as well. Eating junk food in excess, drinking too much caffeine, or drinking too much alcohol at night can all affect your mental and physical health, and may affect your ability to get a restful night's sleep as well.

, Communicating effectively is difficult when you are upset or stressed. You may end up having a hard time expressing yourself or you may overreact to something. Before you have a conversation with someone, take a moment to check how you are feeling. If you are feeling upset or stressed, then take a moment to calm yourself down before having a conversation.Try taking a few deep breaths.
Make yourself a cup of herbal tea.

Visualize a pleasant place for a few minutes.
Go for a brisk walk.

, It is also important to stay focused and listen when you are talking to someone. If you are looking at your phone, thinking about something else, or preoccupied with what you are going to say next, then you may miss important points that the other person makes and have to ask him or her to repeat what he or she just said. This can lead to lost time and frustration for the other person.Before you start a conversation, put away your cell phone, focus your eyes on the speaker, and pay attention to what the speaker is saying.
If you get confused about something the speaker says, it is okay to ask a question. For example, you can say something like, “Can you clarify what you meant when you said ___?”

, How you hold yourself and the expression of your face can also have an impact on the amount of information that you retain. Make sure that you are showing that you are listening as much as you are actually listening. You can demonstrate that you are listening by:Making eye contact.
Nodding and responding with appropriate facial expressions.
Facing the speaker and leaning in slightly.

, Assertive speech is important for effective communication. If you use passive rather than direct communication, then you risk being misunderstood or unheard. By stating your thoughts and feelings in clear, direct terms, it will be easier to get your point across.Being assertive does not require you to be aggressive or mean. The goal is for you to be heard and understood by others.
Keep in mind that your opinion is as important as everyone else’s opinion. Don’t be shy to speak up if you have an idea.
Be willing to say “no” if you feel overwhelmed or if you just don’t want to do what someone is asking you to do.

, Another way to ensure that you are communicating effectively is to use simple speech rather than complex speech. Before you speak, try to think of the simplest way for you to express yourself. Consider your audience and think about what would help them understand the point you are trying to make.For example, you might need to find ways to communicate without using jargon or technical speech if your audience might not understand those terms. You also might need to give examples, make comparisons, or repeat key ideas.

Overcome the fear of failure.,
Change your bad habits of the unwillingness to learn.,
Adapt to formulate a sense of control.,
Learn to cope with the added pressure involved in change.,
Break the habitual routines.,
See the bigger picture.,
Overcome the fear of the unknown.,
Show respect for or trust in the person initiating the change.,
Avoid self defeating behaviors.",How to Enforce Change in Your Personal Life and Work," Resistance to change may be deeply embedded in fear. We tend to cling to the past which is more secure and predictable. If something has worked well for us in the past, we may fear not accomplishing as much in the future.;
, The attitude of ""I already know all that I need to know"", is destructive and damaging, both to oneself and to those around us.

, New routines may well create a loss of control, and these feelings will prevent you from growing. Remember that these new routines, may very well become a part of your life in the future, just like the way in which these older ones are a part of you now.

, When people are stressed and under pressure, change may be the last thing they need. It is important to prepare yourself in advance in order to embrace change.

, Doing things in the same manner is comfortable. By changing the way you do things, will move you beyond and outside your comfort zone. It is okay to experience things differently sometimes.

, By not seeing the bigger picture, you may fail to see the positive impact of the change in your life as a whole. Thus do not simply look at change as disruptive and unnecessary.

, We resist change just because something is unfamiliar. Always understand that change may not necessarily make matters worse.

, Very often if we distrust or dislike a person who is leading the attempted change, our lack of enthusiasm becomes very evident.

, This involves worrying more about the changes or the problems, rather than becoming a part of it. This will add to the anxiety and set you back considerably.

Know yourself.,
Notice how you identify yourself.,
Jot down thought processes and self definitions.,
Record your negative definitions.,
Identify your core values.,
Define yourself in positive ways.",How to Define Yourself," Self-knowledge, particularly non-judgemental self knowledge, is an incredibly important skill to help you define yourself. You'll need to understand what makes you tick and what your thought processes are before you can define who you are as a person.Mindfulness means paying attention to what you are thinking and observing your patterns of thought. For instance, you might realize that you have a tendency to feel that people don't care what you think and that your opinions are unimportant. Recognizing that you have these thoughts and catching them before they start causing you anxiety, can help you piece together the important parts of your identity.When you start paying attention to your thought processes and patterns you'll need to practice attentive non-judgment. This means being aware of your thought patterns and acknowledging them, but not beating yourself up over them. Everyone has negative thought patterns and processes. By paying attention to them, you can eliminate them from your mind.;
, Once you start paying attention to the way you think about yourself and about the world, look specifically for the ways in which you identify yourself. See what groups and communities you use to create your identity. All of these inform how you see yourself and tell you what you are letting define you.For example, look at things like religion, nationality, sexual identity and see if those are ways you define yourself.
Look at the roles you take on, such as your job, your position in your family (mother, father, sister, brother), your romantic status (single, couple, etc.).

, To become adept at seeing your thought processes and definitions and how those determine how you act and who you are, write them down in a notebook as you identify them. You'll be able to see how you consider yourself and it will make it easier to eliminate the negative associations.


Talking to and working with a clinical psychologist can greatly help in uncovering patterns of thinking and being. They can also help you deal with the more negative aspects of your thinking.

, Recording them and paying attention to them will help you let go of them. Getting them out in the open can help to take away some of their hold on your mind and self.Don't limit yourself in negative ways. Definition of the self determines the action. So, for instance, if you're defining yourself as someone who has bad romantic relationships, you've already lost the potential for a good romantic relationship. It is a story that you tell yourself, and then because you believe the story, you will already be behaving in ways that make the story true.

, You don't want to define yourself based on outside forces, because outside forces are volatile and subject to constant change. By basing your self-definition on core values, you will have a better chance of having a stable self-definition.You won't lose your self identity if you base it on values you hold at your core, like compassion, courage, integrity.
Write down a list of these values and consciously and mindfully act them out in your daily life. Therefore, if courage is one of your core values, stand up for someone being harassed at the bus stop, or if honesty is a core value, fess up to having lost your father's favorite watch. If compassion is on that list, spend time volunteering at a homeless shelter.

, This doesn't mean that you don't acknowledge the negative events and actions that have happened in your life. They are as much a part of you as the positive, but they do not define you.This means don't let outside circumstances rule your identity. That comes from within in, from the core values that you have already identified as being important to your identity.
Understand that the negative experiences in your life have offered knowledge. For example, if you have had negative experiences with romance, learn from those experiences. What have they taught you about the kind of person you want to be?

Remain happy and lighthearted.,
Try to stay calm in tense situations.,
Keep an open mind.,
Develop modesty.",How to Develop a Good Personality1," Try to see the joy in the world. Laugh with others, but not at them. Everyone appreciates someone who is jolly and jovial. Smiling and laughing a lot is a huge part of having a good personality.;
, A lot of people seem like they have a good personality until you see them in an emergency or tense situation. Then they lose their cool. Don’t be this person! If you are in a tense situation, try to remain relaxed and see what you can do to resolve the situation.


For example, lets say your car breaks down on the highway and you’re going to be late to work. Don’t start yelling and screaming – that’s not going to fix anything. Keep your mind clear and start developing a plan to solve the problem.

, One part about having a good personality is being willing to change your worldview. Listen to others and always be willing to change your mind. Don’t pass judgment on other people just because they act in a different way than you do. Keeping an open mind will allow you to make many new friends and probably live a much more interesting life. There’s no need to shut off parts of the world.

, You could be the most talented, extraordinary person in the world, but if you don’t have any modesty than you probably won’t have a good personality. Always keep yourself level and balanced. Nobody likes a big ego.

Learn to love other people.,
Ask questions.,
Remain loyal.,
Offer support and guidance.",How to Develop a Good Personality2," Many bad personalities develop because people do not want to forgive each other and find themselves overwhelmed with hate and anger. Try to find love for everyone.

, Being an inquisitive person is part about caring for other people, and it will also make you a more interesting person in turn. Try to find out what others find interesting and important. You’ll learn a lot and you’ll help them feel valued.

, Don’t betray those who are close to you. Your loved ones will appreciate you more and more if you remain loyal. Stick with the people you love through thick and thin. You can push through a rocky part in your relationship if you remain loyal to the person.

, Don’t try to act like you know everything, but always try to offer a helping hand to people when possible. This could be something as simple as helping a friend move out of their house or more involved support like life guidance. Offer whatever insight you may have but don’t try to sway them too far in one direction. Respect people’s decisions and opinions.

Think positive thoughts, both about yourself and others in general.,
Show your true self.,
Focus on the good parts of your personality.,
Commit to working on the parts of your personality that you don’t like.",How to Develop a Good Personality3," The thoughts that we think soon turn into the words we say and the actions we take. Having good thoughts about yourself gives you self-confidence and self-respect: a hallmark of any good personality. Once you become aware of your own thoughts the process of guiding them in the right direction through positive thoughts will become effortless.

, We often come across opportunities in our day to day life to express our personality. Do it! Don’t try to fall in line with the crowd. Having a good personality doesn’t mean that you are like everyone else. For example, if you are in a conversation with a group or an individual, try not to just constantly agree with everything that they say. Insert your own opinions and stories in a respectful and engaging way.


Always act like yourself. People are drawn to others who act real. If you are putting on a front it will be easy to tell.

, It’s easy to get down on the parts of your personality that you need to work on. Try to avoid that. Pay attention to the parts of your personality that you think appeals to other people and try to showcase that.

, Maybe you think you talk about yourself too much, or that you become impatient too quickly. It’s important to recognize these things, but not to hate yourself for it. Try to pay attention to the way you are acting. The next time you start acting impatient you can catch yourself and try to respond differently to the situation.

Try to figure out who you are.,
Decide what matters to you.,
Develop hobbies.,
Have an opinion.,
Spend time doing the things that matter to you.",How to Develop a Good Personality4," Look deep inside yourself and think about who you are. It's one of the most difficult things to do, but it is also really important. Try to sort out the difference between the ways you act and your real personality.

, Remember, it’s a lot harder to find out what matters to you if you aren’t even sure who you really are yet. Don’t choose the things that matter to you just because other people told you they were important. Find out where your true heart lies.


Maybe you’ve always liked playing soccer because your dad really likes soccer. Or maybe you have always supported a certain political party because your friends support that party. Try to figure out the way you really feel.

, Having hobbies is a big part of having a good personality. You want to be a well-rounded person, not a cliche. Try to throw yourself into the things that you enjoy doing. You don’t even need to be good at them – just passionate.

, Having an opinion is an important part of having a good personality. You don’t just want to be a nodding automaton. You naturally should have an opinion anyways, but sometimes people suppress their opinions to avoid conflict. Don’t be obnoxious about your opinion; just be well-informed and willing to change your mind. Don’t be afraid to ask others their views and share your own.

, Whether its playing the guitar, reading the news, or learning how to fly a plane, if you enjoy it then it’s worth spending time doing. The more time you spend doing things the more knowledgeable you’ll become. Do this for yourself, not so that other people think it is cool that you play the guitar.

Write down five personalities traits about yourself.,
Evaluate the positive and negative.,
Identify activities you enjoy.,
Assess what you want to improve.",How to Develop Personality1," Think about at least five or more personality traits that you have. Write them down, and take a few sentences to describe why you think this personality trait applies to you.


Make sure at least one of them is a positive, good personality trait that you see in yourself.
Also, list one personality trait that is negative or bothering you in some way.
Don't use your physical appearance as a way to describe yourself. Focus only on your personality.;
, When you wrote down these personality traits, did you seem to focus on mostly positive or mostly negative traits? For example, did you have four negative traits, and only one good one?


Understand if you are only seeing the negative in yourself. You may feel like you're not worthy or don't believe in yourself. Find ways to boost your self-esteem.
If you only mentioned one negative trait, you may have greater confidence in yourself, but lack insight into what needs improvement. Consider evaluating your limits in a healthy way and finding more humility.

, If you are not sure about how to develop your personality, think about what makes you happy. What activities do you enjoy? Do you like to spend time with others, or do more things on your own? Do you like fixing or creating things? Are you more artistic or science-oriented?


There are not right or wrong answers about which activities make you a happier or more personable person. This is just a way to figure out the context of what makes you happy.
Some people enjoy activities by themselves or with a few people more than others. Some people love to be at big parties with lots of people.
No matter the activity, it's important to learn how to interact with and respect others. Good communication skills with others helps to show the best parts of your personality.

, Think about what is bothering you in particular about your personality. What do you want to see differently in yourself? By having greater insight, this is an important step to changing. Think about how you could improve in the following areas:Your anxiety, anger, or temper
Your shyness, fearfulness, or awkwardness
Your loneliness, sadness, or depression
Your stubbornness, irritability, or frustration
Your lack of trust
Your arrogance

Walk to keep up your appearance.,
Be consistent.",How to Walk Properly," Although everyone has their own unique, individual gait, certain common behaviors can improve almost everyone's walking experience. Chief among these is your posture. As you walk, keep your head upright, your back straight, and your chin up. Maintaining this posture will keep your spine straight and help you breathe by taking pressure off your diaphragm.


Resist the urge to hunch or slouch as you walk. Over time, bad posture can lead to back pain, a stiff neck, and even more serious maladies.;
, An effective walking motion uses nearly all of the muscle groups in the leg - not just one. As you walk, visualize pushing off with your back foot using your hamstrings and quadriceps and propelling yourself forward onto the heel of your other foot. Roll your foot forward, heel-to-toe, as you make your step. This brings your calf muscles into play - use them to keep your feet at the correct (elevated) angle for each step.

, Even though the majority of the muscles used to walk are in your legs and core, you'll still want to keep an eye on the posture of your upper body. Keeping your shoulders in a relaxed, pulled-back position serves several purposes. It maintains a stable, ""vertical column"" of support while you walk stretching from your neck to your hips. This works in conjunction with a straight back and an elevated chin to minimize the strain on the back as you walk, preventing injury in the long-term. Also, it's simply a good habit to get into to prevent slouching, which, as previously noted, can result in shoulder pain and strain.


Finally, pulling your shoulders back makes you look good by projecting confidence and strength. This is a small but not insignificant point - why look mediocre while you walk when you can look great and protect yourself from injury in the process?

, For most, this should be second nature. As you walk, let your arms hang naturally at your side. Your arms should begin to swing in small arcs as you start to walk - the quicker you walk, the larger the arcs. Moving your arms is a natural part of walking - it's been found to increase the efficiency of your stride, allowing you to walk farther on the same amount of metabolic energy than you would while keeping your arms still.So, don't be afraid to swing your arms as you walk. Don't worry - you won't look like a power walker.


If weather permits, try to keep your hands out of your pockets. Doing so allows you to receive the benefits of swinging your arms, meaning you'll be able to walk faster and farther than you would otherwise.

, For the first few minutes of your walk, keep an even, comfortable rhythm as your body warms up. Assuming that 100% represents the absolute fastest you can walk without breaking into a run, try walking at about 50 - 60% of this level of exertion. As a general rule, you should be able to speak normally and carry on a conversation without being breathless during your warmup.


Though there is some debate on the matter, general warmups have been shown to increase performance during cardiovascular exercise., When you feel comfortable doing so, pick up the pace to about 70 - 80% of your maximum walk speed. Maintain good form as you pick up speed. At this moderately intense pace, you should eventually start to breathe hard, but not gasp. You should be able to maintain a conversation, but not necessarily be able to do this extremely easily.


Resist the urge to start taking long, unnatural strides as you speed up. Lengthening your gait in this manner stretches out your leg muscles and destabilizes your core, leading to discomfort over time.
To improve your cardiovascular health, warm up and maintain this pace for at least 30 minutes 5 times a week. Studies have also shown that breaking up this 30-minute session into multiple chunks throughout the day is similarly effective, so long as one spends an equivalent total amount of time walking.

, After you've maintained your elevated pace for 30 minutes (or longer), decrease your pace back to your warmup pace. Spend 5 to 15 minutes walking at this lower pace. A cooldown session at the end of a high-intensity walk allows you to gradually (rather than abruptly) return to your resting heart rate. Plus, it just plain feels great.


This last point is definitely worth consideration. The better you feel after exercise, the more likely you are to repeat your exercise consistently. Thus, good cooldown sessions can help increase your long-term gains from exercise.

, If you're about to start an exercise regimen of daily walking, consider buying a comfortable pair of walking shoes if you don't already have a pair. A good pair of shoes can do wonders for your performance, improving your gait and allowing you to walk comfortably for longer than you otherwise would. Pick shoes that provide good stability to help keep your feet straight as you walk, cushioning to protect your heel when you step, and support for your ankle to prevent injury. The employees in the shoe section of most athletic stores should be able to help you make an informed choice.


You don't necessarily have to delay your walking regimen just because you don't have a sporty set of purpose-built sneakers. Though these will provide the maximum benefit, any pair of shoes that you can walk in comfortably for long periods of time without developing pain or blisters can potentially be walking shoes.

, When walking, there are some basic practical considerations you'll want to keep in mind as you choose your clothing. You'll want to be prepared to work up at least a light sweat. Usually, a simple cotton t-shirt can help here, keeping you comfortable by absorbing sweat. You'll also want to pick pants that don't inhibit your gait at all. Sweatpants, shorts, track pants, and even comfortable jeans are all possibilities. Finally, you'll want to pick clothing suitable for the weather so that you're not forced to cut your walk short when you're waylaid by wind, rain, or heat. If it's cold, you'll want to bring a coat or a windbreaker, whereas if it's hot, you'll want to wear shorts, and so on.


As with your shoes, don't feel the need to don sporty exercise gear just to get out there for a walk. The benefits of a lycra bodysuit, for instance, are minimal - unless you're really serious about walking, it's usually OK to rely on the clothing you already have rather than to buy something new.

, Where you walk can have just as much of an effect on the exercise benefit you receive as how fast you walk. Early on, you may want to stick to mostly level ground. As you become more confident, you can challenge yourself by setting more difficult or longer walking routes.


Hiking up and down hills is a great way to get exercise. However, this can also increase the strain on your muscles and joints, especially your ankles, which will need to support your feet as they angle up for each step. Approach steep hills as you would approach a heavy set of weights at the gym - build up to your goal, rather than tackling it immediately.

, Though walking isn't as intense a form of exercise as running, weightlifting, rock climbing, and other forms of exercise, injury is still a possibility. To lessen the chance of injury from walking and to improve your flexibility, stretch before and/or after you exercise. Taking a moment to stretch your legs and arms for 5 - 10 minutes before you walk will make walking more comfortable and can keep you in better shape in the long run.


Note that the benefits of stretching (and the consequences of not stretching) are increased if you suffer from a chronic condition like back pain or arthritis.
Because your legs are the primary muscles used in the walking process, you'll want to prioritize lower body stretches, though core stretches and even upper body stretches can also provide benefits, especially if you're prone to pain in these areas. Below are just a few types of stretches you may want to perform:

Standing thigh stretches
Hamstring stretches, like the downward dog yoga pose
Calf stretches
Back stretches, like the cat and crocodile yoga poses
Shoulder stretches



, The benefits of starting a walking regimen when you previously had no exercise routine will quickly become apparent - your mood will likely elevate, you'll feel more energetic, and you may even lose weight (assuming you don't begin to eat more to compensate for the energy you use while exercising). To increase these benefits, feeling even better, having more energy, and potentially losing more weight, you'll want to increase the distance you walk, the speed at which you walk, or, best of all, both. Treat walking like you would any other exercise routine, gradually increasing your burden over time, and you'll be surprised at the changes in how you look and feel.

, Walking purely for exercise and no other reason is a great idea, but you can greatly increase the amount of time you walk every day by making the choice to walk everywhere you go. In addition, because of its demonstrated mood-boosting effects, walking to the places you need to during your day ensures you arrive energized, alert, and ready to perform to the utmost of your ability. If you walk enough throughout your daily routine, you may not even need to devote any extra time to exercise! Below are just a few common opportunities for walking:


Your daily commute. This is a big one. If you can manage to walk to and from work (or walk to a public transportation station) rather than driving, not only will you get exercise and avoid the tedium of morning and evening commutes, but also reduce your impact on the environment in terms of pollution.
Trips to the store. Many people make trips to the store for groceries or other common purchases several times a week. If you use this opportunity to go for a walk, you'll get exercise from walking on the way to the store and additional exercise on the way back from carrying your purchases home.
Trips to friends' houses. Finally, if you're going to hang out with a friend, take the opportunity to walk, rather than drive. Doing so helps ensure you'll be in a great mood and have plenty of energy for having fun when you show up.

, As noted above, it's smart to walk as a way of getting where you need to be, but you don't necessarily need any reason to walk other than that you want to. Besides being a form of exercise, walking can be just plain fun (assuming that the weather is good). It's a great way to get out of the house, get some fresh air, and see what the world has to offer. Rather than spending all of your free time on the couch, devote some of your recreational time to walking. You'll find that it's a lot more rewarding than watching TV in the long run.


One good idea for walking as a form of recreation is to use the opportunity to explore. Venture off the beaten path of roads that you use to get to and from work or school. You'll discover hidden secrets, handy shortcuts, and places that you didn't know existed.

, It's hard to meet new people if you're in your house all day, so take the opportunity to go for a stroll! Walking in public in places like malls, street fairs, and busy downtown streets is a time to present yourself to others and potentially make new connections. It also allows you to participate in your community simply by virtue of the fact that if you're physically present in it, you're more likely to participate. It's easy to forget the simple pleasures of seeing and being seen if you aren't out and about regularly, so get up and get out!


Walking is a great way to gently start ""coming out of your shell"" if you're shy. While there are more effective ways to meet new people, walking is good choice for people who have been withdrawn for a long time and are looking to ease back into a new social life. Plus, on the off chance that you strike up a conversation with a new person when you're out walking, you'll naturally be more energetic and alert than you might otherwise have been because of the mood-elevating effects of walking.

, Proper walking form has some nice side benefits for one's appearance. For starters, walking provides an obvious benefit in the form of improving your general fitness. Like all forms of exercise, walking can help you become fit and trim, increasing your attractiveness. Beyond this basic benefit, however, there are others. For instance, keeping good form while walking can gradually contribute to a habit of good posture. People almost always look better when they're standing straight and erect than when they're slouched.


For men, maintaining proper posture while walking by keeping your upper body straight and your shoulders back has the added benefit of accentuating the pectoral muscles and tensing your abdominal muscles, making you look slightly more muscular than you would otherwise. For women, this will have the benefits above, plus the added effect of making you stick your chest out slightly, making you naturally appear more busty.
Don't feel vain for investing time, thought, and energy in your appearance. Physical attraction is a real, legitimate component of one's dating potential and should not be ignored.

, However you choose to work your new walking routine into your life, it's important to remember to stick with it. The effects of a walking routine are most pronounced when that routine is practiced regularly. Going for a few long walks and then neglecting to walk again for a month won't give you much of a benefit in terms of health, mood, or appearance. However, walking for forty five minutes five times a week will. Give yourself a routine and stick to it - you owe it to yourself to make the most of your potential.


With the demands of your work, school, and/or family competing for your time, it can be tricky to make time for walking every day. If you're having trouble being consistent when it comes to your walking regimen, try making up for this by taking the opportunity to take small walks throughout the day. Below are just a few ideas for when you may want to do this:

During your lunch break or recess
After you finish work or school
Early in the morning before leaving for work or school
After dinner

Find your confidence.,
Be open to new experiences.,
Be agreeable and friendly.,
Be respectful and humble.,
Have resilience.",How to Develop Personality2," Confidence is an attractive personality trait. Often confident people who believe in themselves and in others are happier. While being arrogant in your confidence can make others uneasy, believing in yourself is key.


Identify the different ways to feel and look confident.
Have good body language that shows you're not fearful of others. Maintain good eye contact. Smile. Look interested in what others say and do.
Gain confidence by focusing on the positive things in your life, and what you do well. Think about any recent events in which you worked hard, did well in something, or overcame a struggle. Remember these times, rather than the times where you messed up.

, While it may feel comfortable to do the same old things you always do, be adventurous and consider trying other things. You may be shy or unsure if it will go well. Oftentimes, things aren't as bad as you imagine them to be. Being open to new things makes you seem more flexible, interesting, and attractive to others.If you not ready to do something new on your own, try things in groups or with a trusted friend or family member.
New experiences don't necessarily have to be risky adventures that put you or others in danger. It's just something that gets you out of your comfort zone.
For example, let's say you like to draw, but have never taken an art class because you're not sure if you're good enough. Well, that's what a class is for--to improve, to explore, to create a new way of thinking.

, While it may be tough to be agreeable all the time, people are more likely to respond positively and help you if you're kind and friendly. Show others that you are interested in getting to know them. Be willing to listen and understand another person's perspective.Show empathy when others need to talk or vent. Imagine what it would be like in their shoes. Listen without interruption. Put away your electronics and devices, and focus on being present with others in need.
Try to remain kind and polite even when others are rude. While it's important to know your limits, avoid trying to pick a fight when someone disagrees with you.

, You don't necessarily have the same things or outlook as everyone else. You may be doing well for yourself. You may see others bragging about how well they're doing. Focus on how to be humble rather than jealous. Respect that each person has their own path.


Show self-control.
Forgive yourself and others. Put the past in the past. Avoid dwelling on past mistakes, and focus on how to find solutions and be future-oriented. Consider saying these self-affirmations: ""I release the past so that I can step into the future with pure intentions"" or ""I forgive myself one day at a time until it's complete.""Focus on how you can give rather than take.

, Resilience is the courage to pick yourself up again after bad things happen. It's a belief that you can persevere. This is an important trait, particularly during tough times.Focus on how to be strong in your daily life. Stand up for yourself and others who are being bullied, demeaned, or hated. Have the courage to do selfless acts in which you put others above yourself.
Develop your resilience by not taking things too seriously. Believe in second and third chances to improve and become better. Take care of your body, mind, and spirit by finding ways to stay positive and be healthy.Avoid being disheartened or disillusioned. Believe that you can contribute and make a difference, even in small ways.

"
"
Avoid rigidity and stubbornness.,
Exercise patience rather than anger.,
Help others more.,
Speak up more.,
Stop comparing yourself too much to others.",How to Develop Personality3," Being stubborn often means it's your way or the highway. You see things in black and white, and have a rigid sense of how things are or should be.Imagine that things can be confusing, unclear, and gray. And that's okay.
Imagine alternative ways of understanding a situation or person. Avoid assuming that there is no alternative way of thinking.

, Anger and anxiety happens to everyone. You may feel out of control at times, or like you don't know what to do with your emotions. Find ways to stay calm and patient.


Identify ways to control your anger.
Look at what triggers your frustration, and find ways to reduce these stressors.
Instead of thinking about how much something makes you anxious and angry, take a minute. Breathe. Imagine yourself in a calm and relaxed place.

, Do you avoid sharing with others? Or seem to always want to put your needs ahead of others for some reason? Break this habit of selfish behavior, and focus on how you can help others more.Do things that you normally would avoid or complain about. Help others that need your help.
Focus first on how you can help those closest to you--your family, relatives, friends, neighbors, classmates, or co-workers.
Branch out of your comfort zone, and consider volunteering your time to others. Give back to your community.

, Learn to stand up for yourself and others. Shyness can be hard to overcome, and takes practice. The more you try, the better you will be with time. Learn to say what you want to say without fear of rejection or judgment.


Consider taking a public speaking course. There are also many meetings nationwide via Toastmasters that help you learn public speaking: https://www.toastmasters.org/

If you are in school, there may also be debate classes or other opportunities to learn public speaking.
Try talking more often with acquaintances through school, social gatherings, work. Build your communication skills.

, Everyone wants what they don't have. You may see someone who's happier, smarter, and better looking that you, and wish that you could be them. If you continue to dwell on what you don't have, you miss out on appreciating what you do have.Instead of wishing for things to be better, be grateful for you've got. Remember at least three things each day that make you grateful for your life.
Appreciate what the world has to offer rather than fixating on how you've been ill-treated.

"
"
Remember that each person is unique.,
Find your inner happiness.,
Focus on loving yourself.",How to Develop Personality4," You don't have to pretend to be someone that you're not. Be true to a personality that fits you, and that feels natural to you. Uniqueness in your personality is itself an attractive quality.


Avoid seeing your personality as static. You will likely change over time. You may become less shy. You may become more open-minded. Or maybe, you become more stubborn as you grow older.
Whatever your personality is or becomes, it is adaptable. It is uniquely yours, and you have the ability to adapt it, change it, or keep it as is.

, Ultimately, your personality may tied to your sense of happiness. You may wonder how you can change your personality to be a happier and healthier you. It starts with finding your inner happiness. What gives you peace? What makes you feel calm, relaxed, and rested?


Learn ways to cultivate happiness in yourself.
Do relaxing activities. Meditate. Listen to music. Take a walk in nature. Take time for yourself.

, Remember that developing a sense of yourself and your own unique personality starts and ends with loving yourself. Appreciate who you are and what you have to offer to others. Believe in yourself.Avoid negative talk or thinking. If there are others putting you down, avoid defining yourself on their terms. You determine who you are.
Find supports that boost your positive personality traits. Find others that welcome you, and make you feel loved. Share with them your concerns.
Be kind to yourself every day.

See fear as a positive.,
Reward yourself for completing tasks.,
Have a sense of urgency about every situation.,
Remember the big picture.,
Learn from failures.,
Develop your sense of self-efficacy.,
Embrace the fact you control your attitude.,
Do not think about why you can't do something.,
Avoid negative people.,
Use positive language.,
Challenge irrational thoughts.,
Develop your resilience.,
Express gratitude every day.,
Smile more often.,
Practice meditation.,
Adopt a healthier lifestyle.",How to Develop a Can Do Attitude," How you look at fear can severely affect your sense of motivation. Rather than seeing fear as something to slow you down or hold you back, see fear as a challenge. If you want to have a can-do attitude, work on consciously altering your attitude regarding fear.Fear is based in the unknown. In any given situation, there's always a chance you could fail or lose. Being unable to know the outcome can make you bulk at a new opportunity rather than take it.
However, see the unknown as something to be embraced rather than feared. There is a chance something could go wrong, but there's always a chance it could be a positive experience. The more chances you take, the more you increase your likelihood of success.
The next time you feel fearful in the face of a new challenge, remind yourself you could succeed. Remember the unknown is not always bad and, worst case scenario, there will be other chances in the future.;
, Self-motivation is key to a can-do attitude. One great way to motivate yourself is to reward yourself for pushing yourself. Success can take a long time to achieve, and you often have little control over external rewards. Therefore, learning to reward yourself can help. This will teach you to work for your own personal sense of accomplishment and pride, allowing you to take new opportunities as they come. This will foster a can-do attitude.Rewards are a bigger motivational factor than many people realize. Rewards may actually account for about three quarters of the reason people do things. However, you're unlikely to get rewarded every time you said ""Yes"" to something at work, or each time you check an item off your to-do list.
Therefore, reward yourself. Give yourself a small treat or reward. You can, for example, allow yourself to spend a night out with friends if you agree to take on an extra task at work that week.

, Procrastination can kill a can-do attitude. Many people live with the mentality that there is always tomorrow to get things done, take chances, and embrace opportunity. Successful people, however, do not think about tomorrow. They live in the here and now, and are eager to get things done as soon as they can. If you want a can-do attitude, try to live with that same sense of urgency.Do everything you reasonably can do each day rather than putting it off. Remind yourself you don't know what will happen tomorrow. For example, you find yourself thinking, ""I don't need to proofread that report now. I can do it tomorrow morning during downtime.""
Counter this thought with something like, ""What if I don't have downtime tomorrow? What if there's an issue in the office I need to take care of?"" This will motivate you to proofread your report right now.

, People with a can-do attitude don't see small tasks and opportunities as minute obligations or details. They stay focused on their larger goals. Instead of focusing on your short-term wants and emotions, remember your long-term goals.For example, your boss asks if anyone can stay late to help with a project. You want to go home and relax, as it's been a long week. Someone with a can-do attitude would eagerly say ""Yes"" to this, but you're exhausted and want to go to bed.
Instead of thinking about how you feel now, look to the future. Yes, you will probably have a bad day today, but think about the positives in the future. This will make you look like a hard worker. The next time a promotion comes along, your boss may look to you over other employees.

, Your reaction to failure can have a major impact on whether you can sustain a can-do attitude. If you let every single failure destroy you, you will burn out quickly. You need to learn to bounce back from failures so you can get up the next day and have a can-do attitude once more.When you experience a setback, remember your positive qualities. Think about your capabilities and everything you have going for you. Remind yourself one small misfire in an otherwise successful life is not worth beating yourself up.
See if there's anything to be learned. Sometimes, setbacks are beyond your control. However, review how you acted in the situation. Is there anything you could have done differently? If so, try to see this as a learning opportunity rather than a waste of time and effort.

, Self-efficacy is when you believe that you can accomplish your goals and influence your situation in the way that you desire.This is an important component of having a can-do attitude.



Find a role model. Do you know someone who is highly self-efficacious? If so, then this person could be a great role model for you as you work to develop your own self-efficacy and can-do attitude.
Reflect on your accomplishments. Think back on goals you have accomplished and other achievements that make you feel proud. This can help you to see that you have the power to influence your future.
Work towards one goal at a time. Trying to take on too much may hider a sense of self-efficacy because you may become overwhelmed by everything you want to accomplish. Instead, focus on just one goal at a time.
Surround yourself with supportive people. You may also have an easier time of building your self-efficacy if you spend time with people who believe in you and encourage you. Steer clear of people who put you down or who discourage your efforts., Many people falsely believe they cannot control how they feel. This can lead to a defeatist attitude, in which setbacks and problems are internalized. Remind yourself you can control your attitude. You can choose how you interpret your experience. Viewing experience through a more positive lens can help fuel an upbeat, can-do attitude.Remember that people view situations differently. One person may see missing the last train to work as an opportunity to enjoy a nice walk before a long work day. The other person may see it as a disaster.
You can choose which of these life views to embrace. Opting for positivity over catastrophic thinking will be more energizing. You will be more eager to say ""Yes"" to new opportunities and experiences as you won't be as emotionally drained.

, When an opportunity is presented, many people immediately think of the reasons they can't do it. Your mind may immediately make a running list of your limitations and the reasons something can't be done. Work to block out these thoughts as they occur. If something simply needs to get done, you can't indulge in worrying over whether it can be done.Challenge your knee-jerk excuses. For example, your boss asks you to make a presentation at a big conference. Your immediate thought is, ""I can't do this. I don't have time. I don't know enough about the subject.""
Stop immediately. Do not think about why you can't do the presentation. Instead, focus on the ways you can could conceivably achieve. For example, instead think, ""This will be a challenge, but I can do it. How can I make time for this? What should I do to learn more about this subject?""

, Other people can really affect your own attitude. It's hard enough to stay positive and work against your own negative thoughts. You don't need negative people encouraging such thoughts. Try to limit your contact with chronic complainers.You will learn to filter out negative people fast. You may know someone in your office who's prone to complaining about all their setbacks. You may find when you share positive news with that person, they respond with disinterest or disdain.
You don't want someone else's negativity to rub off on you. Instead of sharing good news with this person, talk to someone who's generally positive and encouraging.

, How you use language throughout the day can affect your mood. If you want a can-do attitude, talk as if you already have one. This will alter your thinking, gradually allowing you to develop more motivation and positivity.Avoid negative phrases. When you catch yourself saying, ""I can't"" or ""It's impossible,"" try to rephrase. Instead, say something like, ""Sounds like a challenge.""
When people ask you how you're doing, phrase it in a positive way. Respond with something like, ""I'm doing great. How are you?""
If you do need to express negative emotions, work on tapering your expression. For example, don't say, ""My mom really made me mad today."" Instead, say something like, ""I'm a little annoyed with my mom right now.""

, Negative thoughts are often irrational, and can inhibit a can-do attitude. Negativity can convince you that you can't do something. When you feel an irrational thought creeping in, stop and challenge it. Acknowledge the thought is not a true reflection of your capabilities.When you think poorly of yourself or a situation, pause. Think to yourself, ""What is a better way to view this situation?""
For example, you have a lot of deadlines coming up at work. You think to yourself, ""I can't do this. It's too much."" Pause and think, ""What's a better way to look at this?""
Figure out a better way to view this situation. Instead, think something like, ""This will be a challenge, but I know I'm a capable person.""

, Being resilient can help you to bounce back more quickly when something does not go your way. This is important for a can-do attitude because you may sometimes have to deal with setbacks. Some things you can do to become more resilient include:Maintaining good relationships with supportive friends and family.
Looking to the future to feel better about your current situation.
Working towards your goals regularly, even if you can only do something small.
Looking for opportunities to learn more about yourself.

, Gratitude is key to maintaining the positivity necessary for a can-do attitude. Gratitude can help with your overall life view, giving you the energy you need to say ""yes"" to more opportunities.Keep a gratitude journal where you write down specific thing you're thankful for. Remember to avoid generalizations. Do not say, ""I'm grateful for my friends."" Instead say, ""I'm grateful for how caring and supporting my friends are.""Try to even be grateful for negative situations. For example, think something like, ""It's too bad Claire and I broke up, but I'm grateful I got out of a relationship that wasn't working.""

, It's a small change, but it can have a big impact on your mood. Work on smiling more throughout the day. Smiling sends feedback to the muscles in the brain, which then trigger feelings of happiness. Work on smiling periodically. You will end up feeling more motivated and happy as a result., Meditation can help you reduce stress and increase energy. A can-do attitude requires a resilient attitude and high energy. Daily meditation can help you stay grounded enough to keep embracing new opportunities.Strive for at least 7 minutes of meditation each day.
You can take a meditation class. You can also find guided routines online.

, How you're feeling physically can have a big impact on your overall emotional state. If you want a positive, can-do attitude, you need to embrace a healthy overall lifestyle.Eat plenty of fruits, vegetables, lean meats, and whole grains.
Strive to get some exercise in each day.
Make sure you get enough sleep each night.

Speak slowly.,
Mix your vowels.,
Speak with a lilt.,
Drop your “g”s.,
Perfect a few phrases first.,
Be considerate.",How to Develop a Southern Accent1," People from the South are known for their slow drawl. They have a drawn out way of saying their words, especially their vowels. Part of sounding really Southern is matching the slow pace of southern speech., Another aspect of a Southern accent is mixing together some of your vowels. For example, “pen” and “pin” should sound the same, like a mixture between the two words. It’s the same with “tin” and “ten.”""Get"" comes out ""git,"" and ""just"" as ""jist"" or ""jis"" (almost drop the t).

, A Southern lilt involves drawing out vowels to the point where, sometimes, they sound like two syllables. For example, “bill” turns into “bee-hill” and “short” becomes “showat.”Practice using a lilt on

, Say your words as though there is no “g” at the end. This is common to most Southern accents. For example, say “fixin’” instead of “fixing” and “fishin’” instead of “fishing.” You don’t have to do this with words like “thing” or “dog,” but words with an “ing” should lose their “g”s.


“Fixin’” is also a word commonly used by people with Southern accents, when you’re trying to do something. As in, “I’m fixin’ to go fishin’ this afternoon!”, Perfect a few phrases that you know you can say exactly correctly. Maybe they are phrases you learned from the book you read, ones you’ve copied from a movie you watched, or ones that you learned from a friend or family member from the South. Before you tackle the entire accent, work on these phrases.""Jist-a-minute"" and ""Jist a second"" are common.

, Remember that many people speak with genuine Southern accents. A person who speaks with a Southern accent does not have the option to switch it off. If you imitate a Southern accent with the intent of poking fun at the speech pattern, you might offend or otherwise disrespect people who speak with Southern accents.

Consider also that the Southern accent is sometimes associated with certain stereotypes and subcultures. This is perhaps most notable in a particular stereotype of Southerners as ignorant, uncultured, and poor. Ask yourself whether it is discriminatory to imitate a Southern accent in this context.

"
"
Use colloquial sayings.,
Reduce your use of the verb “to be.” This means not using the words “is,” “are,” and “am” as much.,
Relearn the word “done.” In southern speech, “done” can have a few different meanings.,
Incorporate “might could” and “y’all” into your speech.,
Remember that many Southerners are polite.",How to Develop a Southern Accent2," Every way of speaking and culture has its own sayings and colloquialisms. Try to learn some southern ones. Here are some examples:


“Bless her/his little heart” sometimes means that someone is incompetent or that they did something sweet or thoughtful.
“Dad burn it!” essentially means, “Gosh darn it.”
“He chews his own tobacco” means that the person is independent.
“He could talk a cat out of a tree!” means that the person is persuasive and convincing., For example, instead of saying, “Are you ready?” you would just say “You ready?”, Here are some examples:


It can be a substitute for “already,” as in, “I done let the dog out this morning.”
It can also be used emphatically, as in “I done cannot do this anymore.”
It can also mean “did,” as in, “I done my math homework tonight.”(This is archaic Southern; more educated contemporary Southerners don't say this.)

, There are lots of grammatical structures unique to Southern speech, and these are two examples. Use them when appropriate!


Use “might could” or “might should” when you want to imply both that someone could and should do something. As in, “You might could put another log on the fire.”
Use “y’all” instead of “you all.” As in, “Y’all should come here and look at this dawg!” ( Common) or ""Y'all uns"" almost said as one word ""Y'all-uns need to stop that racket right now"" - often towards children.

, ""Sir"" and ""Ma'am"" are common, especially with child to parent (regardless of age), people in authority, people older than you, or people you don't know well. ""Pardon me,"" ""'excuse me,"" ""Thank ya,"" or ""Thankee much"" are also common. ""Yessir,"" ""Yessah,"" and ""Yes'm"" are often meshed into almost one word."
"
Research the specific Southern accent you want to adapt.,
Watch TV shows and movies featuring characters with Southern accents.,
Try to find someone with a Southern accent.,
Read a book about speaking with a Southern accent.",How to Develop a Southern Accent3," Southern accents are different in many different parts of the South. Phrases and accents were different in Georgia in 1800s as opposed to modern day New Orleans. The slow Southern Drawl is more common in the past and in rural areas than in metropolitan areas like Atlanta or Birmingham. Usually, they are grouped into categories by region. Here are two major regions into which the South is divided as well as their differences in speech:


Coastal/Lowland: Drop your ""r""s at the end of words and blend them with the next word (as in, ""bigguh dog"" instead of ""bigger dog""). Turn short vowels, like ""dog,"" into longer diphthongs (""dah-wug"").
Inland/Mountain: Exaggerate the ""oo"" sound in words like ""loose."" Pay more attention to the ""o"" in words like ""coat."", Get used to the way the Southern accent sounds. In the Netflix series House of Cards, Frank Underwood has a slight Southern accent, while in some movies, such as Forrest Gump, many of the characters have stronger Southern accents. The TV Show ""Justified"" has excellent modern day Mountain regional accents. Watch a variety of movies and shows to get a feel for different types of Southern accents., If you know someone with a Southern accent, ask them to sit down and talk with you. If you don’t know someone with a Southern accent, ask around until you find someone who knows what you want to do and doesn’t mind talking to you for a little bit. Repeat the same words over and over again, and try to say the words exactly how the other person says them. Ask them to correct you on how you say certain words and to coach you on how to say these words.

, Try reading The Complete Guide to Speaking Southern by Steve Mitchell, as well as the book’s sequel.You could also find a book for actors on perfecting accents in general. Reading about how to acquire and maintain a Southern accent will certainly help you when you try to speak with one.

Know What You Want.,
Give it time to happen.,
Create your Affirmations.,
Deal with Resistance.,
Take Action.,
Know the difference between Working Hard vs Inspired Action.,
Take One Step At A Time.",How to Use the Law of Attraction to Achieve Success," Separate a page into three columns and head them What I Don't Want, What I Do Want and Why I Want This.


What I Don't Want. In the first column, write a list of everything that you do not want in relation to money. e.g being in debt, stress about paying bills, having an out-of-date wardrobe, working long hours and not having any family time, etc.
What I Do Want. In the second column, next to each item you have already written, write the exact opposite of each item. e.g next to stress about paying bills, write having more than enough money to pay my bills on time each month, or next to having an out-of-date wardrobe, write affording well made clothing that suits me.
Why I Want This. In the last column, write WHY you want it next to each item in the What I Want column. Each time you give yourself an answer, ask again Why Do I Want That? You're trying to get to the core feelings that motivate you. The motivation goes beyond the material items and is needed to make the goal meaningful to you. Really spend time on this column and when you get to an answer that gives you a feeling of 'knowing' or an unfamiliar wave of emotion, you have the answer to write down.;
, Now you know What You Want and Why. You have already activated the Law of Attraction to begin orchestrating your success. Your main task now is to allow it to work.

, On a new sheet, write out your list of What You Want and the reason for it. Write each item as if it is already true in the present, e.g I love that my wardrobe is filled with fashionable well-made clothes that suit me because I walk taller and feel powerful and respected when I walk into meetings; I am so grateful now that I earn ever-increasing amounts of passive income from multiple streams of income so that I can spend so much quality time with my family. Repeat these affirmations when you wake and when you go to sleep at night and as often as you can any other time.

, If any doubts or fears begin to surface, nip them in the bud immediately by doing EFT, distracting yourself with something you enjoy doing on another topic, or finding something inspiring to read or listen to by others who have succeeded.

, Keep your end goals clearly in mind, feeling the emotions they evoke, when encountering any decision that may take you closer to success. Only act on the choices that 'feel right' when holding your goal in mind. Never worry about missing an opportunity. Law of Attraction will keep bringing you opportunities if you keep your focus on your goals and the feelings they evoke. You can never 'miss the boat' or 'miss a once in a lifetime opportunity'.

, Working hard without a clear end goal in mind is like racing up a ladder and finding it's resting against the wrong wall. On the other hand, using the Law of Attraction and then taking Inspired Action (acting on your intuition with your goals clearly in mind) can result in miracles.

, You don't need to know all the steps to take to achieve your goal, but you do need to believe in the success of your goal and you do need to look out for the one next step and take action on it.

, First-time networkers should start with a goal like meeting two new people or getting two business cards. Experienced extroverts may want to try to garner an invite to an exclusive society or community service organization.

, Keep your body language positive, including arms relaxed at your sides, legs planted at hip width apart, nodding and smiling. If you have weak posture, get in the habit of standing up straight.


Avoid crossing your arms and legs when you sit and stand. These are negative and defensive postures that might work against you.






Get used to eye contact. You should be able to look someone in the eyes as you meet them, but break eye contact before you start to stare.Don’t be afraid to talk with your hands. It’s better to gesticulate to make a point than to cross your arms or touch your neck and face. It shows confidence, just like eye contact and a wide stance., Bring them along so that you can easily trade contact information. Keep a pen on hand in case you want to write a personal message to a new acquaintance.

, If you are starting a new business, looking for investors or trying to gain support for a cause, you should have a 30-second persuasive speech ready. Practice incorporating it comfortably into everyday speech, so that it doesn’t sound rehearsed., Research how most people dress for the event and adopt a similar appearance. Looking professional and put-together will work in your favor when trying to start conversations.

, Stick it on the upper right hand side, below your shoulder. Right handed people will be drawn to look there when they shake your hand., They will be more open to striking up a conversation with a stranger. Keep in mind that it may be harder to leave a single person and a group when you want to create other connections, so make sure you don’t talk to one person the entire night.

, Three people usually have room for one more in their conversation. Choose groups of three that are standing in open formation, with room in between or near the perimeter; these groups are a better bet than people standing close and whispering., Placing yourself by a buffet or registration table will make you more likely to see people you know, introduce yourself to organizers and pick out people you’ve been wanting to meet.

, Show that you remember names and personal information by taking a leading role in a group conversation. You can become the glue that holds other people together.

, Your goal is to make new connections, so tell your friends ahead of time if you think they will be offended. Ask them to introduce you to people if they have good connections.

, Don’t try anything too complicated or humorous. The following are simple ways to start talking to people.


Compliment the person’s taste in drinks if it appears you are drinking the same thing.






Try commenting on the hors d’oeuvres, the weather or sports. These topics are seen as “ice-breakers” so the person will understand your intention.






Ask what company the person is associated with.






Ask for a person’s impression. Many people like to share opinions, so don’t be afraid to say “What do you think of the theme this year?”Avoid being negative. Don’t make the first thing you say to a person a negative comment. You are setting the tone for a negative interaction, rather than a positive one.







, Use a firm, three second shake while you maintain eye contact.

, Don’t dig too deep, but show an interest. Most people will eventually ask you how you are associated with the organizer or the event.


Avoid yes or no questions, especially at the beginning of a conversation. They give a person an excuse to say very little and excuse themselves.







, Spend the majority of the time listening, rather than talking about yourself. If you are patient, the people you talk to will hit on a topic of mutual interest that will strengthen a conversation.


Note these mutual interests so that you can remember them the next time you meet.

, You won’t click with everyone, so accept that some rejection will be part of a networking event. Move on quickly to a new group or person, rather than taking it personally.

, Volunteering your services to a community or charity goal can improve a relationship and the connection that you just made.

, Many people make the mistake of giving them to everyone. Make it a special connection while a person you want to be in touch with in the future.

Study another industry.,
Learn about another religion.Religions are the way that humans organize and understand their relationships not only with the supernatural or divine but with each other.,
Take a class.Learning a new topic will not only teach you a new set of facts and figures, it will teach you a new way of looking at and making sense of aspects of your everyday life or of the society or natural world you live in.,
Read a novel in an unfamiliar genre.Reading is one of the great mental stimulators in our society, but it’s easy to get into a rut.,
Write a poem.While most problem-solving leans heavily on our brain’s logical centers, poetry neatly bridges our more rational left-brain though processes and our more creative right-brain processes.,
Draw a picture.Drawing a picture is even more right-brained, and can help break your logical left-brain’s hold on a problem the same way a poem can.,
Turn it upside down.Turning something upside-down, whether physically by flipping a piece of paper around or metaphorically by re-imagining it can help you see patterns that wouldn’t otherwise be apparent.,
Work backwards.Just like turning a thing upside down, working backwards breaks the brain’s normal conception of causality.,
Ask a child for advice.,
Invite randomness.If you’ve ever seen video of Jackson Pollock painting, you have seen a masterful painter consciously inviting randomness into his work.,
Take a shower.There’s some kind of weird psychic link between showering and creativity.",How to Think Different," Go to the library and pick up a trade magazine in an industry other than your own, or grab a few books from the library, and learn about how things are done in other industries. You might find that many of the problems people in other industries face are similar to the problems in your own, but that they’ve developed really quite different ways of dealing with them. Or you might well find new linkages between your own industry and the new one, linkages that might well be the basis of innovative partnerships in the future.;
, Learning about how such relations are structured can teach you a lot about how people relate to each other and the world around them. Starting to see the reason in another religion can also help you develop mental flexibility – when you really look at all the different ways people comprehend the same mysteries, and the fact that they generally manage to survive regardless of what they believe, you start to see the limitations of whatever dogma or doxy you follow, a revelation that will transfer quite a bit into the non-religious parts of your life.

, This in turn will help expand both how you look at problems and the breadth of possible solutions you can come up with.

, Try reading something you’d never have touched otherwise – if you read literary fiction, try a mystery or science fiction novel; if you read a lot of hard-boiled detective novels, try a romance; and so on. Pay attention not only to the story but to the particular problems the author has to deal with. For instance, how does the fantasy author bypass your normal skepticism about magic and pull you into their story? Try to connect those problems to problems you face in your own field. For example, how might your marketing team overcome your audiences normal reticence about a new “miracle” product?

, Though it may feel foolish (and getting comfortable with feeling foolish might be another way to think outside the box), try writing a poem about the problem you’re working on. Your poem doesn’t necessarily have to propose a solution – the idea is to shift your thinking away from your brain’s logic centers and into a more creative part of the brain, where it can be mulled over in a non-rational way. Remember, nobody has to ever see your poem…

, Also, visualizing a problem engages other modes of thinking that we don’t normally use, bringing you another creative boost.

, The brain has a bunch of pattern-making habits that often obscure other, more subtle patterns at work; changing the orientation of things can hide the more obvious patterns and make other patterns emerge. For example, you might ask what a problem would look like if the least important outcome were the most important, and how you’d then try to solve it.

, This is the key to backwards planning, for example, where you start with a goal and think back through the steps needed to reach it until you get to where you are right now.

, Don’t buy into the notion that children are inherently ore creative before society “ruins” them, but children can think and speak with an ignorance of convention that is often helpful. Ask a child how they might tackle a problem, or if you don’t have a child around think about how you might reformulate a problem so that a child could understand it if one was available. Don’t run out and build a boat made out of cookies because a child told you to, though – the idea isn’t to do what the child says, necessarily, but to jog your own thinking into a more unconventional path.

, Pollock exercises a great deal of control over his brushes and paddles, in the service of capturing the stray drips and splashes of paint that make up his work. Embracing mistakes and incorporating them into your projects, developing strategies that allow for random input, working amid chaotic juxtapositions of sound and form – all of these can help to move beyond everyday patterns of thinking into the sublime.

, Who knows why? Maybe it’s because your mind is on other things, maybe it’s because you’re naked, maybe it’s the warm water relaxing you – it’s a mystery. But a lot of people swear by it. So maybe when the status quo response to some circumstance just isn’t working, try taking a shower and see if something remarkable doesn’t occur to you!

Choose careers/professions that suit your personality and traits.,
Realize that you have an eye for detail.,
Be proud of the fact that your are reflective and think before you speak or act.,
Take advantage of your excellent listening skills.,
Deal with people one-on-one where possible.,
Play up your preference for writing as opposed to talking.,
Try to be more assertive.,
Practice speaking in front of others.,
Make the best of your ability to write well.,
Make your opinion known, one way or the other.,
Prepare for any meetings, presentations or discussions in all possible ways.,
Push yourself to be more sociable.",How to Thrive in an Extrovert World As an Introvert," Take pride in the strengths that come with being an introvert and leverage them in order to find a career path that suits you.


Scientists, writers (technical and content writing), programmers, researchers, auditors, accountants, translator, lab technician etc. These are some of the jobs that match the personality of an introvert.
They offer autonomy, require people who have a keen eye for detail, and don't necessitate too much interaction with colleagues.;
, Introverts tend to bury themselves into whatever it is they're working on and dig deep for facts, details and information. You can put your heart and soul into everything you undertake - be it a simple school level assignment or a crucial project.


Even the minutest details matter to you, so you are able to see things that other people would overlook. This gives you ownership over those points, aspects and ideas which others have no access to.
You are able to think outside of the box to deliver unique and customized solutions, products and services. This trait is crucial in professions such as auditor, accountant, researchers, scientists.

, You are not in the habit of thinking aloud or saying/doing something just for the sake of it. When you say something you mean it, so it's no wonder that people take you seriously.


You are a taskmaster. You are capable of commanding respect. So you come across as firm, decisive, unwavering, as one who weighs all pros and cons, not impulsive. You just don’t say something-you come thoroughly prepared and what you say is completely backed by facts.
As a result, people take you and what you say seriously. Therefore you are the ideal mediator or arbitrator. You are the Mr. or Mrs. Reliable of your organization/department

, You prefer to use your ears more than your mouth. Your preferred method of communicating is to spend more time listening to your inner thoughts and to others rather than talking or participating in discussions with others.


Good listening skills are one of the prerequisites for maintaining harmony, good relations and managing crisis both in our professional and personal lives.
Good listening skills lay the foundation for nurturing relationships. Especially in the corporate world, this trait is essential to succeed in professions such as sales, customer service, counselling.
Since you are so good at listening, you can easily absorb what others are saying - their ideas, views, suggestions - and incorporate them to suit the needs and requirements of everybody involved.

, Introverts find it easier to show their extrovert side when engaged with a single person instead of a group of people at the same time. This can be to your advantage.


For example, you could strike up a rapport with a client or customer for a particular project. Instead of interacting with multiple people on the same project, you can focus on the one person. Since you are a good listener and very detail oriented, it is easy for you to strike a chord with a single person.
With your kind of personality it is easy for you to understand his needs and requirements and be proactive in offering him the best products, services and solutions. This can make you a success with clients and customers.

, Another preferred method of communication for introverts is writing rather than talking.


Introverts can articulate and express themselves wonderfully through writing. But, if they are expected to deliver the same content through oral communication, they become very uncomfortable and withdraw.
Your reflective, introspective and contemplative nature enables you to innovative and create. However, this ability to innovate and invent comes out best through your writing, so use this to your advantage by choosing a job that requires use of the written word.

, You put in lot of hard work, you you have the facts and the content, but if you do not know the proper way to convey the message then you can lose out to others. Or somebody else who is a good talker might take the credit for your hard work, which can be extremely frustrating.


Therefore, it's important that you learn how to speak up for yourself and that you do not hesitate to speak wherever and whenever necessary about what you can do, what you have done, your strengths, capabilities.
You may prefer to work behind the scenes silently, but it is equally important for you to take center stage from time to time if you wish to make your mark. If you are unwilling to be assertive, remember that there are scores of other people out there who are prepared to walk all over you in order to move up the ladder.

, You can prepare and practice what you would like to speak, but also remember to practice how you would like to say what you intend to say. Practice the right pace, intonation and pitch to deliver the message.


Being an introvert, you would probably find interrupting somebody rude and would prefer not to do it yourself. But, keep in mind that extroverts or the good talkers are usually good at interrupting/interjecting the speakers, when somebody interrupts your mind goes blank, you feel like escaping from that place with all the eyes fixed on you and you not knowing how to and what to respond.
Such incidents send jitters or scare you or make you retreat into oblivion. So, practice how you would face them, what you would say in such case, how you would respond, how you would tackle it …because introverts are usually not extemporaneous speakers and need time to prepare. So it really helps to be prepared to speak up.
For example, when somebody interrupts you you can politely but firmly ask them to wait till you finish, or that you have allotted time for questions at the end of your presentation and so their question has to wait.

, Since introverts are better at writing than talking, you can use this characteristic to sell yourself, showcase your work and project and yourself as a capable worker.


Since you feel more comfortable communicating in writing than talking, produce effective e-mails to strike the right chord and to convey your message in the most effective manner. You can develop the skill to communicate in writing as if talking to them.
Since you have excellent attention to detail, are focused and strive for perfection, you can also be an extremely good choice for writing important documents such as proposals and business plans.
You can also showcase your work using professional networks such as LinkedIn as well as social websites such as Facebook and Twitter.

, Introverts often find it somewhat discomforting and disconcerting to be vocal in meetings, brainstorming sessions and discussions. This can put them and their careers at risk. To mitigate the risk, introverts should use their writing skills.


For example, after the meeting, brainstorming session or whatever it is you could send out an e-mail stating your observations on the particular topic, your views and suggestions, or any other data to substantiate your position. What's effective about this is that everything you say can be substantiated by evidence, research and deliberations, which creates a good impression
Additionally, putting your thoughts in writing saves you from having to do the talking. So, the question of getting confused, going blank, or experiencing discomfort due to the presence of a lot of people can be avoided.
Also, if you need to commend a subordinate for his or her good work and are at loss for words, you could use the power of writing. However, keep in mind that the technique works best when writing is used in combination with a certain amount of face-to-face communication.

, Prepare not just in terms of what the content would be, but also on how you plan on delivering the content in terms of the pace, pitch and tone.


Think about the possible questions you could be posed and how you would respond to those questions, how you would respond when somebody interrupts your speech/presentation, how you plan to break the ice in the room, the best strategies to attract the attention of the participants and what strategies to adopt to lighten the atmosphere in the room.
Dealing with too many people at the same time and too much conversation can be exhausting for an introvert, particularly if you are unprepared. Therefore, it's important to practice in order to strengthen any weak areas. By repeatedly doing this you will get used to handling meetings, presentations, questions with confidence and assertiveness over time.

, You do not have to try to change your personality entirely or become an extrovert, but sometimes you need to tweak your personality a little to suit the occasion. Make it a point to attend events - it is important for you to be seen in social and office circuits.


However, try to arrange social events so that they don't make you feel too uncomfortable. Just because you go to an event doesn't mean you have to be there from beginning to end. Arrive on time, say your hellos, talk to some ‘must meet’ important people and leave.
Or, instead of scheduling meetings over lunch or dinner which can take longer and be more stressful, you could arrange to meet over coffee.
Before you attend a social event, prepare some conversation starters in your mind. Prepare specific topics depending on who you will be talking to - you boss, you employee, a man, a woman, a client, etc.

Enjoy the journey.,
Take pride in setting reasonable goals.,
Appreciate your ability to learn from mistakes.,
Be proud of your ability to bounce back.",How to Take Pride in Being a Perfectionist1," Perfectionists have a tendency to fixate on the results of a task, instead of appreciating the process itself. If you are practicing healthy striving, you will enjoy the task you are working on, regardless of the outcome. Try to enjoy the moment and take pride in the work that you do.For example, in healthy striving you will have a good time working on a school project and not just be fixated on the final grade. This can actually help you do better work, as you will be focused on the actual project itself and not the final outcome.;
, Be happy about your ability to set realistic goals and objectives. You can still take pride in reaching these goals because you achieved something. You know your abilities and try to work with them. Instead of setting yourself up for failure, you create and meet the practical expectations you set for yourself.For example, you set a goal to run three miles, instead of five, because you know that five is an unrealistic objective for your current physical shape.
Setting high goals can set you up for failure, which can hurt your self-esteem in the long run. It's OK to set smaller goals for yourself so that you can attain them.

, Instead of viewing failure as something that should be avoided at all costs, you understand it as something that you can learn from. Be proud of your ability to take a positive away from something that is considered a negative. It is important that you understand that you are human and that mistakes are part the experience.For example, instead of viewing a bad grade as a major failure, look at it as an opportunity to improve your knowledge of a certain subject.
Remember that you may fail a few times before learning something new. For example, if you're learning how to cook, you may burn things a few times, but you will soon improve.

, As a healthy striver, you are a resilient person who takes adversity in stride. Instead of being bogged down by mistakes, you use them to your own advantage and learn from them. You refuse to let your fears and anxieties limit your ability to perform and create.For example, you get work completed on time and avoid procrastinating because you are not paralyzed by a fear of failure.

Appreciate your positive traits.,
Understand your imperfections.,
Try to be vulnerable.,
Repeat your affirmations.",How to Take Pride in Being a Perfectionist2," Celebrate the fact that your perfectionism can make you punctual, goal-oriented and high-achieving.You are someone who can be counted on to finish a project on time and perform to the best of your ability. You push others to do their best and expect the same from yourself. It is okay to be proud of your positive traits.Be sure to discuss these self-affirmations with a counselor or therapist. It is important that you address your own self-worth and are not simply reaffirming problematic emotions and traits.

, Take the time to investigate and try to accept your imperfections. It is important to understand how your drive for perfection impacts those around you. Recognize that your perfectionism might be less about excellence and more about dealing with intense social pressure and shame.If you are able to address your imperfections, you may find that you are generally less anxious and more happy.
It may be difficult to acknowledge your imperfections on your own. A licensed therapist or counselor may help you practice self-reflection.

, Perfectionism can be a shield that you hide behind in order to avoid being vulnerable. Because of an intense fear of social criticism or rejection, it may feel safer to put up a front of perfection. However, this can lead you to feeling isolated and foster intense anxiety. Instead, try to be authentic and acknowledge the times when you are struggling with your perfectionism. Be vulnerable and let those around you know that you are having a hard time and need some help.Authenticity and vulnerability are practices that you need to exercise every day in order to manage your perfectionism.
Remember that self-acceptance means coming to terms with both the good and the bad. It is fine to acknowledge that you have faults as long as you do not obsess over them.

, As a part of your practice of self-acceptance, focus on your positive attributes every day. Repeat them to yourself every morning or when you have feelings of self-doubt and shame. You might also consider writing them down on a list that you carry around with you during the day. If you begin to feel bad about yourself, look at your list and think about your positive traits.Remember that perfectionism can be a maladaptive personality trait and that it often masks deeper emotional issues. Make sure that you are practicing self-acceptance and not simply reaffirming problematic traits.
Consult with a therapist or psychologist about any feelings or shame or self-doubt related to your perfectionism.

Seek help.,
Practice mindfulness.,
Make a list of the advantages and disadvantages of being perfect.,
Be realistic about your abilities.,
Learn how to deal with criticism.,
Be selective in your perfectionism.",How to Take Pride in Being a Perfectionist3," If your perfectionism is hurting you and those around you, you should seek help as soon as possible. A licensed counselor or therapist may help you understand the underlying emotions spurring your perfectionism. They may also suggest some strategies for helping you manage it.

, When perfectionist thoughts enter your mind, try to recognize and challenge those thoughts. Take time to reflect on your feelings and the impulses they inspire. Try meditating to become more mindful and aware of your perfectionism.When you start having perfectionist thoughts, ask yourself questions like “am I jumping to conclusions?” or “is this as bad as it seems?’

, In order to begin addressing your perfectionism, your counselor or therapist may suggest that you create a list of the positives and negatives of being a perfectionist. You may find that the negatives of perfectionism – anxiety, damaged relationships, substance abuse – outweigh the positives. Creating a list may help you gain some perspective and insight on the impact of your perfectionism.You may also want to consider how your actions impact others.

, Look at the areas of your life where you experience intense perfectionism and try to set more realistic goals. Setting objectives that you can meet will help limit any negative emotions you might experience from failing to meet your unrealistic expectations. Whenever you begin something, ask yourself if you have created impossible expectations for yourself. Achieving reasonable goals will help you feel better about yourself and negate any negative emotions.For example, you may set a goal of running five miles and only complete four miles. As a perfectionist, you may feel disappointed about your performance and anxious about improving it. Instead, tell yourself that four miles is good enough for now and accept that you might not be able to run five miles.
Remember that depending on others isn't a weakness. Learn to work with others, and allow them to help you when you need it.

, Instead of viewing criticism as personal attack, think of it as an opportunity to learn and grow. Understand that mistakes are a natural thing and that you have a right to make them. If you try to distance your fear of failure from your feelings of self-worth, you may find that you are less angry and defensive.When you make a mistake, try to think of things that your learned or could learn from it.

, Try to limit the spaces in which you apply your perfectionism. Work and school are natural places to push yourself and try to achieve excellence. However, the same is not true of your personal relationships or events beyond your control. Regardless of your actions, these things will never be perfect and you should accept that. Concentrate on applying your perfectionism where it is useful and applicable.Try to think about what it would be like to be less perfectionistic in a certain situation.
Consider why you expect perfection from other people and how that impacts your relationships with them.

Recognize any black-and-white thinking.,
Note if you are highly critical of others.,
Identify a sensitivity to criticism.,
Note if you engage in substance abuse.,
Observe significant procrastination.",How to Take Pride in Being a Perfectionist4," Perfectionists have a tendency to have an “all-or-nothing” mindset in which they view themselves as either successes or failures. There is no middle ground between the two, which can lead to extreme emotional swings. This can push you to achieve your goals, but also result in intense depression and frustration if they are not met.Because of this all-or-nothing mentality, people suffering from extreme versions of perfectionism are more likely to be displeased with their bodies and develop eating disorders., Because you have such high expectations of yourself, you tend to project those same expectations onto other people. This can lead you to be overly critical of others and denigrate them. Because of this, you may find yourself unable to work with others and socially isolated. This can lead to severe loneliness and depression.This may also make you highly critical of romantic partners, making intimate relationships difficult to maintain.
Because of this critical outlook, you may also find yourself taking pleasure in the failings of others.
Try to catch yourself if you find yourself judging people, even if the person you are judging is yourself. Keep track of these moments throughout the day so that you can stop this thinking in the future.

, Most people do not appreciate criticism. However, perfectionists have a particularly strong reaction to it. Because doing well is tied so closely with a perfectionist’s sense of self-worth, you may have a tendency to be extremely sensitive to most forms of reproach or criticism. If you become extremely angry or depressed when you receive even minor criticism, your perfectionism may be more problematic.If you find yourself having regular and strong reactions to criticism, consider visiting a therapist or counselor.

, Because the anxieties of perfectionism can be overwhelming, you may find yourself abusing drugs and alcohol to numb those feelings. Substance abuse is a common symptom of maladaptive perfectionism. If you believe that you have a substance abuse problem, talk to a counselor or therapist.Remember that substance abuse can lead to addiction.

, One of the most common traits of more severe – or maladaptive – perfectionism is an irrational tendency to delay or avoid completing tasks. This might seem counterintuitive, but an intense fear of failure, which is a common trait associated with perfectionism, can prevent you from completing tasks. If you find yourself dreading completing projects and waiting until the last minute to complete them, this may signal a more maladaptive response to perfectionism.If you find that your anxiety is so intense that you miss deadlines or fall behind, be sure to talk to a counselor or therapist.

Go with the flow.",How to Stop Trying to Control Others," Sometimes, you might find yourself trying to control others by relying heavily on them to calm you down when you are upset. You might demand that they say or do something and feel that you can calm down only if that action occurs. However, you must not depend on others to provide you with peace; you must find that for yourself. Learn and develop self soothing techniques to better learn to calm yourself.You might do something like stepping away from the situation, journaling, listening to music or taking a hot bath.
Consider developing regular self-calming rituals to help prevent frequent upsets.;
, In addition to learning to calm down, you should also learn how to manage and regulate your emotions. For example, though you might feel very angry or disappointed in your spouse for their poor eating habits, this does not give you cause to lash out, yell, curse, or try to manipulate them into being healthier. Allow them to make their own choices. When your emotions begin to feel out of control, take a moment to re-center yourself so you can respond more logically. Ask for a time out from the situation and consider why you are feeling the way you’re feeling.Don’t try to control anyone with your emotions or guilt someone into doing something for you.

, Your anxiety may be the root of why you try to control others. You might feel jittery, nervous, or extremely worried for instance that your coworker will not complete their portion of a project on time. You should work to regulate and monitor this anxiety and work on what you can control and do own your own.Exercise has been proven to ease anxiety.
Talking on the phone to someone you trust is helpful as well.
Breathe deeply when you are having an anxious moment and then release it all slowly.
Sometimes, people’s behaviors are harmful to you and your anxiety arises from that harm rather than a need to control. Stay away from people who make you tense or hurt you.

, Though you may feel the need to control another person when they are going against your wishes, you must recognize that you cannot and should not do so. However, you can modify and control the situation or environment that you are in so that you can feel more comfortable without stripping another person of their autonomy or free will. If you feel overwhelmed or are on the verge of lashing out, remove yourself from the situation.For instance, if your mom won’t go with you to a movie, don’t try to force her. Reach out to friends or other family instead or reschedule with your mom.
Step outside for a few moments or take a walk and do some deep breathing.
Take a shower or a bath.
Do what you can personally to make things better.

, When you are beginning to feel the need to control someone, another way to counteract that is by distracting yourself. Don’t allow yourself to become obsessive over another person’s actions; take a moment to get the thought out of your head by replacing it with something that requires your attention.You might watch a few funny clips on YouTube or a funny TV show.
Do a puzzle or play a relaxing game on your phone.

, You may feel that your need to control runs deep or stems from some childhood issues or trauma that you faced. You may have developed your need to control as a coping mechanism. However, you must realize that your controlling behavior can be harmful to you and others. Therapy can be a great way to work through these issues constructively and get at the cause of them., Beyond controlling your own emotions, you must begin the process of letting go of your control of others. Remember that just as you do not want to be controlled or manipulated, others do not want that either. If you have to force someone to do something, then realize that it is not out of genuine love or respect, but likely arising out of fear or frustration.Ask people to do things for you rather than requiring them to.
You might say, for instance, “Hey, I’d really appreciate it if you didn’t leave your dirty clothes on the floor anymore. I like to keep the floor clean.”

, Though you cannot control others, know that you can always control yourself. Beyond your emotions, you can also control your actions. For instance, if you want someone to make you dinner and try to force them to do so, remember that instead you can buy or make your own dinner.Rely on those you trust but do not negate or override your own independence out of laziness or a desire to control.
When in doubt, try spending some quality time by yourself until you can recenter.

, Your control issues might center around a particular person in your life who is overstepping some personal boundaries that you have. Communicate these boundaries to others, but do not threaten them with ultimatums. Determine what behaviors you can handle and what you cannot.For instance, if you are dating someone who sometimes insults you, tell them that that is unacceptable to you, but don’t try to force them to be kind. Leave any relationship or friendship that is more hurtful than uplifting.
You might say something like “Sometimes, I feel insulted by you, especially when you call me names. I would appreciate it if you didn’t do that anymore.”

, Often times, your control issues might have developed out of issues from your childhood. Perhaps your mother expected perfection from you or your father yelled or belittled you when you made a mistake. Take some time to reflect on your childhood and the things that happened to you to make you who you are today. When you recognize the root, you can develop solutions.Talk to your siblings if you feel comfortable.
Talk to long-standing friends who knew you in your childhood.

, Whenever you begin to feel the need to control someone, take a moment to be honest with yourself about whether or not you are being controlling or being reasonable. However, if you have to ask the question, then you are likely being controlling. Take responsibility in those moments and apologize to the person and give them the space to make their own choices.For instance, perhaps you are upset that your friend did not call you back when they said they would and now you are calling them repeatedly. Forcing them to speak to you when they might be busy is controlling. Allow them to call you back when they are ready to talk.

, Sometimes your need for control might manifest into you begging someone to do or say something. However, in these moments, others might lose respect for you. You should never resort to pleading to get a desired result; merely ask instead. If that does not work, then you should drop the issue until a later time when both you and the other party has had more time to think.

, Sometimes your controlling behavior might be so pervasive that you hardly notice it. It may have become a normal element of your day to day behavior. You should, however, listen to others when they say that they feel controlled by you, especially if more than one person is saying it.Ask them how they feel they are being controlled and cease your controlling behavior immediately.
Work on your language. For example, ask ""Would you consider cooking dinner for me once a week? It would mean a lot to me.""

, The person you are attempting to control likely has several good qualities that you like about them. Rather than trying to control them to be someone that they’re not, reflect on their positive attributes. This will allow you to view them more graciously and lovingly and will perhaps snap you out of your controlling mood.Write down a list of why you like them. This could include things like being intellectual, kind, or funny.
Compare the positive list with the things that bother you. How does it stack up?

, In the current situation that you’re in where you are seeking control, you are probably thinking very selfishly. You have likely not thought much about how the other person feels in the situation. Show them compassion and empathy by seeking to understand their feelings and respecting their decisions.For instance, maybe you want a coworker to go to lunch with you but they refuse. Rather than forcing them, accept their ‘no’. They might be having some financial issues or wish to be alone.

, In any relationship, whether romantic, friendly or professional, you should work to move past controlling or tolerating others and into accepting them as they are. Do not try to change anyone, argue with them about their beliefs, or force your thoughts onto them. They have developed their character and opinions over the course of years and through dealing with a multitude of experiences, experiences that you may be unaware of.Perhaps you meet a coworker who is anti-abortion, but you are pro-choice. That same coworker may have had an abortion that has rendered her unable to have children, so don’t judge her for beliefs she formed from experiences that you have not had.
Say to them “Though I don’t necessarily agree with you, I can understand your perspective and I respect your ideas.”

, You might know people who you get along with very well but run into others with whom you are not so lucky. Your need to control might only be triggered among those who you feel oppose you in some way. However, don’t compare these people to your more easygoing friends. People are all different and you should respect these differences.Remember that everyone is different and prone to making differing choices.

, At the end of the day, if you don’t release some of your control over people and situations, you will be more often miserable than happy. Go with the flow more. Be spontaneous. Say yes to last minute plans. Let go of the need to always be right. Agree to disagree. Life is too short to try to make anyone do anything. Focus on your own happiness and be free!"

Get help.",How to Tell if You Are a People Pleaser," A key characteristic of people-pleasers is being a pushover of sorts. You might say “yes” to virtually any favor asked by friends, family, or co-workers. Your tendency to do for others might cause you to feel taken advantage of. In some cases, friends and family are merely pleased that you are so willing to help out. In other cases, people may purposely exploit your kindness.For instance, a co-worker asks you to help her finish her reports and you are happy to oblige. The next time, she asks if you can do it because she must leave work early that day. Over time, you do the reports more and more until it becomes “your” task, not hers.;
, Due to your penchant for holding back your own needs while overly meeting the demands of those around you, you start to feel resentful. People-pleasers commonly work themselves tirelessly for others, but then end up getting angry or passive-aggressive when those kind acts are never reciprocated.Your spouse asks you to pick up the dry-cleaning; you say “sure.” Your sister asks you to babysit her kids; you say “Of course.” Afterwards, you speak sarcastically about having to be a superhero in your family. You pretend to be just joking, but you’re really not.

, If you are a people-pleaser, you probably feel guilt regularly. Deep down inside, a part of you knows that you don’t really want to stay late after work as requested by your boss, or attend your partner’s office Christmas party. But, you say “yes” anyway then inwardly beat yourself up for having these feelings at all.


Guilt might manifest as telling yourself that you are a bad parent, spouse, family member, or employee when you aren’t happy to fulfill the demands of others. You “should” want to help out, you tell yourself. You may also feel guilt about neglecting your own true desires to please others., Pretending to want to do things that you don’t comes with a price: stress, anxiety, and/or depression. In a sense, the habit of people-pleasing requires persistent lying to yourself. You pretend that you don’t have needs. Your pretend that you want to do this or that favor. As a result, you end up increasing the stress hormones in your body and compromising your health.Stress may show up as the following symptoms: headaches, fatigue, sleep disturbances, irritability, sadness, withdrawal from social connections; restlessness, and drug and alcohol use among others.If chronic stress is left untreated, it can develop into more serious conditions like anxiety or depression.

, Fear of rejection is at the core of people-pleasing. And, most commonly, people who engage in this habit developed it during their childhood. In response to your parents’ desires in your early years, you may have built patterns of relating that required putting others’ wishes ahead of your own. Thinking that this was the only way to feel accepted and loved, this behavior carried over to other relationships in your life.For instance, your mother asks you to practice dance and you refused. As a result, she didn’t speak to you for several days. You finally gave in and took up dance. Now, many years later, you are working in the career she chose for you and are dating the person she likes best.

, A primary indicator of people-pleasing is making the requests and needs of those around you a priority. While there's nothing wrong with being there for your parents, your partner, your kids, your friends, and your boss, it becomes a problem if you are not seeing after your own health and well-being.


Have you abandoned many of your previous goals, hobbies, or interests in order to clear up your schedule to do more for others? This neglect of self is one of the main reasons people-pleasers feel guilt and resentment. You probably know that you should attend to your own needs, but you don’t know how.For example, you had a nice spa day planned for yourself, but then you heard that a friend was going through a tough time. So, you forward your gift certificate to the spa to her instead. This is a clear sign of neglecting yourself for others.

, Because you fear being rejected by those around you, you strive to minimize conflict at all costs. Early on, you came to believe that saying “no” or stating a difference of opinion was divisive, so you refrain from doing so. You are desperate to keep your relationships intact, even at the cost of keeping your mouth shut on issues that are important to you.For instance, you might not eat Thai food, but all your friends want to try this new Thai restaurant. You do not share your preference and go along. You tell your friends you are not hungry at the restaurant to not make them worry. You're secretly starving, but you don't want to make a fuss.

, Thinking that you “owe” others or believing that it’s selfish to listen to your own inner desires can be detrimental. Years of people-pleasing may lead you to forget that you have any rights as a person. When and if you do speak out or express your desires, negative consequences occur. So, you stay silent and accept maltreatment, even abuse.Fearing rejection and abandonment can cause people pleasers to remain in unhealthy relationships far longer than they should. Consider that your girlfriend flakes on plans at the last minute, insults you in front of others, and spends her money and your money on lavish gifts. You might dislike this treatment, but worry that if you speak up, she will leave.

, When you learn to accept yourself you remove the burden of needing someone else to accept you. The key to overcoming the negative habit of people-pleasing is to develop your own self-worth. When you feel good about yourself you are less likely to seek validation from others.


Repeat a mantra such as “I am at peace with who I am. I do not require others to accept me for me to accept myself.” Other ways to practice self-love include making a list of your positive traits and posting them on a mirror or in the visor of your car. Read them aloud when you need a lift.
In addition, challenge yourself to practice self-care regularly. Select 2 to 3 things you can do for yourself each day that you enjoy. These may include eating a healthy meal, getting some exercise, taking a relaxing bath, going for a walk outdoors, or listening to your favorite musician., Never forget that. If a friend or family member makes a request, it is entirely up to you to acquiesce. Sometimes, people-pleasers fall into the frame of thinking that they are powerless. Reclaim your power and start declining favors that you don’t want to do.


To help you learn how and when to say “no,” think about your priorities in life. If family, health, and financial stability are most important to you, you might decline requests if they do not align with your priorities.
Say “no” with your head held high and don’t provide an excessive excuse or explanation . Simply say “No, thank you” or “I don’t have time in my schedule.” Remember, you are putting your time and energy where it counts when you say “no”—back into your own health, interests, and goals.If it helps, makes it a policy. Your “no” can seem less about the person if you tailor it to a limit you have previously set. For instance, you might say “No, I have a personal rule about never lending large sums of money to family or friends.”, Your personal boundaries have been left at the door when you give in to people-pleasing behaviors. Spend some time thinking about the ways you felt violated or used by people in your life. These situations could have occurred on purpose or inadvertently. Then, work to set new limits so that you are able to have healthy, full relationships without being a doormat.


Write down these situations, what happened and who was involved. Then, use these boundary violations to help you redefine limits in your relationships
For instance, perhaps a friend asked you for a favor at the last minute which left you feeling stressed and overwhelmed. You could set a personal limit that, if others need your help, they need to give you advanced notice. Come up with other limits relating to other situations that you don’t want to happen again., Sometimes, no matter how firm your personal boundaries, people will try to cross them. In fact, some people seem to have a knack for sniffing out people-pleasers and exploiting them. If you have friends or loved one who make it their business to use your kindness for their gain and consistently push your limits, get some distance.Slowly stop answering the calls or emails of old friends who abuse your kind-hearted nature. You don’t have to supply an explanation, just stop responding.
If this person is closer to you, minimize the amount of time you spend with them. You can even let them know why by saying, “I love you, Rita, but I have difficulty maintaining my personal boundaries with you. I need some space.”

, Being a people-pleaser is a deeply ingrained behavioral style that can be challenging to overcome. If you are having difficulty asserting yourself and constantly feel stressed by your relationships, see a professional. A mental health therapist can help you find the cause for this behavior and learn effective skills to start living a healthy emotional life.


Research mental health therapists in your area. Either call ahead or arrange to meet in-person to talk to them about the way the do therapy and if they have experience treating people like you. Choose your therapist based on which one has experience with your issue and with whom you feel most comfortable.

Read up to understand your type.,
Understand that you tend more towards introversion over extroversion.,
Embrace that you prefer sensing to intuition.,
Understand that you prefer thinking to feeling.,
Embrace your preference of perception over judgement.,
Learn to use it to your advantage.",How to Understand ISTPs and Embrace Your Own Inner ISTP Personality," ISTP stands for a type that is characterized by introversion, sensing, thinking, and perception. Each characteristic roughly correlates to a different way in which a person relates to the world. Next we'll explore each characteristic individually and what each means for you.;
, People who tend towards introversion tend to be quiet and reserved. Also, introverts generally prefer to interact with a few close friends rather than a wide range of acquaintances and energy is expended in social situations, rather than gained as with extroverts.


Insights to help understand this: social engagement is exhausting for introverts and they can only handle it for shorts periods, and infrequently. Introverts are not marathon partiers and will not feel up to socializing every night of the week, and when socializing, it must last only a few hours maximum for exhaustion to be avoided.
Introverts have to take frequent breaks from social activity in order to recharge, not because they had a bad time or dislike people; they are just drained and need to retreat for a while.
Also, introverts will be overwhelmed by large numbers of people and thrive best/ feel most comfortable when in small intimate groups, less than ten people in size.
To embrace your inner introvert, you must accept your weaknesses as normal variations on human personality and play to your strengths to feel comfortable, fulfilled and socially adept.
To thrive and live comfortably, avoid large parties, they'll make you feel awkward. Opt instead for small group gatherings where you'll feel right at home. Also, try to limit the length of gatherings by making your feelings clear with those involved, you don't hate them, you just need rest.
Try centering gatherings around time limited activities like a movie or dinner. Understanding that you're simply introverted and not ""awkward"" or socially disinclined will help you to feel adequate in life.

, A sensing person tends to be more concrete in thinking than abstract. Sensing people focus more on details than the big picture and worry more about immediate realities than future possibilities. Understanding a sensing person means knowing that they are grounded more in the current, immediate reality. They are better at reacting in the moment in realtime rather than conjecturing, philosophizing or theorizing about the future.


Embracing this means that as a sensing person, you'll feel most comfortable in jobs and situations that provide immediate feedback and not conjecture.
In a military application for example, a sensing personality would feel most comfortable in a role on the ground where decisions are made right away based on incoming data, not as a politician planning for future campaigns or speculating about international relations.

, A thinking person tends to prefer to rely more on objective criteria than personal values. They give more weight to logic than to social considerations.


This type of person would fit in well as a logistical planner, thinking outside of convention to achieve more efficiency. Thinking people value things that are objectively superior, not just personally preferred. Understanding thinking people means that they do not reach their conclusions frivolously and will continue to reassess for further correctness based on logical criteria.
Embracing this means realizing that you have a gift for making effective, rational decisions based on real, proven realities rather than opinion or preference.

, Perceiving types tend to withhold judgement and keep options open in consideration of possibly changing circumstances. This type of person will not rush to get things settled and will desire to make an up to date decision.


Understanding this means knowing that this person may appear to be postponing a decision, while they're actually gathering lots of data.
Embracing this means learning to live with slow, unrushed but ultimately more accurate decisions.

, ISTP people fit in well in professions such as engineering. They appear to have a detached nature but are known for radically creative insight and unexpected wit. ISTP's think outside the box and are often closet daredevils, seeking stimulation. ISTP's can be very libertarian, thriving in a ""don't tread on me"" lifestyle.

Learn assertiveness.,
Strive to adapt to change.,
Own your own mistakes.,
Offer constructive criticism instead.",How to Stop Complaining1," Many people complain as a passive-aggressive tactic when they don’t know how to ask for what they want. You might complain about doing certain activities or favors simply because you do not know how to say “no.” The first step in becoming more assertive is getting in touch with your own needs/wants and then being able to say no to things that do not align with them.Start small with assertiveness. Express how you feel about an invitation that you need to decline, such as “Thanks for the invite to the birthday party, but I won’t be able to attend.” Use similar tactics for bigger issues as they come up.
Guilt also plays a huge role in not being able to say no, let go of the guilt because in all reality it would be impossible to say yes to every invitation or to every project someone asks you to help with. You have just as much right as anyone else does to decide what things you can do and what things you cannot. An honest reply should not come with guilt on your part.;
, While change may be uncomfortable at times, it is important to understand that change is a constant part of life.Anxiety can play a role in not wanting to deal with change, but learning to recognize those feelings as being natural and also temporary can help in working past them. Be willing to ask for clarification if you need to about to how things are going to change and request support as needed.
If you do need to speak up about an issue relating to some sort of change, find positive ways to assert yourself instead of complaining. Offer solutions or suggestions for changes instead of pointing out the worst in the situation.

, Accept responsibility for your part in the way things are. Complaining can stem from not being ready to take ownership of your own role in either the problem or the solution.If you are unhappy in your current environment, own your part in getting to where you are. This can be done by acknowledging your role just as you acknowledge others. Also realize you are the only person with the power and responsibility to improve any aspect of your life if you are unhappy with it.

, Unlike complaining, constructive criticism offers solutions or information to help the problem-solving process instead of just pointing out the negative in the situation. Constructive criticism generally does not contain the negative undertones or blame that complaining or nagging does. It is simply a way to stand up for yourself in naming and then fixing the problem.For example, if you have become frustrated at work by the way a co-worker performs a certain task you could complain about it by telling the co-worker their work is poor or making a big deal about having to re-do whatever project .
Or, you could say “Hi, Joey, your last project could use some improvements. Is there any additional training you require to get up to par on ? What can we do to make sure the project is getting done correctly the first time?”

"
"
Practice gratitude.,
Stop judging others—and yourself.,
Look for the lesson in unfortunate situations.,
Recognize that the world is imperfect.",How to Stop Complaining2," Avoid getting stuck in the rut of complaining about things you take for granted. Take time each day to point out a few things that you are happy about in your life.It may seem like everyone naturally complains about returning to work on Monday morning. Instead, learn to value having a job to go to each week. Not everyone is able to work or, if they are, they may be unable to find work that meets their financial needs. Complaining about work just makes the job seem even worse than it really is and more of a burden than it needs to be.
Complaining about family often again seems like something everyone does. It may seem natural to complain about your teenager, but be grateful you are able to meet your family’s basic needs so your biggest worry is how busy they keep you running from event to event.

, Complaining not only judges others harshly but it also often sets you up to be your own worst critic. Sometimes, people judge others merely because their way is different.Learn the difference between someone doing something different than your preferred way and doing something “wrong.” Someone may take a different route to get things done. But, if the outcome still meets the goal, that’s all that matters.
Appreciate the value of diversity instead of focusing on differences. You may find yourself actually growing and learning from those who are different from you, if you open yourself up to different views of things around you.

, Focus on the here and now, and forgive so you can learn from what has happened instead of getting stuck in the fallout from the bad event.

Give yourself time to vent, get angry or feel however you need to in the moment. Then let those feelings go and free yourself to move forward. It is a mistake to feel the need to hide feelings because you never get to deal with them and then move on.
Know that each mistake is a chance to change how you act in the future, and this is a huge part of learning. Think of all the things you have learned in the past just by encountering and gaining knowledge after a mistake.

, Allow yourself to be imperfect and recognize the fact that those around you also will be imperfect at times. No matter how well-prepared you are for any life event, things may not go the way you expect or plan. Being prepared for this may lead you to become more flexible to find solutions in the moment instead of being overwhelmed by something going wrong.With major events like a wedding, birthday or even school activities you can often put undue pressure on yourself and others to make everything perfect. Learn to focus on the most important things and recognize many small details would go unnoticed by the average person.

Learn mindfulness.,
Exercise to boost your mood.,
Practice relaxation techniques to alleviate negative feelings.,
Keep moving forward.",How to Stop Complaining3," Mindfulness uses concentration and acceptance to maintain presence in the moment.Mindfulness is a great way to overcome complaining because it allows you to accept the present moment and all that comes with it.


Practice mindfulness by sitting quietly in a comfortable chair or on a cushion. Breathe deeply—in through your nose and out through your mouth. Focus on your breath, clearing your mind of all other thoughts. When you notice your mind wandering, simply bring your attention back to your breath without judgment., Self-care and taking steps to make sure you are in your best physical shape can go a long way in changing your outlook.Instead of complaining, use the extra energy you would waste on the negative to squeeze in a good workout. Use a long walk as a break from stress at home or spend 30 minutes doing cardio to sweat out the frustration you might otherwise complain about.
Using physical activity to give your body a boost also will help with your mood as moving your body releases feel-good chemicals called endorphins. Being in poor health or poor physical fitness can be yet another thing to complain about. Exercise is a constructive way to improve your physical and mental well-being.

, Be mindful of your triggers and which audiences tend to bring out the most complaints, and then work to find ways to relax instead of reacting. Great ways to relax may include deep breathing, meditation, yoga, progressive muscle relaxation, or even going for a nature walk.If you are able to make yourself aware of some of the major triggers you can prepare yourself with positive affirmations or even role play different ways to respond to the triggers. In order for a trigger to work it depends on a knee jerk reaction from you; learn to take away that power by relaxing or otherwise preparing yourself.

, Embrace the opportunity and power to make changes in your day to day life. Each day is a chance to do better than before. Start with small steps to move forward and build on what you have learned from past mistakes.Embrace the chance to experiment and mix things up a bit. Open yourself up to try new things even if you are not sure if they will be successful. Strive to enjoy the experience instead of driving just for success.

Consider your reactions around people.,
Think about your energy levels.,
Look at how you feel about new people.,
Think about your place in the workforce.,
Consider the full spectrum of possibilities.,
Examine your approach to thoughts and feelings.,
Consider your need for privacy.,
Realize that people can learn to go ""against type"" in certain situations.",How to Tell if You Are an Introvert or an Extrovert," How do you act at a party, or around a large group of people?


If you tend to be more of a listener than a talker, you might be an introvert. You would be more of a wallflower than the life of the party.
If you are more talkative, you are likely to be an extrovert. People are drawn to you because you smile more and are comfortable to be around.
Sometimes how you act also depends on how comfortable you are with the people around you.;
, What helps you to get your energy back? How do you mentally or emotionally recharge?


Everyone needs to sleep but some people need time to be alone in order to get their energy back. These people are usually introverts.
Extroverts get their energy from socializing and being around other people.
Basically, most introverts need time to themselves ""internally"" and extroverts need to get everything out ""externally"".

, Do you find that it is easy to trust others you have just met or don't know very well?


Introverts do not trust others as easily as extroverts do and tend to only have a few very good friends, and the rest they consider to be good acquaintances.
Extroverts are usually more trusting and open and consider more people as friends than merely acquaintances.

, Are you (or are you interested in becoming) a teacher, politician, or someone who has constant interaction with other people?


Extroverts are more likely to seek out jobs that fit their personality, so if you have always loved public speaking, you might be an extrovert.
Not all introverts avoid public speaking or jobs that require interactions with others such as acting, politics, or being an attorney. Some introverts learn to act more social, while many others choose to have a less social work place. Some like to have jobs they can do from home or in an office cubicle.

, It's rare for someone to be completely introverted or completely extroverted, just as it's rare for someone to be completely governed by the right or left hemisphere of their brain. An ambivert is a person who is equally extroverted as they are introverted.

, Do you think or feel more?


Introverts are found to have more blood flow in the frontal lobes, and frontal thalamus of the brain, which is used for planning and problem solving.In extroverts, more blood flow goes to the anterior cingulate gyrus, and the temporal lobes, which are used to process sensory and emotional stimulation.Don't generalize others by these traits––not all introverts rely on thinking and not all extroverts rely on feeling.







, When you go into your room or office, do you leave the door open, or close it?


Introverts like their privacy and they are more likely to want to keep doors closed.
Extroverts don't mind leaving their doors open, because they are more interested in socializing than being alone.

,

Do you find yourself trying to speak louder and speak more often with people whom you have just met? Do you act the same way with your close friends, or do you act more introverted and feel more natural? You might be an introvert.
An extrovert may act more introverted if they feel they need to. Sometimes being quiet is polite in certain situations. Do you find that if you are taking a test in school, or finishing up paperwork at your job that you have to strive not to be distracted by social situations around you? Is it easy for you to talk to people but hard for you to stay quiet?

Ask your friends how you can improve.",How to Stop Being Obnoxious," Before you can fix your behavior, you must admit it first. Nobody likes to admit their faults, but by admitting the problem, you're making yourself conscious that ""OK, I have a problem, but I'm going to try my best to fix it"". Admit your mistakes without blaming anybody else, and don't be too hard on yourself. Not only will this help you improve, but it will show an increase in maturity, by accepting your faults.Consider making a list of the things you have done in the past that others have called annoying.
Think on all the ways that you have directly hurt someone’s feelings because of your obnoxious behavior.;
, If from thinking back on your bad behavior you discover that you have behaved in ways that have hurt your friends or family, and you have never apologized for that, you should take the time to do so. Prepare a heartfelt and genuine apology and set aside some time to communicate this to them.Try to talk somewhere quiet and away from others.
If necessary, you can talk to them on the phone, but in person is better.
You can say something like “I wanted to let you know that I have taken some time recently to think about myself. I recognize that I can be really harsh sometimes and that you end up on the receiving end of that. I wanted to say that I’m so sorry and I’m going to work to be a better person.”

, One of the most obnoxious behaviors that a person can exhibit is by being a braggart. Some people feel the need constantly tell others good things about themselves in a showy way because, in reality, they are very self conscious. However, you should make an effort to not toot your own horn very often.There are certain instances when sharing accomplishments is both necessary and important, however. For instance, if you have recently gotten into college, you will want to share that with your friends.
Examples of things to avoid saying are “I have a bigger house that you.” Any compliment to yourself that exists in comparison to others should be avoided.

, Your friends love you and you love your friends, as well. Rather than being mean or aggressive with them, work to actively show them compassion and empathy. If they are having a hard time at home, take them out for ice cream so they can vent. If they are struggling in their classes, see if you can offer any tutoring.Try to think of things more from their perspective instead of thinking only from your own.

, One other obnoxious behavior that is a sure way to frustrate anyone is by acting as if you know everything. Remember that the things that you know are minute and pale in comparison to the wealth of knowledge that is in the world. Not only do you not know everything, but it is impossible for you to. If your friend tells you something and they are not known to be a liar, accept the information and move on.If your friend is particularly knowledgeable about a specific topic, trust that knowledge, especially if you know very little about it.
Avoid arguments with friends over trivial matters.

, The world does not revolve around you, just as it does not revolve around anyone else. Don’t make everything about you, even if you feel that it is. Take a moment to step back from situations and don’t take everything personally., Many people are annoying due to feelings of anxiety or insecurity. Others have a hard time reading social cues and are unaware with others are offended or bored. If you feel that any of these issues speak to you personally, you might want to consider seeking out an expert, like a doctor or a counselor.

, One way to overcome your obnoxious demeanor is by replacing your negative body language with positive ones. A great way to do this is to smile more. Smiling makes people see you as warm, friendly and inviting which is exactly the disposition that you’re looking for if you’re going to change your image.Try to frown less, as well.

, Perhaps, you just have a few obnoxious habits that are annoying to others that you are looking to get rid of. For instance, if you chew your gum loudly or have any other tics that really bother people, work to actively get rid of those behaviors. If you can manage to stomp them out, people will feel less frustrated around you.It can be difficult to get rid of these habits, especially if you have done them for a while. But just hold firm to your commitment and eventually you will kick it.

, One other behavior that is obnoxious is taking up way more space than is necessary. This comes from thinking of yourself as being overly important and not taking others needs or space into consideration. Maybe, on the train you sit with your legs spread wide, and it makes less room for others to sit near you. Or maybe when talking to others, you use your hands and others have to stand far back from you. Adjust these behaviors and give equal room to others.


Practice self awareness. Take note of your behavior and watch how people respond or don’t respond to you.

, There is a tendency, even amongst people who are not obnoxious, to cross legs or arms when sitting. However, doing so can make you look closed off or even mean. Sit and stand in a way that communicates that you are kind and inviting. Stand with your arms uncrossed and sit with your legs uncrossed and knees together or slightly apart. Keep your hands open and visible.Don’t roll your eyes.

, One other way that obnoxious people annoy others and take up even more space is by being very loud in conversation. If you do this as well, work to actively keep your voice down. You should not resort to whispering, however, but instead maintaining a respectful tone.

, One key aspect to overcoming your obnoxious behavior is to actively and respectfully listen to others when they are speaking. Obnoxious people often only listen to respond or, even worse, to interrupt. While your friend is speaking, keep your thoughts and comments to yourself until they have finished speaking. Think carefully about their words and try to stay focused., There is a difference between being truthful and genuine and being downright rude. Consider if what you want to say is truly necessary. If you have a tendency to be rude or insulting, actively work to eradicate that behavior. Choose your words carefully and season any uncomfortable truths with some sweetness.For instance, if your friend is struggling with breaking up with her boyfriend, don’t say something like “you are so dumb for staying with him, of course you should break up.” Instead you can say “I know you love him, but seeing him hurt you over and over makes me think he is not good for you. I will love you and support you no matter what you decide, though.”

, Negative talk can be draining for your friends and family and is likely affecting them more than you are aware of. If you are constantly thinking of the glass as half empty or making disparaging comments about others or yourself, realize that people don’t tend to enjoy being around people like that.Take some time to reflect on all of the positive things and people in your life. This will help you be more grateful and more pleasant to be around.

, Though you may get excited when in conversation with someone, hold your comment to yourself until they are done speaking. Interrupting someone is a surefire way to put them on guard and make them feel annoyed with you., One other behavior that is obnoxious is when people inject advice into situations where it was not asked for or solicited. Remember, that you are not the expert on the your friend’s life and that, though you have their best interests at heart, you don’t necessarily know what’s best for them. Remember that and allow them to make their own choices.Offer advice when asked.

, You may be doing things that are annoying that you have no idea about. Get some clarity from your family and friends about your behavior and the work to improve on the areas that you find important to you.You might say something to them like “I know that you say I am annoying sometimes, but I was wondering how? I’m trying to work on it.”

, Remember, you are your own person and you have to be happy with who you've become and continue to become over the decades. If you aren't satisfied with yourself, it's okay to keep working on it. It's also okay to change every few years––it's how human beings keep on growing, learning and relearning.


Keep in mind that this process of bringing forth your true self won't happen overnight. It will take as long as you need it to, which is perfectly fine! In the end, the only validation of who you are that matters is your own.

, You are amazing just the way you are and negative criticism is both unhelpful and unkind. Let the negative remarks go in through one ear and right out the other. Does it really matter what people think of you? The people who really mean the most are those who stick by your side and respect and love you for who you are. However, this isn't to say that you can't learn from positive and constructive feedback about improving yourself––those you trust will sometimes be excellent sources of suggestions for ways to improve yourself that will help bring out your true talents and abilities.

, It's hard to stay true to yourself when everyone around you is influencing or pressuring you to be something or someone other than yourself. Choose your friends wisely. Be close with genuinely kind and nice people, not cruel or detracting ones. Make sure that your friends support and admire you for being yourself; if they don't, question their motives and the reasons for your friendships.

, Before anyone else can love you, you have to love yourself in a healthy way. Don't be too rough on yourself. Nobody is perfect, no matter how close they may seem. Every flaw you have makes you who you are and a ""flaw"" one day may be a ""feature"" some other day, as often it depends on context and finding your true direction in life. One bad day doesn't mean you're destined for a terrible life.


Be very careful about what you choose to do with your life. If you pursue a career that isn't aligned with your personality type and true inner talents, you may end up being miserable and constantly on the back foot. Take your time in working out what you are best at and don't commit completely to a career, job, vocation, etc., until you're one hundred percent sure it is right for you. This process may change again and again through your life, so expect to transform now and then.

, Learn to embrace your flaws––they are apart of you, and that won't change. Balance these by acknowledging and making the most of your features and putting your best self forward as much as possible. People will recognize the best in you when you acknowledge this yourself.

Don’t neglect your personal spaces.",How to Stay Fresh," To stay fresh, start your day by cleansing your body. Your unique body chemistry will determine how often you need to bathe. Many people take a shower every morning, but if you play sports or live in a really humid climate, twice a day might help you stay fresher. If you live in a temperate place and your skin is on the dry side, every other day might be best. No matter what, aim to bathe often enough that you smell good and feel clean.


Being clean doesn't necessarily mean using the harshest cleanser possible. Use a soap that's good for your skin type and doesn't dry it out too much. Choose a body wash or bar soap that's gentle enough for everyday use.
While taking a shower most days is recommended, you may want to wash your hair less often. Washing your hair every day can dry it out and ultimately damage it, since it strips your hair's natural oils. To stay fresh on the days when you don't wash your hair, consider using a little dry shampoo. It's a powder that absorbs oil and makes your hair look and feel clean.;
, Did you know that 2 percent of the population doesn’t have the gene that causes body odor?Those lucky people don’t need to use deodorant, but the rest of us use it to prevent body odor from becoming too strong during the day. Apply deodorant after you get out of the shower.


If you tend to sweat a lot, you might want to use a combination deodorant and antiperspirant to keep you dry. Use it with caution, though: in recent years there have been claims that the aluminum in antiperspirant could lead to breast cancer. Experts say these claims are unfounded, but it's worth looking into if you're going to use it on your body every day.Using all-natural deodorant sticks or rocks is trendy, but many find that it wears off after a few hours. The exception might be homemade coconut oil deodorant cream, which quickly absorbs into the skin and keeps you dry and fresh. To make it, just blend 6 tablespoons (88.7 ml) of coconut oil with 4 tablespoons (59.1 ml) of baking powder and 4 tablespoons (59.1 ml) of cornstarch. Add a few drops of your favorite essential oil, and apply it by rubbing a little into your armpits., If your skin tends to feel a little oily or sweaty as the day progresses, try applying body powder after your dry off from your morning shower. It absorbs extra moisture, keeping you feeling fresh. You can bring a small bottle of powder with you so you can reapply during the day.


Apply it to areas that tend to feel less than fresh, like your feet, armpits and so on.
You can use baby powder or make your own body powder by simply mixing together cornstarch and your favorite essential oils.

, Lucky for us, polyester went the way of cassette tapes several decades ago. The synthetic fabric was known for being itchy and uncomfortable because it wasn’t made out of natural, breathable fibers like cotton or even wool. Although thick, heavy polyester isn't commonly found these days, there are other synthetic fabrics that have a similar effect. When you wear airtight fabrics that don’t allow fresh air to circulate near your skin, you can end up sweating and feeling sticky.


Check your wardrobe for synthetic fabrics that might not be allowing your skin to breathe. Make an effort to wear more cotton and other natural fibers.
Another way to stay fresh is to layer your clothes so you can change things up to suit the temperature. Instead of wearing a thick sweater to work and feeling hot later, try wearing a blouse with a cardigan that you can remove or put back on.

, If you’re worried about your feet sweating or smelling, take extra care to wash, dry and powder them every morning. Wear shoes that are appropriate for the day’s weather. If you wear heavy boots in the summer, your feet are going to sweat, which leads to odor and an unfresh feeling. Whenever possible, wear a pair of socks to absorb extra moisture.


Have a separate pair of shoes for working out. Don't wear the tennis shoes you use at the gym when you're hanging out with friends, because the dried sweat on your workout shoes could cause your feet to smell.

, The best way to keep your breath smelling good is to have proper dental hygiene. Floss once a day and brush your teeth in the morning and at night using a toothpaste approved by the American Dental Association. Be sure to see a dentist every six months for a deeper cleaning to remove the buildup of tartar, which can lead to bad breath and more severe dental problems.


Using mouthwash is a good way to combat bad breath. Rinse your mouth with antiseptic mouthwash a few times a day to kill the bacteria that cause bad breath.
Drink water often. Aside from brushing your teeth, there's no quicker or better trick for freshening your mouth. Having a drink of water rinses away food particles that can build up in your mouth and cause bad breath.

, If you’re physically active during the day, you might want to bring a few essential backup items you can change into. That way you won't have to deal with that icky feeling that comes late in the day when you've been wearing the same thing since 8 am. You could even keep a tote bag in your car with a few items so you’ll never be without them when you leave home. Consider bringing along the following:


A change of socks
A clean undershirt
A pair of clean underwear

, Wind, rain, and general rushing around can mess up your hair and leave it limp by midday. Bring a comb or brush with you so you’ll always be able to fix your hair if you need to. You may also want to bring a small bottle of hair spray or gel to help it stay neatly in place.


If your hair tends to look a little greasy by mid-day, try dry shampoo. You just sprinkle a little on the spots that look greasy, let the powder sit for a few minutes, then brush it out.
Another trick is to put your hair up into a bun or ponytail to instantly give yourself a fresh new style for the remainder of the day.

, This might be helpful if you’re in a humid climate and don’t have time for a second shower. Be sure to use unscented wipes, since the scented kind has a strong smell. Wipe where necessary, then reapply deodorant and you’re good to go.

, If you tend to feel less than fresh after lunch, start bringing along a travel toothbrush and toothpaste so you can quickly clean your mouth and feel better right away. A travel-sized bottle of mouthwash is also handy to bring. And when you don't have these items handy, you can always pop a breath mint or a piece of peppermint gum.

, There’s nothing worse than having your period start in the middle of the day when you don’t have access to a drugstore. Think ahead and pack everything you need to keep yourself fresh during your period. Have enough tampons or pads so that you can change them every few hours.


Avoid using douches or perfume sprays to keep yourself fresh. The chemicals in these products can actually lead to yeast infections, which will just make matters worse.Instead, wash with warm water or use an unscented cleansing wipe to freshen up.

, Using a light application of perfume or cologne on your pulse points makes you smell fresh. However, spraying loads of it on mid-day to mask the smell of sweat is not a good idea. You’ll make matters worse if you try to cover up unfresh smells with strong floral or earthy scents. It’s better to find a way to take a quick shower or use cleansing wipes if you don’t have time.

, If you tend to get bad breath after eating onions, or your skin smells like garlic a few hours after consuming spaghetti sauce, choose what you eat a little more carefully. Stick with lighter foods like salads, fruits and vegetables, especially on days when staying fresh is a priority. Eating these foods has the added benefit of keeping body odor to a minimum.Know which foods give you indigestion, too. Common culprits are beans, greasy foods and cruciferous vegetables.
Spicy foods may make you sweat more than usual.

, If your bedroom, car, and other places where you hang out aren’t clean, it’s going to affect the way you smell and look. For example, if you have a messy bedroom and never hang up your clothes, they might smell a little stale and look wrinkled. Here’s what you can do:


Put away clean laundry right away, and keep dirty laundry in a closed hamper.
Vacuum often, especially if you have a pet.
Clean out the inside of your car.
Clean out your office and other places where you spend hours of time a day.

Be assertive.,
Interrupt the harassment.,
Use caution in addressing the bully.,
Seek support when intervening.,
Alert others to ongoing bullying or harassment.",How to Stand Up for Others1," Don’t wait for a bullying victim to speak up and ask for your help. They may feel too threatened to be able to say anything. Try to take control of the situation and speak up for the other person first -- they may be relieved that they don’t have to.Understand that victims in a confrontational situation may be stuck in a physiological “freeze” trauma response, a common reaction to extreme stress. They may be paralyzed by fear and unable to effectively respond, making it important for a bystander to intervene.If you feel like speaking up can be hard, you’re not alone. It can be hard for many people. But often, when one person speaks up, more people will start to intervene as well.Be aware that you can help de-escalate some situations because of a real or perceived relationship with the bully. If you share race, gender, or culture with the bully, the bully may be more willing to listen to you because they may feel they have something in common with you. If you know the bully, you may also be more likely to be able to successfully intervene because of your ability to hold them accountable.;
, When you see the bully harassing the victim, interrupt the bully by ignoring them and heading straight to the victim. Fully assess the situation for safety before you intervene. If you feel it is safe, you can physically get in between the victim and the bully to talk to the victim. Do your best to remove the victim from the bully as quickly as possible. Otherwise, get as close to the victim as you can. Starting a conversation with the victim gives them the power to decide if they want you to intervene or not.As you assess the situation, look for any possible weapons. Determine if the perpetrator is making physical threats, if the victim is injured, or if this is a possible sexual harassment or abuse. If any of these are happening, immediately get local police and emergency medical services involved.
You can do this if you know the person or not. The victim will likely be willing to play along in order to stop the harassment. You could say, “Hey, I’ve been looking everywhere for you!” or “Oh my gosh, how are you? I haven’t seen you in ages!”

, In many cases, directly confronting the bully may not be the best idea, especially if you are concerned that they may physically assault you. You could also end up becoming the bully’s next target. However, while maintaining a safe distance, it is wise to attempt direct eye contact with the bully. Be firm in your actions. You can do this without speaking to the bully. This will help you gain control over the situation as you cautiously approach the victim. Using this approach will also allow you to have a detailed description of the bully if you need to report the incident to law authorities later. However, if you feel confident that the situation will not escalate and that you will not become a target, you could address the bully if you feel comfortable. Bullies often care about being popular and powerful, and calling them out might help take away their power.You could step in and say, “Leave him alone! Back off right now!” Be firm, loud, and stand your ground. You may not feel brave, but you can pretend to be., Find someone in a position of authority who can help you deal with the problem. This may be a supervisor, law enforcement, or someone who has more power than you do who is better able to solve the problem.Call emergency services immediately if you feel the situation is dangerous.
Tell an adult. If you are a child or teenager, find an adult you trust to help you deal with somebody else being bullied or mistreated. Adults can often use their power to deal with the issue without a bully ever finding out what happened.If you cannot find a person in a position of power to help you, gather other witnesses to help you step in and stop the bullying. There is strength in numbers.

, If you see bullying, harassment, or discrimination, speak out. Tell someone and raise awareness, even if it didn’t affect you or you weren’t near the event when it happened. Not saying anything will make it worse for everyone.Tell someone in a position of authority where you are seeing the harassment or bullying occur. For example, if you are a student in a school, you could let your teacher know that a kid is often being bullied in an area of the school where there is not much staff supervision. If you are witnessing harassment in the breakroom at work, you could let your supervisor or HR representative know so that another witness could be there.
If you are too nervous about speaking up in person, you could do it anonymously. Some companies have ways to anonymously report employee wrongdoing (“whistleblowing”), schools may have ways you can report trouble anonymously, and many communities have tip lines where you can anonymously contact law enforcement to report trouble.
If you feel like speaking up can be hard, you’re not alone. It can be hard for many people. But often, when one person speaks up, more and more people start coming forward. Sometimes it takes just one person to call out injustice, and then more people feel brave about coming forward themselves."

Don't expect thank yous.,
Go the extra mile.,
Have the ability to be moulded.,
Challenge yourself.,
Don't wait.,
Stop expecting for the ""perfect partner"".,
Smile.,
Give advice.,
Don't say comments that will hurt other people's feelings.,
Be confident.,
Have fun.",How to Stand Out and Be an Uplifting Person," Yes that's right, nowadays everyone says thank you out of politeness. Originally someone would say thank you because they felt gratitude because someone did an action which was not obliged of them. The person in turn would say ""you're welcome"", to say that they were welcome to their help and no need to repay for the help which they received. Putting this into practice, it shows that you can only expect a thank you if something wasn't expected from you. This is not to say that, you should stop saying thank you but now you will know the difference from a thank you out of politeness and thank you out of good merit.;
, Now that you know you shouldn't expect thank yous over something which was expected of you you should work extra hard for something. This will make you stand out, bringing more success to your life, and will also be an example to everyone else not through words but action.

, When someone says something that hurts, but you know will help improve your character and personality try not to get angry. Listen to the person and work hard to improve yourself.It may hurt but its better to listen now then suffer later because you didn't hear the truth.

, Don't think your life will be awesome if you don't push yourself. Learn a new language, play a new instrument, remove your fear of heights. Don't limit yourself to your comfort zone, and persevere in always doing something new.

, This is not to be mixed with patience. However if you wish to reach a goal, instead of hoping against hope that it will somehow come true you have to take action! Make the goal realistic, yet something great. Persevere, and make sure you do what you have to do and fight for it! Have positive thoughts, distance from friends which will only bring you down and remind yourself of your goal whether it is reminders on your iPhone or notes stuck in your bathroom so you can see in the mirror. Work hard, and never take your eyes of the goal. You will get there!

, I'm not saying go for someone which will only bring lots of problems in your life but don't expect the total prince charming of Hollywood in your life. The real life fairy-tale is different from the Hollywood one. Work on yourself before investing in your love life. After all if someone was so ""perfect"", then why would they search for a partner. A relationship is for two people to work together and lift each other up. Think about this before entering a relationship.

, It will make you so much more approachable.  Don't let a stressful ruin you and always make a frown turn upside down. Life doesn't always go according to plan but a good sense of humor is best when problems arise.

, Whenever someone needs your help, offer to help and give the best advice possible. Reflect on the problem and first put yourself in their shoes, what should be done. Giving advice shows that you can reflect and are mature enough to face problems making you an uplifting person.

, Part of being an uplifting person is to strengthen someone when they feel down. Having someone which will make someone stand up when they fell will make you all the more uplifting.

, Being needy is unattractive and even worse, will show you are insecure. Be comfortable with yourself.

, Go out with friends, go the park etc. Make the most out of life.

Help the victim stand up to the bully.,
Listen to the victim.,
Help the victim get support.,
Let the victim be upset.",How to Stand Up for Others2," Sometimes, a victim of bullying may want to stand up to the bully, but doesn't know how to or is afraid to do it on their own. Offer them your support, and ask if they want you to help them stand up to the bully.


Ask them how you can help them stand up to their harasser. You could say, “Would you like to meet me after class so we can confront her together before lunch?” or “I can come talk to the supervisor with you if you want. I will support you and be a witness.”
Don't be surprised if they turn you down. Some people don't like to have another person's help to stop bullying. If they tell you no, you could say, ""Okay, but if you change your mind, I'll help you"" and stick to it!, If the victim comes to you seeking support, believe them and listen to them tell their story. Find out how you can help if they need it.


It’s important to believe the victim even if you did not witness the event. Remain nonjudgmental and supportive as they speak. Casting doubt on their story may make them feel even more victimized and shut down.

Listen with empathy as they share their story. You could say, “What happened to you sounds horrible. You sound really upset. What can I do to help you?”

, The victim may be too distraught to seek out helpful resources on their own, so take the lead and offer to find some. Offer your assistance in any way you can and feel comfortable with.If you see someone being harassed on the street, you could help them get home safely.
You could call the police on behalf of the victim and stay with them while they file a police report. Give the victim and the police your contact information so you can be a witness for any legal proceedings.
You could get help the victim get connected with any legal support or anti-bullying resources they may require.

, It’s possible that the victim may take their feelings out on you after the incident. Don’t take it personally. The victim may feel you are a “safe” person to express their anger to.The victim might say something like, “I wish you hadn’t interfered. I can take care of myself!” You could respond, “I’m sorry. From my perspective, the situation seemed like harassment. I won’t intervene again unless you ask me.”
The victim may cry, express anger, or be in shock. It’s okay to sit with them and just be present -- you don’t have to find some magic words to say.

Stop unkind conversations.,
Be an anti-bullying advocate.,
Take action against cyberbullying.,
Talk to people who are different from you.",How to Stand Up for Others3," Put an end to all conversations that put down or gossip about someone else. You don't have to be friends with the person being trash-talked, but it's important to tell the trash-talker not to speak badly of other people, even if you don’t particularly like the talked-about person either.


You can defend the person being trash-talked. For example, if someone says, ""I hate Maddie! She's so ugly,” your response can be, ""That's mean. Don't talk about people like that. I think Maddie is pretty.""
Tell the speaker to stop talking about other people this way. You could say, “I don’t think it’s right to be making fun of him like this. Please stop.” If they continue, walk away from the conversation.
Something else may be happening in the bully's life that is causing them to bully others. Sometimes people may act out because they are suffering stress or experiencing other issues at home. They may also have been bullied themselves, or they may have been a victim of abuse. These people may be in need of additional support, such as mental health counseling, to address these issues. Try your best to gently inquire about these possibilities. Offer supportive guidance to encourage them to seek help from a qualified professional.

, Teach others how to stand up to bullies and to stand up for what’s right. Find anti-bullying or anti-discrimination resources appropriate for your audience, educate yourself, and share what you’ve learned.


Find resources that support a cause you believe in and is valuable to your audience. For example, you may wish to learn about bullying to raise awareness to your high school, or you may wish to learn about hate crimes against a minority population to help raise awareness in your community. People will be more receptive to your campaign if it is something they can connect with.
Assist your local community, workplace, or schools with establishing a reporting system to make it easier for victims to seek help. Communities, workplaces, and schools can use these procedures to help identify easy and practical ways for victims to report bullying or harassment. They are also able to use these reports to track bullying and harassment trends over time so that they can develop better prevention procedures.
If you are in school, you could start an anti-bullying group, or talk to your school’s leadership about things that could be done to help prevent bullying at your school., If you're online and see other people talking badly about someone or sending harassing messages to them, report their account. Most social media websites have an option to report people for abusive behavior, and cyberbullying is considered abusive behavior by almost every website's Terms of Service.


Remind people to think before they post. Once you post something, it is out of your hands and on the internet forever. If your friend wants to post something mean about a classmate, you could say, “Do you really want to post that? It could get back to him really easily, and it will make you look bad.”Treat other people on the internet the same exact way you would treat them in real life. If you don’t have something nice to say, don’t say it at all, or share your differing opinion respectfully.
Avoid using websites that allow you to be anonymous. People sometimes take advantage of anonymity features on a website to harass people.
If you’re a kid or teenager, allow your parents access to your passwords and social media accounts. They can help you if you encounter any problems online., Make an effort to learn more about people of different races, cultures, religions, or sexual orientations than yours. The more you learn about someone’s life, the more likely you are to have empathy toward them and their situation. Promote a culture of empathy among people in your life. Knowing more about another person’s story can help prevent bullying and help others speak out against it.You could make friends with classmates or coworkers who have different backgrounds. Once you get to know them better, you may find that you share a lot of the same things in common.

Volunteer for a cause that supports people who have different circumstances than you do. You could volunteer at a homeless shelter, set up an apartment for a refugee family, or work with your faith community to set up a fellowship with a different faith group.
Read books about people or written by people who are of a different background than yours.

Start by looking at their actual job.,
Be prepared to make some assumption and judgments.,
Judge the book by its cover.,
Ask and listen.,
Watch them engage.",How to Spot a Politician1," If you’re surveying an individual who you suspect is this type of politician, the best way to confirm is to find out what they do for a living. If they hold an elected public office, then by definition they're a politician, regardless of the type of role (some municipalities hold elections for City Clerk), and whether or not they exhibit all the other politician-esque traits that we’ll discuss later.


If you’re not able to determine the individual’s career, there’s not much else you can do to spot whether he/she is a politician, as it’s illegal to stalk an individual to find out where they work or what they do for a living.;
, There are a few additional clues that indicate an individual is an elected politician, but they are purely inductive, meaning that these clues often align with politicians but they’re not guarantees that the individual is a politician.

, Most elected politicians are nice-looking, well-dressed and well-groomed — as public image is important to them, and it’s also important (at least subconsciously if not overtly) to the electorate who evaluated this individual as a candidate and decided they were worthy of the votes that earned them the elected role. Conversely, an individual who is slovenly, poorly-dressed and/or missing their front teeth, is not likely to gain the confidence of enough voters to win an election and end up in office.

, Most elected politicians are well-spoken, which means they’re articulate and knowledgeable when it comes to political, social and economic issues. To get elected, they would have had to express their positions succinctly and convincingly, in order to garner the majority vote. If you’re interrogating — er, chatting with your suspected politician and they have difficulty expressing their sentiments, they’re most assuredly not an elected politician.

, Lastly, most elected politicians are sociable, charismatic and comfortable in their own skin. They’re well-connected, high-energy and highly verbal. They like speaking to groups, being on television and radio, and being in the public eye (except of course when accused of wrongdoing). If more than a couple of these traits are missing from the person you’re evaluating, they’re likely not an elected politician.

Think of the connotations of ""politician."",
Go detective-mode on their track record.,
Follow the paper.,
Listen for verbal miscues.,
Question logical fallacies.,
Ask for face-time.,
Run a heat check.,
See if they own up.",How to Spot a Politician2," Now that we’ve addressed the challenge of spotting an officially-elected politician, let’s swing over to the other type of “politician”, often characterized by quote marks, because they’re not a true politician who has been elected, but rather an individual who could be labeled a politician simply by the types of communication devices and leadership choices they embrace, to achieve whatever agenda they may have.


In this case, the label “politician” connotes any person (in elected office or not) who uses charm, emotional appeal and/or convincing dialogue to manipulate a certain outcome, especially when it involves the need to persuade a group of individuals who may otherwise be doubtful of the trickster’s views or priorities, and especially when such outcome directly or indirectly serves the claimant's own well-being more than that of the group or population at large.

, The person who habitually advances their own political agenda in a workplace or community at the expense of others will find it difficult to piece together a verifiable storyline of successful relationships and achievements, because their destructive habits result in burnt bridges, failed friendships and breach of trust. A simple vetting of their past and corroboration of their claims against those of others will shed light on this characteristic.

, Talk is cheap, but paper is expensive in the sense that it’s hard to contradict what’s documented by others. Compare notes – emails, public filings, official documents, articles, internet posts – anything related to any claim being made. If a person says they did or said this or that or that they believe thus and so, but the hard-coded documentation tells a different story, stick another red flag in this guy’s cake.

, The problem with the politician façade is you have to keep it painted fresh on a daily basis, or it starts to stink. Politicians are notorious for verbal miscues, because nobody can remember every nuance of every misrepresentation he or she ever made, much less piece together a narrative that satisfies all scenarios, both the fabricated and the legitimate. A simple comparison of claims made over time will yield a clear answer to the question of veracity, which is an attribute entirely lost on the real politician.

, Politician-speak is hard work, because at every turn, they have to find a way to say what you want to hear without saying what you need to hear. For example, if somebody says “rich people need to pay their fair share”, notice they didn’t say what that is. No percentage, no number, no ceiling. Once they toss out the word “fair”, the less-guarded among us are hooked into the class envy track. So filtering this hot air takes equal work, for example, by just asking the question, “what is fair”? If the answer doesn’t come, the silence is deafeningly letting you know it’s time for another red flag.

, Here is likely one of the most efficient tests of Politician’s Disease. Equipped with all the above tool sets to ferret out the masked politician through inquiry, if you can so much as request a face meeting with the suspected individual, if indeed they are guilty of the title, chances are they will avoid such a confrontation at any cost.


Politicians are not comfortable being challenged straight up. Their world is one of sleight-of-hand and charlatanism. Unwillingness to hold press conferences, to field questions, to stop and talk to reporters — we’ve all seen this odd behavior in elected politicians whose oathed responsibility is to deliver ongoing, transparent messages of leadership, vision and intentionality to their constituents, and their perennial avoidance of this is no different with our non-elected “friends” of similar persuasion.

, The politician is a master at personal warmth – but only on their own terms, and only skin-deep. Want to test your candidate’s heat level? Pour out your heart about something personal, be long-winded and dramatic, and gauge their response. A true friend will go there with you, feel your pain, relate to your struggle. This is impossible for the closet politician — they’re so fixated on their own agenda, they won’t have the tolerance to engage your emotional challenge, no matter how genuine or heartfelt.

, Everybody is human. But corner a supposed team leader or champion of a cause on his or her own past mistake, and if you get a slippery dismissal, it’s time to whip out the permanent marker again. Only you may need some help holding the guy down, because the politician’s own hubris will prevent him from wanting to be known for what he is.

, Keeping your lips together, pull one corner of your mouth up in a sort of crooked half-smile. You shouldn't need to use too much force to do this - smirks look best when they're effortless, not strained.









Many people's smiles aren't perfectly symmetrical, so one side of your smile may work better for smirking than the other. Practice in a mirror to determine which side of your smirk is best.

, One variant on the basic one-sided smirk is a smirk that's basically a very coy, ""shallow"" full smile. This is extra-tricky and not something everyone can do. Try to curl the corners of your mouth up slightly in an expression of subtle amusement. Don't smile too much, though - there's a thin line between a debonair smirk and a leering, grinch-like grin.








, Regardless of the style of smirk you choose, the way you use your eyes can make or break your smirk. Ideally, your eyes should help ""back up"" whatever emotion you're trying to convey by smirking. If you're cockily flirting, show confidence by looking the person you're smirking at in the eyes with a smoldering gaze. If, on the other hand, you're just expressing mild amusement at a joke you just heard, shoot a sly, knowing look out of the corner of your eye.









Use common sense here. Don't leer at the recipient of your smirk for any longer than you normally would look at someone in the situation you're in - smirks can really creepy, really fast if accompanied with a stare.

, A common mistake many people make when smirking is to raise their eyebrows and/or cock their head to the side. With a few exceptions, this usually looks somewhat ""cheesy"" and insincere. Usually, when someone does this, they'll end up conveying a different emotion than they originally intended (befuddlement, for instance, rather than coy amusement). Smirks are usually best when they're subtle and shouldn't normally need to be heavily ""telegraphed"" or ""hammed up"", so avoid these attention-grabbing behaviors.








, Whatever you do, when you smirk, don't look like you're trying to smirk. Smirks naturally convey a little arrogance along with whatever else you're trying to convey - it's just the way they usually look. If your smirk looks put-upon or otherwise insincere, you'll find that it may have the opposite effect as the one you intended.









Remember - stay relaxed. Smirks are cool and confident, not attention-seeking. Don't smirk so that you can be seen smirking, but rather, smirk as a natural response to something happening around you.

, One classic use for smirks is to show that something you're saying (or that you've just said) is intended sarcastically. For instance, you might adopt a subtle smirk after giving out effuse, ironic praise to convey that your previous remarks weren't 100% sincere.

, Smirks are somewhat confusing because they're used both to display sarcasm (as above) and to display actual, genuine amusement (albeit in a muted way). A smirk after hearing a good joke can be a silent, controlled way of showing that you found the joke somewhat funny. Conversely, a smirk after hearing someone make a good point during an argument can be a tacit admission that s/he is correct.


Of course, in both of these situations, sarcasm also is a possible response, so it's crucial to have a keen eye for the context of the situation.

, Somewhere between sarcasm and amusement lies smarminess - a sort of detached, arrogant sense of enjoying one's self. Unsurprisingly , smirking can be used for this emotion as well! For starters, try smirking as you make a biting joke about someone to his or her face (in good fun, of course) or smirking as you list your own wonderful qualities.

, Smirking is a great tool for sexy, confident people - men and women alike. Smirking shows self-satisfaction in a knowing, teasing, confident way - in short, when applied well, it's irresistible. Give a smirk to someone who's caught your eye on the dance floor for a fleeting moment as you walk past or shoot a smirk to the good-looking person at the end of the bar whose drink you just bought. You'll make a lasting impression of confidence and self-assurance that can open the door to exciting romantic possibilities!

Express gratitude.,
Give compliments.,
Refrain from negativity.,
Drive courteously.,
Be a kind shopper.,
Forgive people.,
Post something inspirational on social media.",How to Spread Kindness1," Look people in the eyes when you give them a grin. This is such a simple way to spread kindness, and it’s free! Be generous with your smile and put feeling into it. Smile at store clerks, waiters and baristas, mail carriers, and other people you come in contact with. This easy gesture can brighten people’s day.;
, Good manners are the art of making people feel at ease.Treat others respectfully, as well or even better than you’d wish to be treated. Aim to be cooperative and thoughtful.If you borrow things, don’t forget to give them back.Try to extend invitations to people who have previously invited you to an event.
Work on your interpersonal skills. For example, think of the nonverbal communication you may be sending with your body language. Interact with people using open and relaxed body language.

, One of the best ways to spread kindness is by starting at home. If you have children, instill in them the importance of being kind to all beings. Read and tell them stories about kindness. Teach them forgiveness and gratitude as well as respect for all others, regardless of race, gender, origin, culture or socio-economic status.Discuss your acts of kindness as a family at dinner., Be an active listener without judging. Sometimes advice isn’t needed, and others just want to be heard. In order to develop better compassion for others, you should practice self-compassion as well by soothing yourself when you need it. When someone lets you down, remind yourself that people struggle silently for many reasons. Don’t be quick to anger or hold a grudge.The other person may be going through something you don’t know about that caused them to be tardy for a meeting, be snappy, or otherwise offend you.Keep in mind that we all make mistakes; there could be any number of reasons for the person’s lack of acceptable behavior.
Tell yourself at the start of each day that you won’t judge anyone.Give people your full attention. Don’t interrupt, act condescending, fiddle with your phone or be otherwise rude.
For example, you can practice self-compassion by breathing deeply and releasing the tension in your muscles. Hold your hand over your heart. Focus on your breathing and imagine that you’re using it to send warm compassion throughout your body. Think of a positive self-affirmation, such as “Kindness is a strength. You are kind and capable.”

, Tip generously when you can.Tell your loved ones why you’re grateful for them. Be appreciative and express your respect and admiration for others.Try telling someone in your life, “You inspire me to be a better person through your…” List specific things you appreciate about that person. If you don’t feel comfortable saying it in person, tell them through a note or online message.

, When you think something nice about someone else, don’t keep it to yourself – say it! You can also do this online by “liking” people’s posts and tweeting good words to people.For instance, like ten things on someone’s Facebook profile or Instagram feed. Repeat the favor for others, for example, by making a habit of doing this every Sunday.
Try saying, “What a nice outfit!”

, Be mindful of not only your words, but also your thoughts. Thinking positively can help you approach the world with kindness. Start a day at a time, trying not to speak negatively. You may slip up, but stick with it until it becomes second nature for you to avoid negative words and deflect negative thoughts., Put safety first, and then consider being a polite driver. Use your turn signals when you’re supposed to, and use your horn sparingly – only when you need to alert someone to your presence. Keep distance between your car and the one in front of you. Try not to block other people’s access while you’re sitting in traffic. Don’t try to cut off a line of cars by using the breakdown lane or a turning lane to skip ahead in traffic.Avoid blocking driveways, intersections, entrances and exits while traffic is stalled. Don’t block the passing lane for an unreasonable amount of time.
Road rage is illegal, dangerous, and spreads negative emotions like stress and anger. The DMV suggests that if you find yourself having a strong emotional reaction, breathe deeply, pull over, put some calming music on, and remind yourself that you have complete control over your own intentions., Open and hold doors for people. Use shopping carts courteously. Always keep your cart to the side of the aisle so that people can get around you without having to wait for you to move. Offer your help if you see someone with their hands full, for instance an elderly person with a lot of items to load in their vehicle. If you see someone else vying for the same parking space, let them have it. Planning a little extra time can make it less stressful when you have to search for a parking spot or wait in store lines.If you are walking towards a store and see someone looking for a shopping cart corral, offer to walk the cart back into the store. You can use the cart yourself and they don’t have to find a cart return.
If you want to use your phone, try text messaging instead of talking so that you don’t bother others around you. If you encounter rudeness, match it with kindness and patience.Use pleasantries like “please,” “thank you,” and “you’re welcome.” Don’t get angry with salesclerks if an advertised product is out of stock. If you need to discuss it with an employee, ask for a manager, and present your problem clearly and calmly.
Don’t forget to exercise caution. If you’re in an isolated area like a parking lot empty of people, or if something feels off, don’t approach a stranger even if they’re crying for help. Go to a populated area and relay that the person needs help if they appear to be injured., You can give kindness an edge over negativity by refusing to hold onto anger and resentment. Forgiveness is something you should do for your own well-being, and you can lead others by example through living a more positive life. You can tell the other person that you’ve forgiven them, or just say the words “I forgive you” aloud to yourself along with the reasons why you’re forgiving that person. You may be surprised at how freeing it feels!Forgiving someone doesn’t mean you’re excusing their actions or that you’re forgetting the incident ever happened. It doesn’t make you a pushover; it means you’re exercising control over keeping negativity out of your life.
If someone is indebted to you, consider forgiving their debt, if possible.
If someone witnesses you letting a grievance go and expresses surprise about it, try saying, “I’ve decided to be a forgiver. You wouldn’t believe how much more peaceful my life has become because of it!”

, You never know when someone may need a pick-me-up and your simple gesture can reach them. Choose an uplifting quote or verse.You can put it directly on your timeline on a site like Twitter, Facebook or Instagram. Or, if you notice someone who seems down, send them the post directly along with an inspirational message.Try saying something encouraging and nonjudgmental, like “I saw this verse and thought of you and your strength in dealing with difficulty.”

Search for online forums where the topic you’re an expert at is being discussed. You can contribute advice to the forum anonymously if desired.

, If you know someone who could use a babysitter or pet sitter, offer your services. For example, to a friend, neighbor or family member. You can also offer to walk someone’s dog.


Try saying, “If you ever need a babysitter, I’m happy to help free of charge!”

, If you live in an area that gets snow, the next time you are out shoveling or snowboarding, consider doing one or more of your neighbor’s driveways as well. Try to clear the paths to their doors and their sidewalks also. Or, load your gear in the car and drive to a friend or family member’s house and clear their driveway for them.

, Find a charity that means a lot to you and donate your time by volunteering. Look on their website for information about volunteering, or email them to ask how you might be able to help.


If you don’t have time to volunteer, consider making a financial donation instead. You may be able to deduct it on your income taxes! There are also sites you can do your ordinary shopping through, such as Amazon Smile, who will donate a portion of your purchase to the charity of your choice.If you’re struggling with which charity to give to, ask yourself some questions.

Set up a free coffee or hot cocoa stand.",How to Spread Kindness3," When you go to a drive-thru for coffee or food and there’s someone in line behind you, tell the cashier you’d like to pay for their order. Alternately, you can do this inside of a restaurant or coffee shop on your way out. The object is to do this discreetly and anonymously, without receiving accolades.


Try saying, “I’d like to pay for the person behind me. Could you add it to my bill?” You could also request that the cashier relays a message, such as, “Please pay it forward someday!”
If you’re uneasy about how much the bill might be, contribute a specific amount instead. For instance, try saying, “Here is ten dollars towards the bill of the person behind me.” If the cashier mentions there will be change, tell them to keep it in their tip jar, if they have one, or ask them to give it back to person behind you.

, Call friends, neighbors or family over to visit. You can mention whether the invitation is for brunch, lunch, dinner or tea/coffee. You can be extra kind by telling them they don’t need to bring anything but themselves., You can do this on a website such as Craigslist (their “free” category is under the “for sale” section). Items you may want to consider giving away are vast, ranging from furniture and household items to tickets, toys, games and auto parts. When you don’t need something any more and/or you’re considering throwing it away (for example, on your trash bulk pickup date), consider whether you can give it away instead.


Remember to take safety precautions when meeting with strangers from the classifieds. You can read more about that at https://www.craigslist.org/about/safety


, Donate canned food or other acceptable items to a food bank. You can organize a drive by getting friends and family together and asking them to bring items.Find food banks near you at http://www.FeedingAmerica.org or http://www.FoodPantries.org.

, Find a local church, Goodwill or other nonprofit. Another way to do this is look online for a drop-off box near you that accepts such items.

, Purchase holiday cards at a supermarket or stationary store and send some delightful snail mail to your loved ones. Another idea for spreading kindness over the holidays is delivering treats through a service or in person.


There are many companies that offer mail order gifts of edible items such as Christmas cookies, nuts and other goodies. Consider ordering a box to arrive as a surprise for some of the people you know. Alternately, you can show up on their doorstep when you know they’ll be home, with your family and a box of homemade sweets. Ring the doorbell, and when they answer, sing one or two of your favorite carols!

, You can improvise with your own ideas of anonymous gifts, but a couple ideas to consider are stamps or books. Consider carrying a pack of sticky notes and a pen with you for the purpose of acts of kindness.


Occasionally when you go to the post office to buy stamps, purchase extra and leave them in or beside the machine.Take a good book you’re willing to part with and leave it in a public place with a note for someone else to enjoy it.Write something like, “This is for you. Please take it and try to pass on act of kindness to someone else.”

, A good way to do this is to buy or make two to four bouquets (or more). Select a nursing home from a local directory, like the yellow pages. When you arrive at the nursing home, find a staff member. Give one bouquet of flowers to them to keep, and ask them to give the other bouquets to residents who could use cheering up. This technique utilizes the rule of reciprocity, also called, “the norm of reciprocity.”If the staff member asks why you’ve given them flowers, just say, “It’s a ‘thank you’ for passing these out.” If you prefer not to do this in person, you can have a flower delivery company send bouquets with a similar note.
The rule of reciprocity means that the person you are generous to is likely to feel obliged to do you a favor in return. In this case, since you’re giving a bouquet to a staff member as well, you increase the likelihood that they will pass the kindness on well, by thinking carefully about which residents would most benefit from the gift.
Alternately, you can bring other types of gifts besides flowers, such as homemade knitted scarves.

, Find a local children’s hospital in a directory. Call ahead first or visit the hospital’s website to find out where you should bring the gifts and if there are any guidelines about what you can give. Prepare some items you think kids would enjoy, such as kids’ craft sets, stuffed animals, or quilts., This is a great activity you can do with kids. Set it up as you might a lemonade stand, with a table, chairs, and a large sign. You can opt to serve coffee, hot chocolate, or both.Make sure to dress appropriately for the weather. This is a nice way to spread kindness over the holidays!
Write on the sign, “FREE Coffee and Hot Cocoa!” Consider adding to the sign or somewhere at your table an advisory such as: “Warning: beverages may be very hot.”
Items you may need are thermoses, coffee and/or hot chocolate, disposable coffee cups with lids, marshmallows, packs of sugar or artificial sweetener, packs of flavored or unflavored creamers, and stirrers.

Pronounce your words clearly.,
Speak more softly.",How to Speak Nicely1," People range in their ability to hear and understand language, and you have a greater chance of being heard and understood when you speak clearly. Practice with a recorder or ask a friend to help you learn to pronounce your words with more clarity. Things that can help include slowing down, lowering the tone of your voice, listening to and borrowing from actors whose accent or tone you like, etc.


Avoid using a monotone (no variances in your speech). This suggests that you don't have confidence in what you're saying and it tends to bore people after a short time.
Avoid mumbling. People feel very embarrassed when they continually fail to ""catch"" what is being said and will soon find and excuse to get away from someone who is mumbling a lot. If you mumble as a result of shyness, it's important to address this cause; for example, see How to overcome shyness.;
, Try to tone down any hint of aggression or loudness in your voice when talking to others. Loudness causes people to be on the alert and even on the defensive, and can set them on edge. As for aggressiveness coming through the voice, few people will miss this intent and will feel very uncomfortable.

"
"
Use good grammar when speaking.,
Say what you mean without demeaning another.",How to Speak Nicely2," Well constructed sentences impart information more clearly than using slang or vague meanings. When you use grammar properly, it is easier for the listener to grasp your meaning without having to struggle.


While slang may be the ""in"" thing for your clique, family or group, avoid using it with people outside that circle of intimates. Slang rarely travels well.

, Be assertive, not aggressive or manipulative. This means stating clearly and firmly what your needs, interests and preferences are without overriding the interests or needs of the listener. If you are aggressive or manipulative, this places the listener on the defensive and isn't a nice way to engage in a discussion.


Do not directly blame the listener's personal traits. If the listener has done a poor job of something, state how the job was done poorly rather than calling the person sloppy, lazy or thoughtless.

"
"
Slow down when discussing important issues.,
Avoid being impulsive.",How to Speak Nicely3," You may feel excited, impassioned, angry or even fearful about a particular topic but your emotions are not an excuse to shoot from the hip and rally off a whole bunch of insults or demands. Instead, take the time to respond to things that matter to you or set off your emotions. There is no harm in saying something like, ""That's a big issue you've raised there. I'm going to need to think it over for a day or two and get back to you on that."" Buying yourself time also gives you a chance to cool off and reflect over the matter. Ultimately, it means that you keep the discussion nice.

, Your listener may think you rude and even mean if you keep cutting them off before they've had a chance to fully explain, explore or talk about their issues. If you are in the habit of always cutting people off, or always needing to butt in and add your two cents worth before the whole story is laid out, learn to restrain yourself. Nice talk is like a well orchestrated game, with each side having a turn and in between turns, avid concentration on what the other person is really saying.

"
"
Concentrate on the speaker's words.",How to Speak Nicely4," Don't ever think of what you're going to say while the person is talking! This is rude, and they'll know that you weren't really listening and that you think more highly of your own opinion than of theirs. And that may hurt their feelings. While this isn't about speaking nicely per se, it is an important part of holding a decent and thoughtful conversation with other people.


Show more interest in the other person than in yourself and you will have a captive audience for the things that you do want to get across.

"
"
Avoid speaking ill.,
Be the bearer of good news.",How to Speak Nicely5," Gossip, rumors and backstabbing conversations have no place when you're aiming to speak nicely. Complaining is also out. Find positive and constructive ways to explain yourself and the things that happen to you. Concentrate on what you want rather on how you wish other people would behave. Remember that you can't change other people but you can make it clear what you want to happen for yourself.


Beware sarcasm. It may feel witty and clever but it is barbed wit and it can hurt people who either don't get it or who realize that you are being damning about something they genuinely care about. That said, there are occasions where sarcasm can relieve tension, so use your best judgment knowing the people you're with. The best advice is to not make a habit of it.
Avoid being saccharin sweet. The ""everything's great"" attitude when things are clearly not great is annoying and people see through it quickly. It is better to acknowledge what isn't working at the same time as being upbeat rather than sugarcoating bad things.

, Even in times of hardship and difficulty, it is possible to relay information in a way that helps people rather than leaves them feeling sad, angry or at a loss. Look for ways to bring positive things to everyone's attention, all while acknowledging the hardship. This is as much a habit as always complaining is a habit, and with practice, you can turn it around.


For example, consider a situation of a power outage. Everyone is sitting around feeling miserable, complaining how cold and boring it is. You might say something like: ""I know it's dark and cold in here but we can get the blankets out of the cupboard and wrap ourselves up in them, Johnny can cook us a cup of hot cocoa using the camping stove on the porch and we can play cards by candlelight."" Finding the ""nice"" in difficult situations can help boost people's spirits immensely.

Lead by example.,
Take a breath.,
Remember a role model.,
Think positively.,
Be proactive.,
Focus on the big picture.,
Visualize something positive.",How to Practice Grace under Pressure,"


Remembering that others are looking to you as an example of how to behave is strong motivation for practicing grace under pressure. Coworkers, friends and family members can all draw positive perspectives from you if you handle a high-pressure situation with composure and maturity. Tell yourself to act the way you would want others around you to react.;
,


Be graceful under pressure by counteracting your body's natural reaction to a stressful situation. Close your eyes and take 3 deep breaths, exhaling slowly each time. This calming exercise will help slow your heart rate, which has probably been naturally accelerated by your body's release of adrenaline in your bloodstream. Slowing down your heart rate will allow you to remain calm, collected and graceful.

,


Show grace under pressure by taking a cue from a role model that has done the same. Think of a family member or someone in the same field that you admire for his or her ability to be cool in tough situations and ask yourself how he or she would act in the same situation. Draw inspiration from someone you admire as an athlete, industry leader or philanthropist and model your actions after that person.

,


Avoid reacting negatively to the high-pressure situation. Your natural reaction could be to feel defeated or distressed. Tell yourself you can do it and that you have the experience, drive and ability to handle the issue.
Don't use negative words like ""can't"" or ""won't"" and look at the positive perspective to keep yourself cool under pressure.

,


Ask yourself the best way to fix or overcome the problem and quickly brainstorm possible solutions. Include those around you and get their input about how to handle the situation once you've composed yourself enough to be calm.
Focus on resolving the issue or finding a solution. This will help you stop focusing on the pressure and be graceful in your efforts to make it better.

,


View the problem or high-pressure situation as an individual issue. Don't let yourself project your thoughts on what could happen in the future. Focus only on the issue at hand.
Remember that this is one issue in the scope of the larger picture of your life or your job. It will be easier to react calmly and gracefully when you realize that this is one small thing in the perspective of the larger picture.

,


Close your eyes and focus on a mental image of something you love or that makes you feel good. This can be your kids, puppies or a deep blue ocean and palm trees. This lets you harness your emotions, calm down and handle the situation gracefully.

Wear tops that show off your cleavage.,
Leave your top buttons undone.,
Wear tops with eye-catching designs.,
Make sure a strapless outfit has enough support.,
Keep the dress code in mind.",How to Show Cleavage1," While this may seem like a given, the right top is absolutely essential when showing cleavage. You can't show something that's covered up. While a turtleneck sweater may make your bust look fantastic, it will hide your cleavage. Make sure what you're wearing is cut for visible cleavage. Some classic examples are:


V-neck sweaters, t-shirts, and tank tops.
Button-up blouses.
Criss cross tops.
Dresses with plunging necklines.
Blazers without undershirts.Mesh tops.;
, This is a trick you can use to instantly go from modest to sexy and back again. If you're wearing a button-up blouse, simply unbutton the top few buttons. You can create a plunging neckline by leaving many undone or show just a classy hint of cleavage by buttoning a little higher. This versatility will let you wear the same thing to the office and to a party without needing to stop at home to change., When you're showing off your assets, you're likely to want some attention drawn their way. A good way to draw the eye towards your cleavage is to wear a top with not only a low neckline but also an interesting design.If your blouse is plain or a solid color, wear an eye-grabbing pin or brooch near your cleavage.

, This can come from within the outfit itself if it has built-in boning. Otherwise, you will need to find the right strapless bra for the job. Find one with enough support to keep your cleavage looking great while keeping everything in place.


Keep in mind that a strapless bra can push your breasts up too far. Make sure your cleavage looks natural.
Before heading out for a night on the town, try jumping in front of a mirror while wearing your outfit. If you find your breasts jiggling too much, your top sliding off, or your bra peaking out, reevaluate your outfit. You don't want anything to pop out unexpectedly on the dance floor.
For formal events, such as a wedding, consider being fitted for a bodice. A bodice will both keep your cleavage in place and make you look a little trimmer., Every type of job and work environment will have its own rules when it comes to cleavage. Many offices are fine with a hint of cleavage, while others are more strict. Some professions may even be fine with a plunging neckline.


If you aren't sure what your work's dress code is, try asking your supervisor or checking the employee handbook.
When you're starting a new job, try to remember how people dressed during your interview.
When in doubt, it's best to err on the side of caution and keep the cleavage to a minimum.

Make sure your bras fit correctly.,
Consider sporting a push-up bra.,
Give silicone bra inserts a try.,
Wear makeup.",How to Show Cleavage2," When showing cleavage, you want your breasts looking their best, and an ill-fitting bra won't be able to do that. Your breasts should fit perfectly inside the cups without any bulging at the top, bottom, or sides. Your bra should sit firmly and horizontally across your back without riding up as the day goes on. If your bra has an underwire, make sure it fits against your chest without gaps or pinching., Push-up bras are essential for creating the sexiest cleavage possible, especially for women who may be less well-endowed. These bras are specifically designed to increase the appearance of cleavage. Push-up bras work to push your breasts both upward and together, giving you a fuller, perkier look. If the pushup isn't enough for you, tie it in the back

, Also called ""cutlets,"" inserts can both enhance cleavage and add volume to your breasts. Position an insert low on the exterior side of each breast. This will push your breasts inward, creating better cleavage.


When wearing inserts, you may need to wear a bra that's at least one cup size larger than what you'd wear with unenhanced breasts., If you want the focus to be on your breasts, make sure to take the time to make them look their best. Pat on some powder and bronzer before going out. Try to make the color of your cleavage match your face.


Don't go so far as to pile on foundation, however. If you want to hide blemishes, stick with a light concealer."

Layer with sheer fabric.",How to Show Cleavage3," Celebrities seem to get away with extreme plunging necklines while experiencing relatively few wardrobe malfunctions. If you're curious as to how this is accomplished, the secret is simple: double-sided tape. Double-sided sticky tape mounted along the inside of their tops keeps their clothing stuck perfectly in place. This is vital when you're sporting a plunging neckline without a bra if you don't want to flash your nipples.Breast lift tape, designed especially for holding up breasts, will also work well for keeping them in place., You have a few different options for how to handle your undergarments when wearing a plunging neckline.


The easiest and usually best-looking option is to simply go braless. However, this can be difficult to pull off and may not feel comfortable for everyone. If you're going braless, consider wearing nipple covers, also called ""pasties"" or ""petals,"" in case of slippage.
A thin, understated bralette or triangle bra can give you support while keeping your cleavage in full view.
A bandeau covers up some cleavage but works well in more casual settings.Because plunging necklines are trendy, deep plunge bras made especially for this look are becoming more common., Do you want to wear a plunging neckline but still feel a little self-conscious? Consider sheer layering. Pair a sheer, high-cut top over a solid one with a plunging neckline. This combination will put your cleavage on full display while masking any minor skin imperfections in that area."

Consider how much you get accomplished during the day.,
Determine if you feel as though you are tapped out of ideas and creative ways to accomplish tasks.,
Assess your sleep and fitness level.,
Decide if you feel distracted at all times or does your general feeling of inefficiency disappear when you are away from the office?,
Make an appointment with a trained therapist and/or your physician for an assessment.,
Resolve to handle only one media resource at one time.,
Take a mental health day every few months.",How to Spot and Deal With Attention Deficit Trait," You used to be able to hit three meetings, make your deadlines and get the kids to soccer on time. Now you are lucky if you leave the office at 7pm.


Your work and life schedule hasn’t changed, but you are having difficulty meeting the same demands. Even though you have the same deadlines and requirements, you seem to have trouble getting everything done during the day.
You feel as though you are working harder to get the same tasks accomplished. This includes putting more time and emphasis into the same task and project as before.
You are always running behind. From meetings to deadlines and personal demands and even housework--nothing seems to get done in a timely and efficient manner.;
, You used to be able to tackle new projects or explain how to get through a chapter of history to your child but now you feel as though the creativity well has completely dried up.


You have trouble expressing your feeling and thoughts. When it comes to communicating with family, friends and coworkers you can’t get your thoughts or opinions across clearly.
You always feel hurried so you can’t take the time to fully communicate or discuss ideas or thoughts.

, ADT can impact your overall health and well-being if not addressed. Do you find that your fitness and/or sleep patterns have been disrupted to the point where you are exhausted all the time?


Sleep only comes sporadically. You are exhausted throughout the day but can’t seem to get a full night’s sleep. Some consider over the counter sleep medications, which can further exhaustion during the day, creating a cycle that is difficult to break.
Exercise was part of your daily routine but you’ve almost completely abandoned it. You hit the gym five or six days a week, however now you can barely fit in a quick walk on the weekend.
You have an overall feeling of malaise and ill health. In addition to feeling sluggish you are more susceptible to viruses and illnesses.

,


Test your overall level of attentiveness when you are on vacation or away from the office for a certain number of days. If you seem to be able to get back to old patterns of getting tasks accomplished while away from work, you may want to explore the possibility that you may have acquired ADT.
Do you gradually revert back to old ways when you return to work? Did you seem to be able to accomplish tasks while away from the office but feel overwhelmed within a few weeks of returning to work?
Do you feel more distracted or unable to complete tasks in certain work environments, but efficient in others. For example, if your job is in outside sales, do you feel overwhelmed and have trouble when in the office surrounded by voicemail and email, but free and focused when on the road, meeting with clients?

, Instead of self-diagnosing you should rule out other health or mental issues.

Have a complete physical. Make sure your sleeplessness and overall feeling of malaise has nothing to do with an underlying physical issue. Ask if the doctor could run blood work in order ensure you are in good physical condition.
Discuss how you’ve been feeling with your doctor to determine if visiting a therapist may be necessary. While your general practitioner may not be able to provide you with a concrete diagnosis and treatment for ADT, he/she can advise you on whether further assessment is necessary.
Consult with a therapist for diagnosis and strategies you can use to lessen the effects of ADT. Instead of treading water, just trying to make it from 7am until 9pm every day, ask your therapist for strategies that will help you thrive and excel not only in the workplace, but also at home.

, In many cases, busy professionals may be taking a phone call while sending a text and finishing paperwork. While you may think doing all three at once will save time, but in the long run it will take you longer because you are not focused on one thing at a time.


Have a certain time of day you answer emails. Turn off the email alert system on your computer so you aren’t distracted every time a new email hits your inbox. Then schedule time throughout the day when you will check emails based on how much your job depends on it.






Return voicemail messages twice a day. Check your voicemail before lunch and before you leave at the end of the day. Of course if you are working on an urgent project or need to return voicemails make an exception on that day, otherwise don’t have a phone stuck to your ear 24/7.
Put your cell phone away. Friends or family members may want to text you during the day, however getting texts all day can be extremely distracting. Instead of keeping it on your desk so you can continuously read text messages, put it in a drawer and out of sight.
Stay off social media. Although seeing friends’ pictures and commenting on the Red Sox game from last night may be fun, it is sucking time from your schedule. Resolve to only to tap into your Facebook page or Twitter account after work.

, Check with human resources to see if the company has built in certain days that don’t fall under the umbrella of sick or vacation time.

Use your mental health day to restore your energy level. If you haven’t been sleeping or overly exhausted, use the day to rest and relax.
Consider getting items checked off your “to do” list. Perhaps you continuously try to get errands accomplished but never can. Schedule doctor’s appointments or other necessary visits on this day.
Try to be unavailable during your day off. Don’t check email or voicemail all day, but instead ask a coworker to back you up during that day (and then do the same for that person when he/she is out).

Laugh at yourself often.,
Look for the positive in negative situations.,
Learn to joke about your sensitive areas.",How to Not Take Yourself Too Seriously1," Life is going to throw a lot of curves your way and finding humor in less than ideal situations can be very useful. Put things in perspective. If you have a flat tire or a bad public speaking moment, take a step back and realize it's not the end of the world. If someone says something hurtful to you, be the first to laugh at yourself. It shows you understand you may have flaws and aren't afraid if others recognize that.;
, One way to prevent taking yourself too seriously is to stop dwelling too heavily on the negative. If you're having a less than ideal day, try to find something positive thing about that situation.For example, if you get a flat tire, be glad it didn't happen on a highway or lead to an accident. Tires always need replaced eventually. This just expedited the process.

, Rather than being worried about hiding things you are sensitive to, embrace them and laugh at them. If you are sensitive about your weight, make a joke about it and get everyone to laugh at it with you. This will loosen you up, but also make you less apt to worry about others and what they think about your sensitivities. Start slow and in appropriate situations. Do it around people you like and trust and who you feel comfortable being vulnerable with.

Know what's important to you.,
Think about the worst case scenario.,
Limit your need for reassurance.,
Remove sources of negativity.,
Stop trying to please everyone.",How to Not Take Yourself Too Seriously2," Learning your own values, and what's important to you, can make what others think of you far less important. When you know your priorities and feel comfortable with who you are, you'll be less apt to care what others think.


Make a list of attributes that you like about yourself as well as values you aren't willing to compromise. This can give you certainty when others are pressuring you to change something about yourself and worry less that people are judging you., Many times when we are worried about what others think of us, it prevents us from trying new things, or even old things, we enjoy. If you find yourself unwilling to try something new because you are afraid you'll look silly and be judged, picture the worst case scenario. You'll see that the worst case scenario is usually not that bad., Don't ask people to weigh in on you and your ideas, especially people who tend to be overly critical. Choose a select few people that you trust and know aren't overly negative for feedback and forget the rest.When you do seek reassurance, try asking a different question. Rather than asking ""What do you think?"" ask ""How can I make this better?""

, If you have co-workers, friends, or even family who are constantly weighing in on what you do negatively, this can make you more prone to care about others' opinions. Instead of reeling over negative things people say, try to remove the perpetuators of negativity altogether.If that's not possible because you see them constantly, then try to block out what they say by reminding yourself of your values and worth, regardless of what others think.

, Part of taking yourself too seriously has to do with being worried how others perceive you. Realize that some people may not like you, and that's okay. Keep being who you are, and enjoying it."
"
Accept that you're only human.,
Don't be afraid to look silly.,
Be open to new perspectives and advice.,
Learn what you can change and accept what you can't.",How to Not Take Yourself Too Seriously3," This means both that you will make mistakes and that you will learn from them, as long as you allow yourself. Life isn't a perfection contest and treating it as such can severely hamper your enjoyment of living.

, People spend far less time watching what we do than we think. Being willing to step outside your comfort zone, whether its learning a new skill or breaking out a move on the dance floor, can help you grow as a person. Recognize your flaws and realize everyone has them; they make you unique.

, Often times when people take themselves too seriously, every matter becomes personal. Take solace in the fact you don't know everything and the learning opportunities this presents.


Whether you're arguing about a sports team, or your favorite movie, make room for other perspectives. Spending less time worrying about whether you sound right, and more time learning, can really help you grow as a person.Try listening more and speaking less. It's important to have your own opinions and express your thoughts on things, but sometimes we worry more about being heard and right and are unable to embrace that we may not know it all.

, It's important to distinguish between what you can change and can't. This will give you confidence that you're doing what you can. If you are sensitive about something you can change, like maybe your knowledge about a particular subject, take steps to improve.When you realize you can't change something, learn to embrace it. It's part of who you are and you'll spend less time worrying about something you can't help.

If you wish to ease your way into becoming a better person, you must begin by taking a look at yourself.,
Begin by asking yourself how you think.,
Ask yourself how, why, and what you speak and say.,
Ask yourself how you act.,
After reviewing how you think, you must change your way of thinking.,
Change how you speak.,
Change how you act.,
Remember that it's not always about you, either.,
Practice, practice, and practice.,
Don't encourage bad behavior in family, friends, or strangers.,
Don't encourage bad behavior in yourself.,
Keep calm, collected, and confident.,
Always show loved ones and friends that they are important.,
Be grateful.",How to Slowly but Efficiently Become a Better Person," You must learn to notice your flaws and become self-aware of how your actions and words affect others.;
, Do you think it is okay to hastily judge someone because of their appearance, ethnicity, sexuality, etc.? Do you think it is okay to be rude to someone because they are not like you or think differently from you?

, How do you speak? Are you obnoxiously loud? What do you say when you speak? Do you swear and use derogatory terms? Why do you speak? Do you speak to demean someone or gossip? Do you speak about yourself and gloat excessively?

, Do you ignore others when they clearly need help? Do you bump into someone and keep walking? Do you preach and not practice?

, Begin by realizing that not everyone in the world is going to like what you like, look how you look, think how you think, and believe what you believe. People are individuals; they aren't you. Being cruel to and thinking others shouldn't be treated nicely and with respect because they are different from you is absolutely not acceptable. From severely horrible ways of thinking such as, “He's black so he's inferior” or “She's a woman and only good as a sexual object” to things such as, “She doesn't have the newest phone so she's not cool” or “He dresses in all black so he must be a freak” are unacceptable ways to look at people. It is not okay to judge someone on their appearance, ethnicity, sexual orientation, etc. It is much more important to take a look at someone's actions.

, If you are loud, lower your voice. It is rude to those you are speaking to as well as those around you who are not in the conversation if you speak in a shouting voice. Make yourself appear more calm and collected with a low yet clear and confident voice. If you swear or use derogatory terms, stop it. Swearing a lot is a crutch. You must learn to replace swearing with more acceptable words. Also, cut out the derogatory terms completely. If you call someone, directly or indirectly, horrible names, it makes you seem ignorant, irrational, and mean. If you speak to gossip or talk about someone in a rude way, it is best that you do not speak at all. Someone who talks smack about others does not appear to be trustworthy.

, Say, “Thank you” when someone opens the door for you. Say “Excuse me” or “I'm sorry” if you bump into someone by accident. If someone drops some books or papers, help him pick them up. These are very simple, basic forms of etiquette. Open the door for others, offer the elderly or a pregnant woman your seat on the bus, and allow the person with one item in hand go ahead of you and your basket full of items at the cashier. Use your words to express gratitude and appreciation. Use your actions to make things easier for others.

, This is where you learn to listen. Get over yourself; you're not some divine gift for the world to marvel over, and no one wants to hear about every little thing that you do. Sit back, listen, and observe. You will notice a lot of things you have not noticed before, and learn some new things you would have not learned if you kept on yapping about yourself.

, It takes time to change and it takes patience. Simple changes, however, can lead to major transformations. When you catch yourself thinking, saying, or doing something you shouldn't, stop yourself. Habits are very hard to break but with time and practice, good habits will replace bad ones.

, If someone is talking rudely about another, you can stick up for that person or ignore the situation by not offering any encouragement by agreeing with the smack talker or laughing. If you show that you are disinterested or offended by how someone is behaving, she might take the hint. If you make it clear to, say, a friend, that you do not feel comfortable with how he acts and he ignores it, move on. He is not worth the time. There are plenty of other people who are nice that you can befriend. Surround yourself with good influences and your quest to becoming a better person will be easier, supported, and encouraged.

, It may be easy to fall off the wagon and back into old habits. This may be because it is easy to look around and see people acting mean or completely apathetic. You can see this in person or even more especially, on the Internet. Don't allow yourself to fall victim to the bad influences around you. Remember, you may not be able to change others but you can change yourself. If you act like a good person, you can at least influence someone.

, It takes a lot of work to be a good person which is why when you begin to see bad habits change to good habits, you need to congratulate yourself. It is only difficult to be a good person if you have allowed yourself to wallow in bad behavior. Be confident that you can become a better person, more and more so as time goes on. Keep your demeanor. There will always be people who are ignorant and selfish. They will try to discourage you and attack you for being who you are. Those are the kind of people that make the world a horrible place. Do you want to be one of them? Imagine how much nicer the world would be if people could just use some etiquette, show their appreciation for others, and offer a helping hand when one is needed. Imagine that world and strive for it. This will help you stay on track.

, These people are your support. True friends and loving family should be shown how much they mean to you. You should show them often that you appreciate them. Give them meaningful cards and gifts for special days, such as holidays and birthdays. Do something nice for them and help them out throughout the year and tell them that you love them and care for them through words or through actions.

, It is very easy to look at things in a pessimistic way. It is okay to feel sad, depressed, or disappointed every once in a while. If you find yourself in this situation, allow yourself to cry or express some grief, but pick yourself back up. You are human and you will have pitfalls, however, you must remind yourself of what you have in your life that makes you happy. Be grateful that you have family and friends who love you or that you have a roof over your head. Be grateful that you got your fancy coffee this morning or that the store had that one box of Twinkies and YOU got them. Be grateful for the small and larger things in life. This is positive reinforcement for when you are down.

Stop comparing.,
Modify the way you look at failure.,
Change your views on success.In today's high-octane society, success may only be measured by tangible outcomes, such as a trophy, a pat on the back, or a career promotion.,
Release your expectations.,
Learn to compromise.,
Welcome a difference in opinion.Becoming upset when others have conflicting views won’t accomplish anything.,
Become interested in others.,
Question yourself.,
Notice when you engage in turf wars.,
Determine if you are offended easily.",How to Not Have a Big Ego," Regardless if it is directed towards the positive or the negative, playing the comparison game can result in greater anxiety, depression, and poor decision-making.There are always two sides to a coin. You may look at someone and say yourself “I’m so much better at this than him”. It is just as likely that the other person surpasses you on some other trait.


You can stop comparing when you start appreciating more. Rather than measuring up to an ideal in your head, simply respect and appreciate what others have to offer as individuals.Remind yourself that no one is perfect, including yourself. If you must compare, hold yourself up to the person you were yesterday.;
, A person with a big ego might think of failure as the end of the world. You shouldn’t. Having a fearful attitude about failure can convince you to not try again, or even to develop smaller goals. Failure provides you with an opportunity to refine your knowledge and skills. Learn to celebrate each failure as bringing you one step closer to success.Pay attention to how you currently react to setbacks. Do you beat yourself up? Drop all your big plans?
Decide how you would like to react, and do it. Maybe you want to closely examine what happened and change your plans to account for the new information you now know.
Give yourself a pep talk. Find some inspiring quotes and place them around your living or work environment. Repeat a powerful mantra to yourself after each setback.

, Depending on these things can make you have a big ego when you shouldn't, because there are many other ways to measure success than with money or awards.


Another way of looking at success is to think of it as a journey. There is one saying about success being the progressive realization towards a worthy ideal. In other words, as long as you are steadily moving (even in the case of making baby steps) towards your goals, you are successful--even if your boss or teachers don't notice and you aren't subsequently rewarded.
In the meantime, try not to be so boastful about your successes. Quietly applaud yourself on a job well-done, but be sure to extend the same credit to others. A surefire way to not having a big ego is being able to share success and victory with your peers.

, Having extremely high expectations for yourself or others could be contributing to your ego problem. Expectations shape the way we view ourselves and the world around us. As a result, we respond to our environment depending on these expectations. When we release ourselves from the expectations trap, we have the power to look at ourselves and the world from a new perspective.Look for unreasonable fantasies that guide your actions. Maybe you were told as a child that if you act like you own the room, everyone feels like you do. This may work, but it may also cause others to distance themselves in the process. Throw away “If, then” principles, and define success in your own way.
Practice mindfulness. Strive to be fully present in every moment of your life. That way you are not limited by past or future-oriented thinking that limits the now.
Start with a beginner’s mind. Believing that we know everything about a given situation can cause us to not see the full picture. To counteract this expectation trap, enter every situation as if you are doing it for the first time. That way you have the openness to receive new ideas and new points-of-view.

, Getting your ego under control is largely about getting used to meeting others in the middle. Whether it’s at work or in your relationships, mastering the art of compromise can help you and others interact more effectively. Here are some easy tips for compromising:Reconsider your motives. Again, when you reach a stalemate with someone you should question whether you are disagreeing because you feel superior or inferior. Relent some if one of these factors is driving your friction. Try to find some middle ground that mutually benefits everyone included.
Decide what’s important. Remember there is no “I” in team. What collective goal are you moving towards? Are you willing to bend a little to help reach a mutual objective?
Recognize that compromise does not mean defeat. Working with another person to reach a goal while forfeiting something minor (like being right or dominant) is totally worth it. Just be sure that those variables that really matter, such as your personal beliefs or values, are never compromised.

, A certain degree of friction in your personal and professional life can be healthy, too. There’s a popular saying that goes “If everyone is thinking alike, then somebody isn’t thinking”. The same is true in your interactions with others—if everyone is always agreeing with you, then you are only ever getting one opinion. While that may feel good, it is incredibly limiting for your personal and/or career growth.


This isn’t saying go out and pick a fight with your partner or coworker just because. What is being suggested is that you do not have to put your foot down and shut off communication whenever you feel slightly threatened. Sometimes, hearing a viewpoint different from your own can challenge you to look at the world in a brand new way.

, Rather than spending a great deal of your interactions talking about yourself, take an interest in others. Showing genuine interest will get you a lot further than trying to force people to be interested in you. There are many ways you can show interest in others.Make eye contact. Orient in the speaker’s direction. Uncross your legs and arms. Practice active listening by listening to understand rather than to reply. Before sharing anything of your own, paraphrase what the other person said and ask questions to clarify like “Are you saying…?”.
Use the person’s name. Ask about something you know is important to him or her, such as any children or a favorite hobby. Say something like “Hi, Donna! Have you taken the boat out lately?”
Pay a compliment. This can be challenging, but give it a try. Instead of focusing on yourself, direct your energy outwards. Look for things you truly appreciate in others—their clean-cut appearance, their effort, or their personalities. Take the time to let these individuals know that you appreciate these traits. For example, you might say “Hey, man, your energy for this project is really contagious. Thanks!”

, Despite constant run-ins with people at work or home, you may be doubtful that you actually have an ego problem. There are many complex routes one can use to describe the ego. Perhaps the best descriptions is the approval-seeking part of yourself. In order to find out if your ego is running the show in a given situation, ask yourself two questions:


”Do I feel superior to others?”
”Do I feel inferior to others?”
If you answered “yes” to either of these your ego is likely running the show. It may make sense to you that feeling superior is a sign of a big ego. You probably didn’t know, however, that feeling lesser than those around you can be an ego problem, too. , People with big egos tend to have a problem with others crossing into what they feel is their territory.Your best friend tries to give you some insight on how to perfect your golf skills. Your manager who sits behind a desk all day thinks he can tell you how to do your job better.


If you feel a rise after situations similar to those described above, your ego is at play. You may get angry when people try to give you suggestions about things you think you already know. You may refuse help. When people offer up viable ideas that outshine your own, you dismiss them so that your ideas are not diminished.

, An inflated ego may not always be clearly apparent. Sometimes, having a big ego is demonstrated by how quickly you get offended by opposing views. A person with a big ego tends to think he has it all in the bag. When someone disagrees with your viewpoint or criticizes it, you feel as if your very competence is being questioned.You may have trouble noticing the signs of being easily offended. Observe your interactions for a few days. Are people around you steadily apologizing for ticking you off? Do you always have to calm yourself down after someone angers you? You may be dealing with an ego problem.

Realize that controlling others is a problem.,
Make a list of the issues or problems you worry about.,
Learn to relax.,
Think positively about others.,
Consider how you ask for things or direct people.,
Put yourself in their shoes.,
Be in charge of your own happiness and emotions.,
Trust your partner.,
Spend some time alone.,
Cut out all the nagging, criticizing, and controlling behavior.,
Consider counseling.,
Make a list of people you try to control.,
Talk to someone.,
Do something for other people.,
Do not give advice without being asked first.,
Detach yourself from expectations or outcomes.",How to Not Be Controlling," You may have been controlling, directing, or criticizing people for so long that you weren't even aware you were doing it. Understanding that this controlling nature is not helpful or healthy is a difficult, but important step. If you're controlling, you have become the problem.Are you unsure if you're controlling? Think about a situation with an outcome that wasn't what you wanted. If you immediately felt anxious, irritated, and began correcting the outcome, you may be controlling.
Many controlling people offer unsolicited advice. Think about how often you give advice. Were you asked to give an opinion or did you just tell the person what to do?;
, These can be specific or vague. Often times instability, fear, and anxiety cause people to micro-manage or attempt to control their surroundings. If you have a handle on what makes you anxious or afraid, your awareness can keep you from controlling others.Look at the issues on the list that are specifically your problems. Think about what's causing those problems and whether you have any control over them. If not, don't let them cause you anxiety., This will help you deal with your stress or anxiety, making you less likely to try managing others. You might try meditation, reading a good book, yoga, running, playing music, or painting. Regardless of what you choose, do something you enjoy that takes your mind off of worrying., If you always seem to nag the same people, stop yourself and think about what you like about them. After all, if they're friends or partners, there must have been something that you initially liked about them. Start seeing the good in these people and stop seeing the flaws., If you've been directing others for a while, you may not even realize that you come across as blunt or impolite. Remember your manners when asking for things! A simple ""please"" and ""thank you"" is a good start.


Think about when you're asking or commanding someone. If you're in a bad mood at the time, don't let it affect how you're asking. Better yet, wait until you're in a better mood to ask for something.

, Chances are you haven't thought too much about how your nagging or controlling tendencies feel to your partner. Spend a moment and think back to a situation where you were controlling. Imagine the event from your partner's perspective., Don't allow your happiness to be dependent on what your partner does or doesn't do. You'll need to be gentle on yourself, be grateful for things you can do and what you already have, and try to connect with other people.Stop having to be right all the time. This is largely related to accepting your partner and not controlling him or her. You have to learn to be okay with imperfection.

, At the root of many controlling tendencies is a lack of trust. For example, you don't trust your partner to follow through on chores or you don't trust him or her when they're out alone. This might lead you to nag until something gets done or constantly check in on him or her when they're out. Learn to let your partner be himself or herself.If you're having trouble trusting, try letting your partner take the lead in decision making or planning something. Begin honestly and openly communicating with each other., It might be helpful to do things on your own occasionally. Take time for yourself to realize that you can be happy without a partner. Some space might also make you both appreciate one another more.Do something fun with your own friends. Remind yourself that you don't have to be controlling someone in order to have fun with them.

, This will be hard at first, but learn to bite your tongue instead of direct your partner. Make it a habit and you'll gradually begin to accept outcomes, rather than controlling them.You may find that your partner becomes more receptive and appreciative of you once you stop controlling him or her. Respond to this change by trusting your partner more.

, If things haven't improved or have gotten worse, consider seeking professional help. Relationship counseling can bring up these issues of trust, anxiety, and control.


If you fear that you're in an abusive and controlling relationship, get help. Contact a domestic violence shelter, get help from family members, and make preparations to leave the relationship., This will make you more aware of your relationships and make you honestly assess whether or not you try to control them.


Your list may be short. For instance, you might only be controlling with a loved one or romantic partner. You may also find that your list is lengthy and includes family, friends, and partners.

, Find someone that's not on your list and is someone you respect. Tell them that you worry about being controlling and need help. You might also want to find a support group.It can be helpful to talk with people that aren't familiar with your situation. Meetings provide regular support that can make you reassess your problems and progress.

, If you're a controlling person, it's very easy to think only of yourself and your needs. Take a break from all that and do something for others. Volunteer, help a neighbor, or visit with family that you don't frequently see.


Getting outside your comfort zone and helping someone else can make you happier, more appreciative, and feel valued., This will be really hard at first, but will show others that you're trying to change. You might even find that people begin asking for your opinion. In that case, offer it without expecting them to act on your advice. Until then, don't meddle or direct others.Similarly, stop yourself from constantly micro-managing others. Again, it will be hard at first, but you will find that others will be more receptive of your requests later on.

, There are several ways to do this. Not offering advice, directions, or commands is the most obvious. You can also learn to suggest things or give your opinion when asked, but it's important to stop caring about the outcomes. Let things happen, go with the flow, and realize that you're no long trying to control everything.


Don't feel guilty for simply letting things happen. Replace that worry with a new skill or activity. Relaxing or helping others will help you detach."

Be aware that not all judgments are negative.,
Realize that people judge one another daily, as a matter of course.,
Accept that how people judge you tends to say far more about them than it says about you.",How to Not Be Judged by People1," Some are positive too, although holding a person to a high standard of future behavior can actually thwart that person's ability to do even the slightest thing wrong. In the context of this article, making a value judgment is considered to be a decision or summation of another person based on the judging person's own preferences, biases and experience of the world.


A judgment is often made without standing in the other person's shoes, without any attempt to see the issues from the other person's perspective. If this happens, the judgment will come across as righteous, all-knowing and superior, as if the person judging has somehow got the handle on what's right and what's not. Remember, if you fall for this trap yourself, that nobody has this much knowledge or power!;
, This doesn't condone the practice of judging others censoriously but it does allow you to acknowledge that human beings are primed to compare each other, to comment on the doings of others and to make quick assessments of whether or not they like what they see. This means:


Every one of us is subject to being judged, even those doing the judging.
You are likely to be judging people too; how often do you find yourself not liking things about other people's actions, looks or taste? How many times do you barely know anything about those whom you judge?
Many judgments are made subconsciously, based on our experience rather than active thinking. It takes effort to challenge what we have layered down deep within!
It's just a fact of life that some people are more judgmental than others. Whether this is thanks to their genes, their upbringing, their personal choice, etc., isn't always clear. Authoritarian types who like to police others' actions (even when it's not their field of knowledge) or those who ""stick to the rules like glue"" without flexibility, can be particularly challenging people to deal with.

, Judgments are often a reflection of a person's own struggles, fears or self-dislike, projected onto another. Some of the more common reasons behind judging others can include:



""I bettered myself, so why can't you?"": It is often the case that a person who dislikes something about themselves will see that trait or attribute in another person. If they have striven to rid themselves of this negative aspect, such as by getting educated, working really hard, overcoming temptations, forgoing things they really want, etc., then they may be harsh in their assessment of someone else who hasn't done the same things as them to avoid, change or improve their lot.

""My religion/faith/background/learning, etc. tells me this is right (and by default anything different is wrong)"": In this case, indoctrination (at however a subtle a level), custom or habit have eroded this person's ability to see that being different from the way that they follow isn't wrong, it's just different. It's not impossible to get such people to see that other ways of being, believing or seeing the world are equally valid but in the meantime, this doesn't give them any upper hand and you shouldn't lose sleep over their stubbornness.

""You ought to be ashamed of yourself"": This tends to arise from one person supposing his or her take on the world is the only way the world works and there is no need to probe any further according to such a shame-and-blame thrower. The trouble is, the world isn't that black and white and shame is in the eye's of the blamer. This type of judgmental attitude tends to be about looking for a scapegoat for the world's ills.

""I don't approve of you because you're prettier/smarter/more agile, etc. than me"": This type of disapproval-based judgmental attitude is about trying to get control over you, to prevent you from blossoming into the person that they're afraid you'll become (and hence, leave/upset/forget/outperform, etc. them).

""You have achieved something I wish I had"": In this case, it's about simply trying to bring you down to this person's level. Don't oblige.

"
"
Acknowledge that you cannot change the person who judges you unfairly.,
Spot judgmental behavior before you take it on board.,
Don't rent out head space to judgmental persons.,
Avoid stooping to the other person's level.",How to Not Be Judged by People2," But you can react to the judgmental comments or behavior differently. And you can even go so far as to point out how detrimental some judgmental behavior is, such as when it lacks compassion, is prejudiced or hateful.

, Learn the types of judgmental behavior outlined above. Also realize that whenever you feel that someone is trying to control you, force you to accept their view of things against your own view or they simply don't like you, see this as a red flag for protecting yourself. You may be forced to hear what they have to say but you are never obliged to take it as gospel. Let what such people have to say fall right off you, like the proverbial water off a duck's back. Do not let it settle inside you. Which leads to the next step...

, A judgmental person may irritate the skin off you but that's no reason to invite them to live inside your head. Churning whatever he or she said, commented on or inferred over and over in your head gives that person free space in your mind, when that space could be better used doing something productive and self-nurturing. Kick them out, they can be who they want outside of your head.


You are nobody's scapegoat. Remind yourself that the judgmental person is trying to offload his or her personal issues onto you.
Value judgments are not valid reflections of who you are or what you stand for. They are phony judgments, projected from the dark place inside the other person, in an attempt to belittle you or to hold you back.
Many value judgments are lies. They may seem real enough to the person stating them but they are based on personal deceptions that serve that person's needs but not yours. Their dishonesty doesn't belong in your head.

, The tit-for-tat, retaliatory approach leads to a never-ending argument about who is right. In all likelihood, there is no ""right"", just a disagreement about the best way to live/be/appear, etc. Fighting about it won't change anything but it will leave you both feeling angry, more set in your ways and upset. Ultimately, fighting will leave the issues unresolved and leaves harm in its wake.


Learn to sidestep or deflect nasty or insinuating comments. For example, if someone suggests that you aren't capable or that you're inferior, you can respond with something like: ""It's disappointing that you feel that way about me. I don't have the same negative feelings about my ability though. I know I've worked long and hard on this, I've looked at all the angles and I am still going to do this as I've promised."" Don't put the other person down but equally, show that person that you're unwilling to allow them to try to do that to you.

Be curious about the judgmental person.,
Don't expect a judgmental person to see things your way any time soon.,
Catch yourself being judgmental.",How to Not Be Judged by People3," Try to see things from that person's perspective. Often the angriest, most judgmental people are coming from a place of despair, fear or hurt. What has happened to this person to make him or her so worried, afraid or uncertain about their place in the world? A little compassion can help you to step aside their judgmental comments and see them for what they really are.

, However persuasive, considerate and caring you may be in pointing out your side of the story and how they could benefit from being a little more open-minded, they may simply stay stuck. And that's not your problem or burden to lug around; shrug off their bad attitude and allow yourself to keep becoming the person you really want to be, without their negative criticism in your ear.

, Make that mental effort to stop yourself and to redirect your unkind thinking to something with more empathy and compassion toward the other. Apologize if your judgmental attitude has hurt someone else. This will help others to learn that it's okay to apologize and start over too.


It requires vigilance to recognize when you are being judgmental towards others. Don't use that as an excuse to be sloppy about catching yourself doing it.

Ask yourself, ""Why am I this way?,
Don't be self-centered.,
Be humble.,
Be happily sociable.,
Be polite and courteous.,
Maintain a positive attitude most of the time.,
Dress modestly.,
Be helpful.,
Be yourself.",How to Not Be a Snob," Do I like being this way?"" Contemplate hard on whether you think that you are full of yourself, or that you really are the greatest person in the whole world, judging by your opinion. In order for you to understand why you choose to rudely rebuff others and think of them as nothing compared to yourself, also ask yourself, ""How would I feel if someone displayed my actions towards me? Would I enjoy it? Is it my goal to be the most special person?"";
, Snobbish people tend to be selfish, with only deep care for themselves and not for others. You must be generous and kind to others, and don't ever hesitate to seize the opportunity of treating everyone with respect and kindness, because benevolence can be rewarded by people treating you with respect, as well. Remember the Golden Rule: Treat people the way you want to be treated. Always be willing to be nice.

, As an individual, acknowledge that you can't be pretentious and arrogant, which is a certain characteristic that snobs possess. If you constantly boast about how fantastic of a person you are, it affects other people by them not feeling great about themselves, and it shatters their self-esteem. Be modest and admit your insecurities, which will build your self-confidence and be beneficial for others, as you place yourself before them.

, Snobs shun themselves from interacting with other individuals, due to them labeling them as ""low-class"". Refrain from being antisocial and willingly talk and spend time with people, whether they're causal acquaintances, best friends, co-workers, or even elders. Make new friends, even if they're older or younger than you. Otherwise, don't isolate yourself.

, Snobs tend to be rude. Avoid giving someone a vibe that tells them, ""I hate you,"" or ""I don't want to talk to you."" You must respond to people's questions, smile at people when you firmly shake hands with them, and greet people politely.

, Snobs never hesitate to complain and make things go their way. Instead, avoid griping and keep a smile on your face. Know that if you're having a good attitude, people feel comfortable around you.

, Snobs tend to dress in such revealing clothing as too-short shorts and revealing skirts, which is not only extremely unladylike, but it also reflects upon you not having self-respect. Know the difference between ""sexy"" and ""slutty"" and choose to wear attire that is appropriate for your body type and does not show unwanted areas.

, Snobby individuals tend to deliberately choose to not help others when they need it. Instead of turning away from someone who is need of assistance, do the right thing and help them, whether your friend accidentally spilled a pile of books, your grandmother needs help crossing the street, or your father needs help carrying heavy boxes. Being of help towards others assures them that you truly care about them, so go for it!

, Snobs can be nothing but wannabes and/or posers either to be more popular or simply to attract all of the attention to themselves. Refrain from copying and posing yourself as other individuals, and know that you're your own person and uniquely you. Let the inner you shine through!

, It's hard to completely revamp your personality. However, you can work on recognizing your best qualities. From there, you can find ways to make these qualities stand out more.Write down all your positive qualities. Think about what you most like about yourself, and what others seem to like about you.
Think of what ways you can make those qualities more apparent. How can you make something like a good sense of humor stand out? You can try making jokes more often. How can you make generosity stand out? You can always bring snacks or drinks to social events.

, Your opinions are what make you interesting. While you don't have to force your opinions on others, most people are drawn to those with strong opinions on a variety of topics.

If you get feedback, work on it right away. This will help keep your personality on the right track. You'll develop a unique, likable personality.

, There are many ways to be an important member of a group, and you probably already have a natural role within the groups that you engage with. This role may not be someone who is at the center of attention at all times, but your role is important nonetheless. Think about your role when you are in a group and try to be proud of this contribution.

For example, you might be the type of person who is quiet most of the time, but who says insightful or funny things whenever you do speak.
Or, you might be the member of your group who others look to for direction or to keep everyone on track.
Still another role might be as a supporter. You might be the one who encourages other people within your group and helps them to feel comfortable.

, Once you've developed your opinions, be assertive and express them. If you simply agree in arguments and discussions, you won't stand out from the crowd. Feel free to express your opinion when discussing issues like politics and current events. This will make people notice you more.Remember to be respectful when voicing your opinion. You can stand out if you're argumentative, but it may not be in a positive manner.
You can phrase your opinion by beginning with something like, ""I see what you're saying, but I actually disagree.""
Remember that your needs and feelings matter. Work on being willing to express yourself to be more assertive. Also, remind yourself that it is okay to say “no.” Try to practice saying no in situations that are low stakes.For example, if a member of the group asks, “Does everyone like the idea of ordering pizza for lunch?” then you might say something like, “No, actually. I would like something light for lunch. Does the restaurant we are ordering from have salads?”

, People want to be around those who are fun. You don't necessarily have to be the life of every party, especially if it goes against your nature, but try to laugh and loosen up when out in public. This will make you stand out as a fun, interesting person to have around.Try to go with the flow at social events. If the whole gang is going to a bar you're feeling so-so about, do not protest. You might have a good time.
Allow your humor to come out. Crack jokes, even if they seem stupid or silly. You'll stand out from the crowd this way.

, Never be shy about expressing your interests. If someone asks about your hobbies and passions, feel free to share. Even if someone doesn't necessarily know a lot about a particular interest of yours, if you're passionate about something you can make someone interested.Talk about interests that are unique to you. For example, maybe you're an expert on French history. Talk to someone about a new book about French history you're reading.
Make sure, however, not to go overboard. Watch for social cues that someone is getting bored, such as them checking their phone or their eyes wandering.

, If you've had a lot of unique, interesting experiences, feel free to share your stories. Others will love experiencing your life vicariously.

Get a more fashionable look.,

Communicate well.",How to Make People Think You're Confident and Cool when You're Shy," Cool and confident people like to draw positive attention to themselves, so they tend to dress in style and a bit noticeable. Shy people tend to go for plain looks in order to avoid attention.


Know what's in style and put together a nice look for you. Something simple but cool.
Add a cool accessory. A pair of flashy earrings or just a really cool watch on your wrist can give your whole look more style.
Get a haircut. Just like dressing style, cool and confident people like to wear haircuts that make themselves look more attractive in order to attract more attention. Learn what type of haircuts suits you better, and if you are a girl, style it pretty - YouTube has lots of video tutorials about it.
For girls: wear makeup. Just a little bit.;
, Do not let a new cool look be ruined by shy body language. Your attitude must match how cool you look.


Stand up straight, head high and stride with a little cool bounce. If you're a guy, bounce a little on your shoulders; if you're a girl, then a little bounce on hips. But the important thing is that it's not overly exaggerated, but has enough attitude to show people you're confident and not afraid of attention.
Make eye contact. Face people, don't look down. It shows you are not afraid.

, You don't have to talk to much... but when you do, you must know how. Most shy people tend to get nervous when speaking to people, especially strangers. As a result, they mumble or stutter, making themselves look nervous.


Speak in slow pace. Practice this. Get any text and read it in a slower pace, making some pauses. Notice how easier your speech goes? Then, you know how to speak with anyone - in a calm, moderate pace with a soft pause after each sentence.
Speak to strangers. Ask what time is it to someone you haven't ever seen your life, or ask an information for someone you almost never talk to. This is a great start to become at ease speaking to new people. But remember, speak with calm pace and make eye contact!

Throw a ball to your dog. Go on a bike ride with your younger sibling(s). Watch a whole bunch of funny YouTube videos. Binge-watch that new show on Netflix. Just have some good old-fashioned fun.


Channeling your excitement into a positive and fun behavior can be effective at calming you down and distracting you from what's got you all wound up.
Those who do not have fun often are actually more likely to experience criminality, obesity, and loss of creativity, researchers say.Even during times when you are not just looking for a distraction, you should take your playtime just as seriously as you do work time.;
, There are a wide range of ways to distract yourself, both healthy and not.Using your excitement for a creative purpose is a productive and healthy way to spend your time.


Your options for being creative are a basically infinite. You could take a pottery class. Write a short story, poem or song. Draw. Buy a box of crayons and a coloring book of your choice. Paint a picture of your house. Grab your camera and try to take interesting shots of common household items.
Art allows you to release or channel the nervous energy in your body. Some people have a hard time verbally expressing excitement, but making art gives you a vehicle to reproduce those feelings in physical form., Take the opportunity to momentarily forget what's making you so excited by getting your hands dirty and moving. Go home and make a list of household chores or errands that need completing, and get started on them.


Rake leaves, mow the lawn, wash the car, do the laundry, dust the ceiling fans -- just keep yourself busy and moving so as to not get caught back up in your excitement.
Chores probably don't rank high on your list of distracting things to do. They're not all that fun. Still, much research has been conducted on the benefits of chores. Studies have found that adolescents who perform a set of chores tend to have a higher sense of responsibility, healthier self-esteem, and are more capable of handling frustration., When we are in a good mood, we have the power to lift the moods of those around us.You can use your extra energy to be a positive influence in someone else's life.


People have a tendency to unconsciously imitate the moods of those around them.Therefore, you can share your positive energy by reading or doing crafts with residents in a nursing home, patients in the hospital, or with children in a mentoring group. They will get the benefit of your bright mood, and you will have a positive method for releasing the excitement.

, Sometimes, the best way to release extra energy is to go do the thing that's got us all wound up. If you're excited about a new job or a vacation, you can't speed up time so the big day arrives faster. But, there are some things you can do.


For example, if you are excited about starting a new job, you can get help yourself get through the excitement by getting prepared. You can research the position online to learn more about it. You can also go shopping to pick up clothing items to suit your new position.
If a future vacation has you reeling with excitement, you can prep for that, too. Start making travel plans or mapping out different activities on your itinerary. You can perform a cursory Google search to learn more about the location. You can also make lists of items you will need before you depart.

, Deep breathing can be an effective way to center and calm yourself. This exercise helps you to bring on your body's natural relaxation response. You can complete this exercise sitting, standing, or lying down.


Start by breathing naturally. Then, inhale air deeply through your nose for 4 counts. Hold the breath for about 2 counts. Then, release the air from your mouth for 4 counts. Repeat this exercise for several minutes to promote calm.You can also add a mantra to your breathing activity. Try thinking to yourself something like ""I am the picture of calm"" over and over again as you breathe.

, Mindful meditation can help you calm your mind and counteract over-excitement. You may think meditation sounds boring or that it will be impossible to sit still with all your excitement. Meditation can be a little challenging for beginners, but the benefits are widespread. Practicing this activity can reduce your stress, enhance your ability to focus, improve your mindfulness in daily activities, and minimize mental chatter that keeps you from being productive.Sit comfortably in a chair or on a cushion. Breathe slowly and deeply. Orient yourself to the present moment by focusing your attention on different sensations in the environment around you.As you breathe, consider the sounds you hear, how your body feels on the chair, or focus a space on the wall ahead of you. As your attention wanders, simply redirect it to your focus point.

, Visualization requires that you focus your attention on a relaxing place to bring about calm. Like many of these calming techniques, the good thing about visualization is that its benefits don't stop at relaxation. This mental practice can also improve your sense of motivation, enhance physical performance, boost self-confidence, and gear your brain up for success.Here's how to do it:


Sit comfortably in a quiet room. Inhale and exhale deeply. Close your eyes and think of a calming place. This can be a real place or an imaginary place like an exotic beach or a peaceful brook.
Activate your senses to notice the smells, tastes, sounds, and physical touch associated with your calming place.You can also listen to guided visualization exercises where a speaker walks you through the imagery steps. It's quite simple to search for visualization exercises on YouTube or download them from health or stress management website., Even a happy excitement can cause mental and physical stress. Engaging in some sort of physical activity engages both the mind and body while producing a calming state afterwards. If you are overly excited, working out may help you to burn off the extra excitement and relax you.


Try going for a walk or a run for about 20 minutes. This may seem like a short amount of time, but not much exercise is required to alleviate stress.You can combat extreme mental chatter by doing a more intensive workout, such as playing sports, engaging in a high-intensity interval training, or doing power yoga.

, Being cooped up inside will make it hard for you to get your mind off what's got you excited. Take a break from what you're doing and get out in nature.


Spending time outdoors actually just makes humans happier. Science reveals that even short nature walks can reduce depressive feelings, boost your outlook on life, improve your body's ability to fend off illness, and enhance focus (which you could definitely use right now).You can opt to go outside alone or invite a friend for an even better distraction-booster. The two of you can go for a walk in the park or toss a ball around in your backyard.

, Or, you can turn on something fun and get on your feet. Jump, clap, shout or dance.


Getting your body moving by dancing to some music will generate those feel-good endorphins that come with exercise.
But, you will also benefit by tiring yourself out physically to fight the over-excitement. Maybe after a fun dance session, you might want to take a short nap.

Be kind to others and do good deeds.,
Kill people with kindness.,
Help someone if they need help.,
Don't lie.,
Don't spread gossip and, if your best closest, friend tells you a secret, keep it.,
Go over there and go along with it talking about it.

,
Try to stop it and say, ""Well, gossip isn't always 100% true


OR

,
Pretend like it's nothing.

,
No gossiping or bullying.,
Never give out secrets, or any personal information.,
Don't bribe someone into friendship.,
Yes, it can be really tempting to be a certain persons friend!,
Never end a friendship for another person.,
Or, would you stick up for your friend and say ""I'm sorry, but I'm just going to have our friendship broken, if, you want me just to stay friends with you."",
Be a good person.,
Enjoy your school year, and always make the right friends, and the right choices.

",How to Make Friends More Easily," Even if you don't like a certain person, doesn't mean you have to treat them like dirt. People don't like others, who treat them wrong. Remember the Golden Rule: Treat others the way you want to be treated.;
, If someone is being mean to you, or, bullying you, don't say or do anything rude back. Just accept it and walk away. Or, go tell an important adult for more help. Or, you could just say ""Thank You!"" if someone is still bullying and calling you names. Yeah, it could hurt a little for someone to call you a certain name, but, just ignore them and stay away from that person. If someone catches you bullying another person back, they will think that you are just like them. So, be kind.

, Again, with the Golden Rule, ""Treat others the way you want to be treated."" If someone is being hurt, then go over there and try to help them, even if you don't like the person, or the person doesn't like you. Say something nice like ""Are you okay?"" You can earn trust from someone if you say kind things like that to them.

, Say for example, your friend wears dress to school, and it looks like they came from the 1700's, and she/he asks, ""What do you think of the outfit?"" don't lie and say, ""It looks, great!"" Be honest and don't be mean and say, ""No, that looks hideous."" If they are wearing one of your favorite colors, then complement them and say ""I like your colors. If you are confused, then do a quiz yourself on these challenges:


Example: Your friend comes back as Red as a Lobster. And asks: Look at my tan does it look great? What would you say?
Example: Your neighbor paints his door Hot Pink and you don't like it, but you don't want to hurt his feelings and he asks, ""Does my door look great or what? What would you say?

, Gossip is the main thing that stops a persons friendship. Say for example, you hear someone talking really bad about someone else, would you:

,,,, Gossip is 100% preventable. If someone tells you something that sounds really personal about someone you know or someone you don't know, do the right thing, and ignore it. And, there is a lot of sad stuff teenagers do, relating to bullying., If you friend tells you a secret that is very close, and personal, don't go telling other people about it. It will get around to your friend, and, sooner or later your friend will, find out. And if she/he was the only person that told you that secret, they will probably find out that was you since you were the only person that they told. Earning ones trust, can take a very long time to develop.

, Bribing others, often lead to broken, and sad friendships. Buying things for other people just to be friends with them isn't cool. And you really can't buy your way into friendship. If someone is making you buy you them stuff, just so you can be friends with them, don't do it. Ask yourself these questions before you think about buying stuff for that person:


What if they just rip me off just to get to my things or even me?
What if they were lying to me, just to get something out of me?
Am I really going to buy something for someone, just to be their friend?

, And doing stuff the easy way so you can be their friend. But, a true friend doesn't make you give things to them, just so they can agree to your ""Friendship."" Just, walk away. There are plenty of kind, caring, carefree friends out there that will be welcome to be your friend. And if someone wants to be your friend, and you make them buy you something, just because you don't like them, or you see that they are weak, help someone, and people will see the kind, and thoughtful person you really are, and you will really gain friends. Remember, you can't just buy your way into friendship.

, Say, you saw a person at your school and that person was very popular. And asks, would you like to be my friend? And, of course, you would probably be happy to be their friend. That's fine to be friends with other people! But, say, that person didn't like your friend that you are friends with, right now. And said something like, ""If you are friends with that girl, we can't be friends anymore! She makes me sick!"" Would you just continue to be friends with that person and lie and say that you aren't friends with your friend anymore? Would you just end your friendship because you want to be friends with that cool kid?

,

, If you agree to not being friends with someone else and you end up with the cooler, more popular friend, you will never know what will happen. You will lose everything, and realize, all that you had and you threw it all away.

Put on a shawl.,
Pin it with a brooch for added flair.,
Wear a shirt under your dress.,
Choose a shrug to wear.,
Don a jacket.,
Test out your outfit.",How to Make a Strapless Gown More Modest2," A scarf is a simple option to make your dress more modest. There are many varieties and colors of scarves to choose from. You should consider the weather and type of dress you are wearing before choosing a scarf. For warm weather, you can wear a lacy or sheer fabric. For cold weather, you can wear a wool or knit scarf. To get the most coverage out of your scarf, you should drape it over your shoulders and arms like a blanket, or tie it in the front or back.To tie the scarf, either tie the ends together in the front, or loop the ends under your armpits and tie them in the back.
Consider the color of your dress when choosing a scarf. A different shade of the color of the dress you are wearing, or a complementary color may go best with your dress. For example, blue is a complementary color of orange, and yellow is the complementary color of purple.

, Shawls are similar to scarves, but they are usually larger and rectangular. A shawl is a good choice for those who do not want to worry about tying a scarf. To wear a shawl, all you need to do is drape it around your back and shoulders and then make sure it is even on both sides. Shawls come in many different types of fabrics and colors, so it is possible to find one that fits well with the weather and your dress.For warm weather, you can wear a lacy or cotton shawl.

Most brooches need to be pinned, so make sure you are okay with putting a small hole into the material you choose., This is a good choice if you do not want to wear something over your dress, and you are not concerned about compromising the look of your dress.

You can also find shrugs with sequins and patterns.

, Wearing a jacket with your dress is a good choice if you are attending an event in a cooler climate or environment, but it could be difficult to wear if you there will be dancing or other physical activity. Try finding a jacket that is not too long and goes well with the silhouette of your dress. The best type of jacket to wear is a tailored crop jacket, or a blazer. These types of jackets can be kept on the entire time you wear your dress, and they add style to your dress, rather than taking style away.Some other types of jackets to choose from are shrunken blazers, short tuxedo jackets, boleros, and denim jackets. Keep in mind the material and style of your dress when choosing a jacket. A denim jacket looks great with a summery dress, but it does not usually work well with a formal dress.

, Put on your complete outfit. If you wear a shirt, it should be worn under the dress. Otherwise, put your shrug or jacket on over the dress. Move around in your outfit to make sure it’s comfortable. Keep in mind that the temperature in your home may be different than the location where you will wear your dress.

Relax your eyes and mouth.,
Watch your movements.,
Maintain emotionless posture.,
Speak logically.,
Keep an even tone.,
Don't use emotional words.,
Don't hang out with emotional people too much.,
Learn to accept things.,
Desensitize yourself.,
Look at money often.,
Find an outlet for your emotions.",How to Look Entirely Emotionless," The eyes and the mouth can express a multitude of emotions. It is important to keep control over them at all times. The best way to do this is by working on your non-expression. A blank face is the look people use to keep others at a distance. You can see this face displayed in almost any crowded elevator. It's like a do not disturb sign for your face.Take a moment to consciously relax the muscles in your face. You'd be surprised how tensed-up they can become even if you aren't experiencing any emotions.
Poker players make an art form of the expressionless poker face. Study how poker players play without any indication of excitement or nervousness.
Do not avoid eye contact. Avoiding eye contact can be perceived as an emotional reaction. Just look at the person the same way you would look at a chair or a wall.;
, Subtle gestures can be very expressive, even if we are not always consciously aware of them. This is usually the most difficult part of looking emotionless, and no matter how hard you try there is still going to be some small gesture that tells something about how you feel.


Avoid any fidgeting, such as cracking your knuckles or biting your fingernails.
Do not show any hints that you are tired by rubbing your eyes or yawning.
Tapping your feet can make you seem nervous.
Looking down too much can make you seem shy or sad.
While most people can keep a poker face, even poker players' hands betray them and it is the biggest tell picked up by watchful eyes.Hesitant hand and arm movements can show your fear, uncertainty, anxiety or excitement. Try making only fluid and deliberate movements. Don't move unless you need to. Then, move decisively and confidently.

, Avoid showing any emotion with the way you stand or sit.


Don't cross your arms. This can be seen as defensive. Keep your arms relaxed and at your sides.
Sit back in your seat. A relaxed, unconcerned posture is the best way to show how unemotionally involved you are. It also helps put more distance between you and anyone you are with. Leaning forward can make you seem eager or excited.

, Channel your inner Spock and try to have conversations that express absolutely nothing about how you are feeling. For example, if you're out to dinner and someone asks how your burger is, tell them it is medium rare and a little greasy. Do not say it is delicious or gross, even if it is. Just state the facts.


If you are asked a question about how you're feeling or something that can't be answered with facts, your best bet is to avoid the question by asking a question back. You can also try giving a vague or ambiguous response.

, Watch the pace and pitch of your words. Raising your pitch can be an indication of excitement or agitation. Dropping your pitch and speaking more slowly can seem like you're uncertain or upset. Try to speak as though you are reading an instruction manual out loud. Dull, informative and without originality will go a long way to keeping your conversations low-key.

, Many words express emotions. Some are very obvious, while others express more subtle emotions. While it's obvious you don't want to say you're sad or happy, you also should not say you're determined, calm or indecisive. These words express just as much of your emotional state.


Avoid using adjectives to describe words that will reveal your feelings. Don't say a movie was exciting or romantic. Instead, describe the film as action-packed or dramatic.


, People that are very emotional can draw you into their drama and make it difficult to be totally emotionless. You don't need to cut anyone out of your life completely, but you may want to limit your contact with your more emotional friends.If you are out and run into an emotional friend of yours, always have an excuse ready to help you slip away without being rude. Simply tell them you have to go return some videos, or something along those lines.

, A big part of looking emotionless is to not let anything bother you. Once you come to realize that you didn't have the power to change most of the things anyway, they might not bother you so much. If you can give up trying to control things that happen, you will have an easier time accepting it when things don't go as expected., Watching violent television shows or movies is the way most people desensitize themselves. While this is often debated as being harmful, evidence shows that watching violent shows can make viewers apathetic to human pain and suffering.If you are hoping to avoid being affected by those kinds of emotions, try watching more television.

, It may sound silly but looking at money tends to make people act more businesslike.Scientists have found evidence that looking at money makes us less likely to approve of outward displays of emotion, or to use emotional words to express our thoughts.

, No matter how good you get at keeping everything inside, sometimes you will need to release all the emotions. Writing or playing music are a good way to get out emotional pressures, while other people may find getting out their frustrations by kickboxing works better. It doesn't matter what activity you choose as long as you can release any anxiety you have on your own terms instead of having a sudden meltdown in front of everyone.

Identify reasons why you want to love being naked.,
Spend more time naked.,
Compliment your own naked body.,
Remind yourself that your body is unique.,
Show compassion for yourself.,
Turn your negative thoughts into positive ones.,
Repeat a mantra.",How to Love Being Naked1," In order to motivate yourself to change the way that you feel when you are naked, identify some of the reasons why you want to feel good naked. Write these reasons down so that you can review them and decide if they are about you or about someone else. If your reasons are about you, then you have a healthy motivation for improving your body image. If they are about someone else, then you may not have a healthy reason for changing your body image and you may need to see a therapist for help.For example, reasons that are about you might be something like, “I want to feel good naked so that I will feel less self-conscious when I am with my boyfriend/girlfriend.” Or, ""I want to love being naked so that I can visit a nude beach when I go on vacation this summer.""
Reasons that are about someone else might sound something like, ""I want to love being naked so that my boyfriend/girlfriend will like my body more."" Or, ""I want to feel good naked so that people will not be grossed out by me when I visit a nude beach."";
, One of the best ways to start feeling more comfortable being naked is to spend more time in the nude. You can expose yourself to being naked and the more you do it, the more comfortable you should become. Make sure that you stay relaxed while you spend time naked. Try deep breathing or even do a bit of naked yoga to stay relaxed while you are naked.Try walking around your house (or bedroom) naked for a little while each day. If you have your own pool (where no one can see you), go skinny dipping!

, Identifying your favorite features may help you to feel better when you are naked. Look in the mirror while you are naked and try to identify your favorite parts of your body. As you notice the parts of your body that you like, tell yourself out loud. Repeat this process every day and you should begin to notice more of your good features and feel better while naked.For example, you might say to yourself, “I really like the shape of my calves.” Or, “I have a great butt.”

, There are so many different types of bodies in the world, so it is important to remember that you have a unique, beautiful body. Try to focus on how different other bodies are to see that there is a lot of variation in body types.Pay attention to how other people’s bodies look when you go to a mall or, better yet, a public pool. Note the different shapes, sizes, colors, and other features of people’s bodies. Just be careful not to stare or you may get into trouble.

, Being compassionate towards yourself can improve your self-image and help you to feel better about yourself while you are naked. Self-compassion means being kind to yourself, even if you don’t feel deserving of kindness.This kindness can come in the form of kind thoughts, kind behaviors, or kind words. If you find yourself thinking unkind things to yourself, ask yourself the following questions to determine if you are having an unkind thought:


Does this thought make me feel good?
Would I say this thought to a friend or loved one?
Does this thought encourage me?

, If you have a hard time feeling good when you are naked, you may be falling victim to your own negative thoughts. Changing the way that you speak to yourself can also help you to feel better when you are naked. The next time you have a negative thought about your naked body, stop yourself and turn the negative thought into a positive one.For example, imagine you have a negative thought like, “I look like a pig.” You can turn this thought around by changing it to something like, “I may not be the thinnest person, but I have a lot of great features and I love how unique my body is.”

, Repeating a mantra can help to calm you down when you are feeling anxious and it can also help you to silence your inner critic. Your mantra can be anything, but you will get the most benefit if your mantra sends a positive message to you.Try something like, “I love myself and I deserve to love being naked.”

Many places around your town might offer a bulletin board where such events can be advertised such as supermarkets, libraries, universities, community centers, etc.


You can also search the internet for events in your area. Try searching for “local events in .”
Don’t be afraid to try out something new, even if you’ve never done it before. For example, if you see a flyer for free group dancing lessons, try it out! Don’t let opportunities for fun pass you by!;
, Having a hobby is a great way to do something productive and fun. If you don’t already have a hobby or are bored with your current hobby, try out something new. If you already have a hobby that is really fun for you, make time to engage yourself in that hobby.If you’re not sure what new hobby you want to try out, try sitting down with a piece of paper and writing down anything that sounds like fun to you, no matter what it is. If you could do anything right now, what would it be? Doing this will help you find things that are fun for you.
You may have something you’ve always wanted to try, but have been putting it off because you think it’s silly or simply because you haven’t made the time. Whatever the reason, there is no better time than now.

, Humans are social animals and, for the vast majority of us, spending time with other people provides us with an opportunity for fun. If you already have a group of friends, nurture those relationships by staying in contact and making time to do stuff together whenever possible. If you don’t have any friends, make some new ones! This may seem scary at first, but there are many social groups out there that are created so that people can find each other.If you feel nervous socializing at an event where you don’t know anyone yet, remind yourself that socializing is a skill, and it is pretty scary for most everyone at first. Remind yourself that if things aren’t going well, you can always leave the event and try again another time.
Spending time with others can also lead to more fun because other people may have great ideas about fun activities you hadn’t thought of.
If you are having a hard time finding social groups in your area, try visiting your local library or community center. People often advertise social events at these locations. You can also search the internet for events in your areas. Try the search terms, “social groups” plus the name of your town.

, If you enjoy socializing and dancing, then going to a party with friends is a great way to make life fun. You could throw a party at your own home (with your parent’s permission if you live with them), you could go to a party at a friend’s house, or if there is a party going on at a bar or restaurant in your town, you could go to a party there. The point of a party is to relax, get to know new people, play games, and maybe even dance.If you are old enough to consume alcohol, then please do so responsibly.
If you don’t drink don’t think this means you can’t go to parties. Many people who don’t drink go to parties and have just as much fun as anyone. If you don’t want people to ask why you aren’t drinking, just have a sparkling water with lemon in a glass, and most people won’t even notice.

, Even if you don’t consider yourself artistic, doing something creative can be great fun. It can be anything you enjoy doing, and the end result doesn’t have to look nice or pretty. The point is to do something that is fun for you.For example, it may seem childish, but many people enjoy finger painting. You can also draw, color, or do any kind of creative activity that you enjoy.
You can do this alone or with friends, whichever you prefer.
Adult coloring books have recently become very popular, and many people claim that they are a great way to relax and relieve stress., Volunteering can help you make life fun in many ways. If you can volunteer doing an activity that you enjoy doing anyway, it will be fun for you. It will make you feel fulfilled because you know you’ve done something good to help out your community, and you can also meet new people, which can lead to more fun activities.Volunteer for an activity that you will enjoy. For example, if you really love spending time with animals, volunteer at an animal shelter. If you enjoy being in nature, volunteer with a local conservation group.

, Exercise helps us to let off steam, which means that it helps us to be happier.This doesn’t have to mean going to the gym and doing hundreds of crunches. It can be whatever it is that is fun for you. For example, you can do an exercise class that involves dancing. You could go play soccer or basketball with friends, or you could go for a bike ride. If it is fun and also gets your heart rate up, go for it.


If you enjoy going for a run or you find spending an hour or two at the gym lifting weights then, by all means, do that.

, This could refer to making excuses to a friend about why you can’t go with them to see a movie or making an excuse for yourself. When we don’t really feel like doing something, but don’t have a good reason not to, we will tend to try and make up an excuse to justify why we didn’t do something. Try to be aware of this tendency, and if you notice yourself doing it, stop.For example, if you were planning to go for a swim in the afternoon, but you find yourself making an excuse about why you should go home instead, stop and think about it for a minute. Do you actually need to go home or are you just feeling a bit tired?
Remind yourself that being active and doing something will help you get past that lack of energy you are feeling.

, If you want to make life more fun, challenge yourself by saying, “Yes!” whenever someone invites you to do something (as long as it is safe to do so). Doing this will lead you to meeting new people and trying out things you might not have gotten to try otherwise.Try to make it a personal rule to say, “yes” anytime you don’t have something else going on and you can afford to do so. For example, although you may have been looking forward to going home and relaxing after school, if someone invites you to come play frisbee in the park don’t turn them down!
Remember, in most cases, you will be glad you went even if you were feeling lazy beforehand.

, If you spend all of your time trying to change yourself into something different, there won’t be much time for having fun. Though it can be difficult, learning to accept yourself will make life more fun in and of itself. If you feel comfortable with who you are, you won’t have to spend so much time feeling stressed and self-conscious.Try to challenge your inner critic. When you catch yourself thinking something negative about yourself, remind yourself of something positive about yourself.

, If you are standing around being worried about what everyone else is thinking about you, then it is unlikely that you will be having any fun. Try to remind yourself that people spend a lot less time noticing you than you think, and even if they are judging you, why should you care?For example, if someone makes fun of your dancing you can say something like, “Who really cares if I’m a good dancer? It’s just for fun anyways.” This will show them that you don’t really care too much about looking good because it doesn’t really matter, and it will also remind you that it is just for fun.

, While it is OK to plan fun things to do, don’t be afraid to be spontaneous and go with the flow. Sometimes these spontaneous things will be the most fun. If you happen to run into a friend, and you’re both free, have a coffee together or go for a walk. If you come upon a community event, go and check it out if you aren’t doing anything anyways.Often we walk past fun opportunities because we think that we can try it another day, but then we never go back. If you see an opportunity for fun, take it.

, Research has shown that people who joke around with others see themselves as better at dealing with stress and less lonely than those who do not. Fortunately, it doesn’t even matter if you are good at telling jokes or not. Telling jokes and being lighthearted will draw people to you.Don’t worry if you don’t think you are good at telling jokes. Not all of us are born comedians. Even if the joke is cheesy, you can make people smile a little if they can see that you know it’s not a funny joke, and are just trying to lighten the atmosphere.

, If you are always running around from place to place and find yourself stressed because you have too many things to do, making a schedule can help give some structure to the chaos. Whenever your week begins, take a few minutes to write down all of the things that you need to accomplish during the week, and when you will do them. Be sure to write in any appointments you have made and how long it will take you to get to each appointment so you won’t be late.Making a schedule will make you feel less stressed and will also help you identify any free time that you may have. During this free time you can do fun things that you want to do.

, If you have something you don’t really feel like doing, do it first. This will accomplish two things. It will get the task out of the way, and it will take it off your mind. That way, you don’t have to spend your time dreading it, and can move onto other things that you feel like doing.If you procrastinate and put off a task until the last minute you will feel more stressed and you may even have to miss out on something fun

, Unfortunately, there will be many things you have to do that aren’t for fun. For example, you may have to do the laundry, clean your room, or cook dinner. You could stop doing these things, but that will probably cause even bigger problems. Instead of just ignoring your responsibilities, find ways to make them more fun for yourself.For example, put on your favorite music while you’re taking care of your chores. Don’t be afraid to dance around a bit. Remember that even if you look silly no one is watching anyway, and even if they are, it will probably make them laugh to see someone having so much fun doing something mundane.

, It isn’t always easy, but maintaining a positive attitude will make life more fun. The way we think influences the way we act, and it also influences how others behave towards us. If you keep a positive attitude, people will be drawn to you, and even the most boring task will be more enjoyable than if you were complaining and grouchy about it.Maintaining a positive attitude takes practice. At first, you won’t always be aware of it if you have a bad attitude, but bringing more and more awareness to how you are behaving and the attitude you are portraying will make it easier with time.

Be yourself.,
Own who you are and appreciate it as individuality.,
Be positive and kind.",How to Look Cool2," It sounds simple enough, but it is so easy to get wrapped up in how-to advice and forget about how cool you are already just for existing. Every person is as unique and offers something different to the world which is a great and beautiful thing. “Cool” isn’t so much an aesthetic as it is a vibe, granted there are things that assist that vibe physically, but a lot of the work happens within. While it is okay to find yourself, it’s never okay to alter yourself just to fit the mold. Embrace what makes you different because that uniqueness is the key to looking cool. When you feel cool, you look cool.


Go against the grain and like what you like, even if it is the road less traveled as far as interests go. If you are into gaming or anime conventions, but people rarely are, do your thing. If you enjoy staying in while others enjoy going out, do you. Don’t force yourself to be a part of what everyone else is doing. Instead find ways to be outgoing while being true to your wants and interest. That just makes you cooler and more interesting.

, Know that even the best people, as with anything, come with good and bad. There are parts of yourself that you won’t like, aspects about your appearance that you wish to change, but instead of punishing yourself for your faults, own them and use them to your advantage. Embracing what makes you unique not only adds to reaffirming your overall sense of self, but it also adds to your confidence.


Knowing not only who you are, but carrying intelligence in other areas of life: music, film, academics, sports adds a cool unique flair to your personality.

, Be upbeat and optimistic. Draw people towards you with your sunny personality and award-winning smile. When you feel good about yourself, it usually bursts out of you and touches others around you, and the more positive and confident you are, the more like-minded individuals you’ll find in your circle. Attracting those personalities naturally round out your cool vibe.

Find a personal style.,
Consider your budget when shopping for new items.,
Create a signature.,
Invest in your shoe game.,
Express yourself through your hair.",How to Look Cool3," Choose a style icon whose look you connect with most and use them as style muse inspiration. Personal style aesthetics range from hipster to chic to glam to athletic, etc, and there are many combinations that stem from that. Is it the eclectic glam stylings of Rihanna or the effortlessly suave look of David Beckham?


Make a board or collage that allows you to keep track of your inspirations. Write down outfit ideas you might have in a notebook to bookmark for later. This will allow you to keep track and stay true to your style goals.Clean your closet of anything that doesn’t align the new look you’re going for. Target items that you’ve only worn once and/or items you never wear and throw them in the trash. Starting new is often the best way to go when revamping your style., Focus on items that will act as staples in your wardrobe, start and invest there, and then build around that. The great thing about style is it does not have to have a huge price tag in order to be considered great style, instead it’s how you wear your look that truly sells an outfit.

, They are important when signing documents, but they are also important when it comes to adding punctuation to a look and elevating it even further. Choose a signature piece that represents you most. This can be done in a multitude of different ways.


If you are a hat connoisseur, incorporate hats into all of your looks. Either have a favorite that acts a mainstay, like a wide-brimmed hat, or interchange them depending on the day and outfit.
If you are into beauty, have a signature lipstick, a bright red or a deep mauve, or a signature smoky eye with a thick cat eye that everyone knows you by.
Be the guy or girl with the best frames and invest in different kinds of eyeglasses. Make nerdy chic work for you.
Mix old and new pieces and higher-end and thrifted pieces together to enhance your style while inflecting personality into your style even more.

, Are you into sneakers? Are you into heels? A lot can be told about a person by what they decide to wear on their feet. It not only gives cues about your style, but it also gives cues about you. Be on trend and wear shoes in an unexpected way.


Pair sneakers or cross trainers with your favorite dress or a suit.
Wear a pair of heels with athletic gear like sweat pants and a tank top.
Crossover the popular winter shoe over-the-knee boots for a spring time outfit of short shorts and be on trend with the latest lampshading effect., Hair has its own sense of style as well. Wear it however it feels most comfortable to wear it. It can be a lot of trial and error through different cuts, lengths, colors, and preferred ponytail holder positions – but it’s worth the effort. Sometimes it is a stamp on its own and the more freedom you have with the way you style it, the more lasting of a memory you leave on people.

Be relaxed in your emotions and sense of self.,
Be self-assured in who you are and what you do.,
Walk the walk.,
Talk the talk.",How to Look Cool4," Uptight is the opposite of cool. It projects fear, worry, concern, while cool is a state of being easy. You might have worries, but it’s not in your eyes or in your smile. You are at ease with where you are in life and it’s evident by how you navigate through life and your social circle. Be level-headed and present and coolness follows effortlessly.

, Not needing to require validation from others is essential to looking cool. You can go places and make decisions without considering other people’s opinions or allowing them to hold a great weight in their life influences. You seek validation from within yourself and it’s obvious in the way you don’t need or cling to people even if you are a sociable outgoing person.

, Looking cool is about projecting cool. Walk with your shoulders back and head held high with grace and confidence being the goal with how you hold your posture. Shift your center of gravity and poise yourself to walk like a model. Always walk as if someone is taking your picture from a distance.Great posture not only shows others your confidence and cool, but it also works wonders on how you perceive yourself as well., Speak knowingly on an array of subjects. Have a sense of humor about everything, laugh at your antics, and make jokes about other things. Don’t take yourself too seriously. Be open to listening to people and their problems while being responsive and advising in their times of need. Allow people to use you as a confidant. You become more interesting the more you are interested in other people.Be genuine in your interactions with other people
Listen actively by being present in the conversation versus thinking of what to say next
Be interested and introspective in the questions you ask to get to know people
Find commonalities

Exercise.,
Eat healthy food.,
Get plenty of rest.,
Wear nice clothes to feel better when you take them off.,
Make time for relaxation.,
Pamper yourself.,
Spend time with people who love you.,
Consider talking to a therapist.",How to Love Being Naked2," By exercising on a regular basis, you can improve your health and feel better when you are naked since some research has indicated that regular exercise can lead to a better body image.Find some type of exercise that you enjoy and do it often. Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate physical activity every day.


Try walking, swimming, dancing, biking, running, or get into a sport!

, Foods that are bad for you can harm your body and your mind. Some research has shown that high fat and simple carbohydrates (like processed flour sugar, etc.) can have a negative effect on your mood.This negative effect may make it hard for you to enjoy being naked.


Choose foods that will nourish your body instead, such as fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains.

, Sleep deprivation can affect the way that your body performs as well as how you feel.If you constantly feel run down and sad, you may have an even harder time of feeling good while you are naked. Make sure that you are getting 7-9 hours of sleep per night to feel your best as you try to feel better naked.Try sleeping naked. Sleeping naked has multiple benefits including better sleep, a reduction in stress hormones, and improved intimacy with your partner., What you wear can affect the way that you feel naked, so choose clothes that make you look and feel amazing. Choose clothes that fit your body well and that you are comfortable wearing. If you haven’t bought yourself any new clothes in a while, treat yourself to a new outfit. Getting yourself something new to wear will remind you that you are worthy of nice things, which may improve the way you feel about yourself when you take your clothes off.If your fears about being naked are related to being intimate with your partner, try getting some sexy underwear. Wearing some lingerie or silk boxers may help you to feel more confident as you strip down.

, If you are stressed, it could be affecting your self-esteem by leading to self-blame, self-doubt, or becoming anxious. Relaxation is necessary for your overall well-being and it may also help you to feel better naked.Make sure that you set aside at least 15 minutes per day to just sit and relax. You can meditate, do some deep breathing exercises, or just lay around.Try taking a long bubble bath to relax. This will combine a relaxing activity with being naked, which may help to promote more positive feelings about being naked.

, Another way that you can build more positive feelings about being naked is to do things to pamper your naked body. People who have a poor body image or low self-esteem tend to avoid pampering activities, but pampering can improve your feelings about yourself and your body.If you have been avoiding pampering yourself, visit a spa and get a massage, body mask, or some other enjoyable body treatment that requires you to be naked.

, Consider the people that you spend your time with and how they make you feel. If you have a lot of negative or judgmental people in your life, that could be contributing to your dislike of being naked. It is especially important that the person who you are intimate with are accepting of your naked body.If your significant other does not appreciate your body, that may have something to do with why you don’t enjoy being naked. Consider moving on if the person you are with does not appreciate you for who you are, as you are.

, While you can do several things to feel good about being naked on your own, you may need to talk to a therapist if your body image problems are severe or if it is causing problems in your relationship. If you are having trouble functioning on a daily basis or if you have other problems, such as an eating disorder, you should seek help from a mental health professional as soon as possible.

Calculate a budget.,
Don’t be afraid of a career change.If you’re stuck in a job you hate, you might daydream about a career that actually satisfies you, but there might also be any number of things, including time, ego, and fear about financial stability, that might stop you from finding a career that will really satisfy you.,
Write down a list of your core values.If you plan on spending the rest of your life with someone, you want to find a partner who shares your fundamental outlook on life.,
Write a list of must-have traits in a partner.You’re never going to find anybody who matches your entire partner wish-list perfectly, so you have to be realistic about what the most important characteristics you’re looking for are.,
Learn to be happy with yourself.,
Ignore the lists you made.Though it’s good to know what you want in a relationship, don’t close yourself off to potential partners just because they don’t fit with some preconceived idea you wrote down on a piece of paper.,
Figure out if you want to have children.,
Decide how large or small a family you want.,
Consider whether you want to be a working or a stay-at-home parent.,
Ask yourself what kind of a parent you want to be.",How to Know What You Want in Life," Does your family come before or after your faith in god, if you believe in god? Is it more important for you to spend time on the hobbies that make you personally happy, or to focus on the career that supports your family and gives them a comfortable life?


By ranking your values and priorities, you’ll be better able to tell whether or not you’re devoting an appropriate amount of energy to each aspect of your life.;
, There are no right or wrong answers, but be honest. Maybe traveling brings you the most joy, or maybe it’s a well-cooked meal. Maybe you love talk about books, and you should practice literary criticism. Maybe you like to be the one writing the books, not the one talking about the books other people have written.


The list might evolve over time. What makes you happy at twenty might not be what makes you happy at thirty. Don’t be married to an image of “who you are” — update your list over time to reflect what makes you happy in the present moment.

, Having “stuff” makes a lot of people happy, but don’t fool yourself into thinking that just having things is the root of joy. You may want a nice sound system because you love music, but focus on your love of music, not the sound system.Be aware that going to concerts, singing with friends, and whistling on your drive to work are all equally important elements that work with the fancy sound system to bring you joy.

, Meditation can be incredibly beneficial for mental health and happiness, and can clear your mind so you can see your priorities more clearlyAlthough it has religious and mystical roots, meditative techniques can be used by anyone for relaxation and stress relief.


Find a tranquil environment free from distracting sounds and activities — someplace where you can clear your mind and focus on your state of being.
Sit in a comfortable position like the lotus position with your eyes closed, and focus on your breathing.
Inhale and exhale slowly, deeply, and purposefully.
Focus on your breath, how it feels entering and exiting your body. Be present fully in your body in the moment, and do your best to think of nothing else.
Do this at the same time every day to make it part of your routine. Early in the morning, before you go to work, is a good time for meditation because it calms and prepares you for the rest of your day.

, If you’re a great public speaker, and you really enjoy giving presentations, you’re wasting your talents away coding programs at a desk. Maybe you should be a teacher instead!


Are you a good speaker?
Do you work best alone or in teams?
Do you work best when you’re given tasks, or when you have to lead your own projects?

, Although not everybody can have a career in something they’re absolutely crazy about, most people should be able to match up interests and careers to some degree.


There are many tests you can take to figure out what kinds of jobs are best matched up with your interests., Some people can’t stand the idea of working every day from 9-5 in an office setting. If you need the flexibility to work at your own pace, during your own work hours, from a setting of your choosing, maybe you need to find freelance or contract work. Other people could not imagine the constantly shifting schedule of a university professor, for example, and crave the stability and ritual of a 9-5 workday and Monday to Friday workweek.


Ask yourself what kind of schedule would work best with your work habits.
Don’t choose freelance work if you slack off and lose focus easily!
Note that freelance and contract work is less stable than regular office work, and usually does not offer benefits.

, Although you shouldn’t ever choose a career just for the money, you also don’t want to labor away without ever making enough money to support yourself and your family. Calculate a budget for how much money you’ll need to maintain your family at a level of comfort that’s acceptable.


Search online for average salaries in various career paths.Figure out if the career you’re thinking about will work with your budget.

, You need to put everything on the backburner except for your career satisfaction.


To prepare for a career change, you should begin saving as much money as possible. A career change sometimes means you have to start your new job at a lower-paying position before you can work your way back up the ladder.

, What are your most uncompromising, unchanging beliefs? Some examples might be:


You want a big family vs. you don’t want kids
Religious beliefs
Feelings about marriage and/or divorce

, Prioritize the things you’re looking for in a relationship and figure out what the five most important elements are. Some examples might be:


Sense of humor
Good-looking
Shares your taste in music or other hobbies
Enjoys/avoids outdoor activities
Financial stability

, Regardless of how great a romantic partner you find, you’ll never be happy in a relationship until you can be happy with yourself.You’ll also have a better idea of what you want and need in a partner if you’re the best version of yourself that you can possibly be, and you’re happy with it.

, Admit that you’re never going to find someone who meets your entire checklist, and just be open to spending time with the people you feel a connection with.

, Some people know from a young age that they want to be parents, but it’s not so obvious an option for many. There’s nothing wrong with that! Don’t let anyone — parents, friends, society at large — pressure you into a choice you don’t want for yourself. Some things to keep in mind include:


Are you called to parenthood? Though it’s more commonly ascribed to women (biological clocks, maternal instincts), both men and women sometimes just feel the urge to start a family. Other times, that need simply isn’t there.
Can you afford a family? As of 2014, the estimated cost of raising a child from birth to legal adulthood is $245,000.How much wiggle room will that give you, based on your family income? Will you be able to give children a good quality of life? Will you have a comfortable retirement?
Do you understand the realities of parenting? Although most all parents will say that their children are their greatest joy and achievement, they’ll also tell you how hard it is to raise a child. As a parent, it will be your responsibility to safeguard your child against all dangers, to provide them with the best possible life, and to socialize them into a responsible citizen of the world. You’ll have to put up with temper tantrums and expensive Christmas lists, etc., etc. It’s a hard job!
Remember that women can always have their eggs frozen if they choose not to have children in prime child-bearing age.Although it’s difficult to get pregnant as women’s bodies age, freezing young eggs gives you a better chance at having a child if you choose to start a family later in life.

, If you decide that you do, in fact, want to have children, the next step is to figure out how large you want your family to grow. Again, some of this is just instinct; some people can just feel in their bones that they want a large family. But there are many practical considerations you should keep in mind.


Again, each child will cost about $245,000 over their 18 years of legal childhood!
How much attention can you devote to each child? A single child will get as much attention as their parents have to offer, but with each additional child, your attention will grow more and more diffused over your growing brood. How much time will you have to drive each child to their individual after-school activities, help with homework, listen to them talk about their days, etc.?
How much companionship do you want your child to have? Even if you can’t devote undivided parental attention to a child, having many siblings means your children will always have playmates to keep them occupied and to help each other through the trying emotional times when they don’t always turn to their parents.
Remember that with your third child, you are officially outnumbered. With two children, one parent can manage each in a given situation, but with three children, there’s a spare child running loose!

, Though traditional gender roles see a man in the workplace and a woman raising the children at home, these days, both men and women should feel equally comfortable in either role.


Childcare for children whose parents work can be so expensive, depending on where you live, that it may not be worth the income from your job.Would be comfortable with other people spending that much time raising your children, regardless of how much you trust them?
Do you want to be present for all of your child’s developmental milestones, and would working in an office get in the way of that?
Would staying at home with your child all day make you feel claustrophobic, or like you’re being defined solely by your identity as a parent?
Would staying at home keep you from the passions and interests you get to explore every day at a job you love?

, Despite what a legion of parenting books would have you think, there’s no right or wrong way to be a parent. After all, people raised children for centuries without guidebooks. It is important, though, to think about what kind of parent you want to be to be as happy as possible.


Do you want to be a hands-on parent who walks their children through all of their decisions and activities, or do you want to be a more laissez-faire parent who lets their children make and learn from their own mistakes?
How involved do you want to be in their education? Will you check homework every night? Assign extra homework outside of class? Or let more qualified teachers handle their education?
How do you want to reprimand your children when they make mistakes? Would you feel more comfortable in a good cop or bad cop role? Another way to think of it might be “do you want to be more of a coach who helps make good decisions, or a referee who identifies and punishes mistakes?”
Do you put your children first before all others, or does your marriage take priority? What about your personal happiness?

Study his/her hobbies, mannerisms and style.,
Stay attuned to world events.,
Study up on pop culture.,
Ban all electronics except for your cell phone and computer.",How to Keep up With a Hipster," The only way you can keep up is to have a good handle on his/her essence and understand what exactly makes him/her a hipster. However, avoid direct copying--doing so will only make you look crazy and a little creepy.


Find out what’s not trending and follow that. As crazy as it sounds, a true hipster acts like he/she marches to the beat of a solo drummer. If a certain style is popular, steer clear of that particular style. The same goes for music, art and pop culture. Look for the most obscure entity and dig that.
Study his/her appearance and style. Outward appearance will give you the first indication that you are dealing with a hipster. How does your hipster friend dress from day to day? Most likely you are surprised on an ongoing basis with the outfits he/she emerges in daily so be ready to search for a pattern. Also, hair and makeup or skin is another important feature to study. Does this person wear a popular style or is it something far out of the ordinary?
Write down certain catch phrases and habits. Not only is appearance importance, but also mannerisms are equally as vital. Also, hipsters seem to have certain catch phrases they like to use. Figure out what they are and keep them in mind ( but avoid dropping them too often or else you’ll look like a copycat).;
, Typically most hipsters may not overtly say they are smarter than the rest of the population, but usually think this to be true. If you really want to keep up with your hipster friend, you’ll have to know what’s going on in the world so you can contribute some smart facts during a conversation.


Read the global headlines. Glean the front page of a reliable news resource such as CNN or MSNBC for the latest on world events. Look for articles that surround politics and policy, which could most likely be brought up during dinner or drinks.
Don’t neglect local news. The notion of “think globally, act locally” applies especially for hipsters. Read news about local elections and hot topics. Try to draw a correlation from local to national and then global in order to make you look even smarter.
Troll local event rags. In addition to mainstream media, check out the local, hipster papers that discuss controversial and alternative ideas and events. Find out when the hot bands are playing in your area and discover where the newest, “impossible to get into” restaurant is located.

, Keeping up with your hipster friend means that you will need to be well rounded not only on serious and world events, but also pop culture. Making a Kim Kardashian joke takes finesse and even a little background knowledge so know what you are talking about (and what’s being discussed at the hipster table) by taking a trip down tabloid lane.


Consider following pop culture comedians. People like Kathy Griffin or Bill Maher, who dish solely on celebrity or political faux pas may be helpful in arming you with good insight into stardom ridiculousness.
Check out the tabloids--but only for fodder. Don’t take the headlines seriously, but at least if the notion is raised about a certain celebrity’s breast augmentation, you’ll know what people mean.
Listen to alternative music. Avoid mainstream radio and hit the alternative satellite radio bandwidth. Get into an obscure (hopefully up and coming) band, which you can encourage your hipster friend to listen to as well.

, In a society so married to their electronics, hipsters act as though they don’t require mainstream media to sustain their interest.


Buy a lot of books. Hipsters proclaim to be fans of the written word, however not “Fifty Shades of Grey” books, but great works or deep political or award winning works of fiction. If at all possible, purchase books that most people would never attempt to read on their own such as “Ulysses” where you’ll need a book to translate what’s in the book.
No TV. No sitcoms or (gasp) reality TV for the true hipster. In fact you won’t find a single television set in many hipster’s homes. It’s just not cool to watch the boob tube.
No land line. Land lines are for old people. A real hipster only uses a cell phone because he/she is always on the move and too busy to be lolly-gagging at home. Pick up an iPhone or Android--something that will allow you to accomplish just about anything via phone.
Only watch podcasts or foreign films and then discuss them at length during dinner. Obscure or foreign films are a favorite amongst hipsters. The more surreal the better so check out the Sundance Channel or IFC (but don’t tell anyone you are actually watching TV) to find out what’s being watched. Also, podcasts are pretty popular if they surround science or the environment. Check one out on your laptop and take notes while it’s on.

Make a list of your traits.,
Examine your attitude and actions.Some studies suggest that your personality influences how you approach situations and your outlook on life.Other research suggests that personality traits influence behavior.So, look at your attitude and actions to understand how to define your personality.,
Pick three characteristics that summarize you.",How to Define Your Personality1," Traits are the parts of you that don’t usually change much over time.They are characteristics about you that may be positive, while others might be a bit more negative. Your personality is the sum of all these traits and characteristics and is what makes you a unique person. Listing your traits can help you define your personality.


For example, you might write that you are sensitive, caring, stubborn, determined, ambitious, hard-working, and dependable.
Use words that describe how you think, behave, and feel in general.For instance, you could include: calm, a night owl, sociable, a good planner, or helpful on your list. Look at lists of personality traits online that others have used to define themselves. See which ones are applicable to you, then add words of your own.
Include words that family and friends frequently use to describe you. For example, if they are always telling you that you’re comical, put it on the list. You may even ask family and friends to help you find descriptive words for yourself.;
,


Consider your attitude towards change. Write about a major change in your life. For example, you may write that you felt nervous and worried when you moved.
Think about how you handle challenges and obstacles. Then consider how likely you are to take risks, and how you respond to failure or set-backs. Write down the personality traits that come to mind.
For example, think about how you react when someone is rude to you. You might write, “I calmly tell them to stop and try to figure out what’s wrong.”
Think about the things you do. Would you describe them as individual activities or social?
For example, gardening, reading, and painting are individual activities. Social activities are things like team sports and participating in clubs and organizations.

, Think about three words that could be used to describe most of the things on your list. These three words will help you define your personality.Look over your list and find the words that could be used as synonyms, or to describe some of the other words.


For instance, ‘ambitious’ could be a word to summarize being determined, hardworking, and goal-oriented.
As another example, energetic, fun-loving, independent, and thrill-seeking could be described by the word ‘adventurous’.
Identify those three (no more than five) words that would tell someone about you in general if that was all they had to go on.
You might determine that you are outgoing, active, and easy-going, for example.

"
"
Observe real people.,
Read descriptions of people from authors you admire.,
Decide how you are using your description.,
Extensive detail doesn't mean good.,
Show don't tell.,
Write more than one draft of your description.,
Remember that descriptions should move the story along.,
Keep writing.",How to Describe People," As with dialogue, you have to observe real people to be able to replicate that realness with words. So grab a pen or pencil and something to write on and get out into public.


Observe strangers in a public place, like the mall or a coffee shop or even the library. Write down descriptions of them. What are they wearing? What color is their hair? How are they walking? Are they striding confidently, or are they hunched over and furtive? What quirks do you observe? Do they tap their fingers as they drink coffee, are they chewing on a pen? Are they laughing to themselves?
You don't have to write an entire description while you're observing, just jot down a few notes to give yourself ideas for later. All these observations tell us something about a person and you'll need them for when you start describing people.
Pay attention to your family and friends. They all have habits and personality quirks that you've become accustomed to. Start jotting those down, as well. Describing people you know well can be great practice.;
, You aren't looking to copy them exactly but to figure out what works for them and why it works. Analyzing someone else's work is important, because it gives you ideas on how to make your own work do something similar.


""Crowley had dark hair, and good cheekbones, and he was wearing snakeskin shoes, or at least presumably he was wearing shoes, and he could do really weird things with his tongue. And, whenever he forgot himself, he had a tendency to hiss. He also didn't blink much.""This description gives an outline of physical features, but leaves most of the formation up to the reader. What it does do is highlight Crowley's ""otherness,"" because Crowley, is in fact, a demon. Other things that can be gleaned from this one passage: Crowley wears good clothing (the snakeskin shoes), he is trying to fit into being a human, but not quite succeeding, and he doesn't always maintain control over himself.
""Suddenly Frodo noticed that a strange-looking weather-beaten man, sitting in the shadows near the wall, was also listening intently to the hobbit-talk. He had a tall tankard in front of him, and was smoking a long-stemmed pipe curiously carved. His legs were stretched out before him, showing high boots of supple leather that fitted him well, but had seen much wear and were now caked with mud. A travel-stained cloak of heavy dark-green cloth was drawn close about him, and in spite of the heat of the room he wore a hood that overshadowed his face; but the gleam of his eyes could be seen as he watched the hobbits.""Aragorn's introduction gives clues that he is not what the Breefolk think him--his clothing is well-made, but it is worn. He smokes a ""curiously carved pipe"" which speaks to his odd origins. Tolkien shows him being interested in the hobbits, but being removed, casting onto doubt his intentions.
Notice that both these descriptions are part of the story. They set-up further action instead of stopping it to describe every detail. The Tolkien example, frames the first look at Aragorn as being done by Frodo, who is noticing the character's interest in him. This passage also highlights Frodo's own heightened wariness.

, Descriptions can be as long or as short as they need to be to accomplish your goal, but those goals are different for each writer. Both examples above are introducing the person, but that isn't always the case.


Word choice is important. It will be different depending on the person. In the above Tolkien description the pipe and the ""dark-green cloth"" are clues that this character is not the bad guy he might be presented as. Think about what you are trying to invoke with your description.
Another example of word choice: ""Rose was waiting on a bank of seats in the foyer, and for a split second Laurel saw her as one might a stranger. She was wrapped in a purple crocheted shawl that gathered at the front in a pink bow, and her wild hair, silver now, was roped in a loose plait over one shoulder. Laurel suffered a pang of almost unbearable affection when she noticed the bread tie holding her sister's plait together.""This passage describes both Rose and Laurel, but gives the reader Laurel's thoughts. It shows Laurel loves her sister (and not just that, but that a certain trait of her sister's draws out that love), it shows that she is feeling removed from her family. It also paints Rose as absentminded, and feminine. She uses a bread tie for her hair, she wears a purple crocheted shawl. The chosen words evoke this description.

, Don't feel you have to describe every last detail of the person. You want to be specific enough to give your reader something to imagine, while still leaving much of that imagining up to your reader.


Hemingway's short description in this example works to both describe Catherine, and the narrator's interest in her: ""She had wonderfully beautiful hair and I would lie sometimes and watch her twisting it up in the light that came in the open door and it shone even in the night as water shines sometimes just before it is really daylight.""A good rule of thumb for writing descriptions is using no more than three of the five senses. So if you've evoked sight and sound and smell, it's not necessary to bring in touch and taste. This is only a guideline, of course, but it's something to consider., While telling isn't always bad, showing will help bring the description to life. In the examples above, Tolkien doesn't say ""Aragorn was dirty and didn't want to be part of the crowd."" He draws attention to the wear and tear of his clothes, the mud on his boots, and the manner in which he is sitting in a corner with his hood over his face.


An example of telling: ""Margaret had red hair and was very tall. She didn't like it and wished people wouldn't notice her, so she was buying hair dye."" The problem here is that this description gives everything away, without evoking anything. It also doesn't vary its sentences. They both have a similar rhythm.
Now the example of showing: ""Margaret towered over most people. She refused to wear high heels, and when she walked she hunched her shoulders and ducked her head. Her shock of flame-red hair didn't help. Now she stared at the dye options on the shelf in front of her, biting her cuticle."" What happens here is that the reader feels Margaret's discomfort with herself, without it being spelled out (apologies for the pun). Active words are used: ""hunching,"" ""ducked,"" ""towered,"" ""stared,"" ""biting."" Her actions are described. She won't wear high heels because she hates being noticed, which both her height and her hair made impossible. The description gives the reader an idea of her appearance, as well as her personality.

, Your first draft will not be perfect. In fact, it probably won't be very good. That's okay! Rewrite it multiple times.


Try to avoid adverbs. These pesky little words are often used when telling instead of showing. Your writing will be stronger if you find other ways of showing the emotion, or description, that the adverb is telling. Examples of adverbs: lovely, slowly, quickly, angrily, pleasantly.
Read your description out loud. Hearing your writing out loud will help you understand the rhythm of your writing, and help you to eliminate any clunky phrases or odd wording.
Have a trusted friend or family member read it and give you their suggestions. Your brain will often overlook errors, because it already knows what the description is supposed to look like. Having someone else read your description will also help you know if you evoked the person well enough.

, A reader will often give up if description goes on and on without providing story to go with it. Make sure that you're providing insight into the character, or story in your description. By focusing on three things you'll make sure that your description keeps the reader interested. Pay attention to this when you're editing your description.


Motivation of a character: Giving motivation of the character gives the reader something to imagine along with the description and to see how this person fits into the framework of the story. Margaret's motivation, for example, in the paragraph is that she will do all kinds of things to avoid being noticed, like dying her hair.
Specific detail: Again, this has to come as a balance with too much detail on one hand and too little on the other. Margaret , from the example, hunches, towers, ducks her head and has flame-red hair.
Insight into a character: what does the description reveal about the person being described? For Margaret, it's that she hates being tall and that she doesn't want people to notice her and that she is anxious.

, The more you write, the better you will get. So keep reading and analyzing and writing. It takes practice to be skilled at anything, so practice, practice, practice your descriptions.


Look back over your early work. You will be amazed how far you've come and you can take that opportunity to examine what does and doesn't work in your earlier descriptions.

Try the Big Five to describe your personality.This popular and well-researched method, also called CANOE or OCEAN, categorizes your personality in terms of a combination of five areas or dimensions: conscientiousness, agreeableness, neuroticism , openness, and extroversion.Using this system can help you define your personality using terms that have been researched and that many people understand.,
Determine how conscientious you are.,
Examine how agreeable you are.,
Look for signs that you might be neurotic.,
Ask yourself if you are open to experiences.,
Decide if you are extroverted.",How to Define Your Personality2,"


For each trait, consider whether you would describe yourself as ‘high’ or ‘low’ on that dimension or more or less like that trait.
Compare your list of traits, attitudes, and behaviors to the descriptions of the Big Five personality types to help define your personality.

, If you’re highly focused on your goals, organized, detailed-oriented, considerate of your impact on others, and reliable you can consider yourself conscientious.Conscientious people are less impulsive and more deliberate in their actions and plans. On the other hand, you may be low in conscientiousness if you are more impulsive and spontaneous.


For example, if you’re more conscientious and are invited on a spur-of-the-moment vacation, you would think about how much it will cost or how it benefits you.
A less conscientious person would just go on the vacation without worrying so much about these things.

, You are likely to define yourself as agreeable if you are kind, helpful, trusting Or if you think about ways to bring people together and make things run smoothly.You might describe yourself as less agreeable, or disagreeable, if you are more skeptical and suspicious of people, and look out more for your own interests, or if you find that you often come into conflict with others.


If you tell yourself things like, “I can cut some of the tension in this situation and help us compromise” you are probably high in agreeableness.
Thinking things like, “They probably have a secret motive. I’ll just do what’s best for me” is characteristic of people that are more disagreeable.

, Be honest and ask yourself if you are very emotional or sensitive, moody, or unpredictable and emotionally intense.If you cry frequently, apologize unnecessarily for things you do or say, or find friendly physical contact stressful, these may be signs that you are high in neuroticism. People that are lower in this dimension are calmer, less excitable, and more emotionally stable.


For instance, if everyday things like traffic jams or missing the bus completely ruin your mood and your day, you may be neurotic.
If you aren’t bothered by small nuisances and daily challenges, you are probably low on neuroticism.

, If you have an open personality, you are okay with change, like new experiences, and learning new things. You are flexible, view life as a chance to explore, and define your personality by your curiosity.You might be more closed if you are more conservative and prefer routine and tradition to new experiences.If you say to yourself, “This is a chance to have a new experience that could turn into an epic adventure with amazing people” you are likely open.
If you would rather stick with the safe, conservative plan rather than try the risky one, you are probably more closed.

, You could define yourself as extroverted if you are outgoing, enjoy spending time with others, and like doing things in public. On the other hand, if you are more quiet, enjoy time alone, and less energetic you would define yourself as an introvert.For example, you are extroverted if you think to yourself, “How can this be fun? What new people can I meet?” when your friend tells you about a party. You may be introverted if you would prefer to stay home and read or work on a craft project than go to the party.
Keep in mind that shyness and introversion are not the same. You may be good with others but prefer to be alone, or you may want to be social but struggle finding common ground. Look at your desire to be with others as an indicator.

Learn about Type A/B personalities.,
Identify your Type A personality traits.,
Decide if you are more of a Type B personality.",How to Define Your Personality3," Defining people as either a Type A or a Type B personality is very popular, especially in the business world. This system of classifying personalities into one of two overall types also has research linking it to health and achievement.You can define your personality by finding out whether you are more a Type A person or more of a type B person.


Take an online personality type quiz like the Personality type A/B Test on the University of North Carolina Charlotte website.You may also look back on previous work evaluations or job feedback to give you an idea.
Compare your list of traits to the characteristics of Type A and B personalities. Look to see if you have more traits that are Type A or more that are Type B, keeping in mind that most people have traits that fit into each category.

, Type A personalities are generally successful, hard-working and very conscious of time. If this fits you and you are also competitive and goal-oriented, you may define yourself as a Type A personality.Type A people are also often more hostile, stressed, anxious, and impatient compared to Type B people.
For example, if you tend to get very stressed and extremely upset when something makes you even a little late, you may be Type A.
Or, for instance, you might be Type A if you would skip a night out with your friends without a thought in order to finish a report.
Check your list of traits to see if you mentioned words like: hard-working, driven, busy, focused, or impatient to see if you are Type A.

, You may define yourself as Type B if you are more laid back, creative, and tolerant of others.Type B people are late more often than Type A, but also have less anxiety.


Look at your list of traits to see if you included: relaxed, easy-going, peaceful, not always reliable, or a good imagination.
Think about whether you usually procrastinate when you have assignments or work to do.
For example, would you rather play a game of basketball than work on a report that’s due?

Explore the Myers-Briggs system.,
Find your Enneagram type.,
Use the Keirsey Temperament Sorter.",How to Define Your Personality4," This personality system is based on research by the psychologist Carl Jung and is widely used.The Myers-Briggs categorizes personality along four dimensions. Each dimension has two opposite preferences associated with it. Combining your preference from each of the four dimensions will define your personality according to one of 16 possible types.


The four dimensions are: introversion/extraversion (I/E); sensing/intuition (S/N); thinking/feeling (T/F); and judging/perceiving (J/P).
Compare your personal list of traits to your preferences on each of the four dimensions on the Myers-Briggs.
For example, does your list indicate you are more of an ‘I’ or an ‘E’? Do you have more words related to thinking or feeling?
You might, for instance, be a ISFP (introverted, sensing, feeling, perceiving) personality based on the traits on your list.

, With this system of personality classification you define yourself according to nine different personality types.Although there is usually some overlap between the nine personality types within a person, most people are more similar to one type than the other eight.


Evaluate your list of traits to see if they can be described by one of the nine types of personality according to the Enneagram system.
Look for clues that you are mostly a: reformer, helper, achiever, individualist, investigator, loyalist, enthusiast, challenger, or peacemaker.
For example, if you see traits on your list like: mediator, problem-solver, and diplomatic you may be a peacemaker.
Visit http://www.enneagraminstitute.com to learn more about using this personality classification system.

, You can use this system to define your personality along four temperaments or types: the guardian, artisan, idealist, or rational.Similar to the Myers-Briggs and the Big Five, there is a great deal of research related to the Keirsey system.


Use your list of traits to help you determine which of the four personality types, or temperaments, is most like you.
For example, do you have traits on your personal list like imaginative, peaceful, and optimistic that suggest that you are an idealist?
Many people use their Myers-Briggs type along with their Keirsey temperament to define their personality.
You can also take a short form of the Keirsey Sort at http://www.keirsey.com.

Don’t compete.,
Be patient and don’t take things personally.,
Set limits.,
Communicate and compromise.","How to Deal with ""Type A"" Personalities1"," Type A personalities can be very competitive, even with spouses and partners. They often lack self-esteem and carry a sense of dread, seeing any failure as a personal fault. Failure can therefore hit them hard and lead in some to depression or withdrawal. For the sake of your relationship, avoid competing with your Type A partner if at all possible – competition can lead to a toxic mix of inadequacy, jealousy, and resentment.Make it clear that you are not – and do not want to be – in competition with your partner. Type As may self-compare and develop of sense of being the “competent” member of the relationship, making it hard to celebrate a spouse’s success or have a relationship of equals.
Tell your spouse what you’re noticing and that you’re not interested, i.e. “You seem to keep score between us, and that’s not what I want. I want to work as teammate, not as competitors.”
Give gentle encouragement and feedback – Type A personalities can be very sensitive to criticism. Praise your partner and encourage gratitude, while avoiding the negative.;
, Type A personalities are also often perfectionists and can be very critical of others, including spouses, when they perceive a failure. Try not to get drawn into your partner’s critiques or take them to heart. They are really more about his own feelings of anxiety and self-worth than about you.Develop techniques to keep your cool, if you often find yourself becoming impatient. Try counting to 100 before you respond or taking a walk around the block. Also try to replace impatient responses with patient ones – like consciously speaking in a measured voice or writing your thoughts on paper instead of speaking.
It helps to try to understand what makes your partner tick. Type A personalities and perfectionists are often trying to mask other emotions; they may have had chaotic childhoods or are dealing with feelings of abandonment and micromanage to gain a sense of control.
When your partner, say, criticizes you over a minor point like the way you fold the bath towels, try to see it as a reflection of these emotions rather than a personal attack.

, A Type A personality’s assertiveness, perfectionism, and competitiveness can make them very controlling. Be ready to stand up for yourself. Be clear that you have boundaries and then set and uphold limits on your partner’s behavior. At the same time, don’t try to control the controller. Be assertive rather than becoming involved in power-struggles.Focus on high-priority issues. Take a stand on things that you really care about, like children’s schooling, rather than minor issues like the toothpaste tube.
Be calm and clear in upholding your limits, i.e. “I appreciate your advice, but I really want to do this my own way.” Be willing to repeat yourself, and share your feelings and tell your partner when he’s hurt you.

, Communication is the key to any successful relationship, but especially with a Type A personality. It is a two-way street, as well. Type As often assume they know best, but they will have to be willing to compromise for both parties to be happy. You can’t be the only one making allowances.Be honest but loving when communicating with your partner. Try to make him see that there is more than one “right way” to do things. For example, your method of cleaning the floors might be less efficient but it still does the job just as well.
Try to negotiate such things as housework and parenting styles, too. For example, you might agree to clean the bathroom every week, but insist that you can only do the laundry every other week.

Accept the positives.,
Don’t waste time.,
Give and take criticism very carefully.,
Set boundaries, again.","How to Deal with ""Type A"" Personalities2"," Type A personalities can be very hard to work with: micromanagers who are controlling, hypercritical, and do not always work well with others. That said, though, they can also bring positive qualities to the workplace. Remind yourself of these when you are feeling particularly frustrated with a Type A boss or coworker.Try to value your colleague’s perfectionism. While they can be irritating, you can rest assured that perfectionists will do a competent job and maintain or even raise your workplace’s standards.
Perfectionists are also completely involved in their work. They will be committed and emotionally invested in the task at hand.

, Type As are competitive, have a constant sense of urgency, and are usually able to manage a large amount of unrelated tasks at the same time. They will expect the same urgency and work ethic from you, too, as a matter of course. Be aware of these traits and try to satisfy them, especially if the resident Type A is your boss.The fastest way to get on a Type A personality’s nerves is to waste her time. Try to keep up and work at the same pace she does. Be to the point when talking, too. Type As appreciate clear and succinct communication.
Show up on time for work, meetings, and any other events. By being late, a Type A personality will feel that you are not worthy of her time and that you’ve robbed her of productivity.
In the same vein, have a clear schedule, goals, and deadlines when working together. Type A personalities dislike uncertainty and will appreciate the concrete timeline.

, Type A personalities tend to criticize others but bridle when others criticize them. This is because, deep down, they are insecure about their self-worth and only hear the negatives when getting feedback. The key to working well with this sort of person is to accept criticism, letting it bounce off you while learning to give gentle feedback.If it’s from your boss, don’t take the criticism to heart. Instead, remind yourself that this is just who your boss is – it is nothing personal. Don’t be tempted to respond in kind. Doing so will only make your boss angry or defensive.
You might frame any feedback in terms of asking for advice, i.e. “I’m not sure how best to help you with this project. Tell me, what sort of feedback would you find the most helpful?” This way, you won’t demotivate or demoralize your colleague.

, You may not be able to speak your mind if the Type A personality is your boss. However, you can make it clear to other coworkers that you are willing to accommodate their personality but not to bend over backwards. Be clear, kind, and collegial and don’t apologize for it. They will only interpret a concession as a sign of weakness.Avoid confrontations with a Type A boss. Say you are working on a project and your boss objects to some ideas that you’ve added. State your reasons for the additions calmly. However, don’t argue if she still insists that you remove them. Putting your foot down will only make the relationship tense, or even get you fired.
If your boss is asking too much of you, you can try to gently assert yourself. Say something like, “I really want to do this project exactly how you want it, but I also need to preserve some balance in my life.” Then, ask your boss for his thoughts and advice. If your boss responds well, consider asking how to handle similar situations in the future.
You can be less flexible with coworkers. For instance, you don’t need to accommodate a Type A peer who criticizes the way you talk, eat, or work around the office. Just say, politely, “This is just the way I am. I don’t think I can change.”
You might try a “hit-and-run” style of communication with difficult colleagues to assert yourself. State your position or what you want and then immediately excuse yourself, saying “Sorry, I have to run. I’ll talk to you later.”

Cultivate your child’s talents, but don’t overdo it.,
Set realistic priorities and goals.,
Teach your child to learn from failure.","How to Deal with ""Type A"" Personalities3"," Perfectionism is not a wholly negative trait. While studies show that perfectionists are more likely to develop depression, anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, and other conditions, there are also positives. Gifted individuals can often attain great achievements by striving for perfection. The key is balance.Be aware that perfectionism can be a powerful motivator for a child but is also a source of stress. Try to be sensitive to sources of pressure on the child, whether at home or at school.
If your child has a particular talent, encourage and celebrate it without going so far that your child comes to depend on your praise to feel good. Also, allow the child to take risks and to have safe opportunities to fail.
Consider pointing out positive, imperfect role models in the community or media so your child learns that no one can be perfect.

, You as a parent are your child’s main model for behavior and you too might be a Type A personality or perfectionist. The child will see your response to work, success, and failure and learn from it, so aim to moderate any unhealthy perfectionism in yourself. Try to set high but realistic personal priorities and goals.Avoid negativity when it comes to work. Saying “If I don’t get this project done on time, I’ll be so unhappy” shows a child that you equate your happiness with professional success. Instead, say something like “I worked hard on this project and did my best. It doesn’t need to be perfect.”
The same goes for praising your child. If the child makes something, say “I really like what you’ve made” rather than “It’s perfect!”
Help your child develop high but achievable standards. Encourage good grades at school, for example, but make it clear that the effort is what is important rather than a perfect mark. A “C” can be a good grade for a student who struggles with math, for example.

, Perfectionists usually see the world in black and white terms, either in success or failure. One way to counteract this mindset is to teach kids early on to focus on effort and process, not on the outcome. Show by your own example that failure is not a catastrophe but an opportunity to learn and improve.Let children know that mistakes are a normal part of life and learning. If your child is upset about a mistake or failure, avoid dismissing them by saying something like “Oh, don’t worry. It doesn’t matter!” Instead, recognize and validate the feelings. Later you can talk about the bright side of the situation and suggest ways for them to cope.
Praise effort and not just success, as well. Encourage children to self-assess and to examine failures to see how they can improve in the future.
Another way that you can temper perfectionism is by reminding children that they can’t control everything. Teach them to focus on what they can control, like work ethic, attitude, preparation, and level of effort.

Get rid of negativity in your life.,
Make sure your relationship is healthy.,
Look for the positive.,
Be kind to others.",How to Change Your Attitude1," If there are people, activities, or situations in your life that continually feel stressful, you may need to let them go. A change in attitude depends on living a new kind of life. This might mean quitting drinking, using drugs, overeating, or smoking. Whatever the negative parts of your life may be, you'll need to let them go if you're going to develop a better attitude.


Consider joining a support group for people who are similarly motivated to change their lives for the better.
In making these changes, chances are you'll notice some patterns of positivity in your life. No one's life is all bad, and by letting go of the parts of your life that no longer serve you, you'll become more aware of the habits you want to strengthen.;
, If you're in an intimate relationship with another person, this will affect your attitude. A healthy relationship should be positive, and result in feeling better about yourself. If you feel pressured to do things you don't want to, are afraid of the consequences of disagreeing with your mate, or if there is yelling or physical violence during arguments, your relationship may not be healthy. This will negatively affect your attitude.Some disagreement is natural in healthy relationships. Most relationships have some combination of healthy and unhealthy characteristics.
Talk to a counselor together with your partner if you find yourself unable to change the unhealthy patterns on your own.
If you are in a relationship that is violent, or emotionally or physically abusive, seek help with a local domestic violence agency. You can find these agencies in the United States by calling 211.

, There's always something in any situation that is worth praising. For example, if it's raining out, you could either complain that you're getting wet, or you could observe that the plants will likely benefit from a good soak. Someone with a negative attitude can easily find the downside of any circumstance, but to develop a positive attitude you should force yourself to notice the good. Share your positive observations with others, and keep negative remarks to yourself.

Make sure to look for the positive in yourself as well.
Remember that everything is an opportunity to learn new skills, especially the things that feel most difficult at first. If nothing else, you can be grateful for the chance to learn new things in a bad situation.
Never stay in a situation simply because it's bad. You may be tempted to pretend that unhealthy behavior — a racist boss, an abusive partner, an emotionally manipulative friend — is providing a good opportunity for you to learn patience and tolerance. While this may be true, staying may not be the healthiest choice. One of the most positive things to learn from a bad situation is that you can leave.

, One of the quickest ways to feel better yourself is to be kind to other people. Whether this involves letting someone else have the right of way in traffic or writing a note to cheer up a friend, taking an action to help someone else will increase your positivity.For best results, find ways to do kind things for others in a way that is completely anonymous. For example, fill up all the coin slots in a laundromat with quarters when no one is looking.
Don't just think of how you would want to be treated; imagine the way another person might want to be treated. For someone who's very shy, perhaps writing him a note to congratulate him on his presentation might be kinder than giving him a loud compliment and hug in front of others.

Write a daily gratitude list.,
Send thank you cards.,
Practice meditation or prayer.,
Start a gratitude jar.,
Stop complaining.,
Take ownership of your thoughts and actions.",How to Change Your Attitude2," Every day has something to be grateful for, but some days gratitude is harder to find than others. To develop the discipline of finding gratitude on even your hardest days, practice writing a daily list.Some research suggests that writing gratitude lists by hand is a valuable part of this process. The physical act of writing by hand slows down your attention in a meaningful way.
If you really can't think of anything to be grateful about, pretend to feel grateful. Remember, you're still learning to change your attitude. Consider gratitude as, ""Hey, it could be worse.""

, Learning to say ""thank you"" is an essential element of changing your attitude, and living in positivity. Whether you're expressing gratitude for something done recently, or something that happened years ago, write it down and share it with the person. Perhaps you want to let your 5th grade teacher know that her encouragement for your writing led to your blogging, or to thank your best friend for always sticking by you.If you want to write the note, but not send it, that's fine. The purpose of writing thank you notes is mostly to practice articulating appreciation. It might not be possible to find people from your past, or the person might be deceased.
Research shows that people who spend at least 15 minutes per week writing gratitude letters, over 8 weeks, show a demonstrable increase in positivity.

, Practicing meditation or prayer deliberately places the mind in the present moment, which is vital for cultivating a positive attitude. Find regular times throughout your day to engage in meditation or prayer. These don't have to last long; setting aside three to five minutes will result in a difference in your attitude.

If you practice a religion, you might turn to prayers found in this religion. If you don't consider yourself a religious person, practices of meditation might be more valuable.
Even though it may not feel like it, practicing meditation and prayer is a kind of exercise. The more you practice, the better you will become. You may not notice the difference at first, but over time you will be able to maintain a calm, peaceful attitude no matter what's going on around you.

, Keep a jar in a central location in your home, and every day write down one thing that you're grateful for that day. Watch as the jar fills with good things. If you ever need a ""pick-me-up,"" reach into the jar and read a few examples out loud.

For another kind of gratitude jar, try adding some change or a dollar to the jar every day when you write in your gratitude journal. When the jar is full, use the money to find creative ways to ""pay it forward:"" buying gift cards for unsuspecting people who might need the help, or buying flowers for someone who rarely receives recognition.If you're a crafty person, decorate your gratitude jar with ribbon, paint, or stickers.

, Instead, spend more time recognizing good aspects of your life. Consciously pay more attention to the positive things that you notice, allowing good things to become good experiences. Notice when you're tempted to complain, and try to find something positive to turn your attention to.
Complaining focuses your attention on what you'd rather have different without actually requiring you to do anything different. It keeps you in a position of powerlessness.

, If you believe that you are powerless to make any effective changes in your circumstances or relationships, you may find it difficult to change your attitude towards your life. Instead, try to recognize your own part in making each situation or relationship the way it is. If you can find your own part, you can work towards either accepting it or changing it.Knowing more about why you've made the choices you've made may help you to avoid making bad choices in the future.
Remember that while most negative circumstances are the result of a conscious choice made on your part, sometimes bad things happen despite careful planning. No one is immune from being in the wrong place at the wrong time.
If you can't find another way to think about a bad situation, ask someone for help. Talk to a counselor, a therapist, a trusted friend or another person. You don't have to face this alone.

Wake up earlier.,
Spend time with positive people.,
Notice what makes you happy.,
Try to respond, not react.,
Don't dwell on the past or the future.,
Focus on one thing at a time.",How to Change Your Attitude3," Waking up one hour earlier each morning allows you time to focus on yourself, your goals, and your intention to change your attitude. You might spend this time in meditation, or reading a favorite book. Having the time set aside to plan and reflect upon your day is an important tool in changing your attitude.If it's easier for you to take an additional hour at the end of the day, you can try this. Most, but not all, people find it more productive to take time in the early morning hours.
Don't allow yourself to waste the morning time in negative mind traps, like reading depressing news or scrolling through social media.

, If there are people in your life who leave you feeling drained, unproductive, and depressed, you may need to spend less time with them if you're trying to develop a new attitude. Avoid depressing news stories and take time to read uplifting journalism. Put yourself on a ""positivity"" diet, and minimize the amount of negativity you take in per day.This doesn't mean to abandon a friend who may be having a hard time, but if your friend's life is always full of drama and hardship, you may need to take a break.
If being around negative people is unavoidable (for instance, if it's your boss or supervisor) you may be able to put their negativity to use. Try to understand where it's coming from, and counter it with positivity.

, That sounds easy, but it may not be something that you're used to paying attention to. Try making a list of things that you do every day (or, most days), then make a second list of things that make you happy. Compare your lists, and see what changes you can make to include more happiness.Think about what adjustments you can make to your daily routine to include more things that bring you happiness.
Pause several times per day to take your happiness level. If you're feeling happy, think about the circumstances that have contributed to this feeling.

, When you're in a stressful situation, think about it, use reason to find a solution, and do what makes sense. When you react, you skip the reasoning stage and respond automatically. This only serves to cause more problems and frustration.When you're in a new, stressful situation, pause and take a deep breath before doing or saying anything.
If you can, take the time to think something out before giving an answer. Say, ""I need to think about it.""

, If you're trying to develop a new attitude, keep your attention on the present moment. When you find yourself worrying about the future, or revisiting difficult moments of the past, gently return your attention to the present moment.You might use a particular word or phrase to return your attention to the present, such as ""now"" or ""present"" or ""return.""
Don't berate yourself for losing focus. Remember, kindness is essential to developing a positive attitude.

, Research shows that trying to spread your attention too broadly results in increased stress and lower levels of concentration. Developing a greater amount of control over your attention will positively affect your feeling of well-being and positivity.Try not to keep multiple tabs up on your internet browser, and turn off your phone when you're watching television. If you are washing dishes, turn off the news. Doing one thing at a time, and doing it well, will increase your positive attitude.If you have to multitask, set aside specific times for it. When the time is up, return to your single-task outlook.
When you're having a conversation with a friend, turn off your phone.
Slow down your attention to be more fully present in every activity.

Define personality.,
Learn the big five personality traits.,
Learn about personality stability.,
Assess your personality.,
Identify the changes you would like to see.",How to Create a Different Personality1," Prior to identifying your own personality or the personalities of others, you must understand its foundational meaning. Personality is a set of traits, which include a person's mood, emotions, and behaviors. These traits should be pretty stable and consistent prior to labeling yourself or someone else with a particular personality. Your personality can affect both your mood and emotional responses.


Your personality will affect your self-esteem, and it can also influence your interests, morals, values, and belief systems. A person’s identified personality is shaped by many factors, such as, genetics, and personal experiences ( i.e., trauma, parenting, developmental history, etc.).;
, In order to create a new personality, you will have to be able to evaluate your current personality and define the new personality you want. To do this, you will need to understand what traits define a personality. The big five personality traits recognized by most psychologists are:Neuroticism
Extroversion
Openness
Agreeableness
Conscientiousness

, Understand that an individual's personality is usually much more consistent and stable than their mood or emotions. However, with conscious awareness and effort, it can be changed. A person’s personality is also subject to change as they mature through different phases of life, and as they go through life experiences. For instance, someone who exhibits more of an extroversion personality may become more introverted. If you have a personality that you feel needs changes for improvement, your best strategy is working with a psychotherapist. The psychotherapist will be able to help you identify certain traits you want to change, enhance problem-solving capacities, self-representation, and self-regulation to help you make the positive changes you wish to see in your personality.


Some of the psychotherapeutic modalities used during psychotherapy sessions include cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), and dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT).

, To make a change in your personality, you will need to have an objective look at your current traits. Rate yourself on each of the big five personality traits. This will give you a baseline for any changes you want to make.Take a standardized tests to rate yourself on the big five personality traits: https://ocean.cambridgeanalytica.org/quiz.html

See a mental health professional for more accurate results. Personality tests are common and frequently used tools with psychotherapists. It allows the psychologist and yourself to fully capture your personality, and work as a team to address any areas of concern you would like to change. These tests are much more detailed and accurate than those you would find online. Some of the more common personality tests used by psychotherapists include:

Meyers-Briggs Type Indicator
Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory
Rorschach Inkblot Test
Keirsey Temperament Sorter



, Once you have rated yourself on each of the personality traits, decide which ones you want to see change. You may want to express more of one personality trait and less of another. Make a list of which traits you want to change and in what way you want them to change.For example, you might decide that you want to be more agreeable and less neurotic.
As you make changes, you may feel the need to retest your personality. Try to use the same test that you used initially so that you can accurately compare the two results.

Make specific goals.,
Create actionable steps to meet your goals.,
Track your goals.,
Acknowledge progress.",How to Create a Different Personality2," Avoid setting vague goals such as, “I’m going to change.” This sets you up for failure, since you have no way to measure the success that you’ve had. Instead, set a goal that is specific enough to know when you’ve accomplished it.For example, you might have a goal like, “I am going to act in a more extroverted way for a month.”

, Once you have a goal, you need a path to reach it. This path should be made of actionable steps. Write these plans or steps down so you can keep track of your progress, what works for you and what doesn't work as you go along. These steps are things that you can actually do, not just plan.For example, if your goal is to be more extroverted for a month, you might make steps like, “I will talk to two new people at work and go to one party this month.”

, Once you start working on your new personality, you’ll want to know how effective the changes are. You should track each specific goal by keeping record of your actionable steps and their outcomes. You can also track your overall progress by re-evaluating where your new personality falls on the big five personality traits.For example, you could mark on a calendar each time you attend a social event or talk to a new person. This will let you keep track of how well you are doing at being more extroverted.
Another option is to keep a journal of all of your goals. Such as, those goals that you have achieved, and those that you are continuing to work towards. Detail the steps that you are making to achieve those goals, and those specific experiences, people, or things, that help you stay accountable and on track.

, Even if progress is slow, you should keep a positive attitude about your goals. To do this, you have to celebrate little victories. You shouldn’t give up just because you weren’t the life of the party in the first month. Instead, give yourself credit for having gone to the party in the first place."

Change how you identify your personality.,
Form habits that are consistent with the personality change.,
Continue to learn and grow.",How to Create a Different Personality3," How you see yourself is an important part of your personality. By believing that you are introverted, you may shy away from social activities. On the flip side, identifying yourself as an extrovert may can encourage you to go out and interact with people.You can affirm this identity by being sure to repeat it to yourself daily. You can also visualize yourself as being this new person.
Another way to affirm the identity is to take another personality test and see how your scores have changed over time.

, A personality change is only permanent if you continue to work at the changes. That means you will need to form habits that reinforce the personality that you have created. These will likely do simple, daily routines instead of major events.For example, if you’ve decided to be more conscientious, you could take time to meditate each day and be present in the moment.
Another consideration is to be mindful of the environment you put yourself in. Place yourself in environments that are in line with the personality you would like to reflect. Avoid hanging around people who reflect the opposite of the personality you would like to adopt. Develop connections and friendships with people who will help you through your personality change process. These friends should be reliable and available for you when you need them. They will help motivate you during times of challenge.

, Throughout the course of life, everyone changes. Even once you create your new personality, it will be subject to change. This is not a bad thing. The changes that your personality goes through are generally a result of growth and maturity."

Learn how to advocate for yourself or your cause.,
Ask questions.",How to Build Life Skills," One of the most fundamental skills of life is budget management. If you manage your budget poorly, you will struggle to make ends meet and may even have to borrow money from others. However, if you manage it well, you will be aware of your spending, reach your financial goals and be financially independent. Take some time to make a budget of all of your necessary expenses each month and try to honor that budget by not spending more than those amounts. Also, allocate a certain percentage of any money you earn or receive each month to put in your savings. You can do this manually or by using an app.

It is important to develop a spreadsheet for your expenses and income. You can do this manually with a program like Excel, or you can use a special software. You can also use websites like LearnVest to set goals and track your spending.
Make sure you are spending less than you make.;
, Another necessary skill is knowing how to properly manage your time. There are only a certain amount of hours in each day so use your time wisely and don’t squander it on unnecessary or unfulfilling activities. Write out a schedule for your week including any necessary tasks or projects and devote any extra time to leisurely activites.You can use a planner to keep track of all of your classes or meetings as well, or you can use an online calendar through Google and set up reminders. Include deadlines for important tasks and goals.
Make sure you are able to wake yourself up on time every morning without having to be told. Set alarms on your phone or purchase an alarm clock.
Give yourself some extra time between tasks to get everything done. For example, if you expect that a task will take you and hour, give yourself and hour and 30 minutes to complete the task. This is also a good way to improve your chance of being on time for appointments.
Be flexible. Keep in mind that despite your best efforts, things may still not go as planned. Remember that everything will be okay if you are late now and then or if a task takes you longer than you thought it would.

, Another necessary step in building your life skills is to be able to choose healthy foods. Make sure that you are choosing foods that are nutritious in nature, like whole fruits and vegetables, whole unrefined grains, beans and legumes, and lean protein. Avoid overeating by controlling your portion sizes.

If you still live at home, and your parents cook very unhealthy meals for the family, then you might ask them if they can try to cook at least one vegetable per meal. Or better yet, try to be a role model for your family by offering to cook healthy meals for them.
Choose the healthiest options for food at lunch.
Cut down on foods that are fatty and opt instead for fish and grilled or baked chicken.
Drink water instead of soda or other sugary beverages.

, Though you may not always have control over the options presented to you for lunch during school or even for dinner at night if your parents cook, you can learn to make some things for yourself. This will allow you to take control of your diet and makes things that will be good for your body. The better you become at cooking, perhaps the more often you will be able to cook for your family or others.

Start off with the basics - don’t begin by cooking complicated meals. Try making some meals that just have a few ingredients.
Make a basic salad for yourself or bake some chicken.
You can also purchase frozen vegetables which are easier to cook than those which have had no preparation.

, Stay active as well by working out two to three times a week. Put it in your schedule each week so that you don’t forget. Determine if working out in the morning or after school or work is best for you. Consider working out with a friend or family member to help keep yourself motivated.If you can’t get to the gym, take a walk around the block for 30 minutes or so everyday.
You can also YouTube some exercises so that you can do them from home.

, It is important that you know how to wash your own clothes and keep a clean room. Read the instructions on your clothes before washing them so you know what temperature water to use and how to dry them. Clean up your room everyday so it never gets messy and stays neat.Consider setting up a cleaning schedule for your room. For instance, you might dust your room on Mondays, vacuum on Tuesdays, etc.

, Another step in building life skills is taking initiative in completing tasks. The true marker of adulthood is being a person who takes responsibility and who goes beyond those responsibilities to help others. If you see a friend or family member struggling, do what you can to assist them and alleviate that burden.For instance, if your mom has just come home from work and has groceries in the car, go and help her without her having to ask.
Help your friends should they need tutoring in class that you are doing well in.

, If you are a child or even a young adult, your parents may do all of the appointment making for you and may also still order your food at restaurants. However, the day will come when they will not be available to do these tasks for you, so you must know how to do them on your own. Next time you have to make an appointment, ask your parents if you can do it for yourself. Practice ordering food by ordering for your family next time you are at dinner., Perhaps the most important critical thinking skill that exists is being able to think and make decisions independently of others. Though you should certainly heed the advice of others that are wiser than you, at the end of the day, it is your life to live and you have to make peace with that. Don’t allow your friends to tell you how to feel or what to do.Make sure that you listen to your parents and heed their instruction, but also note that you don’t have to do everything they say. You should keep your grades up and your room clean, but they can’t tell you where to go to college or where to work after graduation. You can be respectful while still making major decisions about your life.

, Another skill necessary in critical thinking is to think beyond yourself. If in developing a plan that will affect other people and you do not consider those people, then you are not thinking critically about the issue. When making a decision that will not affect only you, put yourself in the shoes of others so that you can identify a plan that will work for all.

For instance, if you are considering quitting your part time job because you don’t get along with a coworker, think about how this will affect your family and your other coworkers, as well. Though you may be happy temporarily, you will also have to ask your parents for money more often, which will likely stress them out.

, Remember that every action, even a small one, has a reaction. It is imperative that you consider the potential effects of any decisions that you plan to make so that you make the decision that will be best for you. Consider making a pros and cons list before making major decisions., A major part of developing this critical thinking skills is by doing your research on any topic or issue that you are interested in. In this age of technology, information is literally at your fingertips. Take advantage of it and expand your knowledge by researching topics of importance to you, as well as finding out about opinions that are not in line with your beliefs. The more you know about different perspectives, the better able you will be to make decisions and develop your own opinions and understanding of other people’s opinons.One way to do this is to simply google information you are interested in. For instance, if you want to know more about a certain war or country, google it and read a few articles about it.
Read the news in as unbiased a way as possible. Rather than relying on one news source, consider reading several different ones on the same topic so you don’t gather a biased perspective.

, Another way to develop your critical thinking skills is by problem solving. If you are accustomed to asking your parents or friends for help with certain things, try to instead solve the problem yourself sans advice. Take some time to first identify the issue, consider several possible solutions, and then select and execute the solution that you think is best.

For instance, as a very basic example, if you typically ask your dad for help getting something off of a top shelf that you can’t reach, consider ways that you could get the item yourself, like using a chair to elevate yourself.

, In order to make sure your mind is working at maximum capacity, you must exercise it and keep it active just as you would your body. Read as much as you can to develop your mind. You can also do things like playing board games with your family and friends, or downloading strategy or logic games to your phone and playing them throughout the day to keep your mind going. Journal out your thoughts at the end of each day to keep your mind sharp, as well.Read books on all kinds of subjects! Read fiction and non-fiction books to expand your knowledge, spark your imagination, and build your vocabulary. Try reading from genres that interest you, such as sci-fi, fantasy, nature, astronomy, biography, and anything else that sounds like a fun read to you!
Consider also carrying around sudoku or crossword puzzles in your bag.

, A mentor can help guide you professionally, academically, and socially. Consider people you know who’s career or academic paths are similar to something that you would want for yourself and reach out to them. This person will be able to give you unique and productive advice on how to achieve your goals.

You can reach out to this person by saying something like “I really admire your work ethic and I want to have a career similar to you one day. I was wondering if you would consider being my mentor.”

, It’s important that, as you are developing as an adult, that you are making plans and setting goals for your life and finding ways to achieve them. You should set short term and long term goals so that you can begin to see the fruits of your labor immediately while working towards achieving your more difficult goals as well.

Write these goals down and identify concrete ways to achieve them.
For instance, if you want to get all A’s this semester, then you will need to devote time everyday to doing your homework, studying and maybe staying after school.

, One other critical life skills is the ability to articulate yourself well on paper. Pay particular attention in your English classes so that you learn proper grammar and spelling. Read more books and articles to expand your vocabulary., When you speak, people should feel that you are self-assured and that you know what you are talking about. Use proper grammar in formal settings like work or school and look people in the eye when you speak to them. This conveys confidence.Develop an elevator speech. An elevator speech is a 20-30 second introduction to someone that is short but attention grabbing. You might say something like “Hello, I’m Devin. I’m a Junior at West End High School and I play football and am on the debate team.”

, A life skill that will take you far in your career, your social life, and even with your family is the skill of self-advocacy. You cannot rely on others to defend you or to defend things that are important to you; you must do that yourself. If you feel attacked or misunderstood, take a few moments to direct the conversation towards that. Let the person you’re speaking with know how you feel and clearly articulate why. You will gain respect and be understood.For instance, if after a group project, one of your group members says that you did not help the group, but you know that you did, you should correct them. You can say something like “I feel that you saying that I didn’t help is incorrect. I wrote three pages of the report and helped build the model. I contributed to the group just as much as you did.”
Don’t let people run all over you; make sure that you defend yourself.

, Remember that you don’t know everything. Questions are a critical and necessary aspect of life as an adult and can assure that you operate based off of knowledge and facts rather than assumptions. Should you ever have a question about something that you cannot research on your own, ask. This will provide you the clarity you need.

For instance, if your teacher makes a confusing comment in class, they may not even notice it. Ask for clarification.

Are you looking to change the root of who you are?
Are you looking to change your behavior?
Are you looking to change your personality?
Are you looking to find purpose in your life?;
, We often don't know ourselves as well as those who are closest to us. You can learn a lot about your personality, especially the good aspects, by listening to and observing people you interact with.

Also, you can learn about your nature by paying attention to your tendencies, desires, and wishes.

Talk to friends and family and discuss with them how they would describe your nature. Ask simply, ""How would you describe my nature?""
Pay attention to people who dislike you and why they may dislike you.
Learn from what you are passionate about and what brings you joy.

, If you believe your nature refers more to your personality, and you have become stuck trying to determine it, take a personality test to help you. Determining Your Myers Briggs Personality Type is another way to shed light on aspects of your personality or your temperament.It can show you where you may have strengths or weaknesses and give you a starting point to off of which you can build your idea of your nature.


If you are interested in taking a personality test, visit a psychologist or vocational specialist. Be wary of fake personality tests, especially those easily found on the internet.

, After you have determined what your nature is, or what you would like your nature to be, create a list or write out what you would like to change and what your goals are. It is important to write down these changes to make sure you are making clear and measurable goals to reach for.This also allows you to be specific and gives you a road map for where to begin.

Write at least three good things that happened each day as a result of changing your nature."
"
Be more spiritual.,
Practice positive thinking.,

Your higher power can refer to anything you believe in that is greater than yourself. It can be God, nature, family, a concept like love, or a nameless Higher Power.Your higher power may help guide you toward your true nature, your purpose, and motivate you to improve how you treat yourself and others. Try the following tips to help you become more spiritual:Find a form of spirituality that you are drawn to.
Develop regular practice of that form of spirituality such as attending services or meditating.
Utilize your spirituality during difficult times to help you cope.

, Let go of self doubt or hate.You are possibly looking to change your nature due to disliking or doubting yourself for the way you are. Before you are able to improve or change your nature for the better, you have to try to let go of the negative emotions you are feeling towards yourself.Show yourself some compassion instead.


Smile in the mirror at yourself. Talk to yourself the way you would to someone you love.Run through a list of things you're good at.
Confront negative thinking patterns. Try reframing any negative thoughts. Instead of thinking, ""I can never do that — I'm sure I'll fail,"" try saying to yourself, ""I'm scared I'll fail but I'm going to try, because I don't know the future.""
Congratulate yourself and be proud about making a positive change.

, Depending on your definition of nature, what you want might not be changing your nature at all. Instead, consider doing something that goes against your nature for a chance at at a better life!Try changing the way you think about situations and your reaction to them.


If public displays of affection make you uncomfortable but you want to be a more affectionate person with your partner, consider going against your nature for the sake of your relationship.
If you experience social anxiety, but desire to be a more outgoing or social person, consider making the decision to go out and do something social.

Change your social habits.,
Set realistic goals.,
Adopt new habits.,
Maintain your new nature.",How to Change Your Nature3," Interact with others differently. Many people with favorable natures are considered so due to habits they have developed of interacting with others and the world. Habits are something you can practice and learn. Begin to interact with people with your desired nature in mind. Be inspired by others by finding a person that can be a role model for the change you wish to maintain or the nature you wish to possess.


If you are more introverted by nature,but wish to be more extroverted, try and act like an extroverted individual.Behave as you believe an extroverted person would.
If you want to be a more charitable person, try volunteering more and drawing inspiration from giving and generous individuals.
Try being an encourager and an empathetic listener. Try to be a person who can feel what others feel, and then support and encourage them to go for what they want.

, When changing your nature, make sure the goals you are setting for yourself are realistic. Setting realistic goals will provide you with the best chance to be successful in making the changes you desire. It is also important to set goals that motivate you to change. Utilize the SMART acronym to help you set realistic goals. SMART goals are:Specific. Make sure your detail out the goal so that it is as specific as possible.

Measurable. Make sure you can measure your progress so you know when you have achieved your goal.

Achievable. Make sure your goal is practical so that you can be sure to achieve it realistically.

Relevant. Make sure your goal is relevant to the direction you want your nature to go.

Time-bound. Give your goal a deadline.

, After setting your goals, you should have a clear idea of what new activities or habits you should be working on. How you proceed with the changes to your nature will largely depend on what you want your nature to be and what you have identified as goals for yourself. Adopting new habits can be difficult. Try the following to help you adopt new habits:Schedule specific time to work on your new habits. For example, if you would like to be more spiritual or meditate more, schedule time to meditate when it works for your schedule, such as in the morning.
Use any tools you can to make adopting the habit easier on you, such as phone applications to help you meditate.
Keep track of how often you are working on your new habit by writing down when and for how long you are meditating per day.

, Make sure you are taking these changes at their natural speed and breaking larger behaviors or changes into smaller more manageable ones.Trying to be the cheeriest person in the office before you can even talk nicely about your friends will burn you out, and cause you to be unsuccessful in maintaining change. Make small improvements and turn them into habits. These habits will build on each other until you have fully changed your nature.


Practice. Just like learning a new skill, musical instrument, or language, the key to maintaining is practice. The more you practice the easier it will become for this new nature to be more natural to you.
If you are struggling, use helpers. Have a trusted friend or family member help you to make and maintain these changes.Spread out the changes. If you are making a change to your nature try and maintain the change in different settings such as home, school, work, and even errands like the post office.

Eat a diet rich in glucose.",How to Behave Yourself," Controlling your noise level is the biggest part of behaving. If you are having trouble maintaining an appropriate volume, stop and take a deep breath when you feel yourself getting louder. Collect your thoughts and convey what you want to say in a respectful and reserved manner. Pay attention to your noise level and you can better control it.


Try to limit what you're saying to who you're saying it to. You rarely have to say something to an entire group. Know who you're talking to, and speak with a voice loud enough that they can hear you.
Ask yourself if you really have to say something before you say it. If it's not necessary to the conversation, don't say it. Practice this technique regularly.
Listen to how loud the people around you are. Match their sound level.
If people are staring at you or reacting negatively, adjust your behavior. You should aim to fit in with whatever room you're in.
Don't draw unnecessary attention to yourself. If you try to dominate a room, you'll usually end up rubbing people the wrong way.;
, Make your goals specific and long-term. Psychology studies have shown that abstract, big-picture thinking leads to self-control.Instead of focusing on the moment, look toward bigger goals like success in school or sports. Focusing on the future will help you behave in the present.


Being goal-oriented will teach you the art of self-denial. If you get the desire for a soda or to slack off and play video games, deny yourself. Start with small goals like denying yourself ice cream on weekdays. Move up to harder goals like making the starting basketball team. Stick with your goals and soon enough you'll be in total control of your thoughts and actions.
Write down you goals and hang them up where you can see them regularly. Remind yourself of your goals regularly.
Make behavioral goals too. Commit to behaving yourself in public and not having any unintended outbursts.
Keep your goals positive. Get straight A's, keep practicing guitar until you're comfortable enough to play a gig, or exercise four times a week. Stick to your goals religiously.
Make sure your goals are specific. Vague goals are much easier to forget about.
When you are tempted to break a promise or a goal, take a deep breath and think about why you set the goal in the first place. That long term commitment is more important than your momentary impulse.
Try setting up a punishment and reward system for yourself. If you go a week sticking to a strict diet, give yourself a ""cheat day."" Likewise, if you decide to skip a workout, make up for it by working out twice as long the next day. Practices like these will lead to control over your desires and actions.
Make specific long-term goals with specific short-term ways to achieve them.

, Part 2 has more specific information on this, but generally speaking, be conscious of the rules in any social situation. Keep them in the back of your head. Whenever you start to break one, practice self control. Take a deep breath and remember that you have the strength and self-control to stop yourself.


Make a mental list of the rules of any social situation. Take note of all the rules before you even say anything.
If the rules are unclear, be passive and see how other people are acting. Aim to mimic their behavior. If the atmosphere is appropriate for lewd humor and loud talking, you would not be misbehaving by joining in. If the atmosphere is more professional, conduct yourself formally. If the atmosphere is relaxed, let go more but still watch your noise level.
Calming techniques like deep breathing usually work best for self-control, but find what works best for you. Maybe if you're about to break a rule, you can snap your fingers or pinch yourself. Whatever it is, have a method to stop yourself when you get the urge to break a rule.

, Suit your words to the situation, and choose those words carefully. In most situations, cursing and loud bickering is inappropriate. Avoid pointless arguments and critical statements. Generally speaking, if you don't have something nice to say, don't say it. If you find yourself starting to say something mean or inappropriate, stop yourself before it's too late. If you can't stop yourself, be sure to apologize after.


More relaxed or even crude language is sometimes appropriate if you're with close friends. Be sure you know the situation before you start talking though.
Around coworkers, teachers, or bosses, be very careful with your language. Be humble and understanding, and never curse or start fights.
Compliments and kind words are always appreciated.
If you find yourself wanting to say something mean, write it down instead. Just don't let anybody see what you write!
Don't interrupt people. Let them finish what they're saying before you speak.
Think before you speak. Thoughtless words can get you into trouble. Get in the habit of asking yourself if you're sure you want to say something before you say it.

, Take the self-control tactics you've learned and apply them to school. Set school-related goals for yourself and remember that those goals are the most important thing about school.


Your school goals should probably revolve around getting good grades and following your teacher's rules.
Remember to follow smaller class rules like no gum, no hats, being quiet when the the teacher is talking etc... All the rules are important. If you get the urge to break one, practice self-control.
Pay attention to the teacher. Listen carefully and take notes.
Don't talk over the teacher or any other students. Wait your turn, and always raise your hand unless you're in a small group or outside the classroom.
Come prepared for class. Have your homework done, all the handouts with you, and a notebook and binder.
Join in class discussions. Keep yourself from getting bored by engaging in the class material. Ask questions and respond to other students.
Make friends with good students. Your friends should be a positive influence on you, they shouldn't get you into trouble. Don't sit near any friends that do get you in trouble.
Always be on time.
If behavioral issues persist, talk to your parents, your teacher, and your school counselor. It's possible you have some form of Attention Deficit Disorder, or you just need extra help adjusting.

, Be polite and engage in pleasant conversation. Don't make a mess when you eat, and always use a napkin.


Always say thank you. If you're going out to dinner, thank your servers and if someone else pays, be sure to say thank you.
Don't reach over people for food. Ask them to pass the food instead.
Don't use your hands unless it's finger food. Use your fork and knife properly. Don't cut too hard, and use the utensils to bring the food to you rather than the other way around.
Have your napkin on your lap at all times. Use it frequently to clean food from your mouth.
Offer to pour drinks and serve food to other people. At the end of the meal, offer to help clean up.
If you're dining out, remember to tip 15 percent of the total bill.

, Commit to your work goals, and act professionally at all times. The workplace is usually not the time to make jokes and goof off. You need to be focused and productive. Get to work with the right mindset and your behavior will follow.


Get to work early. Aim to arrive 15-20 minutes before you're supposed to get there.
Have a clean workspace, and keep communal areas clean and organized.
Respect your boss and coworkers. Don't talk about people behind their backs.
Be attentive and take notes during meetings. Avoid having too much idle small talk throughout the day.
Take initiative and do extra work.
Focus on your work. The only time you wouldn't be behaving is when you're distracted and doing something to fill the time.
Fill your day with work, punctuated by several breaks. Use breaks to let off steam. Chat with coworkers, go on Facebook, go for a walk and stretch your legs. When it's time to get back to work, regain your focus.

, Your behavior isn't just your actions, it's your overall presence. Make sure you dress for the part.


For school, dress casual. For work or a formal event like a wedding, wear a suit or fancy dress. For a job interview or dinner, wear a collared shirt or nice blouse.
Excessively revealing clothing is better suited for the beach or home. Err on the side of modesty when dressing for public.
Avoid clothes with offensive sayings or images.
Make sure to maintain personal hygiene. Shower and brush your teeth every day and wear deodorant or perfume.

, A stress-free lifestyle makes you feel more in control of your life and your actions. When you're stressed or depressed, you're much more likely to feel like you're acting on autopilot. Most misbehavior comes from that loss of self-control. You should use relaxation techniques regularly and whenever you feel like you're losing control of a situation.


Learn yoga. Yoga is a great way to reduce stress and promote a healthier mindset. Start your day with yoga, and do yoga when you start to feel yourself losing control.
Meditate. Meditation has long been an effective and easy way to relax. Practice breathing through your nose. Focus on your breath and feel the world slip away. You can do this any time.
Take plenty of breaks throughout the day. Relaxation is key to maintaining self-control. If you're working all day, your mind won't have time to settle. Give yourself alone time or do an activity you enjoy.

, Learn your strengths and weaknesses. Specifically, learn when you are most likely to misbehave. Use that information to stop your misbehavior before it happens. Don't let yourself into situations where you misbehave, or find ways to stop your misbehavior. The more you know about yourself, the better equipped you are to control yourself.


A great way to learn about yourself is through writing. Make lists of your strengths and weaknesses. Be honest with yourself. When are you most in control and when are you least in control? When do you misbehave the most? What are the circumstances when you misbehave? Are you sad, stressed, hungry, or sleep-deprived? Once you find a pattern to your behavior, use that information and change your lifestyle to improve your behavior.
Another great way to learn about yourself is through meditation. Find a quiet place and just sit and focus on your breathing. After a while, you'll feel everything slip away. What's left is your self. Ask yourself questions and answer honestly.
Ask your friends and family what they see about you. Ask them how they think you could improve your behavior, and where they think any outbursts come from. Remember that they're there to help you. Just letting them know you want to improve can go a long way.
Take an online personality test. Though these aren't always accurate, they can help you realize things you already know about yourself.
Go to a therapist, behavioral specialist, or school counselor. Even if you're doing better, this can be immensely helpful in learning about yourself and how to behave yourself.
Use what you learn about yourself to improve your behavior. If you tend to misbehave when you're bored in class, practice engaging more with the material. Take notes and commit to learning the material, and you'll enjoy yourself more in class. If you tend to misbehave when you're in a stressful situation, work on stress management.

, Science has shown even a short workout can dramatically improve your self-control.A short, intense workout results in increased blood flow and oxygen to the pre-frontal cortex which is responsible for self-control. Moreover, making and committing to a long-term exercise program is a great way to practice self-control.


Aim to exercise at least four times a week.
You don't have to go to the gym to workout. Playing frisbee with friends or going for a bike ride can be both therapeutic and rewarding.
Try to get some physical activity every day. Walking or riding your bike instead of driving is a great way to work in physical activity to your daily routine.

, Doctors recommend seven to nine hours of sleep every night. Get on a healthy sleep schedule and stick to it. Studies show that sleep deprivation draining your pre-frontal cortex of glucose which fuel self-control.When you're sleeping your body replenishes glucose levels. Without enough sleep, your body may not physically be equipped for self-control.


Sleep improves all areas of health, not just self-control. Correcting your sleeping habits leads to improved mood, mental health, and physical fitness.
Be careful about oversleeping. When you sleep more than ten hours, you lose the benefits of sleep.

, Foreign substances can lead to abuse and dependency. This loss of self-control is the epitome of misbehavior. Moreover, drugs and alcohol impair your decision-making faculties, making you lose control further.


If you already use drugs and alcohol, work on quitting. Seek help from family, friends, and specialists.
Alcohol is acceptable in small amounts if you're over the legal drinking age. You should not have more than three or four drinks in a night, and those nights should be rare.

, Studies show that glucose is the key to self-control. Acts of self-control use up glucose stores, and when you're low on glucose, you won't be able to control your behavior as effectively. Periodically replenish your body's store of glucose throughout the day.

Lemonade or lemon water is a great source of glucose and hydration.
Fresh and dried fruits are packed with glucose. Strawberries and kiwi are particularly loaded with glucose.
Honey and fruit juice also have a ton of glucose.
Grains, beans, nuts, and almost all vegetables have glucose too.

Analyze yourself first.,
Seek to convince yourself that you want to be disciplined for the purpose of believing in yourself.,
Choose an area in which to be more disciplined.,
Adopt a positive attitude.,
Choose to behave and act with temperance.,
Learn the basics of self-management.,
Keep yourself neat and clean.,
Use appropriate gestures.,
Realize that others may try to deter you.,
Once you learn to do something correctly, keep doing it.",How to Bring Discipline into Your Life," Work out what things stand in the way of you being more disciplined at the moment. They may be character flaws, an inability to articulate what you want out of life or a preference for losing yourself in stimulants or addictions. Perhaps you conform too much without thinking for yourself; this can make it easy to follow someone else's ideas of discipline without working out discipline that works for you and fulfills your own real needs. Whatever the reason, try to determine it first.


Why do you feel you are not disciplined enough now? What are the factors standing in the way of you being more disciplined?
As well as assessing your own limitations, consider how others in your life impact you. Are you pleasing others too much to spend time on yourself? Are you always giving in to other people's wants and letting yours go by the wayside?;
, This is especially important if you spend a lot of time just pleasing others. It will be a lot more difficult to stay disciplined if you feel you need others to form boundaries for you or to tell you how to act and think or what to do.


What voices in your head tell you that you're unworthy or a failure? These are negative thoughts that have no basis and need to be tackled in order to introduce self care and discipline in your life. You may need counseling or it could be sufficient for you to work through your negative thoughts using mindfulness or cognitive behavioral techniques.

, In what area do you want to be more disciplined? Maybe it's work, studies, staying clean, not following a bad habit, etc.

, Decide that you will make the changes needed and seek to remain focused on these. Realize that this isn't going to be easy but treat it as a good challenge, not a source of difficulty or deprivation. Once you make the decision to do something, follow through no matter what. Often there will be moments when a lazy desire comes out and inhibits your work. Remember that these feelings are normal, and even the biggest achievers have them. The difference with them is not that they are somehow ""better"" than you. They just have a habit of catching these moments and deflecting them before they become significant.


Accept that you are the person who brings change about in your life, not anyone else. You're not a three year old who needs direction. Seize the day and do what needs to be done.
Normal routine is comfortable and known. Hence, it will likely draw you back in. Use cues to remind yourself that you're falling back into old habits and make decisions to stop each time.

, Human behavioral traits are influenced by cultures, divergent attitudes, emotions, different values, and other social norms within a person's group or community. Be sure to behave politely and with a common sense in all situations.

, From budgeting your finances to organizing a get-together, you will need to learn how to manage certain things on your own. It certainly doesn't entail the starting of a Fortune 500 company, but simply a sense of order in life. Do more things at a certain time, and start small. For example, take lunch after 12:00 PM and dinner after 8:00 PM.


Plan your work. Make a timetable and follow it assiduously.
Divide work into small and achievable pieces.
Sit for no more than an hour at a time. Get up, stretch and walk around. Give your body and your mind a break. You will come back to any task refreshed and physically relaxed.

, This will not only benefit you, but it will also make you feel good. Cleanliness makes a big difference in how you feel emotionally and it will make your environment better and fresher for you. There are many articles on how to accomplish this available on this site and elsewhere

, Communicate eloquently and assertively, and use appropriate gestures when there is a need to do so. Do not shout or use intensifiers in your speech. Discipline in the subtle arts of communication can make a difference in the discipline you exhibit in the more noticeable areas of your life.

, There will always be someone who benefits from your lack of discipline and when you make it clear that you're changing this, it threatens them. Be alert to attempts to divert you from your new path and desire to stick to it. Listen to them, be polite but don't act on their delay or diversion tactics. Stick with what you know is better for you.

, Make your regular routines as automatic as breathing.

Be patient.",How to Change Undesirable Personality Traits," Be honest with yourself. Which of your personality traits prevent you from living the life you want?Personality traits that get you into trouble, damage your relationships, or interfere with your productivity are probably worth trying to change.
If you want to change more than one or two of your traits, you might find it helpful to make a list. For example, you might include traits like lying, procrastinating, or self-doubt.;
, When you’re talking with someone who knows you well, ask them what they think your faults are. An outside opinion may help you see yourself more objectively. It’s possible that you’re too hard on yourself, or that other people see undesirable traits in you that you haven’t noticed.Ask someone you can trust to be honest with you. For example, you might ask, “I’m trying to improve myself. Can you can help me pinpoint a few negative traits I have that need changing?
Only ask for another person’s opinion if you’re prepared to hear anything they have to say, positive or negative.

, Once you know which personality traits you want to change, ask yourself why you dislike them. Write down the ways your life would be better if you didn’t have these negative qualities.Be specific. For instance, you could write, “Because of my impulsive spending, I had to borrow money for rent twice last year. When I get my spending under control, I’ll be able to save money and rely on myself.”
Save this paper and reread it if your motivation starts to wane.
You may even want to make a list of pros and cons for the trait you want to change. This can help you to determine how the trait is affecting your life and the lives of those around you.

, Ask yourself what traits your ideal self has that you don’t possess now. These are the qualities you will work on developing to replace your negative traits.For instance, your ideal self might be more outgoing, punctual, and tidy than you are right now.

, Ask yourself why you admire certain people. Chances are good that they have some personality traits you could cultivate in yourself.Consider people you look up to in real life as well as public figures like athletes and celebrities.
Try reading autobiographies or watching videos about inspirational people on Youtube. This can help you to identify traits that these people possess that you admire and would like to have yourself.

, Many traits that are often considered negative actually have some positives built into them. Look for ways to preserve the positive part of the trait while minimizing the negative part.For instance, many shy people are good listeners, and many aggressive people make natural leaders.

, If you try to change multiple personality traits at once, you won’t be able to focus on any of them. Instead, select just one or two of the most important qualities you want to work on, and leave the others for later.Choose a goal that will make your later goals easier to achieve. For instance, if one of your objectives is to stop being lazy and develop a good work ethic, it would make sense to tackle that one first over getting promoted at your job.

, After you’ve decided on the specifics of your personality goals, figure out how you will make them happen. Brainstorm specific steps you can take to get rid of your undesirable personality traits and build your new, positive qualities.For instance, if you want to conquer your shyness and become outgoing, you could commit to greeting one new person every day.
If you want to stop procrastinating, you might immediately break down large projects into smaller, doable parts and then take action on at least one.

, Having a goal in mind for making a change can help to keep you motivated. Try to focus on the larger positive aspects of making the change rather than thinking about the negatives.

For example, if you want to be a better public speaker, then try writing down what greater goal this will accomplish for you. Maybe being a good public speaker will allow you to become a personal coach or will be a requirement in starting your own business in the future. Write down whatever positive aspects you can think of to help motivate yourself.

, Instead of letting yourself run on autopilot, get into the habit of paying attention to your thoughts and actions. Notice which situations tend to make your unwanted personality traits come out, and develop strategies for handling these situations differently.For instance, if you find yourself arguing when someone criticizes you at work, an alternate strategy might be to take a deep breath before you reply.
To establish the habit of self-awareness, practice it for a week or two before you start trying to change your behavior.

, Affirmations are statements that trick your brain into thinking you’ve already achieved your desired outcome, which helps you change your habits more quickly. This is called a “fake it til you make it” approach and it is very effective. Come up with some inspiring affirmations that reflect your goals, and repeat them to yourself several times a day.A couple of examples of good affirmations are “I feel confident and secure in myself” and “I accept responsibility for the things I do.”
Repeat your affirmations first thing in the morning, right before you go to bed, and whenever you have an idle moment during the day.
Make sure your affirmations are in the present tense, not the future tense. For instance, instead of saying “I will be optimistic,” say, “I am optimistic.”

, To change your personality, you’ve got to perform a new behavior over and over until it seems natural. This is a long process, so don’t miss an opportunity to practice. Seek out situations that give you the opportunity to behave differently than you’re used to.If you want more opportunities to practice your conversational skills, for instance, you might resolve to go to lunch with your coworkers more often.
You can also find support from friends, family, or even by connecting with new like-minded people. Try telling a close friend about your goals to help keep yourself accountable, or join a group such as by looking for a meetup in your area on Meetup.com.
You might even consider joining a self-development organization to get help developing your new habit. For example, a very useful and well-known organization is called Landmark Education.These can be expensive, but the money may be worth it depending on the importance of the new habit.

, It can take months or years for your new personality to really feel like you. This is especially true if you’re over the age of 30. Stay persistent, even if you slip up or your progress is slower than you’d like. If you stick with your goals long enough, your brain will eventually forge the new connections you want.Keep in mind that developing a new habit will come with setbacks. Try to develop a plan for dealing with setbacks to help you continue to move forward and progress towards your goals.

Get a reputable financial advisor.,
Keep your winning as quiet as possible.,
Change your contact information.,
Update your will.",How to Deal with Demands for Money After Winning a Lottery," Your bank is going to want to tell you how you should invest your money with them. So is your local real estate agent, mortgage broker, and everyone who does anything with money. Go with the person who has the best track record. Setting up some sort of financial plan will increase your chances of long term wealth and will help you not become one of those people who goes bankrupt two years after winning. And here's the added benefit: having a good advisor and locking a good portion of your money into investments means that you won't have tons of money to hand out to people. You'll still have enough to live off comfortably and to enjoy but you won't have millions to share.
, Do not tell everyone. Do not hand out $1000.00 tips to everyone just because. If you do this, then people are going to keep expecting money from you. You gave that girl at Starbucks money? Why can't you give your cousin's friend more? It can get out of control easily. It's tempting to want to have a huge party or to do something crazy and it would be fun. But it will set the stage for people to expect things from you., Close your Facebook account for a while and shut down your Twitter. Get a new phone number right away. Only give your new contact info to people who you actually stay in touch with. This will help you avoid long lost relatives and kindergarten friends who only want your money., You should already have a will and you'll want to update it to reflect your new assets. No one should ask about your will. That's tacky. If anyone is suddenly interested in what it says, then just explain that you'd rather focus on being alive than on your death. Don't say any more than that your loved ones will be cared for. That should guilt them into shutting up."

Fortunately, there are a few easy ways that you can always be sure you'll pick something you can both talk about comfortably.


Assess the situation. If you're in class with someone, you can always start by talking about class. If you're at the same party, talk about the party. It doesn't need to be complicated: ""What do you think of this neighborhood?"" is even a fine way to start a conversation.
Never try to approach a stranger and start a conversation with a pick-up line or other lame jokes. While it's not necessarily ""rude,"" asking someone how much a polar bear weighs doesn't give you a chance to make conversation, it just gives you a lame dead-end.;
, FORM is an acronym commonly used in some conversation coaching, which helps you to remember topics that are always good for starting conversations and assorted prompts for starting them, whether you know the person well, or you're just meeting someone. It's a good rule of thumb for picking conversation starters: Family, Occupation, Recreation, and Motivation.



Family

""How's your mom these days?"" or ""How are your parents doing?""
""How many brothers and sisters do you have?"" or ""Did you all get along?""
""What was your best/worst family vacation?""



Occupation

""What do you do?"" or ""How are you enjoying your new job?""
""What's the toughest thing you've got going on at work?"" or ""What was the most interesting thing you did there this week?""
""What are the people you work with like?""



Recreation

""What do you do for fun?"" or ""What is there to do around here for fun?""
""How long have you been doing that?""
""Do you have a regular group of people you do that with?""



Motivation

""What do you want to do after school?"" or ""Do you think you'll be at that job for long? What's your dream job?""
""What do you want to be doing, down the road?""



, It's absolutely critical that you start conversations by giving people the chance to talk, and responding to them in turn. This is what makes you talkative, not the ability to chatter on about yourself. Open-ended questions give other people the opportunity to open up and give you more to respond to, and more to talk about in the conversation.


Open-ended questions can be used to follow up closed answers. If someone reticent to talk and says, ""I'm doing ok, I guess"" in response to your ""What's up?"" Say, ""What did you do today?"" and follow it up with, ""How did it go?"" Get them talking.
Open-ended questions have to do with opinions. You can't answer an open-ended question with yes or no answers. Don't ask closed questions, like ""What's your name?"" or ""Do you come here a lot?"" This doesn't give you anything to talk about.

, Sometimes, it's actually harder to talk to people you know a little bit, as opposed to strangers. If you already know someone's family history and basic story, you it's good to try to recall previous conversations to look for follow up questions, to find out what they've been up to:


""What'd you do today"" or ""What have you been up to since I've seen you?""
""How was that project at school? Did you get it finished ok?""
""Those pictures of vacation on Facebook looked great. How was the trip?""

, Good conversation is about more than flapping your gums. If you want to be more talkative, it's important to practice good listening and not just wait for your turn to talk.


Make eye contact with the person, and use open body language. Nod your head when you agree and focus on the conversation. Follow up with things like, ""Oh, wow. Then what happened?"" or ""How did that turn out?""
Really listen and respond to what the other person is saying. Practicing training yourself to paraphrase, saying, ""What I'm hearing is..."" and ""It sounds like what you're saying is...""
Never be more talkative by simply one-upping people in conversation, or responding to what they've said by talking about yourself all the time. Listen and respond.

, Some people just don't want to talk, and it won't make the situation better if you force it. Pay close attention for people who are displaying closed body language and disengage from the conversation. Focus your talkative skills on someone else instead.


Closed body language includes things like looking over your head and around the room, as if looking for an exit. Closed or crossed arms are sometimes a sign of closed body language, as well as leaning one's shoulder toward you, or away from you.
Open body language consists of leaning forward, making eye contact, and listen to the other person.

, A lot of conversation is non-verbal. People are a lot more willing to engage happy, open, friendly-looking people in conversation. You can do a lot to encourage other people in conversation and get them to engage you if you use open body language and smile.


You don't have to look like a grinning idiot, just look like you're happy to be where you are, even if you're feeling uncomfortable. No furrowed brows and sour faces. Lift your eyebrows and keep your chin up. Smile.

, Good conversationalists make this easy, but even with closed off people, you can learn to find doors to open into other topics and avenues, looking for a personal connection that can give you something to really talk about together. It's kind of an art, but there are some tricks to developing it in yourself.


Ask about someone's history with a particular subject. If someone mentions going running, ask them how long they've been running, whether or not they enjoy it, where they go running, and other associated questions.
Ask about someone's opinion of a particular subject. If someone mentions working at Burger King during high school, ask what it was like. Solicit their opinion.
Always be following up. There's no problem in following up someone's short answer with, ""Why's that?"" or ""How?"" Smile, to avoid seeming like you're prying, and that you're actually just curious.

, People like to talk about themselves, so don't be afraid of soliciting their opinions and doing a little probing into their mind. While some people who are more guarded may be reticent to talk, others will enjoy being able to share their opinion with someone who is generally curious.


You can always back-track if you need to, and say, ""Sorry, I don't mean to pry, I'm just curious.""

, Don't be silent while you think of answers to questions you've been asked, just start paraphrasing what the other person has said and let yourself start talking. If you're a generally shy person, it's likely that you're overthinking what you say before you say it, and often it'll come out just as well, if not better, the less you censor yourself, and the more you just allow yourself to speak.


Lots of people worry about ""sounding dumb"" or that they're going to not say the ""right"" thing, but this usually results in unnatural speech patterns and awkward timing in conversations. If you want to be more talkative, practice responding, even if you're not positive what you're going to say.

, Sometimes, a subject will just die out, and then awkwardness can quickly set in. If you don't have anything more to say about a particular subject, don't be afraid to hop to something else, even if it doesn't necessarily follow.


If you're having drinks and talking about football, and then football dries up, gesture to the drink and ask something like, ""How is that? What's in it again?"" Talk drinks for a while while you think of other subjects.
Talk about what you want to talk about, and what you know a lot about. Things that you're very knowledgeable about are interesting to other people, at least people who are worth talking to.

, If you run out of things to talk about, it's good to have a pretty good grasp of current events, common topics, and big headlines, so you can talk about something that your conversation partner is likely to have heard of, and you can find common ground.


You don't even have to know a lot about topics to engage in conversation. Say something like, ""What's the deal with this new Senate controversy? I haven't really heard specifics. Have you?""
You don't have to be a man to fall into the ""mansplaining"" trap. Never assume that the person you're talking to doesn't know anything about a topic, even if it's obscure, or very specific, or it may come off as condescension.

, If you're not as talkative as you'd like to be in one-on-one conversations, talking in big groups can be an even bigger challenge. But if you want your voice to be heard, one of the most important things to learn is to speak at a volume that will allow it to be heard more easily.


Many reticent people are also somewhat quiet, and introverted. Larger groups tend to favor extroverts and loud talkers, which means you'll have to slightly tailor your voice to the group.
Try this: grab the floor of the conversation by raising your voice to the level of the others, but then drop to your natural speaking voice when people are listening, so you don't have to fake it. Bring them to you, not vice versa.

, Sometimes, group conversations can feel like that game Frogger: you're looking at a big street, heavy with traffic, and trying to find an opening that never comes. But the secret with that game is that you just have to dive in. Those silences, when they come, are never obvious, or expected, so it's important to risk interrupting someone, instead of waiting for absolute silence before speaking.


Try not to interrupt people by talking over, but use interjection words before they're done, like saying, ""So..."" or ""Wait a minute..."" or even ""I've got something to say,"" and then waiting for them to finish. You'll have grabbed the floor without talking over them completely.

, If you have something to say, look at the speaker, lean forward, and use open body language that communicates you're engaged in the conversation, and want to say something. Someone may even pass you the floor by requesting your input, if you look like you want to talk.


Sometimes, if you feel like you're getting run over by the conversation truck, it's tempting to get frustrated and disengage from the conversation. But this will only make it more difficult to talk, and will keep others from recognizing that you might want to speak.

, In a group setting, the conversation can quickly get boring if everyone is just saying the same thing, so it's good to play Devil's Advocate, on occasion, if the conversation calls for it. If you find yourself disagreeing with the group opinion, try gently voicing your disagreement.


Make sure to soften disagreement by leading with, ""I guess I'm seeing this a little differently, but..."" or ""Good point, but I'm not sure I agree.""
You don't have to adopt ideas or opinions that aren't your own just to say something, especially if you can't back it up. If you disagree though, feel free to voice it. Conversations aren't cults that punish dissent.

, Some people struggle to socialize in larger groups and flourish in one-on-one environments. There's nothing wrong with these people. A recent personality study found that many people fall into one of two groups, based on whether or not they were able to contribute to larger groups or one-on-one talks better. These groups are dyads and triads.Dad's struggle to find purchase in larger groups. If you want to talk to someone, but struggle in a group of three or more people, take the person aside and talk. Then, talk to other people in the group one-on-one, to get into your own comfort zone. It won't seem rude if you make the time for everyone.

, Talking in class is a whole different ballgame, and what might seem awkward or unusual during informal conversations is sometimes perfectly appropriate and even expected in the classroom setting. The best example of this is group discussions, when it's perfectly appropriate to write out, or pre-plan comments that you might want to share with the class.


In general, it can be hard to remember to bring up points you might have thought of while doing the reading in English class, or questions you had about the homework during math, so write these out and bring them up next time you're in class. Nothing wrong with a script for school.

, The best way to contribute to class is to ask questions. Any time you don't understand something, or feel like you're unclear about an issue or topic, raise your hand and ask a question. It's a rule of thumb that any time one student doesn't get it, there are probably five more who don't have the guts to raise their hand. Be the brave one.


Only ask questions that benefit the group, or that apply to the group. It's not appropriate to raise your hand to ask, ""Why did I get a B on this?""

, If you're having a group discussion and are struggling for something to say, there's usually good opportunities to piggy-back on other students comments, which has the effect of making it look like you're saying something, even if you're really not.


Wait for someone to say something that sounds good, then chip in with, ""I agree"" and paraphrase it in your own words. Easy comment points.

, Get in the habit of working things that have already been said and translating it into your own version of what was said, adding bits and pieces to it as you go. This is a great way to contribute to class without really having anything to say that wasn't already said. Of course, it's better if you add a little, to make it worth your teacher's while.


If someone says, ""I think this book is really about the family dynamics and the bad stuff they're all hiding, you know?"" get your translation cap on and polish up the comment. Say, ""I agree. I think you can really see the patriarchy at work in the father-son relationship displayed in this novel, especially in the downfall of the title character.""
Bonus points for pointing out specifics. Find a quotation, or a problem in your book that illustrates a point someone else has brought up.

, Generally, you don't need to be the most talkative person in your class, just talkative enough to let your presence be known. Most of the time, that means at least once per class period. This can also have the effect of keeping the teacher from picking on you later, if the rest of the class is being quiet. Plan out a point, get it out of the way, and then sit back and listen.

Start small.,
Say thank you.,
Smile.,
Help someone with a task.,
Go out of your way for someone.,
Do not underestimate the importance of physical kindness.,
Visit people.,
Treat people with respect.",How to Build an Acts of Kindness Habit1," An kindness habit doesn’t mean that you have to go out and donate tons of money or give up your life to a cause. You can easily do many acts of kindness every day on a smaller scale. In many ways, this is a great way to spread kindness everywhere you go.For example, hold the door open for someone. Smile at a stranger. Pay the toll for someone behind you. Ask someone in customer service that you see often how they are doing. These small things can make a huge difference.;
, Appreciating someone for something they have done is an easy way to show kindness towards someone. This takes little planning or effort on your part. It just takes a bit of awareness to force the words out of your mouth.When someone does something for you, whether it is at work or in a business, you should say, “Thank you” or “I appreciate it.”

, An easy way to start building your habit of kindness is to smile at people. Smiling doesn’t require you to say anything or do much of anything. With some practice, smiling will become reflex. Practice smiling at everyone you pass, both strangers and familiar faces.If you don’t feel happy or cheerful one day, that’s okay. You can still smile to spread kindness despite your mood. In fact, it may help improve your mood, as studies show smiling — even forced or fake — can increase happiness., You can spread kindness by extending your help to someone doing a task, especially if it's something like a chore. You can ask if they need help or surprise them by completing the task as a surprise. This act of kindness can lessen responsibility and brighten someone’s day.For example, you may do the dishes or cook dinner for your spouse or roommate before they get home. You might offer to carry someone’s groceries, or perhaps you mow your neighbor’s lawn at the same time you do your own.

, Sometimes, kindness may mean going outside your comfort zone to be there for someone you care about. You may choose to be kind to a friend or family member by going out of your way to help them with a problem, to be with them during a difficult time, or to do something for them.For example, if your friend is sad, you might give up your evening plans to go be with them because they need your support. Or you might help a family member problem solve until you find a solution. Going the extra mile for loved ones is an act of kindness.

, You may also show kindness through physical touch. For example, you may hug someone, shake someone’s hand, pat someone on the back or shoulder, or hold someone’s hand when they are scared or upset. These small gestures can mean a lot to someone.Make sure to use caution with touch. Not everyone likes physical contact. Touching someone, especially hugging or holding their hand, may not be appropriate in every situation.

, Making the time to include people in your life is a way to be kind. Find time to meet friends for lunch or dinner, or go visit a family member you don’t see often. If someone comes to you a lot, go see them instead.Taking time out of your day to see someone is a large act of kindness that can be easily achieved.

, Respect is another way you can spread kindness. This means treating everyone the same and how you want to be treated. This should be regardless of people’s job title, ethnicity, culture, religion, sexuality, or socio-economic status.Treating everyone with respect and positivity no matter your differences is one of the best way to spread kindness.

Mean what you say.,
Keep your thoughts positive.,
Practice acts of kindness on everyone.",How to Build an Acts of Kindness Habit2," One way to build an acts of kindness habit is to make it real for you. This means you shouldn’t say things just to act kind if you don’t mean them. Instead, be truthful when you speak kind words and perform kind acts.For example, when you tell someone, “Congratulations on the promotion,” don’t feel resentment towards them. Actually feel happy that they got the job. If you tell someone, “Have a nice day,” mean it.

, Your mindset is important when adopting a kindness habit. If you think negative thoughts, you will be sad and down. If you think positive thoughts, you will be more cheerful and more inclined to be kind to people. Try to stay positive, even on bad days.Sometimes, doing something kind for another person can lift your spirits. If you are feeling negative, smile at someone. Compliment someone or tell them you appreciate them. Hold the door for a stranger. These things can help breed positivity.
If you feel negative and getting into a positive mindset seems too difficult, try to lift yourself up to feeling neutral — neither negative nor positive. Try to view things from an objective, slightly removed viewpoint, without emotion or judgement. Once you've reached a place of neutrality, try thinking about the positive things in your life to lift you up even further.

, Part of the basis of an acts of kindness habit is spreading kindness to everyone, not just a certain few people. You may only act kind to people you know or those around you, but this is not a full acts of kindness habit. A acts of kindness habit encompasses everyone.For example, don’t just spread kindness to co-workers you know. Instead, be random and spread kindness to everyone, even those you’re not close with. Be kind to strangers you meet, like your barista and cashier at the grocery store.

"
"
Remember to practice on yourself.,
Practice for 21 days.,
Choose a specific goal each day.",How to Build an Acts of Kindness Habit3," You can’t develop a complete acts of kindness habit without being kind to yourself. Many people are too harsh or overly critical about every aspect of their lives. Treat yourself with the kindness you wish to show to others — treat yourself like a beloved friend, not an enemy.Forgive yourself for mistakes, compliment yourself, smile at your reflection in the mirror, and speak about yourself in positive terms. These are all ways to be kind to yourself, and you deserve kindness, just like anyone else.

, It takes three weeks to adopt a habit. This means that you should consciously work for 21 days at acts of kindness. You can do this when you first wake up by sending an email thanking someone, or you can smile at someone you pass on the street.Make sure to do these acts every day, otherwise it won’t become a habit. Set a reminder in your phone or mark it on your calendar if you need to remind yourself.

, Each morning, come up with a specific way you will be kind that day. This helps you make the conscious decision each day to be kind until it becomes a habit and second nature. The act can be small or large.Habits take time to develop, and they require you to take action. You have to think about your acts of kindness while developing the habit.

All clothes should be clean, neat and never wrinkled
If you're playing a sport, Lacoste style shirts and khaki shorts that are just above knee-length are great.

Wear simple makeup.,
Walk like a woman.,
Grow your hair out long.,
Think about keeping your body hairless.,
Smile often.",How to Become More Feminine2," Spray on your favorite perfume before you leave the house in the mornings. One or two spritzes are usually enough. Scent is one of the most powerful senses for attraction, and smelling great has long been a staple of the feminine image.

, Makeup is one of the few fashion provinces that are almost exclusively feminine. Men rarely wear make-up, but can successfully pull off eyeshadows and liners for a more feminine look, as many rock stars like Morrissey or Marilyn Manson show regularly.


Paint your nails, experiment with new makeup, or emulate celebrities whose look you admire.
You do not need make-up to appear more feminine, but it helps.

, The ""feminine walk"" is meant to accentuate feminine figures and show off curves. Think of pulling yourself forward by your lower half of the body, not ""falling"" forward and letting your feet catch up.The first step is to have good posture (spine straight, shoulders over hips, chin parallel to the ground), but there are a few extra steps that can help make your walk extra-feminine.

Swing your hips slightly towards of the foot taking a step (ie. swing left when stepping with your left foot).

"
Spend time with women.,
Have confidence in your charm and ability.,
Be compassionate.,
Think about other people, not just yourself.,
Be receptive to the world around you, good and bad.,
Recognize that being more feminine has nothing to do with success or accomplishment.",How to Become More Feminine3," What do you value in other women? What makes them ""feminine"" to you? Spending time with women and people you feel are feminine will help you access your own femininity. While everyone is different, most people define ""feminine"" by the following traits:


In-tune with emotions, both your own and others.
Caring and compassionate.
Sensitive.
Nurturing.
Soft, beautiful, delicate, etc., No matter what your definition of femininity, you've got to own it. You have a unique, incredible personality that you should never be afraid to hide. Being more feminine is not about learning to act a part or conform to a role. It is about being happy with who you are and accentuating the qualities you enjoy.


Remind yourself that no one has a monopoly on being feminine -- you get to decide what it means as much as anyone else.
Femininity is about being free to be yourself, love your body and life, and love others., Just like you shouldn't expect other people to judge you on your femininity, you shouldn't judge others. Historically, femininity is rooted in ideas of compassion, wisdom, and nurturing. This is why some people view acting feminine as weak or vulnerable, as typical feminine behavior isn't rooted in selfishness. Yet the ability to be flexible and caring is important for everyone and helps foster community and togetherness that can solve the hardest of problems.Be respectful and polite, even when wronged. Taking the high road is not only dignified, it often diffuses problems before they occur.Avoid unnecessary conflict whenever possible by distancing yourself from petty fights.

, Having emotional empathy is one of the keys to being more feminine that all people, men and women alike, can embrace. Empathy is when you try and put yourself in someone's shoes to see how they feel. This allows you to better manage conflicts, help friends in need, and make long-lasting friendships.Ask yourself: ""What is their side of the story?"" before getting angry.
Think of problems in terms of other people, not just yourself.
Recognize that rarely is something one person's fault-- there are a lot of factors in their life that affect them, just like in yours.

, Many people still see traditionally feminine words like ""submissive,"" or ""receptive"" as bad. But they are incredibly powerful ideas that can help you be more at peace with life, open yourself up to change, and accept love into your heart. While masculine ideas often clash with this, preferring to be in-charge or commanding, the truth is that no one completely controls their life. Learning to accept the things you cannot change with grace and humility is crucial to accessing your feminine side, and it will make you happier as a result.Recognizing that you cannot change everything does not mean ""giving up."" It means finding the things you can change and focusing on them.

, Being feminine does not mean that you cannot be smart, powerful, or assertive. All people, male and female, exist somewhere between femininity and masculinity-- no one is all one or the other. That is a good thing, since both sides are important for a successful, well-balanced life.


Taking pride in your appearance does not mean you are unfit for a job or career.
Having ""girly"" preferences, such as liking the color pink, does not mean you cannot be taken seriously.
Never ditch your dreams, goals, or projects because they don't conform to someone's notions of femininity."

, Keep in mind that if you don't think it's funny; there is a big chance it's not. Also don't rip off famous YouTubers and movies. Make sure the audio in your videos aren't copyrighted. You might get complaints in the comments. Or even a warning or two.

, It sounds superficial but it might be true in some ways. Most people get attracted to looks, and that's what might bring them to watch in first hand. You don't have to go all out if you aren't confident enough or just don't want to. All that matters is, after all; the subject of your video and how you entertain.

Keep your stuff organized and clean. Make your bed every morning. Stuff you seriously shouldn't have to be told, but should be covered first anyhow before you plan to consider yourself awesome.;
, Don't eat just because there's nothing better to do or you're procrastinating. You're going to get fat. Even if you have a major hyper metabolism, all good things come to an end my friend. So don't get used to eating just whenever. If you get a bit of chub after a while, that doesn't mean you can't be awesome. You just have to take into more consideration of what you're doing before you do it, and be more involved with being active. Might sound boring, but it depends how bad you want to be awesome.

, Being obnoxious, ignorant and loud is not awesome. Being calm and maybe even nonchalant is the way to go. Don't make huge reactions to things. It makes the people around you a bit awkward feeling. If you can't control your outrageous emotions to the point where you're recognized as overly dramatic, you need to work on that before moving ahead. Don't be so anxious and explore new places.

, Yes, it's easier said than done. But seriously, relying on your parents to buy you stuff all the time is not awesome. If you're 14 or younger, it's understandable. But around the age of 16 and up, you should really go and find something to do. School can be a real bummer around those times, so if you're really hardcore into school then that's understandable too.

After all, you're reading this. First, stop short-forming words and learning how to spell correctly, then after that work on your grammar. It's a step-by-step progress most people learn when growing up.

, Expand on your brain-thesaurus if you want to impress people. You could even use fancy words if you want. Like those ones you see in movies that everyone knows eventually what it means but no one really says it. But you would say it. Because you're awesome. Just slip in some really great words in your every day sentences. Might seem like your IQ is a bit higher. Awesome.

, Scene, hipster, whatever... It's all right if you like them, or if you have friends like them or something, but if it's a type of trend, you're not being original by following it. And following behind people who make decisions for you is not awesome. Just wear whatever you think is cool, and what you don't see many people wearing but is still... you know, up with the times. Don't set any limits or codes to your own trends, but know what people are going to think.

, It's good to have things in common with people, that's usually how one would make friends. But after a while, for example, say you keep talking to the same people about the same job you do every day. They're obviously not going to care sooner or later, sorry. Even with music or TV shows you like. The more you reveal about your interests with out anyone asking, the more annoying it's going to be and the more obsessed you will seem. Which at that point you probably are. So if no one asks, they don't care enough to.

, Ever heard of free running? Look it up on YouTube. Just an example. Maybe you could get into spray-paint art or baking pastries. Just find something you like and start practising, it's a good time-passer and you could even get awesome at it.

, This doesn't mean you have to change, because only you can decide to change yourself.

Read literature written by witty people, such as Shakespeare, the Sherlock Holmes series by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, or even comics like Garfield or Dilbert. You can learn a lot from witty people (or animals) from any generation.
Watch television shows or films that feature witty people. Woody Allen films always feature witty protagonists.;
, Before you can begin to impress people with your wit, you have to give off a confident vibe to show people that you are comfortable with yourself as well as the jokes you tell. If you're confident, people will be more likely to trust in your abilities, including your ability to charm people with your wit. Here's how:


Have positive body language when you deliver a joke. Though you don't have to make a show of having an audience, just standing tall, speaking clearly, and making eye contact when you deliver the punch line will help your cause.
Be confident about who you are. If you love who you are and what you do, people will be more likely to appreciate you---and your sense of humor.
Show confidence in your jokes. Tell your jokes with clarity and show that you think what you're saying is funny. If you demonstrate a belief that your sense of humor is solid, people will be more likely to agree. This doesn't mean that you should laugh at your own jokes, but you should just tell them in a way that shows you don't care what people think because you already know you're funny.

, Part of being witty is being able to think outside the box and not to see the world as everyone else sees it. Being a thoughtful and intelligent person will improve your chances of looking at the world in a unique way. Here's how to be original:


Read as much as you can. The more you know about the world, the more likely you are to have an unbiased and unique perspective of the things around you.
Don't be afraid to be corny. Being free and open with your sense of humor will make people laugh. For example, if your girlfriend asks you to pick up pears at the store, you can say, ""I'll pear that in mind.""
Create new words of your own. For example, if you and your friends are always gossiping about a girl named Emily and you are sick of hearing about her, you can say, ""I now declare an Emily-bargo!"" Though people will roll their eyes, they will appreciate your goofy word combo.
Find new uses for traditional phrases. For example, if you are emerging from a public restroom and a person of the opposite gender is approaching it and asks, ""Is this bathroom gender specific?"" You can answer, ""How specific do you want it to be?""

For example, the question “How would you spend a million dollars?” invites all sorts of creative thinking. Responding with “Quite happily” subverts the answer in a humorous way.



, Understanding your audience is the key to your success. Though you should work on developing your own brand of humor, you should always be aware of the type of people you are around, and the particular things they find funny or offensive. Here's how:


Never forget to listen. Listening to the people around you can help you understand what they find funny, what they find absolutely offensive because it's a sensitive subject, or to pick up on a comment that you can bring up later in joke form.
Be sensitive. If you're around a group of people who are very sensitive about religion, for example, then try to avoid jokes about this topic. Not only will they not appreciate your wit, but they may not want to hang out with you anymore.
Tailor your jokes to your audience. Try raunchier jokes for a more hip, younger crowd, and stick to safer and cornier jokes if you're hanging out with your grandparents, unless they can really laugh at anything.
Understand when people are not in the mood for humor. Though wit should be appreciated under any circumstance, if you are around someone who is very upset, or sick, telling a joke could lighten the mood, or it could make that person resent you. Tread lightly.

, Even the best joke can fall flat if you don't deliver it the right way. Delivery is something you can practice in front of the mirror, or even with a tape recorder, before you try your joke out with a live audience. But even if your jokes are spontaneous, there are a few tips that can help perfect your delivery:


Speak clearly. Deliver your jokes with clarity and confidence. If you mumble your jokes, people may ask you to repeat yourself and the humor will be lost.
Remember that timing is everything. Part of being witty is being sharp and quick, so don't hesitate too long or people won't understand how your funny comment connects to the conversation at hand.
Try a deadpan delivery. If you're really confident, tell your joke flatly and wait for people to laugh. You should avoid saying your joke in a way that shows that you think you're saying something funny. Part of being witty is developing ""I don't care if you laugh"" persona.
Don't speak over anyone. This should be a no-brainer, but many great jokes are lost because the person tells them while someone else is talking. Wait for a quiet moment in a conversation before you chime in.

, Following as many steps as you can to become wittier will improve your chances of being funny. However, you should avoid trying too hard to make people laugh, or they will feel sorry for you instead of finding you amusing. Here's how to avoid overdoing it:


Relax. Even if you're trying out a new witticism, be relaxed. Stay calm when you tell your jokes, and don't raise your voice unnaturally or look around to check for a reaction.
Don't tell too many jokes at once. Being funny through just a few well-timed moments a day is much more effective than trying to tell a joke every five minutes and bombing nine times out of ten.
Be cool when your jokes fail. If nobody laughs at your jokes, just shake it off and say, ""I'll get 'em next time,"" or ""Whoops---wrong audience."" If you look visibly upset, hurt, or clam up for the rest of the night, people will see that you care too much about whether they laugh or not.
Take a break. If you've already told a few jokes, relax for the rest of the night and study the funny people around you. If you're so focused on being funny, you may miss something important that could help you be funny in the future.

Be Charming.,
Dress Business Casual.,
Make time for friends.,
Always call a friend on your way home from work while on the Sky train or 99.,
Multitask.,
Try not to deny Facebook Requests.",How to Become a Great Guy," Being charming all day every day is not an easy task. The most important thing is starting your day off right. This begins with getting the right amount of sleep, usually 8 hours work best. After rolling out of bed at about 6am make sure you comment on at least one photo from every one of your Facebook friends. After spending 30 minutes picking the right outfit from your absurdly crowded - yet organized - closet, head to the washroom to practice your smile. A great smile is like Hello-Kitty meets the Care-bears (in other words, the most magical thing on the planet), so make sure to have that down to a science. From here on out, the charm should come pretty naturally, just make sure to throw away all inhibitions. If you see a group of people that you have never met before, just walk up to them with that charming smile you've practiced and say something silly, for example: ""I really like that shirt."" Even if people seem genuinely off-put by your outgoing nature and seemingly lack of self-consciousness: Do not leave...Unless of course you know you're just being annoying, than leave. Keep laughing at everyone's comments, and sooner or later your will be 1) going on friend-dinner date's with them, 2) attending their weddings as a +1 or 3) bringing cookies to their potluck/birthday party.;
, Wardrobe is key! Business casual screams friendship, so even when heading to a ""dress-down"" event (e.g. a yoga class) make sure to have your khaki's pressed (Note, alternative can be perfectly hemmed Mavis Jeans), your dress shirt starched, and your blazer recently dry-cleaned.

, The key to keeping your schedule full of social engagements is multitasking. As long as you keep in mind warnings from your g-cal that you have too many meetings scheduled for the same time - you will make it to all of them. The best antidote for the dreaded Fear Of Missing Out is to never ever miss out. Even if you are out of the country; Seminars, conferences, pot lucks, drum circles, cooking workshops. The key is always say yes to everything and everybody.

, (don't forget to enthusiastically yell 'Thank you!' to the bus driver as you get off) to ask how their day was. Public transit is also a great opportunity to create a new connection with a stranger and invite them to your next potluck or painting party (true story!).

, Combine exercise with socializing; schedule runs and bike rides with friends or join a running group (your new group of best friends). Even if you think you are out of shape, or don't have rain-appropriate cycling gear... go anyway! You don't want to miss out on possible fun and friendship. If you are baking cookies for one group of friends, quadruple that recipe so you can distribute joy and happiness to at least 3 more groups of friends!

, We're not just talking requests for friendship (duh - never turn one down!) but also anything and everything that people request in their online status is yours for accepting. Friends looking for someone to help them move? Bike right over. Someone can't find an article online? Email it to them stat. Hot chick looking for someone to run with her a distance you have never tried before? Your shoes are already on. Don't forget to first like their original requesting status, and then like their shout-outs you will for sure receive in their next status for being the most helpful and charming friend out there. Learn to step back or you'll just come off as pushy or needy.

Plan the way you'll move on.,
Set your goals into action.,
Remember that you are the most important person in your life.,
Believe in your abilities and in who you are.,
Realize that other people have their own issues.",How to Become a Confident Person and Succeed in Life," If you're hard on yourself all the time, you'll make life hard for yourself. You don't deserve all that constant negativity and while it is important to focus on what needs self-improving, this should not be at the expense of your self-confidence. Tell yourself you're a great person who can do anything you put your mind to. Every time a negative or critical thought pops into your head, dismiss it with a positive thought that says ""Yes, but I am healthy/clever/capable, etc."" instead. Repeat this exercise regularly for best effect.;
, However much of your life lies before you, be it 80 years or be it 10, you can make the most of the years ahead by giving yourself a direction. So, what do you want to do with your life?


Do you want a new career, a new business, a new hobby or a new volunteering role?
Do you want a new boyfriend/girlfriend? Do you want a new platonic friends?
Do you want to lose or gain weight?
Do you want to set out on an adventure of a lifetime?
Do you just want to be able to get your life in order?


Whatever the reason, firming it up exactly in your mind will help you begin to focus on it and work towards it.







, you will do it! Take a pen and a notebook, one that you can carry about with you. From now on, write down all your thoughts and plans and related tasks for the future. Write down the specifics of how you will set about doing the things that you are aiming for, including budget, travel, gear, etc.

, Start out slowly and work your way towards an achievable goal. When that's done, move onto another achievable goal. As you gain in confidence, start to tackle the harder goals that you have set yourself.


Each time you have achieved a task treat yourself with a small present.

, You need to take care of yourself and appreciate yourself. This isn't about being selfish; the more you have taken care of your confidence-building and sorted out your own issues, the freer you are to assist others to find the same pathway and to be generous with your time, knowledge and skills.

, Confidence grows when you give yourself the chance to do what you're good at and then build on that. It grows when you cease to put yourself down and start to recognize the good things about yourself. It can also grow when you let go of the expectations that you feel other people have of you.

, Sometimes you may feel that other people are standing in your way, causing you to feel ""less"" of a person or to put down your own endeavors. Criticism is commonplace from others but not all of it is constructive or from a place of true concern for your well-being. Learn to sort between the unhelpful barbs that seek to prevent you from reaching your full potential and the feedback that is actually aimed at helping you to grow in the right direction. It can take a little time to sort this out but it is worth it and you'll know in your gut what is sound advice and what is simply obstructive. Remember that many people are carrying their own confidence concerns and some of them are insecure enough to try to pass their worries on to you too."

Stay true to your values.",How to Be Tough," Toughness and confidence go hand in hand. Being tough comes down to the choices you make about handling any given situation. Having confidence in yourself makes it possible to make the right choice and follow through with it. If you're not sure you're capable of stepping up to a challenge, it's probably because your self-confidence needs a boost.


Learn to recognize your true opinions, rather than letting yourself be swayed by what other people think. Trust yourself to know the right way to handle a situation.
Don't compare yourself to other people. It's a rabbit hole many of us fall into time and time again, but comparing yourself to others undermines your self-esteem. Next time you're faced with a decision, look inward.
Learn to say no. People will respect your opinion more if you actually say what you think. Always look them in the eye when saying no, so they'll know that you're sure.;
, Do you blow your top or burst into tears when something makes you angry or upset? Being tough doesn't mean not having emotions, but it does mean keeping them in check so you can think clearly and make rational decisions. Start reigning yourself in a bit if you tend to react strongly to unwelcome news.


Before you do anything, take a deep breath and count to ten. This well-known trick for keeping yourself together really does work. After 10 seconds, the first surge of emotion will calm down a bit.
Channel your energy instead of unleashing it on other people. Exercising, writing in a journal, and practicing meditation are good ways to give your emotions a positive output.

, If you're going to be tough, you can't let disappointing news or a negative comment ruin your day. If every little challenge makes you feel as though you're coming undone, you won't have energy left over for making strong choices regarding bigger issues. Work on developing a thicker skin.


Worrying excessively about other people's judgments is a waste of your time. It's a given that people will disagree with you and judge your choices sometimes; that's their problem. As long as what you're doing isn't hurting other people, you're fine.
Don't be a hothead. Traffic jams, lines at the post office, and other annoyances are not worth losing your temper. If you can't handle mailing a package without having a meltdown, how are you going to handle a real problem?

, Everyone sets goals, but following through with them is another matter entirely. Most goals worth setting require hours of monotonous hard work to achieve them. If you want to be tough, be willing to put in the time and effort it takes to accomplish goals.


Break your goals down into manageable steps and set a schedule for completing them. This way you'll know exactly what needs to be done in order to get to the finish line.
Be ruthlessly persistent. If you give up before you've met your goal, you're letting yourself down. Don't allow yourself to lose interest or get tired of working hard.

, Making mistakes is an inevitable part of life. Tough people use their mistakes as tools for learning how to do better next time. If you tend to let your mistakes get the better of you, or worse, blame someone else every time something goes wrong, try taking a different approach to your mistakes.


Admit when you've done something wrong. It's a misconception that in order to be tough, you've got to act like you're always right. In fact, the opposite is true: tough people are willing to endure the discomfort of owning up to their mistakes.

, You don't have to be sunny and cheerful all the time, but having a generally optimistic point of view goes hand in hand with being tough.Being hopeful about what the future holds is an asset when life gets hard. People who complain a lot and feel cynical about the future aren't able to cope as well in the face of disaster or despair.

, Don't attempt to evade difficult situations by running away or pretending they aren't happening. The ability face reality head-on will help you make practical decisions that will ultimately lead to positive change. If you bury your head in the sand, your problems will just keep festering.


Resist the temptation to ignore your problems by indulging in escapist behaviors. Using drugs and alcohol, watching too much TV, staying up all night online, gambling and other similar behaviors will make it harder to clearly see reality.

, With every situation you encounter, you have a choice to make. It's up to you to decide how you'll react and what actions you should take. Sometimes the right choice is obvious, and other times right and wrong seem impossible to distinguish from one another. Taking the time to think things through clearly will help you choose correctly.


Let's say you get a piece of bad news: you weren't admitted into the program you applied for. What are the possible paths you can take from here? Is there a wrong way to react? What's the right way?

, It's not weak to admit you could use some advice. Other people's opinions can be valuable when you're faced with a situation that you haven't encountered before. Ask people you trust what they would do in your position. Remember, though, that only you can ultimately determine the best course. Other people's opinions are secondary to your own values.


Trusted friends and family members are good people to confide in when you have a big decision to make. Take their advice with a grain of salt, though, since people who know you, even if they love you very much, might have their own personal stake in the decision you make. For example, your mom would prefer you didn't move to a different town, her advice about what college you should choose might be loaded with her emotions.
Going to a therapist or counselor is a great idea when you feel a professional opinion could be useful.

, That little inner voice telling you what choice to make will become louder and stronger as you gain experience and wisdom. After examining a situation from all angles and getting a few outside opinions, it's time to act on your values. Being tough means acting with honor and courage, no matter how scary it might be to do so.

, Once you've made your decision, follow through with it and stay true to your values. The tough decision to make is often the least popular, so there will be times when it seems like other people are against you. Stay strong when others try to tear you down for doing what you believe is right.


There are exceptions to this rule - like when the action you took was actually wrong. Don't automatically get defensive if you're accused of being in the wrong. Think clearly about what happened and decide if you're still on board with your original actions. If you realize that it would have been better to do something different, admit it.

, Being physically strong and healthy is beneficial for your mind as well. If you're always tired and under the weather, it's going to be a lot more difficult to deal with issues that arise. Don't neglect your body's health if your goal is to be tough.


Get plenty of sleep. This will keep your body healthy and help you stay mentally alert. Aim for 7-8 hours per night. Make it a priority!Eat plenty of vegetables and fruits. Making these a mainstay of your diet will provide the vitamins and nutrients your mind needs to stay strong.Exercise. Cardio and strength training will keep your body and brain in good shape.Destress. If your world is cluttered up with a million things to do, it'll affect your power to make good decisions.

, There is strength in numbers. It's easier to build a wall around yourself than to reach out and form deep relationships with other people. Earning and keeping people's trust is no simple feat. It might sound strange, but exhibiting vulnerability with others is actually an important part of being tough.


Show your family, friends and colleagues, that you're trustworthy and dependable. Answer emails and calls promptly and be there for people when you're needed.
Take on a leadership role in your community. You could volunteer your time to help others, coach a little league team, start a neighborhood garden, and so on. Have a stake in your community!

, Having an active spiritual life will help give you the perspective you need when your problems threaten to consume you. Find ways to become more spiritually aware and connected to the rest of the world. Doing yoga, meditating, participating in a place of worship, and spending time in nature are all good ways to enrich yourself spiritually.

, Ultimately, being tough comes down to knowing your values and acting on them. Understanding this will help you deflect petty insults and avoid getting wrapped up in drama. It will help you figure out what's important to you and set out to achieve your goals. Most importantly, it will help you boldly make the choice to do what you know is right.

, To be truly effective, you need to know how to properly attack or defend yourself on a large scale. Military manuals are great, as is the classic ""Art of war"" by Sun Tzu.

, There are many instructional videos/manuals on proper room clearing. But most of it consists of sector control. Sector control is assigning a sector to each member in your team, and that is their responsibility to clear and watch. This is important if your team is on foot and on the move, to keep an eye out for threats, when a team member sees a threat they will yell ""Contact!"" and return fire. While the whole team should return fire, they should always be watching their own sectors to prevent being flanked.

, You have to train to push your failures. A true expert pushes himself/herself to failure, so they can fix the things they aren't good at, therefore constantly getting better.

, The quicker you finish the fight and neutralize any hostiles, the less you will get shot.

, Learn to really hear what others have to say and be genuinely interested in their lives, stories, and hopes. People always respond well to people who care and there is great subtle beauty to be found in being heard.

, Beauty regimes should not take up all of the time but should be straightforward, easy and effective. Invest in quality over quantity - a good hairbrush, a good hair smoothing implement, good makeup, good hair products, etc. When you find something that works, stick with it and keep using it rather than trying too far afield.

, Rely on a base color, such as black, white, brown, pink, etc., and a single pattern. Quality is always better than quantity. Spend money on clothing items that will last and still look lovely, rather than shelling out cash for cheap styles that will wear out quickly or fade out of fashion fast.

, Learn ways to show appreciation of others that don't include stooping to manipulative or unloving behavior.

, Be kind in every circumstance, even if it means holding your tongue.

, If you are at work, be professional. If you are visiting friends, be a good guest. Consider your circumstances in the way that you react to your environment.

, Having something that you are passionate about to work toward can make you more radiant and give you more direction.

, Maintain a ""glass half-full"", rather than a ""glass half-empty"" mentality. Identify what is good in your life, and be thankful for those blessings. Don't complain about everything that is wrong with your life situation, but do look for ways to improve your life and the lives of those around you.

, How you treat time shows other people your priorities. Those who value using time wisely can be subtly beautiful.

, Beautiful people care about what's going on around them, not just themselves.

Be strong and when something bad happens, keep your chin up and fix the problem. If you can't fix the problem by yourself though or if you didn't create the problem, accept help to put the problem to an end before it escalates. Know when to cross the line on being dependent but also know that once in a while you're going to need to accept help and that is not a sign of weakness––that's what friends and family are for, right?

Smile often. If you don't feel good, then the people around you won't feel good. A way to make yourself feel good is to smile. If you smile regularly, people will smile back. When you smile, you feel warm inside, and that feels good. Smile!

Life isn't about running around and being stressed-and if you are you're not being the best person that you can possibly be and no one wants to be around a stressed hurried person. Calm down!

, Don't do anything stupid when you know you will get hurt or in huge trouble, but be willing to try new and fun things. Whether that means trying a food from a different country that you've never even heard of before or going rock climbing, do it and have a blast while you're at it! Whatever you're doing have fun at it...this also goes along with being open minded to new ideas or thoughts.

, Discover what makes you tick personally! That could be art, singing, playing an instrument, writing, learning, exercise, dance, collecting things, making movies, scrap booking, animals, etc. Find what you enjoy and love and rock it! If you love singing, take singing lessons or practice everyday! If you like dance join a dance or gymnastic group. If you like art, learn to draw or paint new things or create your own masterpieces! Get into something and share your creations with the world. If you're having trouble finding what you love, keep trying things until you find it! You're bound to find something. Here are some ideas for a hobby that you can try:


Singing, dance, playing an instrument or making movies
Art. scrap booking
Writing and learning
Collecting things
Exercise, sports, fitness
Animals, caring for them, learning about them
Makeup, clothes, making clothes, doing hairstyles, etc.


Keep searching and you're bound to find something that suits you exactly.

, Don't be afraid to be a little out there; you might set a good example for others who wish to be true to themselves. Don't care what other people think of you, as they'll forget about that girl wearing the crazy unique outfit in less than 5 minutes anyway. Just be yourself and be the best you can be at it!

, This means brushing your hair everyday and night, brushing your teeth twice a day or after every meal, showering daily, washing your face and wearing deodorant. Make sure when you brush your teeth/hair, you get every nook and cranny.


Shower daily but do not wash your hair every day as this strips your hair of its natural oils and helps protect your hair.
Wash your body daily and wash your hair every other day. Wash your face two times a day and avoid touching your face or getting anything greasy on it to reduce or completely avid acne.
Wear deodorant and put it on once or more a day, depending on the heat and your activity level for the day. Put lotion on your dry spots such as your elbows or feet, and wash your hands daily (after you eat and before you eat, after handling something like an animal or bacteria, etc.)

, Wear unique clothes that fit your style. Try to add something to standard clothing and make it your signature look. Some unique accessories and clothes are: feather earrings, beanie hats, long or unique necklaces, friendship or bangle bracelets, arm bracelets, sharp rings, etc. Find outfits that you like that fit your style and that you personally like. Find your style, rather that be indie, goth/emo, jock, popular/average, or hipster clothing. (You can also make your own style!) You can make DIY clothing or buy it, depending on what you prefer. Have fun with it!

, Help others less fortunate than you! Whatever you do will come back to you, so why not make that a positive thing? If you see someone struggling with their groceries, lend a helping hand and help carry them or open the door for them. If your sister is crying in her room because her boyfriend just dumped her, lend your shoulder for crying on, listen to her problem and offer advice if asked. If you see a homeless person playing guitar with a money box begging for money for food that night, pay them some cash if you can or buy them a meal if you don't feel comfortable giving cash. Don't bully or harass people and don't insult others. Good people don't do things to hurt other people or start drama.

, Join charities and clubs, clean up around the town, and donate money for churches, tips, anything that will help the town, etc. Donate clothes and/or canned food for those less fortunate than you.


Help to improve your local environment. Pick up trash along the streets, or encourage recycling.
Try to make your community a real community. Get everybody together and have fun! Hold a potluck. Have a swim party. Congratulate newlyweds, babies, and the birthday girl/boy/man/woman.

, Talk to people! If invited, go to parties or sleepovers. Talk to people, answer questions, communicate. If you're shy now is the time to step out of your comfort zone and get outgoing! If you have a troubling past that affects your ability to do this, seek a therapist or doctor's help and you may be able to get medicine (doctor)or just have someone to listen and offer advice to (therapist.) Don't be ashamed if you do have to do this, everyone needs help sometime and if you have a troublesome past it's crucial that you get help instead of keeping it bottled inside. You also may have social anxiety, in that case you should seek help from either a trusted friend or family member, therapist or doctor and you should *try* to get out of your comfort zone and socialize a little more even if it's hard at first.

Keep the conversation going.",How to Be Suave," A significant part of being suave is looking the part. As a general rule, wear the best clothes you can get away with for any occasion and choose clothes that fit your body well.


If you do not know what clothes would be considered “impressive,” try asking for advice. You can ask a stylish man you know, but an even better bet might be to ask for a woman's advice. A woman will know exactly what styles look suave on a man from a woman's perspective.

If you do not have a girl in your life whom you can ask personally, check out men's fashion sources online that are written by women. One such example would be the Style Girlfriend blog (http://stylegirlfriend.com).

;
, If you want to look suave, you need to know when to play your style up and when to dress it down. Looking too formal can actually work against you on your quest for suaveness.


A suit will look out of place for a trip to the grocery store, yet it can be very dapper for a night at a high-class restaurant.
On occasions when the most appropriate outfit is a t-shirt and jeans, make sure that the clothes you wear are clean and free of rips or tears. Well-fitting clothes that are in good shape can be dashing even if they aren't as formal as a suit and tie.

, If you aren't sure about what “suave” style looks like, look to the professionals. Think of a gentleman who you consider to be the very epitome of suave and take notes on how he dresses.


Choosing a style icon from the modern era can help you figure out what clothes are presently considered fashionable for men. If you cannot think of any off the top of your head, go browsing through a magazine or blog like GQ Style (http://www.gq.com/style/blogs/the-gq-eye) D'Marge (http://www.dmarge.com/), or Inventory (http://www.inventorymagazine.com/updates/).
You can also take a look at the past to gain insight on how “suave” looks.Even though men of today's era can be fashionable, not all men's fashions are considered “suave.” Many male icons from the 1940s and 1950s were considered to be very suave, however. As an added bonus, you can look to these icons as examples of both suave fashion and suave behavior.

, While you can look to others as you develop a suave look, ultimately, you need to develop your own sense of style. Doing so will let you feel more confident in your clothes, which will give you a much more suave ambiance.

, Guys may think that accessories are for women, but a suave gentleman knows how to choose accessories to enhance his look. These little details can take your outfit up an extra notch and round off the entire look.


In particular, make use of ties, hats, masculine scarves, jackets or blazers, and shoes.
If you feel a little bolder, you could also try carrying around a something old-fashioned like a pocket watch or handkerchief.

, You cannot be suave if you look (and smell) like you haven't bathed in a week or brushed your teeth in a month. Good hygiene is the polish that makes a suave outfit shine.


Keep a trim look. The hair on your head and the hair on your face needs to be kept tidy. You do not necessarily need to be clean-shaven, but if you have facial hair of some sort, you need to keep it regularly trimmed and looking its finest. Otherwise, you can be clean while still looking grungy.
Wear cologne. This is only optional, of course, and the appropriateness of cologne will depend on the occasion. A little spritz before a date can go a long way, for instance. Just make sure that you use a little spritz and do not soak yourself in it, since an overpowering smell will turn people away.

, A well-timed smile can work wonders. Make your smile look as natural as possible, and use it to express self-confidence and an appreciation of the company you're presently keeping.Smiling is especially important if you are trying to make a good impression on a woman. Typically speaking, a man has more physical power than the average woman has. Most women know this and will stay away from you if they perceive you to be potentially dangerous or violent. Smiling sends the message that you are friendly and less likely to be a threat.
Make sure that you are smiling and not leering, though. An appreciative grin or quick flash of your pearly whites is all it takes. If you stare her down hungrily with a huge smile plastered across your face, you could end up seeming more creepy than suave.

, While there can be some appeal to a guy who seems a little aloof, aloofness and suaveness do not blend well. If you want to be a suave gentleman, you need to use body language that seems warm and welcoming so that the people around you feel comfortable.


An example of closed body language would be crossing your arms. This puts a physical barrier in between you and he person you are speaking to. Likewise, pointing your body or head in a direction pointing away from the person you're talking to conveys the message that your attention is directed, in part, toward something else.
People revert to closed body language because it feels safer and reduces the risk of rejection. To seem suave, you need to expect and invite people to accept you, which requires open body language.

, Eye contact lets the people around you know that you're listening and paying attention to them. Plus, focusing on eye contact can prevent your eyes from straying to other areas that you could get in trouble for staring at.


Direct eye contact can also make you seem more attractive to women. It produces a physiological response that keeps the brain interested, and as a result, you seem more interesting, as well.
There is such a thing as too much of a good thing, though. If you stare a woman down without blinking or occasionally turning away, you're likely to scare her off.
A good way to tell if you're doing it right is to gauge a woman's response to your eye contact. If she maintains eye contact back, that's a good sign. It can also be a good sign if she smiles shyly and looks away while stealing glances back into your eyes every now and then. It is a very bad sign if she attempts to put distance in between you and her, though, or if she looks away keeps her eyes from looking back into yours.

, Knowing how to nod in a suave way can take time, and it may not feel natural at first. A quick, affirmative head nod can add a touch of class to your verbal responses, however.


Nodding is one of the more subtle forms of body language. If you like the way a conversation is going, give a little nod and continue to do so every now and then. If you do not like the way a conversation is heading, stop nodding. Most people, especially women, will pick up on this polite and nonverbal cue.
In many cases, you will also notice that people, particularly women, tend to get a little more invested in a conversation once you start nodding. This signals to them that you find what they say to be interesting, and the subtlety of this move is what makes it so suave.

, When talking to someone you want to impress with your suave demeanor, move in a little closer to make a stronger impression. This little extra bit of personal attention can add a lot of power to your act.


If you're standing, take a step or two closer. When you're sitting, lean in. If either option feels unnatural for a certain circumstance, you can convey the same attitude simply by leaning your head toward the person you're speaking with.

, A light, friendly touch can be a good way to display the sort of confident, warm demeanor you need to be suave.


Most people in our society tend to be a little impersonal with people they do not know well. As such, we use very little touch on an everyday basis. Slightly brushing against an appropriate area, like a hand or a shoulder, can offer just enough touch to a touch-starved woman to make her want more.
Pay attention to body language. If you touch a girl and she tenses up or backs away, she is not comfortable with your touch. If she relaxes or leans into your touch, you're doing it the right way.

, When all else fails, just keep in mind that you need to appear confident to those around you to leave a suave impression. Your body language and behavior should all ooze with self-confidence. Just be careful to avoid seeming narcissistic.


Along with many of the tips already mentioned, you need to have confident posture. In other words, no slouching is allowed. Keep your back straight and your shoulders squared.

, Another key element of being suave is knowing how to be a gentleman. Never push or pry your way into someone's personal space, and treat others with respect. Nothing screams “suave” more than a man who knows how to treat both himself and others right.

, If you want to take it all to the next level, work on enhancing your vocabulary and becoming a more proficient speaker. An enhanced vocabulary gives the impression of intelligence and wit, both of which can be highly attractive qualities.


A natural way to enhance your vocabulary is to read more. As an added benefit, your knowledge base will increase alongside your vocabulary.
Speaking with a lot of slang is not recommended. Slang is very “common” in terms of language, but in order to be suave, you need to be more than common.

, Even though an advanced vocabulary can be a good trait to possess, you should never try to push it. It will be obvious if you are forcing yourself to use words that feel unnatural to you. Instead, opt for a more polished form of your natural way of speaking.


As a rule of thumb, if you have never heard a word in a sentence or have only heard a word once or twice, you should probably avoid using it.

, You might think that pet names can seem endearing, but many people consider them to be condescending or rude. Wait until after you have developed some sort of personal relationship with a person before using pet names, especially when dealing with women.


Even after you get to know a girl, you should be careful about pet names. Try it once. If the person you speak to has a positive reaction, you can keep using that pet name, as long as you occasionally use her real name, as well. If you get a negative reaction, you should just stick with the real name all the time.

, Being a good conversationalist goes hand in hand with appearing self-confident and intelligent. A guy who can maintain a conversation in a smooth manner will seem more intriguing and pleasant to be around.

Stop judging.What we fear other people think about us are often the things that we dislike, criticize or judge about other people.,
Adapt.,
Have fun.",How to Be Someone Else," Ask yourself what the reasons are behind your desire to change. This way you can discover the root of your problem. Once you know where the wish to be someone else is coming from, you can solve the problem's source.


Don’t base your need to become someone else off of a few isolated events. Challenges and undesirable circumstances happen to all of us every now and then. We all make mistakes and try to learn from them regularly as well.
If there is a clear and repeating pattern to your experiences or relationships that provides clues to where you could improve, then use that information to your advantage. Explore where relationships broke down or what you have been criticized for.;
, If certain things are bothering you, find out what they are and how you can make them better.


If you’re not happy with yourself, figure out why. Are you overweight? Have a nervous disposition? Disorganized?
If you are merely bored with the way things are and want a change, reflect on what exactly you are not satisfied with. Is it your relationship? Your job? Your house or car? The weather? Focus on the area that you want to change.

, You know what needs to change so you can be who you want to be. Now you need to brainstorm ways to fix or make the problem better.


If you need to lose weight to feel healthy and happy then concentrate on that. Start going to the gym, lower your fat and carbohydrate intake and get engaged in a social group for support.
If you suffer from anxiety, then seek help from a professional, practice meditation and take opportunities to practice being assertive.
If you are tired of people calling you boring, do something adventurous like sky diving, mountain climbing, sailing or learning to fly a plane.
If you’re unhappy with your romantic partner, do something new together, find ways to connect and appreciate each other, go to counseling or consider moving on.
If you're sick of your job, get a new one or go back to school to learn new skills so you can get the job of your dreams and earn the house and car that you want. Move away if you are unhappy with where you’re at because it rains too much or gets too cold.

, Now it’s time to think about the kind of life you want and the kind of person you want to be. Reflect on the behavior, beliefs and values of those you admire to learn how to be successful in all areas of your life.


You probably admire someone—a character from a movie or book, a celebrity, sports figure, family member, or a Nobel Peace Prize winner. Do you want to be like your favorite TV character? Or like your girlfriend or boyfriend? Once you narrow down whom it is you want to be like, you can begin to develop character traits for self-improvement based off of their example.
Select good personal qualities that will make your life better, not worse. Ending up in jail or driving away the people in your life that matter will not help you feel better. Examples might include being interesting, sympathetic, or charming.

, If you lie to people about what you can do or who you are, it is not likely to go well when they find out the truth–and they will, eventually.


Don’t act like a wealthy person when you only have a few dollars in your pocket and can’t afford dinner for two, let alone that vacation to Hawaii.
Don’t pretend to know about cars to get a date and happen to end up on the side of the road with a blown out tire you don’t know how to change.
Likewise, learn to play an instrument or cook before attempting to impress someone with your know-how.

, It takes knowledge, dedication and practice to become someone other than who you are right now. It is easier if you have an example to work toward. You’ll need to do some serious investigation to uncover clues that will teach you how to be similar.


Read autobiographies, biographies, stories, and articles about or by the person you admire. Also, check out fan and personal websites.
Observe them on video and pay attention to the qualities that you want to take on, such as appearance and style, how they interact and communicate, how they behave under pressure and how they appear to others. Are they confident, respectful, friendly, positive, compassionate, or powerful?
Try to meet the person who inspires you. If you can chat with the person you want to be at an event, conference, or other location, even better. Try to get to know who they really are, how they got where they are, and whether they might have any advice.

, You need to know what you want and how to get there. You want to make changes to become someone different than yourself at the moment.To come up with a goal, first you need to figure out where exactly you are trying to get to and what the end result needs to be. For example, you want to be more self-confident like your favorite female sports player. You want to be able to be great at tennis, basketball, football or compete in the Olympics.A goal is not just what you want but something you are willing to work toward. You need to ask yourself if you can work toward the end goal. Are you willing to work out, building muscle, practicing every day? This will tell you how badly you want something.Don't set yourself up for failure. Even though there are many tools that can help, such as motivating books and support groups, you're the only one who can change you. There's no magic pill–it will take work and dedication., You will want to focus first on the traits and behavior that you can modify with the least work so that you don’t get overwhelmed. As you get used to adopting new characteristics, you can move on to the more difficult changes that will take the most time and energy to master.


Changing your appearance is usually a lot easier than altering years of learned habits. It can also go a long way toward making you feel different enough to motivate you to change other factors.
Changes that come more naturally will be easier. For example, if you have always been polite, then going out of your way to be extra polite will not take that much more effort. If you like to smile and laugh, then remembering to smile as much as possible throughout the day will probably be fairly easy.
Embrace the challenge. Some things can be very difficult to overcome. For example, if you're usually a timid person who keeps to themselves, then waving and saying “Hi” to strangers may be uncomfortable at first.
Know that with every challenge you accept and complete successfully, you will be closer to becoming the person you want to be.

, How we present ourselves to the outside world dictates not only first impressions but often how we are perceived and treated.If you want to stand out, then wear clothing, colors, or haircuts that make you look different than other people.


If you want to be perceived a certain way, such as wealthy or a professional, dress and look the part. If you want to be seen as laid back and down-to-earth, you may want to dress down.
If you normally wear glasses, have long, brown hair and don’t wear makeup, think about how you might update your appearance. Cut your hair into a funky, short style and dye it a bold color like red, purple, blonde, or deep black. Get contacts or pick up chic-styled frames.
Pick up some guides on creative ways to do your makeup and practice different looks.
Buy new clothes. Think about what the new character you have decided to become would want to wear. Choose flattering options and wear what feels good to you. You probably want your appearance to go along with the positive new attributes you are working on.

, We see how they move, their gestures, and facial expressions, and form opinions about them based on those.


Watch how you move. The way a person moves can have a huge impact on how others perceive them. Move with confidence and poise.
Put on the outfit and shoes you will be wearing in public. Practice walking in high heels if they are part of your new look. Watch yourself in a mirror to see how you swing your arms and sway your hips.
Watch your expressions in the mirror. Practice smiling, laughing, and appearing engaged. See if you can hold a conversation with your new self.
You may also want to record yourself and watch it on video to see where you might improve your communication skills and body language. If you habitually twirl your hair, for example, consider whether this is a desirable trait for your new character. If not, make a deliberate attempt not to carry on this habit.

, Use everything you’ve learned to become someone else. Make choices that will move you closer to your goal of becoming a new person.


Try on different qualities from people you admire. Go out to the store and be the high-energy, social butterfly that is curious about strangers and cracks jokes. Be the hero who can overcome any obstacle. Go out and train until you win a race.
If you’re stuck in a job position that seems to go nowhere, then get a completely new position doing something you enjoy more, or use your past experience to move up to a higher level role for another company. Open your own business or take on a student role for a while so you can become a doctor, lawyer, or something else. Move to another city with more opportunities for your skill sets.
If you’ve always been the one who gets stepped on in relationships, be the one who knows what they do or don’t want in the relationship first. Cultivate trust, mutual respect, and demand that you be treated as an equal. Learn to walk away from people and things that don’t benefit you.

, Remember, becoming someone else doesn’t happen over night. You will need to find out what you want, how to do it and keep at it until it works for you.


Focus on getting your characteristics down. You want the way you look, act, and the things you do to be second nature and part of your new identity. Practice regularly in multiple situations, roles, and relationships. Eventually, you won’t have to work at it anymore because it will become a part of who you are.
Participate in a new activity or hobby regularly, preferably outside of your comfort zone. This will stretch your horizons and allow you to learn to adapt to new situations and experiences more quickly.
Know your limitations. Some things cannot be safely altered and should not be, such as body type, height, foot size, finger length, or skin color, among others. Accept what you cannot change and spend your energy working on the things you can.

, Be less judgmental to free yourself and others from this burden. It is hard to learn from others or grow as a person if you’re always feeling envious about another’s successes.


Resist the urge to be critical of others as well as yourself and start being an objective observer. Find out how others deal with failure, challenges, and try to integrate all these good qualities into your developing personality.
Recognize when you do a good job, handle a social situation successfully, or influence people in positive ways. Pin down how you did it, what you did that helped, and maybe what you did that didn’t help.

, You will likely have to tailor certain qualities, styles, and roles to suit you. Sometimes things won’t work for you and that’s fine. Have the strength to throw out what won’t serve your transformation positively and focus on those that will.


If you have long black hair and want long blonde hair, know that repeated processing over time will likely damage your hair. You may need to keep it short instead of long to avoid breakage and a scraggly look. Consider using dark hair to your advantage and adding some beautiful highlights that look gorgeous against your deep hair color.
If you are 5’ and rather stocky, maybe you shouldn't expend a lot of energy to become a supermodel or famous basketball player—though there’s always a chance. Try being a face model, kickboxer, or a jockey instead. The trick is to problem-solve and adapt the quality you want to suit any limitations.

, Don't take things personally. Some people may not understand what you are doing or why and could make fun of you. Embrace how far you have come and who you have become. Soon, the old you will be forgotten and the person you have worked so hard to become will truly be who you are.


When dealing with ridicule, think about how the person you admire would react and respond. Hopefully, you will do the right thing in this situation, too.
It’s hard to have fun if you’re always worrying about how you appear to other people. Most social interaction is not defined by rigid rules, and people are not waiting to make fun of you if you do something that isn’t considered normal. Just go along with the flow of the conversation and if you need to pause to think, do so.

Most of the time, following your parents' rules is better than breaking them. It leads to less fighting and more appreciation. When your parents think of you as a good kid and can trust you, you get rewarded with more privileges. Even if your parents are control freaks, they often only want what's best for you, so try to work with them as opposed to automatically rebelling.;
, Accept yourself for who you are. As Oscar Wild stated ""Be yourself; everyone else is taken."" If being cool means being someone or doing something that you aren't happy or comfortable with, then don't do it. The coolest people are confident in themselves and not putting on a show.

, You may have true friends that are popular. You may have true friends that are nerds. Don't judge your friends based on their social status. If you're only friends with someone because you think it will make you popular, then your friendship means nothing. People who aren't true friends won't be there to help you when you need it and they won't make you feel better about yourself. Find friends that are nice, trustworthy and share some interests with you (reading, shopping, gaming, music).

, Don't just think ""I care about parties"" or ""I care about popularity"". Try to dig deeper. Often kids think they want to be popular and party because people in movies and on tv do that. Everyone is an individual, though, so what's fun for one person may be boring to another.

, Don't do stuff you hate because your friends are doing it or it's the cool thing to do. If you have a passion for swimming, don't settle for the football team. If you have a passion for choir, don't do cheer because that's what your friends do. If you do what you love, you'll most likely be happier and more successful. You might also make friends who share your interest.

, Trying hard in school is one thing. Don't let it take over your life though. Judging yourself based on your grades is like judging yourself based on your popularity. In order to be really satisfied with yourself, you respect yourself no matter what your grades (or your peers) say. If you usually get A's, but you get a C in a class, it doesn't mean you're stupid. It means you struggled with a class. If you consistently get poor grades, try talking with a teacher or counselor to explore your options. It may be that your workload is too heavy or that you need a tutor or better study habits. It doesn't mean that you're stupid.

, Whether it's your crush or popularity or the fight you had with your friend, obsessing over something doesn't make you happier. It makes you more anxious and unable to cope. Try to remain calm.

, If you're being yourself, then you are unique and that's something to be proud of. If you're nice to others and you don't judge based on popularity, that's another thing to be proud of. If you get great grades, that's something to be proud of. If you are a loyal friend, that's something to be proud of. As long as you are yourself and you try to be kind to others, you will have plenty of reasons to be proud of yourself, and no reason to be ashamed.

, Maybe you've gotten stuck in a rut. Take a hobby to the next level. If you like writing songs, record one and put it on youtube. If you love sketching little pictures, make a comic book or paint a mural. If you love style, design (and even make!) an item of clothing or an accessory.

, Not drama; something fun and constructive. If you need service hours or you just want to give back to the world, start a charity or host a fundraiser. If you love music and you know others who do to, start a band. You'd be surprised how far you can get if you take your band seriously. Try to get local gigs. Start a club for people with a similar interest: books, Asian TV shows, video games, cooking - anything really.

, Not everything meaningful in your life has to be a social activity. If you have a passion for books, but you don't want to start a book club, or you have trouble getting along with people, then do what you love by yourself. Read. If you can't start a band, write your own songs and sing them and record them. Be creative and make something or be proactive and try to better yourself (get more fit, learn a new language, get a new skill).

, It's better to be known as the guy who started a charity to help disabled children or the girl who wrote a novel than to be known as ""that guy who is always high"" or ""that girl who sleeps around"". Know what you care about and are good at, and let everyone see that great side of you. Don't flaunt it. Just let it shine through.

, It helps you later in life and it gives you a sense of pride and accomplishment when your hard work pays off. Your parents will also appreciate your hard work (and if they don't, that's their problem).

, This can be really hard, but don't bow into peer pressure. This means more than not taking drugs or drinking (though you shouldn't do those). Don't date someone just because your friends think that person is cool. Don't join the track team if you hate running and have a bad knee. Don't stay out past your curfew and get into trouble just because your friends are doing it too.

, Try something new for a change and try to be nice to new people who you meet. If you aren't stubborn and stagnant, then your life will be exciting. That said...

, As great as change is, if something in your life is very important and you love it how it is, don't change it just for fun. This goes for hobbies, friendships or even your own attributes.

, High school is a transition from elementary school and day care to college and the adult world. If you do things and have friends and interests outside of your high school then things that happen at high school (drama with friends, a poor grade, unpopularity) won't seem like the end of the world. Having interests and friends outside of high school gives you perspective.

Choose clothing with ""classic"" appeal.,
Prioritize simple, minimalist outfits over complicated ones.,
Wear clothing that fits you naturally.,
Don't go overboard with accessories.,
Keep a natural, clean-cut hairstyle.,
Be conservative with tattoos and piercings.,
Beware of styles that became popular only recently.",How to Be Timeless1," If you're interested in looking timeless, start by considering clothing choices that have already been proven as timeless. While many trends in fashion come and go, some basic outfits stay more or less the same over time. Below are just a few outfit ideas for men and women that have been popular for at least a quarter-century and likely will be for the near future:



Women: Skirts with blouses, jeans with tee shirts, black tights, simply-patterned dresses, flats, heels.

Men: Shirt-and-tie combos, suit jackets/blazers, fitted dress pants, medium-to-dark jeans, polo shirts, medium-length tee shirts, sneakers, dress shoes.;
, Having a timeless look is often as much about what you don't wear as it is about what you do wear. A timeless look is one that doesn't ""try too hard"" to catch others' attention. Instead, it lets the wearer's natural good looks speak for themselves. Try to wear mostly simple, unpretentious pieces of clothing, rather than flashy, overly-showy pieces. Whites, blacks, one-color items, and simple prints are good ideas — neon colors and overcomplicated patterns are not.


Not only will this give you a timeless look, but it will also save you money in the long run as you shop for clothes. Simple pieces of clothing (especially items that are either white or black) can be used in a huge range of outfits and still look good, while flashy pieces usually give you much more limited options and require you to buy more clothing to compensate.
For a great example of timeless fashion from the world of TV, consider the cult classic 90s show Twin Peaks. In show that's filled with sometimes-garish late 80s/early 90s fashion choices, the show's main character, detective Dale Cooper, looks about as good today as he did back then. By wearing mostly simple, elegant suit-and-tie combinations, he avoids looking like a stereotypical member of Generation X and instead achieves timeless appeal.

, Almost every outfit will look best on you if your clothing fits well. While it may occasionally be fashionable to wear clothes that don't fit properly in a conventional sense, these sorts of fashion choices are unlikely to beat the long-term appeal of clothing that fits you well. If you're shopping for formal clothes, don't be afraid to spend a little extra money at a tailor's to get your outfits looking just right. For casual clothes, you can be a little more forgiving about getting your fit exactly right, but it's still in your best interest to pick clothes that fit your figure comfortably without being too loose.


As a very general rule, clothing that's especially tight or especially loose is often part of a temporary trend or fad. For example, think of the tight pants worn by men in the disco scene in the 1970s — they were popular at one point, but today, it would be almost unthinkable for a man to seriously wear skin-hugging white polyester slacks. Keep this in mind if, for example, you're considering shopping for skinny jeans to give yourself a modern hipster look!

, One or two great accessories can be the ""cherries on top"" of a timeless outfit — on the other hand, wearing a dozen flashy accessories can be a great way to date yourself. Below are just a few great accessory ideas for men and women — try to pick one or two at maximum and tend towards simple, elegant accessories rather than large, attention-seeking ones.



Women: Jewelry/earrings, purse/backpack, sunglasses, light makeup/lipstick, bracelets, painted nails, scarves

Men: Dignified watches, ties, simple cufflinks, backpack/messenger bag/briefcase, sunglasses, jewelry or medallion (preferably worn around the neck and under the clothes)
For a textbook example of how to use accessories, look up photos of Audrey Hepburn in her prime. The most famous photo of the actress shows her in-character for the movie Breakfast at Tiffany's with plenty of jewelry and a long, skinny cigarette holder that would look fairly out-of-fashion today. However, the photos of Hepburn out-of-character are another story — she usually wears simple, one-colored tops accompanied with elegant earrings and light makeup for a look that's as striking today as it was decades ago.

, Some hairstyles belong to a certain time and place, while others virtually never go out of style. For example, it's difficult to think of a ""beehive"" hairdo without thinking of out-of-date style that housewives wore in the 1960s. On the other hand, a woman who wears an ordinary bob or simply lets her hair grow out won't necessarily scream, ""2010s!"" in a few years. Below are just a few ideas for hairstyles that aren't likely to go out of style any time soon:



Women: Bobs, ""fringe"" cuts, long natural hair, layered cuts, ordinary ponytails, braids, bangs (optionally)

Men: Crew cuts, buzz cuts, short parted hairdos, shaved heads. Light application of gel or pomade is OK.
As a very general rule, hairstyles that require lots of maintenance or upkeep are less likely to be timeless than others. For example, a spiky liberty mohawk, which requires daily application of hair products to keep it standing up, will almost always call to mind the punk scene of the 70s and 80s. There are, however, some exceptions — dreadlocks, for instance, can require some work to maintain, but can be a perfectly timeless look for someone with naturally kinky hair.

, When it comes to being timeless, modifying your body permanently is something you'll want to be very careful about. You can always throw out or donate tasteless clothes, but piercings and (especially) tattoos can be much harder (and more expensive) to get rid of. Never get a tattoo or piercing on a whim — instead, talk to your friends, your family, and your tattoo artist/piercer to discuss whether it would be a smart long-term choice. When in doubt, err on the side of safety and don't get the tattoo or piercing. It's never embarrassing not to have any tattoos or piercings.


Keep in mind that, unfortunately, potential employers may make judgements about you based on your tattoos or piercings. It's not fair, but it's true — many employers report that tattoos (especially those on the hands or face) can make an otherwise-qualified applicant seem unsavory.Women have a little more freedom with piercings than men do. For example, it's not at all unusual for a woman to have earrings, but it's still sometimes considered unconventional for men to wear them, especially in formal settings. Many women can even pull off wearing a simple nose stud in a formal context, while this would be very unusual for a man to do.
As a general rule, if you're getting a tattoo, it's wisest to get it somewhere on your body that isn't ordinarily exposed (like your chest, ribs, back, and so on.) This way, even if your tattoo ends up being a source of embarrassment in a few years, you won't have to show it to anyone you meet.

, If there's one major rule to take away from this section, it's this: avoid fashion trends that are popular today but weren't popular in the past, because these are almost certain to become unpopular again sooner or later. Fashion trends are constantly changing — a piece of clothing or a haircut that's ""in"" today may be majorly embarrassing in just a few years' time. However, by sticking to the classic, timeless suggestions above (which have changed only a little over the last few decades) you'll stay looking great for years to come.

Stop thinking about sensuality as having to do only with sex and consider all of the other ways that you can be sensual; standing in the middle of a downpour, dipping strawberries in chocolate, or closing your eyes and listening to your favorite classical music. Once you let go of your preconceptions about what it means to be sensual, you can feel more freed about your own personal exploration.


Being sensual is not all about what happens in the bedroom. However, being sensual in your everyday life and taking the time to enjoy the world around you can make you feel more pleasure in the bedroom for sure.;
, No, this doesn't mean what you're thinking -- it just means that, if you want to be a sensual person, that you have to be comfortable in your own skin first and foremost. If you're not happy with who you are or how you look, then it'll be much more difficult for you to let go and let your body enjoy the world around you, whether you're kissing your partner or sunbathing on the beach. Work on building your confidence and self-esteem, and soon, you'll see that you'll be getting more pleasure and joy out of the ordinary things around you.

This doesn't mean you have to look like a supermodel, or even think that you look like a supermodel. It just means that you have to love your body and be open to whatever sensations the world may bring it.







Being comfortable in your own skin isn't something that happens overnight. But you can make a concerted effort to feel happier with who you are by doing the things you love, being around the people who make you feel good, and to work on improving anything you'd like to improve.







, If you really want to be sensual, then you have to stop rushing through your day without stopping to breathe -- or to enjoy the rainbow forming over the clouds. There's a reason people say that you should ""Stop and smell the roses."" Life can pass us by in a flash, and it's important to take the time to acknowledge the world around you. Leave for work or school fifteen minutes early so you can take it slow and notice the world around you. Take a walk and look around you instead of texting or being on the phone at all times. If your friend gets up to go the bathroom at a bar, look at the interesting patrons around you instead of logging into your Facebook. You'll see what a big difference this makes in your ability to indulge in the world around you.


Part of the reason you may find it hard to slow down is because your days are so packed that you don't have a moment to breathe. See what you can cut down on to free up some time just for enjoying the world around you. If this sounds ridiculous, make slightly more concrete plans; decide to watch the sunset, enjoy a bottle of wine with a friend, or go to an outdoor concert.

, Sensual people are always looking to take a bigger bite out of life. Don't just try to enjoy the same old things you've been doing, but find new ways to use your senses and to experience the world. Go on a long hike and stop and look at the flora and fauna, go wine tasting with your partner, or cook a long and savory breakfast instead of your usual granola bar on the go. Think about something you've always wanted to do, whether it's mountain biking or taking photos of the roses in the beautiful garden in your town, and make a plan to actually accomplish it.


This doesn't mean you should get stressed out by all of the millions of ways to be sensual out there. It does mean that you should always be open to new sensory experiences, though.

, If you want to be sensual, then you have to learn to live in the present and to take each day as it comes. Don't spend all day fretting about something that will happen three months from now or regretting something you said a week ago. It's just not worth it and it won't change anything. Instead, enjoy the day you're in, look around you, get some fresh air, and take pleasure in even the ordinary conversations you may be having with your coworkers. Learn to live in the moment and you'll be able to take the time to experience sensory pleasure.


Whether you're taking the bus home or sitting at work, take the time to notice the world around you. What is the weather like? What do you see outside your window? What do you smell? What do you hear? How many details can you write down about the present moment? Getting in the habit of asking yourself these details can help you live in the present.

, Don't feel guilty about doing things that actually make you feel good and happy. This can mean having sex with your partner more often, taking the time to cook a delicious meal even if you're short on time, or playing your favorite record in the morning when you wake up. You're not hurting anybody by spending more time indulging in your favorite pleasures, and you're becoming a more sensual person in the process.


Think about what an average week in your life looks like. Are there things you can cut out, like watching lame TV shows, in favor of doing something you really love, like taking a yoga class or painting in the gardens near your home?

, Spend more time brushing your hair, tossing your hair back, running your fingers through your hair, and just enjoying the feeling of your hair on your head. When you're in the shower, take the time to massage shampoo and conditioner into your scalp and enjoy the feeling of running your fingers through your locks. This will help you indulge in one of the most amazing parts of your body. And if you have a partner, playing with his or her hair will add a sensual touch to your relationship.

, That's right. Being in the shower doesn't have to feel like a race to get in and out as fast as humanly possible. Though it's nice to be eco- friendly and to save water, soak in a bath or just spend some time soaping your body and enjoying the sensation of getting clean and feeling the water running over your body. Sing to yourself if you want to. Just spent the time enjoying the sensation of getting clean instead of trying to rush on with your day as fast as you can.

, Take a nicely scented lotion and massage it into your body. This will help you spend more time with your sensations, both because of your sense of touch and your sense of smell. Your body will also feel softer and you'll enjoy touching and feeling it throughout the day. The lotion doesn't have to have an overwhelming scent; just a touch of juniper or lilac can make you feel happier throughout your day.

, Wear a nice silk robe. Spend time under your favorite comfy blanket. Get a new pillow that feels heavenly under your head. Wear the jacket that makes you feel like you're wearing a pillow. Take the time to enjoy the sensation of a nice piece of fabric or cloth between your fingers or on your body, and you'll be having a more sensual experience.

, Farmer's markets are the perfect place to make use of all of your senses. Go to your local farmer's market and try all of the samples the vendors offer. Feel the weight and the texture of the different fruits and vegetables you have in your hands. Stop and smell the fresh cilantro, parsley, dill, and other herbs you see. Take the time to enjoy a pleasant conversation with the people selling the produce and bring home at least some fresh fruit and a bouquet of flowers. You don't have to be a master chef to enjoy this sensory -- and sensual -- experience.

, Cooking a simple meal at home can awaken your senses and make you feel much more sensual about the process of making food and eating it. You don't have to be Julia Child to bake some chicken in the oven, make a delicious salad of beets and feta cheese, and grill some delicious polenta to go with it. Taking the time to cook the food, especially if you're with a friend and enjoying some wine in the process, can take the sensory experience of eating to a whole new level.

, Plan a wine tasting trip with your loved one or a group of friends. Not only is tasting a variety of wines a perfect sensory awakening, but wine country is almost always beautiful, whether you're in Napa Valley or the Rhone Valley, and you will awaken your sense of taste, smell, and sight as you embark on this gorgeous adventure.

, Whether you love Queen or Lily Allen, there's nothing wrong with blasting your favorite music whenever you feel like it (as long as you're not driving people crazy in the process). Wake up to your favorite songs, listen to them when you're driving, or throw a private dance party when you're making dinner by yourself. You can also hit up the clubs with some friends or go to a concert. Music awakens your senses and makes your mind and body come alive.

, Whether this means going on a hike, walking through a redwood forest, or just lying on the beach, hearing the sounds of the waves crashing on the shores, take the time to make nature a big part of your life and you won't regret it. The more time you spent outside in the sunshine, breathing the fresh air and enjoying the natural world, the more sensual you will feel. Being around nature also helps you learn to live in the present and to appreciate what you have, which are key parts of being sensual as well.

, Whether you like modern art or are more into Renaissance paintings, go to a museum of your choice and enjoy the contemplative silence that fills each room, as you and the other patrons enjoy the beautiful work around you. Stand before a painting without judgment, not trying to analyze it or even read about it, but just thinking about how it makes you feel. Spend at least two hours there without your cell phone or without saying a word, and see how much you awaken your sense of sight.

, Being sensual with your partner isn't all about taking your clothes off. In fact, holding hands with your partner, caressing his fingers, and feeling the weight of his hand in yours can be some of the most sensual experiences you may have. Take the time to hold hands with your partner more, whether you're taking a moonlit walk, sitting at dinner, or watching television. You'll be surprised by how much this can deepen your connection.

, Don't just see your kisses as a means to something more or as a perfunctory way to greet your partner. Instead, take the time to really enjoy kissing your partner just because, with no strings attached. Kiss your partner for at least six seconds every day, and spend time just sitting around and kissing; this can lead to an amazing sensation, no matter how long you've been together.

, Massages are definitely some of the most sensual experiences out there, and you can definitely take your relationship to a new sensual level if you and your partner give each other massages. You can take turns, or just focus on your partner (or do the reverse) for a night and see how good it feels to either have your back, shoulders, arms, and body get massaged after a long day or to give your partner the same pleasure. You can even take it to the next level by rubbing lotion on each other's bodies in the process.

, Though you may not think snuggling and cuddling is anything but cutesy, they are actually part of an important sensory experience. Taking the time to sidle up to your partner and to feel your bodies fall in sync can be a very sensual experience, whether it leads to something more or not. Make the time to snuggle more with your partner, whether you're in bed together or just watching television. Connecting your bodies in this way can lead to a more sensual relationship.

, Who says that love letters are dated? Try writing your loved one a love letter just because you feel like telling him or her how amazing he or she is. You don't have to write one because of a birthday, anniversary, or Valentine's Day, and the thought will count even more if you send or give your special someone a love letter on a random Tuesday. You can leave the sweet message around for your partner to find, and soon you'll see that you've taken your relationship to new sensual level.

, Take the time to really look at your significant other when he or she walks in the room, when you're talking, or even when you're just passing each other. There's something very sensual about locking eyes with the person that you love, and you should make a habit of doing it more often, even if you're just having an ordinary conversation. Making more eye contact with your partner will deepen your connection and will make your relationship much more sensual.

, That's right. You are never too old to tickle someone, and tickling your partner, or getting into a tickle fight, can lead to more sensory pleasure. Even if you're just laughing and goofing off, you'll also be experiencing more sensory sensations, and will indulge in feeling the light-as-a-feather touch on your toes, neck, or sides. Tickling feet can also be a very sensual activity, especially if you're using a feather.

, This doesn't mean that you should just make love for longer, but that you should be more thoughtful and present when you're making that physical connection with your partner, whether you're kissing or doing more. Devote more of your relationship to keeping your love connection going fiery and strong, not just because you think you have to make love or hook up a certain amount of times a week. If you're more mindful about making that connection, you will awaken your sensuality.

Don't be afraid of aging.,
Be true to yourself, not passing trends.,
Don't compare yourself to other people.,
Have an appreciation for great things from the past.,
Pick timeless role models.",How to Be Timeless2," Having a timeless sense of style is as simple as buying some new clothes and getting a good haircut. Becoming a timeless person, however, is another thing entirely — you'll need to attempt the difficult tasks of unfocusing your attention from the here and now and getting a broader perspective on life. To start, try to place less of an importance on the passage of time in the first place. Don't worry about growing old — trying to stay young forever or recapture past glory days will only date you. There are few things more awkward than someone who's aged out of a certain social group trying desperately to stay ""cool"" in the eyes of the younger members.


If you're worried about growing up or aging, it can help to look at the benefits of these things, rather than just the scary and sad parts.For instance, while adults may sometimes fall out of touch with old friends, they also have lots of opportunities to make new ones while devoting their energy to a fulfilling career. Older people also usually have the advantage of maturity and experience over younger people, which can make things that used to seem like a big deal (for instance, peer pressure) seem like no big deal at all.

, A timeless person has a self-identity that doesn't change depending on what's currently popular. Don't make any conscious choices to redefine yourself based on what other people think. Instead, any change in the way you see yourself should come about naturally and effortlessly over time. Don't look down on yourself if you don't conform exactly to what's popular today. Popularity is fleeting and can change at a moment's notice — the sense of peace you get from being true to yourself, on the other hand, lasts forever.


Beware: living your life to be trendy at all costs without considering your true feelings can cause significant problems in the long run: for instance, you may waste time and money trying to get a hold of the latest clothes and consumer goods, you may lose sight of who you truly ""are"" as a person and suffer identity confusion, and more. Being true to yourself avoids all this.

, In the words of Teddy Roosevelt, ""Comparison is the thief of joy.""It's a common piece of life advice to avoid comparing yourself to other people because it's ultimately pointless and will almost always lower your self-image. This habit isn't just a surefire way to become insecure and unhappy, however — it will also keep you from being timeless. Spending your time worrying about how everyone has a better life than you robs you of the time and energy you need to grow as person. Rather than changing and maturing naturally, you become static, forcing yourself only to make changes as a reaction to other people and never because of your true feelings and desires.


For young people, avoiding harmful comparisons to other people can be as simple as resisting peer pressure: for example, you shouldn't abandon your tried and true friends once you get a chance at hanging out with the ""cool kids."" Why be stressed about appearing unpopular when you can simply enjoy your time spent with your true friends?
For adults, this can be more complex: for example, you won't want to compare yourself unfavorably to a coworker who has all the latest tech gadgets or a new car. These things are sources of fleeting pleasure, not lasting satisfaction, so they have no bearing on your status as an individual. If you're true to yourself and this person is not, you're the happier person, no matter what car you drive.

, Someone who's living a timeless life won't be obsessed only with media and art that's currently popular. Instead, she'll have a rich variety of interests that shows an appreciation for the great works of the past and a discriminating taste for the best that the modern world has to offer. A timeless person understands, for instance, that while the language of great books, movies, and music may eventually start to seem old-fashioned, the thoughtfulness and emotional resonance of these works don't diminish with time. Below are just a few select examples of pieces of media that are widely considered to be timeless (there are many, many more.)



Books:Ulysses, To Kill a Mockingbird, Lolita, Catch-22, Native Son, I, Claudius, Pride and Prejudice, A Brave New World.

Movies:The Godfather, Citizen Kane, Vertigo, The Shawshank Redemption, Casablanca, Apocalypse Now, Alien.

Music: Revolver (The Beatles), Dark Side of the Moon (Pink Floyd), Aquemini (Outkast), What's Going On (Marvin Gaye), Blood on the Tracks (Bob Dylan), Thriller (Michael Jackson), London Calling (The Clash).

, A timeless person knows that's wise to pick inspiring people to look up to and to learn from their example when possible. The people who inspire us can be famous people who've achieved great things, people who have shown incredible strength and integrity, or simply friends and family members who have given our lives meaning in some way. Don't waste time worshiping at the altar of pop celebrities — instead, pick a genuine role model with something more substantial and long-lasting to offer you. Below are just a few examples of role models who are truly timeless:



Jesse Owens: A black American who won four gold medals at the 1936 Olympics in Berlin, Germany, single-handedly humiliating Adolph Hitler and disproving the Nazi doctrine of Aryan racial superiority.

Florence Nightingale: A british nurse who selflessly treated wounded soldiers during the Crimean war whose contributions to the field of nursing helped improved the terrible conditions of hospitals at the time.

Sri Chinmoy: Indian spiritual leader who founded the Oneness-Home Peace Run, an event in support of world peace.Note also that role models don't necessarily have to be real people — fictional characters can also be sources of inspiration in your life. A well-written character like, for example, Atticus Finch from To Kill a Mockingbird can be a great role model. In this example, Finch's tremendous strength of character and sense of justice can be an inspiration to anyone who wants to create these qualities in herself.

",How to Be Polite1," This doesn't mean you need to act like a meek, quiet pushover. It means that when you do something, offer something, or make a request, you do it without pressuring the people around you and making them feel like they're being pushed into a corner.


For example, if you're having a conversation, it's one thing to ask a question or offer your opinion, but it's rude to push the matter when someone has expressed discomfort (verbally or non-verbally) about the subject.
Even if you're trying to help, like offering to pay for lunch or wash the dishes, don't be too insistent. If the person says ""No, thank you, I've got it"" then say ""Please, I'd really love to help."" If they still say no, then let it go. They obviously want to treat you, so let them, and return the favor some other time.;
, How are they greeting and addressing each other? What are they doing with their coats? What kinds of topics are they discussing? Different settings require different standards of formality, and those standards often define what is polite and what is not.


A work-related dinner, and holiday gathering, a wedding, and a funeral will all demand a different, but generally somewhat more formal tone than a party with a group of friends.

, Always be courteous, as you might meet this person again in another setting and wouldn't want to have caused negative memories that would give you a bad standing. If someone annoys or even insults you, don't get into an argument. Say ""Let's agree to disagree"" and change the subject, politely debate, or simply excuse yourself from the conversation.

, Try not to talk about yourself too much—if they want to know (or are polite) they'll ask. Be confident and charming. Do not hog the conversation, that is arrogant and boorish. Look interested and listen to the answers.


Don't look over the person's shoulder or around the room when they are talking, or let your eyes linger on the hot new guest who just walked in. That implies you are distracted or not interested—that your conversational companion is too trivial or tedious to bother paying attention to.

, You might want to practice this a bit so you don't squish people's hands, depending on how strong you are. That would make them feel uncomfortable. Beware especially when shaking hands of women who are wearing rings. Too much pressure can be very painful.



Remember too that many people with an ""old-school"" etiquette background (especially if you are in Europe) find it inappropriate to offer your hand for a handshake to a lady or an older gentleman if you are a gentleman, or to an older lady, if you are a lady. Always greet the other person first, but wait for them to extend their hand. On the other hand, if you are the older person or lady, keep in mind that if you do not extend your hand, the other person may feel rejected, as he or she is not permitted to shake your hand. Usually this situation only takes half a second in checking whether the other person is moving towards you for a handshake. Be alert.
Do not approach someone with an already outstretched hand. That is pushy. If you want someone to know you are moving towards them, establish a firm eye contact and smile, maybe opening your arms a little (bent at the elbow) to make a welcoming gesture.

, For silverware, go from the outside, in. Place your napkin on your lap, and do not add anything to the table that was not there when you got there (cell phone, glasses, jewelry). Put your purse between your feet, under your chair. Women should not apply makeup at the table. It is rude and demonstrates a lack of refinement. If you want to fix your makeup or check if something is in your teeth, go to the restroom.

, Loudness either indicates arrogance or insecurity. A charming polite person makes another person feel good. Keep this goal in mind, be considerate of other people's needs and opinions. Don't make derogatory remarks towards any kind of ethnic, political or religious groups under any circumstances.

, Carry yourself smoothly, with a sense of calm, yet involved in the moment. People will notice this subtle charm and this will help you greatly.

Stop apologizing for not being sexier, stop apologizing for gaining weight, stop apologizing for wanting to have sex. You have desires and needs and feelings, and they are valid.;
, You don't need to look like a movie star or a porn star to be worthy of your partner or for them to think you're sexy. They chose you. They're with you. They think you're sexy. Besides, sexy is mostly about how you act, not how you look.

, Find the best things about yourself (you attitude, your best feature) and celebrate that thing. Whether it's you pert little butt or your great....tracks of land, it's all good! You have to know what you can build on, while also giving yourself a sort of grounding point to help you remember that you are, in fact, a total fox.

, You are a sexual creature. That is normal and, really, a great thing. If you're spending a bunch of time being too embarrassed about sex to really enjoy it, then you're not going to be very good at this naughty thing. Be sexual. Be okay with being sexual. This is very important., Comfortable with that sexual side now? Good. Now experiment, either solo or with a partner, and explore your body. Figure out what really brings you pleasure. Find your ""on"" button. You'd think that being naughty is all about pleasuring your partner, but it's also about telling your partner (in a very naughty manner) exactly how to pleasure you.

, Ditch those granny panties and that old stretched out shirt and start by making your wardrobe sexier, from the ground up. Sexier underwear, sexier everyday clothes, maybe even a sexy date outfit. You've got to get the look if you really want to make it convincing for your partner.

, Get a sexier haircut or (if you're a lady-type person) try some sexier makeup looks. Any hair stylist should be able to help you on the hair front and Youtube is awash with great makeup tutorials.

, You can shave or wax off all your downstairs hair, or you can get really creative and trim it into a heart shape. This will give your partner a fun little surprise and show that you have sex on your mind.

, Take advantage of your clothing an environment to show your significant other exactly what you have in mind. You can try cooking in the nude, and time it so that your partner comes home to that pleasant sight, or you can go full rose-petals-and-candles in the bedroom. There are lots of ways to go about it, so get creative.

, No, we don't mean work out to get thinner and more traditionally sexy. Tradition is boring. You should work out because studies have shown that physical exertion increases sexual pleasure and appetite. Try going for a light jog before your partner comes home.

, Take control in the bedroom. Be bossy. Tell your partner what to do. This is very sexy, even if it seems bad at first. Well, that it seems bad is kind of the point, really. This is also healthy for you because it will help you develop a more satisfying, equal sex life.

, Go slow. Draw things out. Don't go straight for the obvious organ. Explore erogenous zones like ears, backs of the knee, and the inner thigh. Try not even touching your partner. Get them to the point where they're begging you to give them release. Then tease just a few seconds longer before giving in.


You can tease in everyday situations too, not just in the bedroom. For example, if you're a girl, slip your significant other your panties while you're out in public. Make a restroom run and then discreetly slip them into your partner's pocket.







, Try talking dirty. Put on your sexiest voice and start getting very good with adjectives and verbs. Telling your partner where and what you'd like them to do, or even telling them that you are super aroused can be an incredible turn-on.

, Sex doesn't just have to happen in the bedroom. Breaking from the norm and taking it outside of the bed can add a real naughtiness factor. You can surprise your partner in the shower, turn a nighttime movie on the couch into something a bit more, or even get really brave and try things in public places, like on amusement park rides or in theaters.

, Role playing is a classic way to spice up a relationship and choosing the right role can really add a naughty factor. Girls can go for the naughty schoolgirl or secretary thing, while guys could try the eager cop or doctor.

, Another trick to try would be breaking your own record for how many times you've gone at it in a day or how many places you did it in. Keep track (you can even make yourself a scoreboard and prizes) and be vocal about your goal.

, Adult toys are another good way to get a little naughty in your relationship. They aren't just for girls, either. There are lots of toys which increase pleasure for men. Surprise your partner with some presents! It wasn't even your birthday...

, The main goal is to always be keeping things fresh and not getting stuck in a rut. You will find that simply by prioritizing your sex life and keeping it interesting, the gimmicks like ""naughty"" become much less important.

, You don't have to constantly be asking them how they're doing in the moment, but a good way to work up to naughty play is to ask them about their fantasies well in advance of trying anything new. Ask in a sexy voice for bonus points.

, While you're trying new things, look at how your partner reacts. Don't just listen to what they say afterwards: watch how they react in the moment. If they seem to stiffen or shy away, they may not be enjoying it as much as they say.

, Don't go from Sunday School to full Marquis de Sade in the course of a day. This can make a partner panic if it wasn't a specifically requested fantasy. Work your way up the kink chain in order to maximize the pleasure of the experiences for both of you.

, Just because your girl likes being called certain things in the bedroom doesn't mean you should call her that outside. You also should try not to let behaviors that you pick up affect you outside of the bedroom. Remember that real life and your sex life are two separate things.

, Don't do anything in the name of naughtiness that you might later regret, especially if you're young. The Internet being what it is these days, it's really easy for pics to get leaked and your life can be ruined before you know it. Avoid taking nude pics (no matter how stable your relationship is), and while sex tapes can be fun, they're best reserved for happily married couples that have been together for a very long time.


Even with explicit trust between each other, it's important to remember that there are other ways for your data to get leaked. Like hackers.

Respond to the situation appropriately.,
Personal greetings.,
Phone greetings.,
Don't bark.,
Introductions.",How to Be Polite2," For many social situations, there are general guidelines for polite conversation. The ability to listen to what the other person is saying, and responding thoughtfully, without sarcasm, insult, or being overly-casual, are key to smooth interactions. Here are some examples:

, If you're speaking with peers, say hello by name, and if appropriate, extend the greeting to be welcoming. The polite response is in keeping with the greeting. For example:


""Good morning, Jess.""

""Good morning, Peter.""


In this case, both the greeter and the greeted keep it short, professional, and courteous. Here's another example, extending it a bit:
""Good morning, Jess, good to see you today.""

""Thank you, Peter. It's good to see you too.""


If you're greeting somebody above your peer group—perhaps your boss, an important person, or somebody else who ""outranks"" you socially, it's best to keep it formal. For example:
""Good morning, Jess.""

""Good morning, Mr. Jones.""


If Mr. Jones says ""Call me Peter,"" by all means do. But do not do so until invited.

, Politeness when it comes to phones depends entirely on the situation. If you're in a business environment, how you answer the phone will depend in large part on your position in the company. The way you answer an outside call from a potential customer might be something like this:


""Hello, ABC Corporation, this is Mr. Applemore speaking. How may I help you today?""

, There is a trend, for internal calls, to answer by barking out your department. Even if it's common practice, it's far better to actually speak politely:


""Sales."" This might as well be a robot answering the phone. It conveys no sense that there's anybody on the line that cares about anything. A better approach would be:
""Sales, this is Eleonore. How can I help you today?""

, This common situation often leaves people wondering what to say, and who should say it. Here are some guidelines.Formal situations. In formal situations, you don't ""introduce"" people, you ""present"" them. There is a hierarchy involved:
The younger or less-accomplished person is always introduced to the older or more accomplished person:

""Mr. Elder, may I present Mr. Green?""


A gentleman is always presented to a lady:

""Ms. Jones, may I present Mr. Davis?""


Presidents, cardinals, and reigning monarchs are all presented to, regardless of age, sex, or station:

""Mr. President, I have the honor to present Ms. Jones of Portland, Oregon.""



Informal situations. Informal situations have much the same guidelines as formal situations—younger to older, less accomplished to more accomplished, women to men—but without the worry of societal banishment should you get it wrong! Also, you can ""introduce"" one to another, or omit the word altogether, thus:

""Mr. Elder, may I introduce Mr. Green, from accounting?"" Alternately, a simple exchange of names works as well:
""Mr. Elder, Mr. Green."" While there's no formal presentation here, ""rank"" is established by inflection. The name of the elder is said in the form of a question, and the name of the younger is spoken as a simple statement: ""Mr. Elder? Mr. Green.""


The polite response when you are introduced is simply, ""How do you do?""
Mr. Jones, may I present Ms. Abernathy?"" Ms Abernathy says ""How do you do."" Mr. Jones may respond as desired.

Practice good hygiene.,
Get a good night's rest.,
Care for your skin.,
Style your hair.,
Go natural.,
Dress to your ideals.",How to Be Perfect1," Staying fresh and clean gives you the building blocks to work toward your best self. Develop a routine that leaves you feeling squeaky clean and smelling great. Remember to always scrub areas such as elbows , necks and knees due to the bacteria you bring home each day. The bacteria will cause your elbows to turn darker if you have a pale skintone.


Shower daily. Pick out a body soap that appeals to you and scrub down! Don't feel obligated to wash your hair every day (in fact, that could dry it out), but do wash up regularly, especially after workouts.
Pick out a shampoo and conditioner for your hair type. Use a deep treatment every so often to increase your hair's natural shine.
Brush your teeth (and tongue!) at least twice a day. Make it a habit when you get up and right before go to bed. A whitening toothpaste will make your pearly whites glisten even more.

While you're at it, floss and use mouthwash! Not only are they good habits to have, but they reduce your chances of gum disease and tooth decay.Use deodorant. Throughout the day, our body releases oils and odors that don't always help us look our best. Using deodorant regularly prevents any unnecessary smells from creeping out of nooks and crannies.

Don't douse yourself in perfume or cologne. A light spray is a good idea, but smelling you from across the street, even if you smell like a field of daisies, is overpowering and less than ideal.

;
, Not only does 8 hours of sleep a night make you feel energized and ready for the day, it benefits your appearance and quality of life.(Prevents darker bags under your eyes too!)


Circulation increases in our sleep. That means our skin is receiving the most nutrients it receives at night, preparing it to look healthier and glow. Sleep and metabolism are controlled by the same areas of the brain. Studies have shown that participants who get more sleep lose more fat than their counterparts, who lose more muscle. Sleep allows our brains time to consolidate memories. Not only does a healthy amount of sleep make for easier recall, but the same restructuring of memories spurs the creative process.Our attention is sharpened, making it easier to focus (and get better grades!).
Sleeping around 8 hours a night spurs athleticism, too. Athletes who slept around 10 hours a night experienced less daytime fatigue and faster running times. , Depending on your skin type, this could mean different things. But whatever skin you're in, develop a regimen catered to it.



Know your skin type. If you have dry skin, use a heavier, more moisturizing cleanser. If you have oily skin, stick to something light and oil-free. Wash up at least once a day to remove dirt and residue.
If you have acne, use treatments containing salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide to combat blemishes on your own. If that's not working, consider seeing a dermatologist. Don't pop your zits--they'll scar your face and lead to more. Make-up works to cover them up in case of an emergency, but it clogs pores and can lead to more breakouts in the future.
Protect your skin from the sun; even 15 minutes outside can start the process rolling. Use moisturizers and lip balms with SPF 15. Pale will always be more in than dark, splotchy, and wrinkly.
Don't forget, part of skin is nails! How long or short you want them is up to you, but be sure to remove sharp edges and keep them clean. And don't miss your toes!

, Every person has a different ideal hairstyle. Experiment with a few or consult a stylist.


If you've found a style you're happy with, maintain it well. Trim your hair every 6 to 8 weeks and remove tangles with a wide-toothed comb. Too much brushing can put stress on your scalp and hair.
Stay away from heat treatments and appliances. Unnatural levels of heat dry out your hair and weaken it, causing it to damage. Air dry your hair as often as possible.

Styling men's hair follows the same general principles.

, Anyone wearing too much make-up is sending the world the message that they are not beautiful on their own. Stay natural-looking to seem organically perfect.


Use powders to soak up shine.
Blush and tinted lip balm will give your visage a rosy, sun-kissed look (without the damage).
Use a bit of mascara to lengthen and accentuate your eyelashes.

If you have skin issues (or an occasion to wear more), familiarize yourself with how to wear concealer and foundation. Worn right it can look good, but worn wrong, it can look absolutely horrendous.



, There is no one ""perfect"" look; in fact, the look that is best on you is the one you are the most comfortable in.


Whatever clothes you choose, make sure they're clean. Dirty is never trendy.
Don't concern yourself with being fashionable. Trends come and go and it'll be exhausting keeping up. Instead, develop your own style and set them yourself. Your money will last longer and you'll be happier being yourself.
Wear clothes that fit and are appropriate. Too tight and you're trying too hard, too loose and your left hand is wasted holding them up. When trying on clothes, consider all angles and move around before buying.

Make a to-do list.,
Make a plan.,
Prioritize and do triage.,
Set goals.,
Be mindful of your effectiveness.,
Keep your tools and materials organized.",How to Be Productive1," Write down everything you would like to accomplish for the day or week, or keep a running list of tasks you need to get done. To-do lists are tried-and-true productivity tools, but they only work if you use them correctly.


Be as concrete, specific and reasonable about your tasks as possible. For example, don't just write ""clean the house."" Instead try ""pick up living room,"" ""vacuum rug"" or ""take out trash""—smaller, more discrete tasks are better.
Don't let yourself get intimidated by or distracted by your to-do list. If you are spending all your time thinking of things you need to put on your list, that can be just as bad as not keeping one at all. Try to create your to-do list in one sitting and don't let yourself add to it throughout the day unless you have to.;
, Figure out what things on your list you can reasonably accomplish, and decide what order you are going to do them in. If you can, make a schedule for the day that includes when you are going to work on each task and when you are going to stop to eat or take a break.


Be aware that tasks will often take more or less time than expected. Don't beat yourself up over this, and don't let it throw your whole plan out of whack. If something doesn't go as planned, just do your best to adjust your schedule and move on with your work.

, Have just way to many things on your plate to get everything done in a timely manner? Decide which things are most important and do those. You might have had big dreams of doing your taxes and washing the dog, but one or the other might have to wait. Trying to take on too much at a time is the fastest way to end up overwhelmed and unproductive.


If there are tasks you have been meaning to do for a long time and never get done, don't let them hang over your head forever. Set yourself a deadline or pick a day to do them—or else decide that you can get by okay without them.

, Whether cleaning, studying or working, set reasonable but challenging goals for how much you are going to write, read, or create in a day. Don't let yourself quit until you've accomplished that amount. Try to be positive about your goals and don't let them intimidate you. Know that you can accomplish them if you stay focused.


Consider creating rewards or punishments for yourself around your goals. Promise to treat yourself with something you want if you are successful. Threaten yourself with an undesirable consequence, such as donating money to a cause you disagree with. This works best if you can hand over control of the reward or punishment to a friend who won't let your welch on your agreements.

, Don't get caught up thinking about how productive or unproductive you are being in the moment, but later do reflect on how well you stayed focused, how much you stuck to your plan, how accurate your schedule timing was. Note unexpected problems or disruptions to your workflow and think about what you can do to improve next time.


Consider keeping a journal to jot down what worked and what didn't work at the end of each day.

, Nothing will slow you down like not knowing where to find some vital file or object, or having to search through emails to remember the time of an appointment. Create robust systems to file information, store instruments, and record your appointments.

Be confident.,
Smile.,
Be healthy.,
Love yourself.,
Open your mind.",How to Be Perfect2," A person that lights up a room is the one everyone wants to be around. Acting confident--whether you are or not--is the first step to presenting the image you're aiming for.


Hold your head high! Body language speaks much more loudly than words. Keeping your back straight and your chin up causes people to notice your presence and self-assuredness.
Make eye contact. Let others know you're paying attention to them. If you shy away from their gaze, you'll seem nervous and inhibited. Confidence is not only sexy, but gains others' trust more quickly.

, Happiness is contagious. If you're the one who's always funny and smiling, others will be naturally drawn to you.


Not only will those around you feel the mood lift, but you will too! Your brain takes cues from your muscles; smile and soon you'll feel it's natural, even if it wasn't in the first place.

, When you're feeling crappy, everything is harder to do. Being perfect is much easier to manage when you feel and look your best.


Stick to a healthy, balanced diet. When we treat our bodies, we treat ourselves. Loading up on whole grains, fruits, and vegetables not only prevents weight gain, but it also leads to more energy, lower risk of disease, and a longer life. Stay away from too many processed goods--they often lack nutrients and are high in unhealthy, unnatural sugars.
Stay active. Exercising has shown to make skin glow and lead to better sleep, in addition to its numerous health benefits. Even taking a walk a few times a week will help to clear your mind, complexion, and leave you feeling more relaxed.

, In order to be truly confident and beautiful, you must love the skin you're in. This may seem difficult, but, luckily, you are the only obstacle in your way from true self-acceptance.


Write down a list of all your good qualities. If that's a struggle, ask others what they think. Go over this list every morning, adding qualities as you notice them.
Stay positive! If you find yourself thinking negative thoughts, immediately stop. The negative thoughts are completely controllable. If they keep on returning, busy yourself with an activity. If you need to, get it all out in a journal. Bottling an emotion up leads to stress and frustration.

, With a closed mind, we cannot see perfection in all its forms. The world out there is large and you may not have all the information. As you form opinions, put yourself in others' shoes.


Keeping open-minded will lead to positivity, empathy, and understanding--attributes all humans are attracted to. You'll be more open-minded about your own flaws, the shortcomings of others, and the less glowing facts about our world. Others will see that you accept them for who they are and they, in turn, will be more likely to accept you.
Let things go. Being bogged down by those who have hurt or betrayed you weighs down your spirit. Happiness, positivity, and confidence--keys to being perfect--are not attainable if you're caught up in grudges and revenge. Forgive, forget, and move on. You don't have time for negativity anymore. This new, perfect you is better than that.

"
"
Pursue your goals.,
Master a skill.,
Keep on learning.,
Be kind.,
Be a good friend.,
Stick to your values.",How to Be Perfect3," Whatever they are, go for them. A person with ambition and motivation is often unstoppable.


Your goals can be concrete or abstract. Write them down. Next to them, write how you will do this. It could be something internal, as in ""I want to be more confident. In the coming weeks, I will 1) start a conversation with someone new, 2) put myself in front of a group of people, and 3) ask a guy/girl for their phone number."" Or, it could be an external goal: ""I want to save an extra $500 a month. This will be attained by limiting myself to eating out once a week, riding my bike to work, and working 15 extra hours a month.""
Stick to them. When you start seeing them fulfilled, your inner sense of worth and pride will swell. After all, most of the battle of being perfect is believing you're perfect.

, If you're creative, sing, paint, or dance. If you're athletic, get on the field. If you're tech-savvy, build a computer. Doing something well not only makes us interesting and multi-dimensional (and give us more things to talk about), but it leads to new and different opportunities.


Correlate these skills with your goals. If you want to make more money, how can you do that with your skill set? Start a side business? Sell your paintings? If you want to lose weight, how can you cater to that? Cook vegetarian or low-fat dishes? Take your nature-loving side to the hiking trails? Look into yourself for the answers--they'll come the easiest.

, Your personality is multi-faceted; you're not just a pretty face. Read up on current events and topics that interest you to be an interesting conversationalist.


On top of being dynamic and well-read, you'll be a problem solver and quick to engage. ""Uh oh, your potatoes sprouted early, huh? Should've put an apple in there!"" ""Yes, I read about that! What do you think will be the implications of China's new stance?""
Don't forget about the benefits for yourself. You'll be able to make better, more informed decisions and understand the bigger picture. What's more, having a mind for learning opens up job prospects and more paths to financial success.

, If you're intelligent, confident, and skilled, it doesn't matter unless you put those qualities to good use. Take opportunities to make others' lives easier. Being smart and beautiful is great, but being smart, beautiful, sympathetic, and giving is near perfect.


Help others. When you see someone struggling--be it with too many groceries or a math problem--offer your help. You'll put a smile on their face, which will put a smile on yours.
Be polite and respectful. If someone is different or feels differently than you, take a step back before you judge. You may not fully understand where they're coming from and simply require clarification.
Helping others doesn't end when you leave the room. Clean up after yourself and make things easier for your friends and family by being thoughtful. If a family member cooked dinner, volunteer to clean the dishes. If a friend missed class, get her the notes. Take small opportunities to make the world around you brighter.
In addition to being kind to those around you, be kind to the planet! It's the only one we have. Don't litter or use electricity excessively. Carpool when you can and used recycled goods if available.

, Being perfect does not have to be a selfish endeavor. In fact, being perfect often means putting others first.


Consider others' desires in addition to what you want. What's good for you, may not be good for the whole. Always thinking ""me, me, me"" will make you a person others don't want to be around and aren't impressed by.
Keep your promises. If you say you'll do something, do it. You have loads of obligations, so don't make promises you can't keep. The last thing you want is to be called a liar or a flake.

, Knowing yourself and what you value will make it easier to make good decisions and become the person you want to become. Don't make excuses for dishonesty or hypocrisy. If you know it's right, it doesn't matter whether or not it's popular.


Surround yourself with like-minded people. It's too easy to get caught up in a crowd that forgets about respect, positivity, and growth. Negative influences will stand in your way of becoming your best self.

Remove distractions.,
Tackle one thing at a time.,
Keep your home or workspace tidy.",How to Be Productive2," We live in a world with endless opportunity for stimulation and distraction. From TV to blogs to instant messaging, not to mention friends, family and pets, it is so easy to spend just a minute on this and a minute on that and find the whole day lost. Don't let that happen! Keep your eyes on the prize by removing as many distractions and opportunities for distraction as possible.


Close your email and social media sites. Turn off any notifications that will interrupt your work. If you must, budget a few minutes into your day to check your inbox and updates for anything important, but having them open while you work is sure to lower your productivity.
Use browser extensions to block time-wasting websites. The Internet if full of interesting pictures, .gifs, videos and articles that will eat away at your day if you aren't mindful. Install a browser extension like StayFocusd, Leechblock or Nanny that will limit your time on distracting websites or keep you from checking them for certain periods during the day. Do whatever you can to put the temptation to check the news, browse your favorite blogs or watch cat videos out of reach.Turn off your phone. Don't answer calls, don't check text messages, nothing. Don't keep it near you. If it is important, whoever is calling will leave a message. If you are worried about emergencies, set aside one minute to check your phone every hour.
Tell friends and family not to interrupt you. Keep your pets out of the room if they are going to be a problem.
Use background noise to block out annoying noises and distractions. Constant background noise such as white, pink or brown noise but also natural noises such as the sound of rain or a river can help you to stay focused and boost your productivity. Use tools like Noisli

Turn off the TV or radio. Depending on you and the nature of your task, a little background noise might by fine—especially music without lyrics—but any kind of media on around you will usually lower your productivity if your task requires mental focus.

, It's a common misconception that multitasking can make you more productive. The truth is we can only really do one thing at a time, and when we try to multitask we are just switching back and forth between different projects. Every time you make that switch, you lose time and focus. To be truly productive, pick one task and work on it until completion, then move on to something else., Yes, cleaning up all the time takes time and effort, but a big mess can be distracting and you may end up losing more productivity than you saved. Keep your desk, house or workspace neat and organized, without clutter and with a minimum of loose objects to catch your eye.

, You may not notice it at first, but if you don't keep yourself nourished you will soon find yourself more distracted, stressed and scatterbrained. You will make mistakes and have to redo your work. Make sure you set aside time in your day to have full, healthy meals.


Avoid heavy meals that are going to make you sluggish and want to nap. Digestion takes energy, and processing a large, greasy meal will sap your strength and focus.

, Don't exhaust yourself or force yourself to stare at the screen until you are a zombie. Every 15 minutes or so take 30 seconds to stretch and rest your eyes a bit. Every couple hours take five or ten minutes to do some exercise, have a snack and replenish your resolve.

Practice what brings you peace.,
Meditate.,
Manage the stress in your life.,
Do physical activity.,
Practice self reflection.,
Allow and accept change.,
Discontinue bad habits.",How to Be Peaceful1," Finding internal peace begins with identifying what makes you feel calm.Consider activities you enjoy that leave you with a sense of peace and calm. Make time in your schedule to practice calming and centering activities on a regular basis.Some peaceful activities may include:


Reading a book.
Enjoying quiet time or silence.
Engaging in creative arts.
Listening to calming sounds such as ocean waves, weather sounds, or sounds of animals.;
, A very successful way to calm your mind and find internal peace is to practice meditation. Meditation will help you train your mind to be peaceful and more clear.When you meditate, make sure you are in a quiet place free of distractions, such as in a room by yourself. Sit in a position that is comfortable for you; either in a chair or on the floor.Try and keep your back straight for better breathing.


Close your eyes and turn your attention to your breathing.Notice the sensation of the breath as it comes in and goes out. Don't try to control or change your breath, just focus on it.
Thoughts may surface with a strong temptation to follow the train of thought as it comes up. If you notice your mind wandering, gently refocus on your breath. The more you practice this the easier it will be and the fewer distractions will occur.
Try setting an intention. You can meditate on any intention that resonates most with you, such as gratitude, the beauty of nature, the love of your family, and so on. Anything that makes you feel warm and fuzzy inside when you think about it would make a good intention. Having something to focus on can be helpful for beginners.
Try additional guided meditations, guided imagery, loving kindness meditations, or even attending meditation classes., Stress and anxiety will interfere with your sense of calm and peace. Counteract it by addressing anything that is causing you stress in your life. If financial management or money issues are causing you stress, make a plan to deal with them right away. Take control of your stress management in order to be more peaceful in your everyday life. Choose a stress management technique and plan that work for you and makes the most sense in your life.Try the following coping skills.For 10 to 15 minutes a day, write about things that are bothering you and how you are feeling about them.
Find a way to let your feelings out such as talking, laughing, or crying.
Spend some time around animals such as extra time around your pets, or going to a petting zoo.

, Certain types of exercises or sports have been shown to provide a sense of peace in the person who practices it.Try engaging in a physical activity that allows you to release your stress, and find relaxation afterwards. Regular physical activity helps promote balance in your life and peacefulness of your mind and mood.


Exercises like running have proven to be almost meditative in the sense of peace they provide.Physical activities like tennis, batting cages, or golfing at a driving range, will allow you to work out extra energy, stress, or aggression.
More meditative exercises like pilates and yoga will help you focus your mind and have a more peaceful relationship between your mind and body.

, In a society where it is easy to be labeled and judged, it is hard not to judge yourself based on what others think. Living this way will only cause you stress and and a decreased sense of peace and happiness. Instead, practice self-reflection.Determine what you think and how you feel about yourself. Use your self-reflection to provide yourself with the sense of peace that comes from being the person you want to be.


Pay special attention to the internal judgments that you are inflicting on yourself. Work towards replacing the criticism with more peaceful thoughts., Change is often difficult to accept and can be very stressful.It is common to become comfortable and be resistant to change. The difficulty here is that change is constantly occurring, and that by being resistant to it, you will just be causing yourself unnecessary stress.To be more peaceful begin to accept and allow changes to occur without resisting them in the following ways:Accept change by realizing you and your life are always growing and changing. Accept change as a learning process to a better life.
Let go of fear. A great deal of the time we are resistant to change due to a fear of the unknown. Letting go of that fear allows you to accept change.
Recognize that resistance causes more turbulence in our lives and uses more energy than acceptance., If there is something you identify as a “bad habit” it is going to cause you stress and interfere with your peace. Breaking a bad habit can be extremely difficult, but can also lead you to the path of improvement of a peaceful and balanced person.Do not discontinue multiple bad habits at once. This sets you up for failure for trying too much at once. Try working on one bad habit at a time.
Put it in writing. Write down what bad habit you are quitting and when you are quitting it by. This holds you accountable and helps solidify your commitment.Switch out your bad habit for another activity. For example, if you are a smoker, try chewing gum instead.

Make eye contact.,
Be calm.,
Learn a lot about a few things.,
Ask questions.,
Make them smile.,
Change the topic.,
Be an alpha or a flirt.,
Keep some things to yourself.,
Don’t always be available.,
Don’t be a flashy dresser.,
Think outside the box.,
Be unpredictable.,
Remember to reciprocate.",How to Be Mysterious to Attract People," Making eye contact shows that you have confidence. Also, when you make eye contact with someone, it shows that you’re interested in learning more about them. Make sure that you don’t hold eye contact for too long – about two seconds is a good length – lest you come off as creepy or intimidating., Animated people don’t leave much too the imagination because they are the center of attention. To be attractively mysterious, be calm, somewhat serious, and relatively even-keeled. Be the calm at the center of the storm, no matter how lively things are around you., You’re mysterious and intelligent. Because you won’t be talking about yourself much, you’ll need to learn about some topics that you can talk about at length. Not only does this keep the conversation away from your personal story, it shows that you’re passionate enough about a subject to learn it.Make sure that the topic is interesting and not polarizing. For example, presidential candidates might be interesting but they’re also polarizing. Instead, the impact of farm-produced fish on the environment is interesting and likely to not be very polarizing at all.

, Asking questions is an excellent way to be mysterious and attract people and serves a few purposes. It allows you to keep the conversation away from your personal details, it shows interest in another person, and, most of all, it allows that people to talk about themselves. People will think you’re especially interested in them and be flattered that you wanted to hear their story.Start off with simple questions like “where are you from originally?” or “where would you travel to if money was no object?” Listen to the answers and ask questions based on those answers, such as: “Oh, you’d like to travel to Paris? What is it about the City of Lights that you find attractive? Would you travel alone or with someone?”

, Just because you’re mysterious doesn’t mean that you can’t be charming. Make people smile. Smiling makes people feel good and it makes people instantly feel warmer toward the person that made them smile. Don’t be afraid to smile yourself, too. This shows a good-natured appreciation of life that is attractive to just about everyone.You don’t have to talk to someone to make them smile. When you’re making eye contact, give the other person a little smile and watch, they’ll return the favor.

, Just because you’re not going to spend much time talking about yourself doesn’t mean that you can’t direct the conversation. This works because changing topics fairly frequently shows your audience that you’re not only mysterious, but that you’re confident and knowledgeable about a variety of topics.Look for natural opportunities to change topics, which will come up typically in someone else’s response to something.
This is a great time to ask a question, which will direct the conversation in another direction.

, Depending on your gender, being mysterious can be a sign that you’re an alpha male or a flirty female, two archetypes that are attractive to almost everyone. Mysterious people exude confidence, and that confidence can be interpreted differently depending on your gender. What is fairly universal, though, regardless of gender, is that mysterious people are quietly in control, but not flamboyant of attention seeking.This idea refers back to the psychology of attraction, which posits that attraction is physiological and psychological, and that the two inform one another., When talking to someone, don’t tell them your life story. You’re not an open book. Instead, you’re mysterious and need to leave gaps in your story. That will encourage people to ask questions, think about what you’ve said, and fill in the gaps of your story with their imaginations.A great way to approach this idea is to only answer questions that you’re asked about yourself as opposed to simply offering up information. Even when you’re answering questions, give as little information as possible while still satisfying the questioner.
If someone asks you about your weekend, make some vague reply such as ""I met up with some friends and we did some things in town."" If they question you further, just say nothing and smile mysteriously.

, If you’re always available, you might seem eager and you certainly won’t appear mysterious. Instead, you want to be available occasionally, although usually not, which will make your attentions almost seem like a reward.This applies to phone calls, texts, video chats, and get-togethers. If your phone rings, let it go to voicemail. If you receive a text or direct message, don’t read it right away. If they suggest that you get together, don’t enthusiastically say yes. Check your calendar first. You’re mysterious when you’re often unavailable.

, You don’t want to stand out in a crowd because of your flashy clothes, bright colors, or loud patterns. Instead, you want to keep your clothing somewhat modest, but still different from everyone around you. Darker colors are more mysterious.If people around you tend to wear jeans, for example, consider wearing boot cut jeans. If everyone wears boots, consider loafers.

, Try to be more creative and think outside the box. Your love interest is attracted to your mysterious demeanor, and creativity is a sign of a confident, mysterious person. Creativity shows that you can be playful and disciplined and that you view the world from a unique perspective. Share that uniqueness with the object of your affection to maintain the mystery.Creativity doesn’t just mean artistic. You might not have an artistic bone in your body and that’s just fine. Be creative with your answers to people, your solutions to problems, or even how you spend time with your partner.
For example, rather than suggesting dinner and a movie, be creative and take your partner to a place they’ve never been, like a state park, for a picnic and bring a book of your favorite poems to read with them.

, Being unpredictable lends to your mysterious demeanor. This doesn’t mean that you should act of character with your love interest or confuse them. Even worse, hurt their feelings. Being unpredictable simply means defying your own routines and patterns every now and then. This will demonstrate that there are still some secrets up your sleeve and keep it interesting.For example, if you always grab a coffee on your way to work, decide to go for a jog instead one day.
Or, if you always wait for your love interest to call you, surprise them with a phone call.

, Your love interest is attracted to you and perhaps you’ve taken your relationship to another level. Remember, you can be mysterious and still reciprocate feelings and interest. People tend to feel more attracted to those who they feel are attracted to them, so reciprocate their interest in you.For example, you can still be mysterious and bring your love interest flowers or send a simple text that says, “thinking of you.” Small gestures mean a lot, especially from a mysterious person.

Accept people for who they are.,
Tell the truth.,
Speak in a calm and relaxing voice.,
Let go of difficult or negative people.,
Parent peacefully.,
Keep a journal.",How to Be Peaceful2," Wishing others would change or attempting to change others will cause you stress. It can easily make it difficult to remain peaceful in a relationship.Instead of attempting to change or control others, accept and love them (including their faults) for a more peaceful relationship.Try writing a list of what you appreciate or are grateful for with the individuals in your life.
Remind yourself that everyone has flaws. No one is perfect.

, Holding in your thoughts and feelings in a relationship will not help you be peaceful. Part of being peaceful is being at peace with yourself. Honesty is a vital component to being at peace with yourself. So, be honest, but kind, when communicating what you really think and feel.Having an open and honest dialogue in your relationships with others helps the relationship be more peaceful as well. It sets up a tone which communicates that if there are problems, they can be discussed and brought out into the open. You can state, “I want to you to be comfortable talking to me about anything.”
Make sure you are communicating any frustrations or negative feelings in order to address them as quickly as possible. Try saying, “Our relationship is important to me. I don't want to bottle anything up and risk having it affect our relationship.”
Have conversations just to check-in with loved ones. It will illustrate that you are interested in your loved ones well-being, and will make them more comfortable talking with you. You can begin with a simple, “How are you really doing?”

, What you say to convey peacefulness is important, but equally important is how you say it.The way you communicate with others is complex and conveys a great deal about your emotions and state of mind. Being peaceful in relationships with others includes speaking in a peaceful way.


Speak slowly and thoughtfully.
Notice the volume of your voice. If you are loud, try quieting your voice.
Try to use a softer tone when you speak instead of a more stressful or sharp tone.
Pay attention to the words that you use. Consider what they are conveying about your outlook.

, As you are trying to accept others for who they are, you may come across some who make that difficult. People who are consistently negative can only interrupt your sense of peace. It may be best to let them go or remove them from your life. If you feel like you cannot let go of people completely, limit the contact you have with them.While you want to be accepting of people and their imperfections, this doesn't mean you have to accept everything another person does. You are allowed to set boundaries as to what you will and will not accept in your life. For instance, you can't stop a boyfriend from doing drugs, but you can set a boundary that if he does them around you, you are leaving the relationship.
Separate yourself from violent or aggressive people. A peaceful person does not engage in violence against herself or others.Distance yourself from people who are overly judgmental or critical of the way you choose to live your life.
Let go of anyone you feel disturbs your peacefulness.

, Parenting peacefully can be difficult. It is hard not to get caught up in the stress now and then. Start small, by changing one thing you do into something more peaceful. Once you feel you have accomplished that, begin a new one. Also try to notice the part you play and how you can help create the change you are looking for.Try to remove or avoid critical or blaming statements.
Instead of focusing on what your child may have done wrong, focus on what he did well or praise him for trying. Instead of saying ""Look at the mess you made! You never pick up your toys!"" try, ""Wow, you are playful and have lots of energy today! What is your favorite toy right now? Let's do something fun with that toy, and put the rest away to play with later.""
Be the peace you wish to see in your child. Become peaceful yourself before expecting your child to be peaceful.Children need to be taught how to behave, including being peaceful. Lead by example and demonstrate the kind of peacefulness you would like to see in your child and in your relationship with him.

, Journaling is a great practice to help you be peaceful. Creating a journal will help focus your peaceful intentions in the areas of your life that need more attention. It will also help you organize your thoughts and plans.Journaling allows you a safe space to vent your frustration and stress so that you can be peaceful with others. Try prompts like the following:

Declutter.,
Keep your work life and home life separate.,
Use soothing tones or textures in your decorating.,
Fill your home with soothing scents and sounds.",How to Be Peaceful3," Minimize toys and physical clutter in your environment. Being peaceful includes having a peaceful environment as well as a peaceful mindset. Help make your environment peaceful by ridding your home of clutter. Toss or donate things you do not use or toys your children no longer play with.Make sure the items that you own all have a dedicated place. Having less clutter in your home will increase your sense of peace.

, Being peaceful at home, in relationships, and within yourself are all important aspects of a peaceful life. Keeping peaceful in all aspects may include a peaceful work environment as well keeping your work and home life separate. Try the following.


Having less clutter in your work space will provide the same result as less clutter in your home.

Work hard.",How to Be Remarkable," You have your own opinions and ideas, and it's time to start sharing them with the rest of the world. Hiding behind popular opinion is a good way to fit in, but it won't make you remarkable.


The moment you surrender your individuality, you surrender your ability to rise above the crowd.
Of course, that doesn't mean you should rock the boat for no reason. You don't need to argue against popular opinion if you honestly agree with it, and even when you do need to speak out, there are often ways to do so with tact that can help you avoid making unnecessary enemies.;
, Instead of turning away and hardening your heart to the wrongs you see, let yourself be moved by those problems. It's easy to grow numb to misconduct. Standing against it is far more extraordinary.


You might find yourself bothered by the abuse of power within your workplace or by the abuse of the powerless worldwide. Either way, when you choose to stand and fight back against that which is wrong, you take the first step toward a positive change that the average person is unwilling to commit to.

, Instead of accepting the status quo, you should be questioning everything about it. The current approach to something may or may not be the best approach, but you won't know for sure until you take the time to examine it.Some questions you may need to ask can include:

Why does this rule or standard exist?
What are the consequences of ignoring this rule or standard?
What alternative options exist, and why are those options rarely/never used?


Answer these questions honestly, understanding that you may not like all of the answers. An honest understanding of yourself and the world around you will provide you with the best perspective from which to work.

, You already have your own unique set of abilities and interests. Look for ways to apply them to your life.


When you love the work you do and have a talent for doing it, you'll usually find yourself going further than you would while doing something you felt indifference toward.

, If you can't trust yourself, you will never be able to move past mediocrity.


Trusting yourself can inspire others to trust you, too. If you project an image of uncertainty, others may pass you by and offer opportunities for growth and success to other, more confident people.

, Don't be afraid of seemingly unrealistic goals. Oftentimes, that which hasn't been done before simply hasn't been done because no one has attempted it yet. Never assume that a dream is out of your reach just because it seems difficult to realize.


Of course, there might be some goals that you won't be able to accomplish, but there generally isn't any way of knowing whether one is or isn't until you actually pursue it for a little while. When you're just beginning to dream, dream big. If a dream is impossible, drop it only after you learn that from experience.

, Once you have a dream, start telling people about it. Doing so can keep you more accountable to your dreams while opening potential channels of opportunity.Discuss your dreams with other positive people since they will be the most likely to encourage you.
When you talk about your dreams to anyone, you suddenly gain an audience. It may not seem like much, but the knowledge that people are watching you can apply a helpful dose of pressure to get you going.
Additionally, you never know when someone you talk to might have the resources or connections to help you pursue your goals more thoroughly.

, It can be far too easy to focus on what can go wrong, but if you want to do remarkable things with your life, you need to start thinking about all of the things that can go right. Optimism will generally get you further than pessimism can.


Understand that there is a difference between optimism and idealism, just like there's a difference between pessimism and realism. You should strive to be both optimistic and realistic. Pursue the most positive goals that are within your reach and realistically plot the path you need to reach them.

, You will make mistakes; this is a non-negotiable fact of life. If you want to get anywhere impressive, you need to confront your fear of failure and push past it.


If you need a little overcoming your perfectionism, think of the most exceptional person you can think of and remind yourself that even he or she has made mistakes on the path to success. In fact, if you do a little research, you can usually learn about some of the more notable mistakes that individual made throughout his or her life.

, Stop making excuses and accept responsibility for your life. No one ever accomplishes anything of significance by talking about all the reasons why they can't. Your life is ultimately your own, and at the end of the day, the actions you do and don't take are your responsibility.


Life may put restrictions on you. For instance, the project idea you had may not be approved by your boss, or you might not be able to secure a loan for the business venture you want to try. When these roadblocks come up, though, it doesn't mean you should stop trying. It simply means that you need to find a different path to reach your desired destination.
When you experience success, accept responsibility for it. When you experience defeat, accept responsibility for it. Acknowledge the results you get for your work. That's the only way to move forward.

, The world is filled with distractions. Everyone needs a little time to relax, but when the things you do for enjoyment stop you from making good use of your time, these distractions ultimately do more harm than good.


The biggest problem with distraction is that it leads to drifting. You might become so comfortable with the way things are that you fall into a routine. Once you get yourself into a rut, you can easily spend your days letting life pass you by.

, This may seem like an inconvenient time for any number of reasons, but if you don't act while the desire is fresh, you may not act at all.


There will never be a “perfect” time. There will always be some minor or major inconvenience standing in your way, and if life made remarkable accomplishments easy to perform, they wouldn't be remarkable anymore.

, Find a step you can take with the resources and authority you currently have, then take that first step. You may succeed or you may fail. Either way, making that first attempt is the only way to get the process started.


Consider making an attempt at something small, especially if you still need to build confidence. If you fail, your losses will be minor. If you succeed, your success will be pretty minor, too. Success can be addictive, though; once you get a taste of it, you'll naturally feel more inclined to seek out further opportunities for success than you felt before.

, Once you succeed with the resources you presently have, you'll likely find those resources growing. Step through each door as it opens to you.


For example, if you excel while leading a minor project, your boss might ask you to lead a major project next time.
Don't be afraid to ask for more responsibility, either. If you have both an eagerness to excel and a history of doing so, those with greater power are likely to feel more confident in your abilities and will be more inclined to consider your request.

, No one becomes remarkable by doing as little work as possible. You will need to work hard, and your work ethic will need to be both consistent and persistent.


For the average person, the path of least resistance might work well enough. You're not trying to be average, though; you're trying to be remarkable. For that, you will need to work harder and contribute far more than the average person.

Train your brain.,
Realize that everything you do has a result.,
Reduce the need to multitask.,
Tackle your most difficult tasks first.",How to Be Serious1," If you have trouble staying focused, it can help to think of your brain as a muscle, and just like the rest of your muscles, it needs to be exercised to be effective at its job.Set aside a time of day to practice focusing on a single task.
Start small-just take a few minutes at first each day to really make yourself fully focus on single task. If and when you find your mind wandering, immediately return to the task at hand.
If you realize you've drifted off task, that's half the battle!;
, For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. What you choose to do does have consequences-often in ways you can't foresee or possibly know of. Being serious involves recognizing what most needs your attention, and focusing on it.


Always avoid procrastination. Not only does procrastinating cause stress and contribute to depression and anxiety, it can be a major factor in reducing overall productivity and leading to unintended consequences. Example: I need to trim a dead tree branch hanging over my house. Instead I decide I'll do it later and play a video game now. Later that day, my friend calls, and desperately needs a ride from the airport. The branch doesn't get trimmed. That night there's a huge windstorm. The branch falls and punches a hole in my roof. Now, instead of simply trimming a tree branch, I have to get my roof fixed, too! Take care of what needs attention first-you may regret it if you don't.

, Multitasking makes us feel like we're being productive, but in reality too much multitasking can cause distraction and lessen our effectiveness. Take each task individually, get it done, and move on to the next.

, Getting the most difficult or least pleasant tasks out of the way first will give you a huge boost and reduce the possibility of procrastination. After getting the biggest obstacle out of the way, the other items on your list will seem like a breeze. "

Make a list.,
Get up in the morning and make your bed.,
Allow yourself a short break from time to time.,
Use your time wisely.,
Know how far you can go.,
Understand the rules of the game.",How to Be Serious2," Make a list the night before of the day's tasks in order of urgency and importance.


If you have a smartphone, then you have a powerful organizational tool at your fingertips! There are many useful apps for creating a concise and helpful to do list. Using an app can also help you keep your lists organized, rather than creating a sea of paper. Remember, put the most difficult tasks at the top of your list.

, Starting the day with a positive accomplishment, however small, gets the ball of accomplishment for the rest of the day rolling. Then look at your prioritized list. Take each item one at a time, and let each task completed be a segue into the next. After each task is accomplished, the next words out of an effective and serious person's mouth are, ""what's next?"". Let that be your mantra. Always ask yourself, ""what's next?"".

, But don't get sidetracked! Specify what your break will entail. Think, ""I'll finish this episode of my favorite show while I eat this banana, then back to the task at hand."" Stick to it-once you let yourself slide off the schedule, it's a slippery slope to accomplishing nothing at all.

, Recognize that time is finite, and think of it as a resource. Be aware of the time you spend on a task. Don't become so swept up in mundane details that you waste time on things that don't matter. Ask yourself, ""how is the time I'm spending on this advancing me toward my goal? Be able to put things aside that are holding you back from accomplishing what you set out to accomplish, or, if the way you've chosen to go about a task isn't working, try something else. Be flexible; be malleable. Be able to bend without breaking.

, Knowing your limits isn't limiting, but freeing! Accepting that you have accomplished tasks to the best of your abilities is hugely rewarding. Remember, completing any task gives you a boost to accomplish more. Take simple steps, and continue to do so, and over time you will accomplish a great deal.

, Some rules can be changed and others cannot. Having the grace to change what you can and accept what you cannot is huge in being a more serious person. To fret over mundane details of life you wish could be different, but know deep down cannot, is to limit yourself. When you come upon an immovable obstacle, go around it, and proceed on your course.

Look ahead, not back.,
Consider your social stature.,
Be in control of your emotions.,
Love yourself.",How to Be Serious3," As we grow older, we tend to want to hang on to youthful behaviors. Everyone goes through periods of conflict between the desire to be carefree and just have fun, and being mature and responsible. Let’s face it-often being mature and serious is the less immediately pleasant way of living life. However, being more serious in life involves realizing that the long term benefits of being responsible and taking care of business outweigh hedonistic pleasures.


Wake everyday with the intention of being mature.
Be aware each morning that some of the decisions ahead in your day will involve foregoing fun in favor of accomplishment.

, If you want to be serious, be aware of how your everyday behavior reflects that. You are how you act, so making the effort to be serious and mature in your actions throughout the day, even the small things, is important to truly being serious.

, One of the most important part of being mature is having the ability to control your emotions, rather than them controlling you. Consider your feelings carefully before acting on them. Act, don’t react. When you behave with maturity, you’re using the rational and reasoning side of yourself rather than the animalistic, instinctual side.
When someone speaks to you, especially in moments of conflict, pause and consider your reply with a cool head before responding. What first pops into your head isn’t always the best thing to say. Think before you speak.
Apply that to actions especially. Actions speak louder than words, so be especially aware of how your actions reflect on your level of maturity. Do you act only after cooly thinking out your course, or do you react without consider the consequences?

, Part of being mature is recognizing that you have worth. It’s often easier to beat oneself up over mistakes than to learn from them. If you want to be more mature and live a more serious life, make the effort to respect yourself and value yourself.


Treat your body with respect. Eat well, and get plenty of exercise and sleep.
Keep friends who value you, get rid of people who don’t. Friends will respect you and understand that you are special for being you. Everyone crosses paths with people who do not do those things. You have no obligation to keep them around. Part of maturity is making the tough decisions about who we associate with.

"
"
Be self aware (as opposed to self conscious).,
Practice good hygiene.,
Wear clothes that you like, neatly.",How to Be Serious4," Being self aware doesn't mean you are being shy or embarrassed, aspects we usually associate with self-consciousness, but that you have the capacity to reflect on yourself, both inwardly and outwardly.

, Taking pride in oneself enough to practice good hygiene is important in being a serious and meaningful person. It is also healthier and will simply help you feel good!


Keep your hair and fingernails trimmed.
Brush your teeth at least twice daily. Practicing good oral hygiene not only shows others that you are a serious and put together person, but it also helps protect against bacterial infection and is beneficial for your health overall., Wear clothes that you want to wear, and that are neat, is important in showing that you are a serious person. It doesn't have to mean that you are vain or overly self-conscious, but simply that you care enough about your own well being to take care of yourself.

Be helpful to other human beings.,
Volunteer.,
Practice the golden rule.",How to Be Serious5," It is so easy in today's world to become focused on ""me"" that we often forget that one of the most rewarding and productive things we can do is to focus on the well-being of others.


When you are helpful to others, even in small, everyday ways, you will find that your overall sense of your own well being will greatly increase and your confidence in the tasks and goals you have before you will be much greater.
Greater confidence in yourself and your own abilities results in much higher personal productivity, and, in turn, will help you to become a more serious person.

, Get involved in local volunteer opportunities. In 2013 alone, over 62 million Americans engaged in some form of volunteer work. Do you have a soft spot for kids? For old folks? For animals? Maybe you'd like to help maintain trails at a local park, or feed the homeless in a soup kitchen. Volunteer opportunities abound everywhere, especially in urban centers.
Even a couple hours a week, or even a month, can help give you a sense of focus and purpose in your life. Volunteering not only makes you feel good about yourself, it connects you with others, increases your social skills, combats depression, and helps keep you healthy., When you do to others as you would have done to yourself, you create a loop of goodwill. This isn't just for morality's sake; the more you show goodwill to others, the more likely they will be to contribute to your own advancement.

Consider cognitive-behavioral therapy.",How to Be Less Impulsive," The first step in being less impulsive is to determine how you want to prioritize your time.Then, before acting impulsively, check and make sure your action reflects the values you’ve written down for yourself.This might mean writing a master task list. It might mean creating a business plan. If you're a student, you might want to create a study plan. The important thing is to record your current goals in order to measure them against your impulses.
You might think of this written record as a kind of container for your values, intentions, commitments, best practices for yourself, and tasks that support these goals.
You can use a notebook, a spreadsheet, or another method that works for you. The main thing is that the framework is accessible and functional.;
, In order to make the most of your organizational system, you’ll need to commit to reviewing how effective your system is in your life, as well as plan out any needed changes.You might find you need to sit down once a week to consider your actions of the previous week. Did you follow your listed priorities? Note what went well, what you found challenging, and what you might do better.
You might find that you need to do this review more often until you find a system that works for you. Doing a brief daily review is recommended; you might also do a more extensive monthly review.

, If you have lots of unstructured time in your day, you’re more likely to fill it with impulsive acts. Try writing down a daily schedule for yourself, using 30 minute blocks of time. It’s okay if you spend more than one 30-minute block on a task, but don’t leave any blocks empty and unstructured.If you don’t know how to plan ahead for certain activities, write in a series of choices for yourself. For instance, if you’re not sure yet whether a friend is coming over or not, write: “Friend or ______.”
Your daily schedule should include your social time and free time too. A schedule that doesn’t include any downtime will ultimately fail.

, If you’re the kind of person who’s prone to impulsively changing directions in the middle of a task, using checklists can help you stay focused. Checklists minimize opportunities to act impulsively by ensuring that nothing is forgotten, and that no unnecessary steps are added to a task.Checklists have been proven to increase attention to the task even for medical professionals. Many surgeons are required to follow checklists when they perform surgery to help them stay on task.
Checklists can be used across multiple settings. Use a travel checklist to help you pack more efficiently; a shopping checklist to help you only purchase the intended items; a study checklist to make sure you attend to each part of the assignment.
Crossing items off a checklist can provide motivation to complete a task.

, Keeping a calendar is essential for anyone who struggles with impulsivity. You’ll need to have access to daily, weekly, and monthly calendars in order to prioritize your attention. Using different colors for different categories of activity will help support your use of a calendar.For example, a student might use red ink for upcoming tests, blue ink for long-term projects, black ink for daily schoolwork and green for fun or social activities.
A portable calendar, such as an app on your phone, will help you access your calendar across settings.

, Research studies show that people who look at photographs of natural world are less likely to make impulsive decisions afterwards. Photographs included pictures of mountains, forests, beaches, etc.If you’re trying to become less impulsive, post a postcard or a photograph of your favorite natural environment near your desk or on your notebook.
Before making a decision, pause and reflect by looking at an image of the natural world. Your decision is then less likely to be impulsive.

, Napping helps decrease impulsivity in adults, according to a research study at the University of Michigan. The amount of nap time in the research study was a 60-minute, but you may not have to be asleep for the full 60 minutes in order to benefit from this approach.Napping also appears to help people remain calmer and less frustrated as they work to complete a task. People who nap are more likely to remain focused on the activity until it’s finished.
The benefits of napping are not limited to those people who don’t receive the recommended 7-9 hours of sleep per night. All research subjects appeared to benefit from napping.

, Putting limits on yourself will help protect you from impulsive acts and decisions. For example, if you have trouble preventing yourself from blurting out everything you think, consider writing down all your comments and questions before saying them out loud. By taking the time to write them down, you may be able to avoid inappropriate impulsive remarks.If you have difficulty overspending, leave your credit card at home when shopping, and pay with cash.
Putting items on hold for 24 hours will help prevent impulsive purchases, and give you a chance to decide whether you really need to buy the items.

, A UCLA research study showed that yoga-based breathing program called Sudarshan Kriya resulted in significant decrease of impulsive behaviors among teens.The breathing exercises include four basic types of breathing:Ujjayi or “Victorious Breath”, which is a type of slow, intentional breathing where focus is on the breath touching the throat.
Bhastrika or “Bellows Breath,” in which breath is exhaled forcefully through nostrils, followed by a rapid inhale, at the rate of 30 breaths per minute.
Chanting “Om” 3 times in a row, which requires sustained, controlled expiration.
Breathing in a rhythmic pattern, whether slow, medium or fast.

, Regular inclusion of basic yogic techniques have been shown to improve attention and decrease impulsivity. Schoolchildren who are taught to do daily sun salutations, and regulated breathing activities demonstrate better sustained attention.The benefits increase when yoga is done in different settings. For instance, if you’re getting ready to go shopping, take a few moments before entering the store to do yogic breathing. At home, do a sun salutation before grabbing junk food to snack on.

, Exercise, particularly aerobic exercise, will help you be less impulsive in a number of ways. Exercise lifts your mood, and decreases feelings of stress and anxiety.In addition, exercise keeps a person’s attention actively engaged. If you’re more likely to act impulsively out of boredom or frustration, you can put this energy to better use through exercise.
Research suggests that 40 minutes per day of aerobic activity improved executive functioning in overweight kids.
All ages will benefit from increased exercise.

, Becoming aware of your feelings, and learning to connect your impulsiveness to your thoughts, emotions and urges will help you better control your actions. Mindfulness helps by allowing you some distance from your impulses, offering you the opportunity to choose to act upon your impulses or not.When you notice an urge, articulate that urge mentally to yourself before acting on it. For example, “I am angry that my partner just said that, and I want to criticize her.” Follow this with a more constructive response, such as, “I can try to calm down.”
Mindfulness means to focus on what’s going on inside yourself, and it may take time to notice what’s going on in your body before you act impulsively rather than afterwards.

, When your impulsivity is based in anxiety, you can help yourself by spending time with people you trust. Making sure to have people in your life with whom you can share things you’re concerned about may help ease your anxiety, and decrease your impulsiveness.You might consider talking with a professional, such as a counselor, life coach, or a professional organizer, about your difficulties with impulsivity.
Just spending time talking with trusted friends can help address your anxiety, even if you’re not having a serious conversation.

, A friend can help you stay accountable to the goals you've set for yourself. Find a friend who is reliable and nonjudgmental, and share with her what your goal is for yourself. You can decide how you'd like to be held accountable for your goal.For example, do you want your friend to call you to check on your progress? Or do you want to schedule regular meetings so that she can check in on your commitment to your goal?
You'll also need to have a plan for what your friend might do to support you if you're not staying focused on your goal, and acting impulsively instead.
You might offer to help your friend stay accountable for something she's struggling with. This way, you'll be accountability partners.

, Sometimes being impulsive can have positive as well as negative effects. For example, if you have a hard time making decisions, you may find yourself making last minute decisions as a means of avoiding the anxiety you feel when trying to make a thoughtful decision.If you’re experiencing benefits from acting impulsively, try to find more effective ways of achieving this benefit.
Remember that you can still be spontaneous even if you’re less impulsive. Being less impulsive doesn’t mean your life will be dull and conventional. It just means that you’ll be more in control of what you choose to spend your money, time, and attention on.

, Calming activities vary person to person, but might include listening to guided meditations, calming music, or doing deep breathing exercises. Getting more relaxed can help you avoid acting impulsively.Do a body scan to locate any areas of your body which are holding tension, then intentionally focus on relaxing these areas.
Set a timer for 5 minutes, and allow yourself to focus on your breath for this limited period of time. This short break will help you relax, and prevent any hasty reactive actions.

, Cognitive-behavioral therapy, or CBT, helps a person focus on connecting their thoughts and feelings with their behaviors. CBT is a common treatment for anxiety and impulse disorders, among others. The goal of CBT is to identify the thoughts that often result in impulsive activity.Impulsive behavior is often the result of automatic thoughts, which are the thoughts that your mind produces as an immediate reaction to certain situations. These thoughts can be negative and may lead you to make poor decisions.CBT helps you to identify these automatic thought patterns and reframe them in new ways.
A therapist or behavioral specialist can help you explore the ways that CBT might work in your life!

Not being yourself is just so draining; no wonder it's hard to muster up enthusiasm. In order to channel that gusto, you gotta be yourself first and foremost. Pretending to be something you're not takes up all your resources you could be using on doing what you actually enjoy and could get excited about.


A lot of us try super hard to fit into a mold that society has deemed correct. Boo. We're not going to enjoy the things our friends enjoy, we're not going to get fulfillment out of the things that fulfill others. So don't waste your time! It's only when you're naturally you that you can find what drives you and grab a firm hold. Then you can work on being enthusiastic.;
, You're on this page for a reason. Most likely someone around you is giving you crap about your lack of energy. Very few people look objectively at themselves and say, ""Hmm. I wonder why I'm not peppier."" But whatever your reason, you probably have an inkling as to why. Is it your job? Your love life? Or is it more of a universal, 24/7 thing that's dragging you down?


It's natural to get stuck in a rut. These things happen. They also end at some point. But then there's clinical depression and that's a whole other can of worms. If it's something you've never thought about, think about it now. Is it a lack of enthusiasm or is it a bigger issue? What's your gut tell you?

, If someone handed you a math test and said, ""Here's the exam. It's stuff you didn't even dream of touching in college. Good luck, kid,"" how might that feel? Pretty daunting, probably. If instead they said, ""Here's the exam -- it's gonna be tough, but it's doable,"" what would you think then? You'd be a lot more motivated and feel a lot better about taking that exam! The same goes for enthusiasm; you're not gonna get excited about something if it's terrible!


Think about it. How easy is it to be excited about something that's doable and that you know you're capable of achieving? It's a lot harder to get enthusiastic about things that we straight up don't think will ever materialize. And what's often the difference? Our way of thinking. Sometimes, that's literally the only obstacle.

, Now that you're at least trying to think positive, what are the goals that you'd like to achieve? How would you go about achieving them? What do you want to be enthusiastic about? It's hard to be enthusiastic when we're floundering about life without purpose.


Knowing exactly what you want to do and exactly how you want to go about it is giving you something to be enthusiastic about. If you want to get skinny, it's hard to be enthusiastic about wanting to get skinny. But if you're working out 30 minutes a week and eating tons of veggies, that's direct behavior to get excited about.

, It's all well and good to have goals, but you gotta actually believe that you can achieve them. If your goal is too lofty, bring it down a notch. Bring it down a notch until you can readily believe that it's something you can make happen. If it's realistic, the only thing stopping you is you.


Having a goal of becoming the King or Queen of England would be pretty damn hard to get excited about. Make sure your goals are feasible -- if in doubt, just start on a slightly smaller scale. Want to start your own business but don't know thing one about it? Make goals of taking business courses and networking. Smaller things that are totally doable and totally useful.

, Often when we're not enthusiastic, it's because we've made up some excuse as to why not to be. We don't want to be enthusiastic because we don't want to get our hopes up, we're not enthusiastic because we're too unsure to be enthusiastic, or we're not enthusiastic because we're worried others will judge us. These are all crap reasons! Your enthusiasm should be undaunted and unaffected by others or by insecurities. What's stopping you?


Realize that your desire to be enthusiastic is there -- it's just buried under a pile of worry and fear. When we grow up, often adults call that ""reason."" It's very much so a learned thing. We had it when we were children; it's time to get it back!

, It's no way to live life unhappy. Working a pointless job, drinking away the weekends, surrounding ourselves with meaningless relationships -- it all can get quite bleak. It's no wonder being enthusiastic is a struggle when we're behind a screen 8 hours a day, eating junk and lamenting our current circumstances. However you can, find something you enjoy and stick with it. Do it as much as you can. Give your life that spark it needs to generate enthusiasm.


It does not matter what it is. Whether it's building model airplanes, cooking, karate, or German karaoke, do it. Make time for it. Rearrange your schedule. Sacrifice other obligations. Make it a part of your routine. If it gives you drive and ignites a fire within you, latch onto it and latch onto it good. The enthusiasm will flow from there.

, Ever been in a room full of naysayers, raggin' on the government, current trends, all their coworkers and acquaintances? It sucks and it's super contagious. Before you know it, you're hating on everything, too. Don't do it! These people take what little enthusiasm can be mustered and pulverize it into oblivion. If you want to work on your positivity and enthusiasm, these people need to play a much smaller role in your life.


The first step is to end your toxic friendships. If you get about 5 seconds to think about it, you'll probably have a good idea of who this means. Once the negativity is expunged, think up of three people that truly make you feel downright good. When you have free time, they should be the people you go to. They can be enthusiasm role models to boot!

, You know how people say if you eat junk food, you'll feel crappy all day? Well, it's true. And it's a lot harder to feel mentally in the zone when you're not physically in it, either. So eat healthy! Your enthusiasm is worth it, right?


Here's another example: have you ever been laying in bed all day, wondering why you're so exhausted? And then you realize it's because you haven't done a damn thing all day. Getting up and exercising would make you that much more energized. So start exercising! That endorphin rush will be step one to feeling the inspiration flow through your views.

Get a good night's sleep! It's so hard to be enthusiastic when we're tired. In fact, we're pretty much the opposite of enthusiastic when we're exhausted. If you haven't been sleeping lately, that could be a cause of your lack of energy. So rest up!

, You know that positive thinking is imperative to being enthusiastic, but finding the motivation for that positivity can be tough. To lessen the burden, make a list of things you're grateful for. Seeing a concrete list of everything you have going for will make it hard to deny why you should be enthusiastic.


Don't give up after 5 minutes. Sometimes it's hard to think of things we're grateful for because we have them. We have them 24/7, so their awesomeness goes away. Your legs. Remember those? Those are awesome. Aren't you glad you have them?

, You know that ol' saying ""practice makes perfect?"" Well, it's crap. But practice does make habit. Act enthusiastic for long enough and eventually it'll be your go-to emotion. It'll take some time, but it's definitely doable. So don that enthusiastic hat of yours and start faking it!


Yeah, it's gonna suck for a bit. It's gonna feel like you're being a phony. Smiling and laughing and saying things like, ""Oooh, yeah!"" are going to feel foreign. If nothing else, start saying them sardonically. Be chipper to poke fun at the anti-chipperness of your personality. Find an excuse to fake it until you're not faking it any longer.

, Alright, so maybe you're not really in the mood to put in tons of effort. But you are of the practice makes habit sort of mind, so how can you fake it? Start by exclaiming things. Whether it's ""Hell yeah!"" or ""jolly good,"" or ""Well sit me down and call me Sally!"" is up to you. The more you react and with pizzazz, the more people will be fooled.


Imagine your friend Ted walks into the room. You two make eye contact, give each other a nod, and you say, ""Sup."" Not even in question form. Just ""sup."" He responds with, ""Yo."" Greeting exchanged. Now imagine Ted walks into the room and you say, ""HEY, TED! OHMIGOSH I'M SO HAPPY TO SEE YOU!"" and then you run around to room, arms flailing like the T-Rex you've always wanted to be. Who's enthusiastic now, huh?

, So an integral part of ""HEY, TED! OHMIGOSH I'M SO HAPPY TO SEE YOU!"" was the running around bit. You can't really sit back in your armchair, eyebrows unmoving, glued to the Discovery channel and exclaim those words with the same effect (well, you could...). So the next time you find yourself thinking, ""It would be appropriate to be excited right now,"" do something with yourself. Jump up and down. Wave your arms like a madman (don't do this in public). Hi-five your grandma (especially if she's the one who wants you to be more energetic). Make a choice and commit to it.


You could do a happy dance. You could make a finger gun and pretend you're the Fonz. You could point your thumbs at yourself and talk about how awesome you are. Why don't you try them all out and see what reactions you get?

, When you're thinking ""enthusiasm...enthusiasm,"" instead try thinking, ""bigger."" How can you make everything you're doing bigger? Try remembering this: you're not in a movie. There is no camera. You're on a stage where you have to show 1500 people in the 4th balcony that's practically a half mile away of what you're feeling, thinking, and doing. How might your behavior get grander?


The next time your roommate walks in and says, ""Hey, roomie. I just made cupcakes!"" you're not going to respond with, ""Oh, awesome, thanks. I love cupcakes."" No, no, no. You're going to punch the air John Bender Breakfast Club style, get on both knees and exclaim, ""My cupcake queen, how can I repay thee?"" and then run to the kitchen and shove a cupcake in your face. You're truly taking one for the team. Go you.

, All of this advice just won't jive with those around you if your face doesn't match your words, tone, or body. When Ted walks in the room, smile. Widen your eyes. When roommate #2 informs you she's made you cupcakes, drop your jaw in gratitude. Whenever you're faking an emotion (you can be enthusiastically negative, by the way), make sure you're covering all your bases.


You know exactly how to do this. You've seen people before and what facial expressions go with what emotion. The only thing you have to change is to make it bigger, making sure it registers with people. You gotta make sure your enthusiasm is heard and seen.

, So about that ""heard"" part. It's not so much that loudness equates with enthusiasm, it's just that quietness usually equates with a lack of enthusiasm. So when you're telling Ted how happy you are to see him, don't do it in a whisper. When you're overjoyed about cupcakes, put your lungs to work. There's no need to scream, but your enthusiasm should be a bit unconstrained, if you will. Take whatever's normal for you and bump 'er up a notch.


Think of what a teenage girl does when she sees Robert Pattinson or Justin Bieber. She screams and gets all flitty. Don't do that. But do make a note. When enthusiasm needs to be displayed, channel your inner Team Edward (but feel free to keep it at a dull roar). If nothing else, do it satirically. Only you need to know that you're poking fun at those around you. Why do they demand enthusiasm anyway?

, A simple way to seem enthusiastic is to ask questions. It shows you're interested and engaged in the moment. And then what happens when you ask questions? People respond and they might say something that actually sparks your interest, if it didn't before. So make the first step! Ask questions, get the ball rolling, and see how it grows from there.


It's easy to write off a topic/thing/person as uninteresting, judging a book by its cover, if you will. Resist! If you're tempted, make it a point to pry a bit further. You may find that lifting the veil sparks your curiosity. And that curiosity may lead you to finding something worth being enthusiastic about!

, One of the simplest ways to get happy is to start laughing. Start laughing and being happy and enthusiasm will follow. It can naturally put you in a better mood and get the creativity and positivity flowing.

, After a certain amount of time in an environment, the novelty of it all goes away. You quit noticing what once stopped you dead in your tracks with its beauty. You stop asking questions and wondering. You stop feeling awestruck. When that happens, enthusiasm escapes like grains of sand through your fingers. All of a sudden life is drab and unremarkable. Don't let that happen.


Simple things like the beauty of a sunset can bring enthusiasm back. The architecture of your favorite local building. Heck, a group of children building snowmen. When you stop and smell the roses, you just might stop and find what'll keep you going -- what can be downright inspiring.

, A simple way to start getting awestruck again is to try to new things. Life can get boring doing the same ol', same ol' -- so mix it up! It's impossible to maintain enthusiasm about something you've been doing year in and year out. And it's ridiculous to expect yourself to be enthusiastic if you don't have an exciting routine!


Even the smallest of change-ups can do wonders. Have you been running 3 miles (4.8 km) a day for the past six months? Find a new trail! Start cooking at home. Pick up a hobby. Go thrift shopping. Explore the tourist attractions in your area. It doesn't have to be big; it just has to be different.

, Imagine a relationship with a person that you've known your entire life. It probably starts getting a little boring when you stop learning about that person, when you know everything there is to know. The same goes for life! If you quit learning, you'll run out of reasons to get inspired. So do more thorough research, seek out experts, tap into your network. Whatever it is you want to do, dig in deeper.


It doesn't have to be book learning. You can learn from those around you, you can learn from yourself, heck, you can learn from wikiHow. Just keep seeking knowledge -- the more you know, the more interesting things become. Life included!

Follow your heart.,
Have some decorum.,
Be a lover of classics.",How to Be Ladylike the Sex and the City Way1,"
Carrie is romantic and led by her emotions. To follow your heart in a ladylike way, you must be gracious in defeat, courageous in a struggle and be prepared to laugh at yourself. In the episode The Real Me, (Season 4, Episode 2), Carrie trips on the runway whilst modelling in a fashion show. Although mortified, she gets up and finishes strutting her stuff to great applause, like a real lady. Handle yourself similarly in humiliating situations to be ladylike.;
, Carrie doesn't intentionally, publicly, belch, break wind, flash, moon, throw tantrums, talk down to people, insult shop staff or wait staff or, 'flash the cash'. Avoid these behaviours and similar. Carrie has been known to drink to excess and get Carried Away. Avoid this to be ladylike. Carrie also is an on / of smoker - smoking is proven to be detrimental to health, but it's a matter of opinion whether it's ladylike or not.

, Carrie loves Vogue, Christian Louboutin shoes, (amongst many others), Chanel, vintage telephones and romantic movies like, ""The Way We Were"". It's conceivably ladylike to prefer these sorts of things as opposed to OK!, Ugg Boots, Juicy Couture, iPhones and The Hunger Games.

Be passionate.,
Cultivate gratitude.,
Change what you can.,
Keep learning.,
Stay healthy.,
Take responsibility for your actions.",How to Be Great1," You want to bring passion to all parts of your life. It will help you to be excited about what you do and what you experience. Being passionate about things is also a great way to find friends and romantic partners, because people are drawn to those who are passionate about things.


Figure out what you like. This could be anything from cooking, to video games, to saving the whales.
You should get out and try new things to figure out what interests you. For example: you might go to a free lecture at your local university about global climate change and become passionate about saving the planet. You wouldn't have found this passion if you hadn't gone outside your usual comfort zone and tried something new.
You can also share your passion with other people. Get your friends interested in your interests, or go online and find like-minded people to get excited about your passions with. There are tons of websites out there devoted to everything from rock climbing to knitting. You can even look around your area to see if there's a group devoted to your passion, or a way to start one (like a writer's group, or a quilting circle).;
, Being grateful for things in your life is a prime way to boost your mental and physical health. It doesn't necessarily mean that everything is going swimmingly in your life. In fact, many of the most grateful people are those who have experienced some trauma or life altering (usually ""bad"") event, like an illness or death of a loved one.Keep a gratitude journal. This means that every day you write down between 3 and 5 things that you are grateful for. They can be as simple as ""the sun warmed me today"" or ""I got to have bacon for breakfast"" or as big as ""I got engaged today"" or ""my book got accept for publication."" Make sure that you spend time thinking about the things that you are grateful for.
Say ""thank you"" to the people you talk to throughout the day: the server who brings you your lunch, the lady who holds the door for you, your son when he makes you dinner. By spreading gratitude you are not only showing yourself everything (even the minor things!) you have to be grateful for, but you are also spreading that appreciation throughout all the people you encounter.
It is impossible to have both fear/anxiety and appreciation at the same time. By cultivating your gratitude you are making yourself better equipped to deal with the more difficult aspects of life in a healthy, healing manner.

, Lots of things happen that you have absolutely no control over. This is why it's important to maintain control over the things that you do have control over. These include: your attitude towards life, your job, how you spend your free time, the people who are in your life, and so on.


Attitude is immensely important. You can be having the ""worst"" life ever and still live well, because your attitude is what is important. Don't focus on the problems in your life, unless you're using them as a learning experience or in order to make changes. Instead, focus on the good things.
This doesn't mean that you ignore when things go wrong, or even that you aren't allowed to feel upset about those things. It means that you don't stay mired in misery over the things you cannot change.
Trust your instincts. If the job you're doing, the place where you're living, the relationship you're in doesn't feel right, see if there is a way to make it better (i.e. talk to your boss about the job, discuss your relationship and so on). If you can't make it better, it might be time to walk away from it and find a different job, a different apartment, or a different relationship.

, Honing your mind and keeping your brain sharp is a great way to maintain your mental health, reducing the possibility of Alzheimer's, for example. By continuing to learn and to grow as a person you open up further possibilities.


Learn from your mistakes. Whenever something happens where you get rejected, where you screw up, where you fail, examine what went wrong and what you could do better the next time around. Mistakes are not the end of the world and if you remember that, you'll be less afraid to fail. For example: if you tried to make a souffle and the end result was completely deflated, you might look back through the recipe to see if you missed a step, or you didn't follow the instructions as you should have done. It's the same for any sort of failure in life.
The more effort you put into learning about your passions the more likely you'll find other people who are interested in them, too. By taking classes on a subject you really enjoy, or going to a convention, or joining a chatroom on the subject, you'll be communicating your passion while learning!
There are lots of free or low cost ways to keep learning. You could enroll in a free program like Open Universitywhere you can take free online classes in almost any subject. You could also check out what your town or city has to offer. Lots of communities have free lectures at museums or universities, or libraries. They also sometimes offer opportunities to learn different things.

, You'll need to keep your health as much as possible if you're looking to be great. Again, there are certain things that can't be helped (like certain illnesses that come out of nowhere) but maintaining a healthy lifestyle can help you manage these types of conditions. If you don't have a serious illness, having a healthy lifestyle can boost your energy and make life easier to cope with.


Eat right. Go for the good, healthy things like veggies and fruits, especially the leafy greens and the colorful veggies like red peppers, Swiss chard, carrots. Get plenty of protein with an emphasis on the leaner meats like chicken. You can also get protein as well as good fats from nuts (almonds and walnuts being the best), eggs, or soy. As for carbs, avoid things with refined white flour and choose instead, brown rice, quinoa, oats, whole grains (Ezekiel bread is especially good).
Get enough sleep. Most people, these days, are operating under a sleep deficit. This means that you aren't functioning up the levels that you could be! Try to get at least 8 hours of sleep each night. Have a set bedtime (preferably before 11:00 p.m.) and a set wake-up time. Turn off electronics (cell phones, computer, iPod, etc.) at least 30 minutes before bedtime, so that you aren't messing up your sleep cycles.
Drink water. Being dehydrated has a bad effect on your body. It makes you feel sleepy and foggy, it can give you headaches and make it difficult to concentrate. Try to drink at least 8 glasses of water each day. You want your urine to be pale yellow in color. Caffeinated or sugary beverages will only make you more dehydrated.Get exercise. It's best not to use exercise as a weight-loss routine, but instead to use it for its health benefits. Exercising releases chemicals, like endorphins, that enhance your mood so that you feel happier.Find an exercise routine that you like. It could be anything from doing the climbing wall at your gym, or going for a run, or even putting on music and dancing. Do this for 30 minutes each day., One thing that is incredibly important to being great, is to take responsibility for the things that you do and feel. Remember, that no one owes you anything (not respect, not sex, not love) except civility and that the same is true of you.Don't blame other people when things go wrong. Sure, they might have had a hand in it, but it is very unlikely that it was entirely their fault. Owning up to your mistakes and taking responsibility for them will help people see you as a team player, someone who can handle things appropriately.
Again, remember, it's not the situation that's the problem, it's your reaction to the situation. Even the worst situation can be handled in a positive manner. For example: a lot of people who are diagnosed with severe and life threatening illnesses find that this strips away a lot of the pretensions from their lives, allowing them to live more fully and completely.
This is not to say that you aren't allowed to feel upset, or angry, or sad. It just means that you don't place the blame of those emotions on other people. No one can cause you to feel anything. (Of course there are instances where someone does irreparable harm to you , act in a way that gets you justice and allows you to heal.)

Respect tradition.,
Conduct yourself appropriately in public, always.,
Use your feminine guile to get what you want.",How to Be Ladylike the Sex and the City Way2," Charlotte, arguably the most ladylike of all four characters, is traditional, conservative, chaste and demure, mostly... Charlotte knows about etiquette and has impeccable manners. Learn which fork to eat your salad with, write thank you notes and leave the table when you feel the tone of the conversation has reached an unacceptably low level. (Season 3, Episode 9).

, Sit with you ankles crossed, speak well and don't swear. Behave yourself, usually. Charlotte was a prom queen, a varsity cheerleader, and a teen model so know about deportment and posture.

, Charlotte isn't afraid to exploit the chivalry of men to get what she feels she has a right to and what she wants. Expect men to pull your chair out for you, stand when you enter the room and get their hands dirty for you. Charlotte doesn't do DIY, she can arrange flowers, lay a table and choose a colour scheme for a dining room but is happy to have a man fix her cable TV.

Do not let your heart rule your head.,
Be amusingly self-deprecating.,
Be professional.",How to Be Ladylike the Sex and the City Way3," Public displays of affection, being overly emotional and losing your cool are things to avoid to be a lady like Miranda. She is a lawyer and takes her career very seriously. Ensure you act in a way that will earn the respect of your peers, male and female, and don't expect special treatment from others because you are a woman.

, Miranda often diffuses tense situations with humour. She doesn't tell jokes, use physical humour or act like a clown, she uses her intelligence to be witty, which is very ladylike. A classic quote of Miranda's illustrates this beautifully: 'Sexy is the thing I try to get them to see me as after I win them over with my personality.'

, Samantha gets to the point when talking and doesn't believe in dropping hints to get what she wants. There's no need to be aggressive, but don't simper or pout to try to get your way if you want to be ladylike in Samantha's way.

, Samantha is the type of lady who doesn't doubt herself. Don't be a wall flower at social gatherings, stride into rooms with your head held high. Make an entrance, don't just walk in, head down, trying to avoid drawing attention to yourself.

Figure out what you want to do.,
Set goals.,
Create a time-frame.,
Use positive thinking.,
Celebrate your accomplishments.,
Be creative.,
Take risks.",How to Be Great2," The world values people who work and you'll spend a large portion of your life working, presumably. This means that you need to find something that you love, or you need to figure out a way to do your work in a manner that fulfills you.Consider the things you're passionate about. If you're really into social justice, look into getting a law or social science degree and work for a nonprofit of some sort. If music is your thing you could start a music camp for disadvantaged children, or do music therapy for the dying.
If you find yourself in a job you hate, start looking for another one. You don't have to quit right away, and it's usually a good idea to have another job lined up before you quit the first one. It's best to keep an open mind about the types of jobs you might encounter, because you never know what might be around the corner.
If you're in a difficult job and you can't leave, try to to find ways to make it easier. If you have a difficult boss, irritating customers, work that is immensely boring, try to find creative solutions to these difficulties. For example: for boring work, come up with a few reasons why that work is important (you're feeding people, you're cleaning up after people, you're helping people get loans so they can have an amazing life!). Remind yourself of these reasons when the job is getting you down.

, While plans change often and quickly, you should have goals set that you want to accomplish. You should also work towards these goals as best you can, despite the other things that are happening in your life.


Have a list of goals, ordered from most important to least. These goals can be things like: run a 10k marathon, and land a job at a publishing house, and make a constellation quilt for a king sized bed.
Work hard towards your goals. If you want to work in publishing, don't just halfheartedly look at some job opportunities. Figure out what it would take to get that job you want. Get the degrees and experience you need, look into internships and entry level positions, demonstrate that you're willing to go that extra mile.

, You want to make sure that you have specific plans laid out for how to accomplish your goals and time-frame in which to accomplish them. This, again, doesn't mean that you can't adapt that time-frame or the goals, or that things can't change. It does, however, mean that you maintain your focus and can prove your accomplishments.


For example: if you want to run that 10k marathon, you'll need to pick the proper time to do it and the proper place. You'll need to set a specific time-frame for training. How far and fast do you need to be able to run? And when? Are you prepared for the marathon? Have you signed up for it? Each time you cross one of these off your list, you get closer to your goal and you feel accomplished.
Refer back to your goals and your time-frame each month. What do you still need to accomplish? What do you need to adjust to make things more feasible? What has changed since your last check-in and what have you accomplished since then?

, Visualization may sound like a silly thing, but it has actually been shown to be effective.It's a technique that many famous people have used to help themselves succeed, including Mohammad Ali.


Visualization helps the brain get ready for the actual physical act, be it getting a pay raise or asking that cute boy on a date. The practice of visualization can help increase your confidence, your motivation, and help set you up for success.
Each night, right before you go to bed, sit up straight and visualize yourself succeeding at your goals and your life. Visualize these things as if you were actually there (getting the raise, giving a successful speech, asking the girl out). Utilize your five senses: what does it smell like? what sounds can you hear? who is there with you? what are you wearing? Each night as you do this combine it with a positive affirmation: ""I am super confident,"" ""I make a great publishing assistant,"" ""I am an amazing runner.""

, When striving towards greatness, you need to take time to recognize and celebrate the things you've already accomplished. These don't have to be huge, life-shattering events. Quiet, simple events like ""successfully kept my house clean for 3 months running"" count, too.Think back over the last 24 hour period. What was your greatest accomplishment in that time? It could be something as simple as ""made a delicious and nutritious dinner"" to something as big as ""didn't give up on dancing.""

, Creativity is a key to being successful in your life and greatness comes from creativity. It comes from having a flexibility of mind to consider other options than the ones immediately obvious. People who use creativity in their lives tend to find it easier to deal with obstacles.


Think outside the box. People tend to get stuck in thinking about how to use certain things. Look at the objects around your house and come up with alternate uses for them to get your brain accustomed to looking at things in a different way. For example, you could build a terrarium out of clear plastic c.d. case fronts.One thing that stifles creativity is fear of failure. To get around this, consider an obstacle or problem without limitations attached. These questions can help open you up to the realm of different possibilities: ""if I could ask anyone in the world for help, who would I ask? If I had access to any possible tools, what would I use? what riskier solution would I try if there were no possibility for failure?""
Daydream. This process helps to form connections and recall information, rather than just being a mindless activity. Setting aside time to let your mind wander can help you have better and more creative ideas. You can daydream while taking a walk, before you fall asleep at night, or even for a few minutes at work., If you're going to be great in your own mind and in your own life, you're going to have to be willing to take risks and court the possibility of failure. No one who did well in life got there because everything went 100% smoothly for them (of course, some people did have advantages, but that doesn't mean they didn't take risks).


Put yourself out there. Be open with people about who you are and what you do. Don't hide your passions and interests. When you're open to life and all its vulnerabilities, you're also opening yourself up to success and to new things.
Obviously, be smart about the risks you take. For example, jumping off a 50 story building without any sort of rope or way to break your fall, is the sort of risk that is going to end in your death or serious injury. It is not advisable.

"
"
Find a community.,
Be the friend you wish you had.,
Learn to listen.,
Be kind.,
Be honest.,
Give back.",How to Be Great3," Community doesn't necessarily have to mean the people in your hometown or city. It simply means a group of people that supports you. Being part of a community can actually help you live longer and more happily and can make you feel less alone.This is where your passions come in. You can find a community and a place to belong based on things you're interested in. For example: if you're interested in social justice, you might find like-minded people in your area at a rally, or by volunteering at a nonprofit.
You can also find community through the internet, on places like Reddit or Tumblr, for example. A lot of these places have search functions that can help you more easily find people with similar interests. All you have to do is reach out and make a move to talk to them.
Don't burn bridges. You don't necessarily want to maintain toxic people in your life, but not dumping people dramatically can benefit you in the long run. Even toxic people can do things like write recommendations for you, or introduce you to other people. This is not to say that you don't have the right to protect yourself. If someone is acting in a threatening or derogatory manner to you, you have every right to call it out and to cut them out of your life completely.
Remember the 30/30/30 rule. This basically says that 1/3 of the people you meet will love you; 1/3 will hate you no matter what you do; 1/3 simply won't care one way or another. Work on strengthening your relationships with the 1/3 who love you and forget the rest., Instead of worrying about what kind of friends you have, be the person you wish you had as a friend. People will respond to that sort of friendship and you'll find yourself attracting the kind of friends you wanted.


Be supportive of your friends. When something good happens to them, celebrate with them without the sting of jealousy. When something unhappy happens, make sure that you're there to help them.
Tell your friends what they mean to you. Be open about their importance in your life, without worrying if they feel the same way. For example: you might tell your friend how much she means to you by writing her a letter detailing all the awesome things about her. You could also tell a friend ""I don't know what I would do without you. You always manage to make me laugh, even when I'm feeling down.""

, Real listening is a skill that most people don't cultivate, or don't learn until they're much older. It means that when you're talking to someone you're truly listening and thinking about what they're saying rather than being distracted thinking about what's for dinner or about the next thing you want to say.This is called active listening. To do it you need to avoid being distracted by the things going on around you. If you do get distracted, ask the person to repeat what they just said.
Ask questions and listen to the answers. Instead of replying right away with a story or thought of your own, ask them a follow up question and keep doing that. People will notice that you are interested in what they have to say.
Maintain eye contact and try to avoid fidgeting or checking your phone (especially this last one). So many people only listen with half their attention

, This is a hard one, because it is so easy to get ratcheted up and forget that other people are typically doing the best they can, just like you are. Being kind doesn't necessarily mean being a pushover or ""nice."" It means giving people the benefit of the doubt and trying to see things from points of view other than your own.


For example: When that irritating person cuts you off in traffic, instead of going into a cloud of irritation (and maybe flipping them off), give them the benefit of the doubt. Maybe they didn't see you. Maybe they were distracted by bad news at work, or at home. Maybe they're simply an angry person, in which case they deserve your sympathy, because their life is guaranteed to be harder than yours since they can't let things go.
Being kind means not gossiping behind people's back, being upfront when someone has upset you instead of using passive aggressive actions. It means not having to have the last word in arguments, and really listening to the other person's side. It does not mean that you accept abuse from other people.
Be kind to yourself as well as to other people. Write down a list of the things you tell yourself on a regular basis (""I'm ugly,"" ""I'm a loser""). You wouldn't (hopefully) say these things to another person, so you shouldn't say them to yourself. When you find yourself doing so, stop and turn the thought around. Say instead ""I'm thinking I'm a loser, but I know that it's just an errant thought and not true.""
Don't compare yourself to others. Someone else is always going to be doing better at life than you and if you continue to compare yourself to the people you think are more successful, you're going to be intensely unhappy. You'll also start to resent them, which is the opposite of kindness.

, Honesty is an act of courage and trying to live your life in this manner will mean you become great no matter what you do as a job or what you accomplish. You don't have to be rude to be honest. Again, you're tempering your opinions with kindness, but it does mean that you don't sugarcoat things.For example: if you're at work and you make a mistake, it might be easy to cover up the mistake or pretend it wasn't you. However, it wouldn't be honest. Act with integrity and own up to your mistake and give an example of how you might fix it.

, This is an intensely important part of being great. Giving back to your community (whatever it might be) helps to foster an atmosphere of giving and makes sure that the members of your community are cared for. Philanthropy actually helps to maintain your health and have a better mental state.Help out friends and family. Offer to drive your grandmother to her doctor's appointment, take care of your friend's kid so he can go on date night with his partner, clean your sister's house when she's intensely busy.
Volunteer in your community. This could be for something like a soup kitchen, or a shelter. It could be for an important arts nonprofit, or for a local social justice group. You can also donate money and items, even a small amount can make a huge difference.
Do something for a stranger. This could be something simple like donating to someone's medical fund, or secretly buying the drink of the person behind you in line. Do these things anonymously, so the impetus is on the act rather than the congratulations for doing it.

Live in the moment.,
Focus on the positives, even in a challenging situation.,
Embrace positive affirmations.,
Value your time and use it in positive ways.",How to Be Happy Go Lucky1," While maintaining a certain level of control over your life is important for maintaining a positive state of mind, you should also try to live more in the moment. This means letting go of things you cannot control and embracing spontaneity. Living in the moment can add an element of excitement and engagement in your life that you may have been missing.One way to live more in the moment is to create a bucket list of five to ten things you have always wanted to do and set a timeline for doing them. Keep the items reasonable, as you want them to be things you can achieve. Your list may have things like “traveling solo for a month” or “competing in the slam poetry competition at school”. Focus on things you can achieve and then pursue them.;
, You should also try to develop a habit of looking on the bright side of things. Though it’s important to acknowledge that bad things happen, you do not need to negative to take over your life. Instead, focus on the positives. Ask yourself, “Is the situation really as negative as I think it is?” and “Can I look at this situation in a more positive way?”It may also help you to view bad situations as part of a learning experience, where you can gain insight into yourself or into others. Thinking about what you can learn, rather than shutting down or freaking out, can allow you to approach the situation positively.

, To boost your sense of happiness, you can start your day with one to two positive affirmations. These affirmations could be simple ""I"" statements about something you are happy about or grateful for, as well as statements about positive things you intend to do that day. For example, you may look in the mirror in the morning and say, ""I am powerful and strong"" or ""I am going to do exciting things today.""You may also want to put up inspirational posters and visuals that contain positive messages in your living space or your work space. This way, you can look at these messages when you are having a low point in your day or struggling to be happy go lucky as a reminder to stay positive.

Pursue a new hobby or skill.",How to Be Happy Go Lucky2," Your sense of happiness is directly influenced by how well you take care of your body. Eating a healthy nutritious diet will ensure you feel energized for the day and your body is feeling at its best. Your diet should be balanced, with good sources of protein, carbohydrates, and dairy as well as fruits and vegetables.You should create a meal plan and go shopping every week for fresh produce. Try to stick to the items on your grocery list so you are not tempted to get unhealthy foods.
If you have a hard time going grocery shopping every week due to your busy schedule, you should opt for the healthy option when you go out to eat. Look for an option that contains vegetables and healthy sources of protein, such as tofu or lean meats.

, Set aside time in your schedule to work up a sweat for at least 30 minutes to one hour a day. Exercise helps to create endorphins and contribute to a more positive outlook on life. Working out will allow you to release any stress or anxiety you may be struggling with and feel refreshed by the end of your run, jog, or exercise class.You may have an exercise class you enjoy doing on a daily basis or several times a week. Or you may prefer to run or jog for exercise. Whatever you decide to do, make sure you let yourself sweat on a consistent basis to boost your mood and stay healthy.

, Try to fit in some outside time to your routine, whether this is a short walk in a green space near the office or a walk in the sun on a nice day. Exposure to sunlight, and Vitamin D, can help to boost your mood and your health. Studies have shown that spending time in green spaces, with lots of plants and natural beauty, can also improve your outlook and your mood., Research has shown that not getting enough sleep every night can lead to mood swings, depression, and disease.You should aim to get at least eight hours of uninterrupted sleep a night.

Maintain close relationships with at least five individuals.,
Offer assistance to friends or family in need.,
Show gratitude and appreciation to those close to you.",How to Be Happy Go Lucky3," National surveys have shown that maintaining relationships with at least five people that are close and fulfilling can lead to a greater sense of personal happiness.You may count your romantic partner as one of these five people, as well as close family members. The idea is the stronger your ties are to other people, the happier you are. Healthy interpersonal relationships enrich your life and help improve the quality of your life. Having good relationships also gives you a sense of support when you are feeling down and a way to relieve stress or anxiety through spending time with those you care about.
You may want to sit down and write out five people in your life that you are closest to. This could be friends, family, partners, spouses, etc. You should then consider how you can strengthen your relationships with these five individuals even more. Maybe you haven’t spoken to one friend in months or you have neglected your relationship with your partner. Make an effort to reconnect with that individual and stay connected.

, Being there for friends and family can also improve your mood and your quality of life. If you have a friend who is feeling down, reach out to them and try to cheer them up.This could be something as simple as dropping by for a visit or going out for a coffee. If a family member is ill, bring them healthy food or medicine. Making an effort to be kinder and considerate to others can in turn help you feel better about your life.

, Do this by expressing a sense of wonder and thankfulness towards people who support you in your life. Every day, to think of at least one thing for which you are grateful. This could be the fact that your partner makes coffee for you in the morning or the fact that your morning commute is shorter that day. Displaying gratitude and appreciation will help you maintain a happy go lucky attitude.When you have an ungrateful thought, try to replace it with a grateful one. For example, you may think, “My boyfriend forgot our anniversary,” but then you might remind yourself, “My boyfriend took me out for dinner last year and he has a lot on his plate right now.”

Think of any issues or problems that may be making you unhappy.,
Write negative thoughts down in a journal.,
Speak to friends or family about your issues.,
Talk to a professional.",How to Be Happy Go Lucky4," Sometimes, it can difficult to feel happy go lucky when you are experiencing negative feelings due to a specific issue or problem. One way to feel better is to address this issue and try to resolve it so you can move forward. You may want to sit down and consider what might be bringing you down or bothering you. Once you address the issue, you can then brainstorm ways to resolve it.For example, you may feel depressed due to losing your job. Once you acknowledge that this is the issue that is making you unhappy, you may be motivated to apply for other positions. You may also take some time to consider if you would be happier in a different career or in a different position. The lay off may be blessing in disguise and allow you to pursue a career you have always wanted.

, If you struggle with negative thoughts on a daily basis, you may want to try writing them down rather than keeping them inside. Try to make journaling a daily practice, done at night before bed or in the morning before you get ready for the day. Writing your thoughts down can be cathartic and allow you to release emotions you may be struggling with., You may also want to reach out to your support network and share your thoughts with friends or family. Sharing your feelings and emotions can be a healthy way to process them and address them.Avoid complaining or whining about your issues on a constant basis, as this will just place your negativity on those around you. Instead, try to talk one on one to friends or family and ask for advice about an issue you may be having. Practice active listening and show the person you are paying attention to what they are saying. Make the discussion feel more like a conversation, rather than a rant session.

, If your issues or problems are really getting in the way of your happiness, you may want to talk to a therapist or a counselor. Talking to a professional can help you work through your issues and feel supported as you try to maintain a more positive outlook on life. Getting help from a therapist or counselor will often open the door to healing and happiness.You can talk to your primary care doctor and get a referral for a therapist or seek out a therapist through a friend or relative who goes to good therapist.
You can also speak to a counselor at your school or in your workplace to help you work through your issues and get one step closer to a happy go lucky attitude.

Take regular showers to keep your body clean and smelling fresh. Avoid overly scented soaps, as these may clash with perfume you use.
Use deodorant and anti-antiperspirant. Like with soap, avoid any with a strong scent.
Keep hair and nails appropriately trimmed and maintained.
Don't forget to brush your teeth after every meal too! You don't want food sticking out of your teeth.;
,


Try your best to be blemish free. That means no acne, no pimples, and no bruises or scars. Sometimes it is unavoidable, but find the best way to take care of your skin.
If you have acne or pimples you should go to a dermatologist to try to find a skin product that works for you.
Keep your skin clean and clear by washing you face every day. You may or may not want to use soaps, as everyone's skin is different. Experiment to find a system that works for you.

,


Start with eyeliner. You should have either a a small amount of eyeliner or a medium amount of eyeliner. Trace the natural shape of your eye on the upper lash-line, and put a little ""flick"" at the end, it's a classic, always gorgeous look.
Find your exact shade of concealer, and use that under your eyes if you have dark circles, and anywhere you may have scars etc. Use foundation if you need extra coverage or if your skin tone is uneven.
To make your face appear more feminine, use a facial highlighter and apply on the high points of your face: your brow bone, your cheekbones, and the bridge of your nose.
Curl your lashes and apply mascara.
Using two eyeshadow colors, apply the lighter one all over the lid and the darker one in the crease.
Find a lip color that works for you and use it, make sure you use a moisturizer before applying lip color.
Choose one or the other if you plan on applying heavy makeup--eyes or lips.

Your hair should be nice and clean.
Everyone's hair is different and unique, and all can be glamorous if you find the right style for your look. Don't be a stranger to volume!
Any color is also possible, just make sure that it is befitting your natural coloring. Any color is ok, depending on your style. However, avoid bright colors because they tend to fade and look cheap.
Your hair should be always shiny and healthy. This means using leave in conditioner and generally keeping it healthy, while also getting regular haircuts to maintain the ends.

,


Keep your nails trim, smooth, and healthy.
Don't neglect your cuticles. Keep them smooth, healthy, and pushed back as necessary.
Paint your nails, when you can. When the paint starts to chip, take it off.

Maintaining good posture will make you look more confident and will also make you look taller. Plus, it's good for you!
Sleep on your back to help develop good posture, then maintain that straight back throughout the day.
Strong stomach muscles are what help you stand straighter, so work out if you need to.
You can also wear a back brace when you're at home to help train you to straighten your back.

,


Make sure that everything matches. This is way more important than having expensive clothes! Nothing says ""glamour"" like being put together.
Keep colors matching by using a limited palette. Choose the colors that look best on you and then stick to well-matching colors or color families (Purple/Blue/Green, Red/Orange/Yellow, etc).
Match styles as well. You don't want to mix a modern looking skirt with a vintage top or anything like that, as a general rule. While sometimes you can make it work and work well, it is easy to make it look off.
A good example is if you go running, wear a matching velour tracksuit, with sneakers that fit, and maybe a cute (matching) graphic tee underneath. It shows that even on your lazy days you are trying, or maybe you are so rich that this was the slouchiest outfit you could put together!

,


Determine your body shape (pear, hourglass, etc.) and then wear clothes that are best for that body shape.
Different cuts of clothing can flatter different body types. For example, triangle body types, which have broad shoulders, should avoid clothes with shoulder padding or puffs.
Wearing clothes that flatter your shape will make you look good pretty much no matter what your body looks like.
Experiment to find what clothing cuts bring out your body's best features.

,


Clothing that doesn't fit can make you look fatter, lazy, cheap, or sick. Avoid clothes that don't fit in order to look healthy and amazing.
Don't wear clothes that are too big and hang off your frame, or clothes that are too small and create bulges.
You also want to avoid pants with a waist that is too low, as your bum will spill over when you move around and this will destroy your glamorous look.
When you try on clothes, take three different sizes of the same item with you, one up and one down (even if you're sure of what your normal size is). Never be afraid to grab more sizes if those don't seem to work.

,


Don't wear clothes that look cheap. Avoid cheap looking fabrics like very low quality fabrics such as pleather (fake leather) or lame, fuzzy/feather materials.
Opt instead for clothes made from fine fabrics like silk, satin, high-quality lace (like Chantilly), cashmere, or modal.
Your clothes should also be well maintained. Don't wear clothes with holes or stains. Keep them clean, wrinkle-free, and looking sharp.
Wear nice looking clothes even if you're doing things like running to the gym or doing errands.
Adhering to all the trends is not only expensive but can also make you look like you're trying too hard and create embarrassing photos of you in the future. Look timelessly glamorous by wearing classic styles.






Trends to avoid include things like bell-bottom jeans, shoulder pads, or asymmetrical hem lines.
Instead, wear things like button-up shirts, knee length skirts, suits, and classic-cut dresses.
Look for inspiration to the look you are trying to achieve.

,


Never wear casual clothing if you can help it. Even your gym clothes should look nice.
For whatever you're going out to do, shoot for dressing just a little bit nicer than what would be normal for the situation.
Don't go over the top though, wearing a ball gown to a dinner party is way too much. This will just make you come across as clownish.

,


Make sure that even if you cannot afford expensive clothes, you accessorize well so that you liven the clothes up and make the outfit look more expensive.
Wear earrings that are dramatic and have some sparkle or shine, but make sure that they fit the size and shape of your neck and face. You don't want them to look too big or too small.
A small, fancy necklace to wear all the time is good because it can make even casual outfits look more dressed up and intentional.
A diva-ish pair of sunglasses will never go wrong. Large sizes, like those popular in the 60s, look especially glamorous.
A shiny watch is almost mandatory! Just make sure it fits and if you have to, get links removed or added. Also, make sure it is a color that goes with everything in your closet and matches your skin tone.

,


While looking confident won't make you visually look more glamorous, it will affect how people perceive you. If you want to be perceived as glamorous and fit in, you'll need to look like you love yourself and are comfortable in the skin you're in.
You don't have to actually be confident but you do have to act like it (although you should learn to love yourself, and the rest will fall into place.) Most people, even if they seem really self-confident, actually are not, so don't feel bad.
Don't constantly apologize or defer to other people. Don't criticize yourself or put yourself down. A little self-deprecating humor is okay though.
Speak up for yourself, be kind and compassionate (not stuck up or offensive), have good posture, and don't be afraid to do things that make you stand out, like talking intellectually, or about things you are passionate about.

,


Getting overly angry or emotional can ruin the glamorous look, making you look immature or like a bit of a jerk. Can you imagine Audrey Hepburn being a jerk? No.
Never create a scene, yell at people who upset you, or generally get extremely sensitive about something that's going on. Be in control of yourself, emotionally as well.

,


Speaking meaningfully, like acting confident, will help create the perception of glamour. The smarter you speak, the more classy and elegant you will seem.
An accent isn't necessary to make yourself seem more glamorous, so don't try to fake one.
Instead, use the best grammar and vocabulary that you can.
Practice speaking when you're alone, if that helps you to overcome bad habits.

,


Remember that since being glamorous is about creating a great first impression, make sure to use your manners, especially when meeting someone for the first time.
Every time you step outside your home into the public eye, strive to convey your image of glamour, but no matter what, stay true to yourself (people will respect you for it.)
Imagine that you have photographers following you around all day--if they're snapping pictures, what do you want them to capture? And is it glamorous?

,


You may not be able to hop on a jet and lounge on a Brazilian beach just like that, but you can be selective in your activities.
If you want to lead the glamorous life of an artist, for example, it's more fitting to hang out in coffee shops , discussing art history with like-minded people til the early hours of the morning than to go bar-hopping.

,


For those on a budget, you can use classic pieces. Imagine an old Hollywood actress is helping you decorate, but don't be afraid to add color.
Stay away from multiple different patterns, it will be too loud and distracting. The key is to look classic and fairly modern with your décor.
Watch old movies to get ideas.
You can also go to your local antique store and find pieces that you like.

In this case, you are much more prone to clumsiness. Being aware of your surroundings will help you to avoid common clumsy mistakes like bumping into things.


Look at and note the small things around you. This will help you become more aware of your surroundings and build good habits that reduce clumsiness., If you are rushed, you are much more likely to do things wrong, because you think you don't have any time. When in a rush, it is easy to stop paying attention to the things around you, and therefore easier to trip, fall, bump into someone or spill your drink.Practice doing things slowly. If you are in the habit of rushing, you will rush even if you are trying not to. Pay close attention to being slow and deliberate with your actions.

, If you suffer from “time urgency,” a constant and ever-present feeling that there is not enough time, you will likely always be focusing on the deadline, the next thing you have to do, or the next place you have to be.

If you find yourself bumping into things that you don't notice, trying paying deliberate attention for a while to reduce it. If you find it difficult to see obstacles even when you are deliberately focusing on it, you might have a problem with your eyesight.

If your makeup needs extra staying power throughout the day, for example if you live somewhere hot or humid, or you work outside, use a setting spray.",How to Apply Eye Makeup (for Women Over 50)," The first step to healthy, younger skin is to moisturize it each day. As you grow older, the area around your eyes is prone to develop wrinkles and a drooping look, but moisturizing your skin can help restore some of that hydration to your skin, giving it a more natural glow.;
, Every night before bed, apply a gentle exfoliant to your skin to help remove dryness or flakiness. You can use a facial scrub or a natural product like coconut oil, but make sure it is not too harsh that it causes irritation to your skin. Purchase an exfoliant specifically for your skin type if you have more sensitive skin.


Exfoliating is beneficial if done well, but if applied excessively or used harshly, your face can experience redness, increased flakiness, or a stinging sensation.

, Although you may feel that a dark tan will help you look younger, the sun damage to your skin will only cause it to age faster. Always apply sunscreen when going outside for long periods of time to prevent more wrinkles and sunspots from forming on your skin.

, Those dark circles that appear under your eyes can be hard to hide, but applying some under eye cream each night and a lighter cream in the morning can help those circles disappear. Invest in an eye cream that matches the tone of your skin so that it can be blended in well with your foundation and concealer.

, After a long day it can be tempting to slide into bed without washing your face, but removing makeup before you go to bed is essential to keeping your skin healthy. Not only can makeup clog pores, but it can lead to aging and wrinkles because you aren't giving your face a chance to recover from the exposure it faced during the day.


During the day your face is exposed to much dirt and pollution. Washing your face at night is important in removing the oils and filth from the day and giving your skin time to recover. If you leave your makeup on, these oils can become trapped on your skin, which over a period of time results in fine lines and premature aging. If you find you don't have time to wash your face at night or are just too tired, use makeup remover pads to swipe over your skin and eyes. You'll want to cleanse your face on a regular basis, but this is okay to do occasionally.
Sleeping in eye makeup as opposed to foundation may not be as harmful to your skin, but it can create inflammation and irritation for your eyes.

, Lack of sleep can be one of the most harmful things to your skin, as it doesn't give it the proper time to recover and rest, resulting in dark circles and dull, lifeless skin. As you get older it's important that you get a good amount of beauty sleep so that your skin looks new and fresh in the morning. If you have a hard time sleeping, try doing some activities before bed that will relax your body and prepare it for rest. Do a bed-time yoga sequence, drink some hot tea, take a relaxing bath, write a to-do list of everything you need to do to get it off your mind, or take a walk. Performing a relaxing activity before bed will help decrease any stress that is lingering and keeping you from sleeping. , It can be easy for women to feel embarrassed by their age, but growing older is a natural thing, and the more confident you feel about your age, the easier it will be to feel beautiful. Understand that your skin will likely be different than it was when you were in your twenties, but that's not a bad thing. Try to avoid going overboard with makeup and focus on doing what's best for your own skin.

, Applying eyeshadow and other eye makeup is a skill, and you may be tempted to apply more makeup as you get older because you want to cover up as much of your skin as possible. However, too much makeup is going to draw too much attention to your eyes (and not for a good reason). Go with a more natural look that makes your eyes pop, but doesn't give them unnecessary attention.

, Expensive products are not always better; it comes down to your skin type, the tools you use, and how experienced you are with applying it. Make sure you seek out product reviews from people with a similar skin type to you, to give you the closest possible idea of what it will do for you.


Remember that everyone's skin is different so you will have to experiment a bit until you find what works best for you.
Don't underestimate the power of tools. Good quality tools can be the difference between a product looking hideous or gorgeous. Again, tools will be a matter of experimentation with what works for you.

, This means both the shade of your skin and your undertones. Using makeup which is the wrong shade or the wrong undertone can make you look orange or ashy, which is rarely flattering


There are many ways to find out what undertone your skin has. A quick way to tell it to look at the veins on your wrist - if they appear greener, you likely have warm undertones, if they're purple, you likely have cool undertones, and if they're not clearly one of the other, you likely have neutral undertones.

Don't be afraid to get a professional to help match you, either!


The shade and undertones of your face can sometimes be different to the rest of your body. Ideally you should get your products to match your neck/body so your makeup looks cohesive.
Now that you know your shade and undertones, get products to match. Matching your foundation is one of the most important, but eyeshadow and even lip products make a big difference too. A general rule of thumb is to use what matches your undertone (for people with warm undertones, stick to warm coloured eyeshadow and lip liner, and those with cooler undertones tend to suit cooler colours).

People with neutral undertones are lucky in that they can often wear both cool tones and warm tones without looking washed out or orangey.
This is just a rule of thumb, experiment to find what YOU think looks best!



, This will give you a smooth base to put your makeup on, and will help it last throughout the day. Some primers even have properties which will make your skin look and feel brighter.


To minimise wrinkles and pores, use a thick primer which will fill the dips in your skin and make your face appear smoother.
Be very selective in your choice of primer. The results they give vary significantly depending on your skin type, so this is one where it's vital to read reviews and experiment a bit.

, This will make your skin look healthier and give it more of a glow. It should also make your face match your neck and body.


Use a liquid foundation. Powder foundations tend to give less coverage and make your skin look drier, thereby emphasizing wrinkles and making you look older. Don't be tempted to set it with powder either - if you need your makeup to have maximum staying power use a setting spray once you have finished your entire face.
Apply this with a brush or a damp makeup sponge (like a BeautyBlender) to get an even application. Using your fingers can make it look streaky and uneven. Make sure you blend it out past your jawline and down your neck so the colour flows smoothly.

, Using the less is more rule, apply a small amount of liquid concealer to those dark circles or bags under and around your eyes, blending in with your finger or a sponge to dab the concealer into your skin. Choose a concealer that is a shade or two lighter than your skin and try to focus on those darker areas, as applying to lighter areas will make your face look patchy. , Applying it to the apples of your cheeks can pull your face down, while putting it closer to your cheekbones makes your face look perkier and healthier.


You can find a diagram online for this. Make sure you blend out the edges so it looks like your skin's natural healthy glow.
Use a liquid or cream product, and sparingly. Like with foundation, a powder blush can make your skin look dry.
Err on the side of lighter shades (within reason, of course). Shades that are too dark will look garish or make your cheeks look hollow.

, As you age, your eyelids will naturally become more hooded, making it more likely that your eye makeup will wear off, move, and/or crease during the day. Using a primer before you apply eyeshadow will help keep the eyeshadow in place and will also help it stay on longer during the day.


Eyelid primers come in a variety of colours. Most come in nude shades to match your skin and hide any discolouration on your lids, but you can also get white ones which will make the eyelid stand out more and the colours on top brighter. For older skin it is usually better to stick to a nude primer and rely on eyeshadow to make your eyes pop in the way you want them to, else you run the risk of looking garish or drawing more attention to the hood above your eye than you eye itself (which will make the eye look small and asleep).

, Eyes that are more prone to wrinkles and are a little more droopy don't need lots of color, just a slight glow to make them livelier. Swipe a neutral or light shade in the same range of tones as your skin tone (for light to medium skin try champagne, beige, or taupe, for darker skin tones try subtle golds or light browns) across your eyelid. To make the look more dramatic, perhaps for a night out, put a dark matte colour in the crease and outer corner for more definition and drama.


Eyeshadow is one product where powder products work well for older skin. Cream shadows tend to set into wrinkles and creases more easily than powders around the eyes.
If there is a section of your eyelid that is not covered by the lid, you can use a light shimmery shade to highlight that spot. However, you will need to be sparing with this, because over-applied highlight can do the draw attention to wrinkles and hoods, detracting the attention from your actual eyes and making them look small and closed, which is the opposite of what you're trying to do.
Be careful with dark colours, because they can make eyes look sunken and heavy. Used correctly they can add striking definition which can brighten your eyes and make them look younger, but it is a fine balance which can only be achieved with a light touch with the dark shadow, and practice.
Focus mostly on the eyelid and crease of your eye, to avoid drawing attention away from them. Taking your eyeshadow too high up will make your eyes look sunken and closed. You can choose to put a light matte shade just under your eyebrow to highlight your browbone and make your eyes pop more, but this isn't necessary and can look garish if it's too obvious. You can also put a tiny amount of shimmery highlight on the inner corner of your eye (near the bridge of your nose) to open up your eyes, but this doesn't work with all eye shapes. You will need to experiment a bit to know.
Wear clothes and outfits to draw attention to the color of your eyes, not your eyeshadow. If you have blue eyes, wear a shirt that makes your eyes pop, and allow the eyeshadow to highlight that, rather than drawing the full attention on your eyelids. Choosing the right glasses that frame your eyes and face well will also highlight the beauty in your eyes.
You can find diagrams online which give you an idea of where to put your eyeshadow. The guides will need to be adapted to fit your own eye.
Be sure to blend your eyeshadow! You want to create a soft gradient at the edges of each shade of shadow and not have any unnatural looking harsh lines. Try using a fairly small, clean, fluffy brush for this.

, Going for a more subdued color like charcoal or dark brown, apply a thin line to your upper eyelid, and blend it in with a small brush if you want it to look really natural. Using a dark liquid liner is often too harsh on aging eyes, so keeping your eyeliner soft will highlight your eyes without them looking dated. Avoid applying eyeliner under your eye as this can make eyes look smaller. If you still want some sort of color under your eye, take a flat brush and using eyeshadow apply a soft line of color under your lashes. Go sparing, because the more attention you bring to your lower lashline, the more it looks like your eyes are drooping.

, Even if your eyelashes are thin and sparse, choose a lengthening mascara over a volumizing one. Creating more volume without length will just cause eyelashes to look more stubby. The color of your mascara doesn't matter so much, but try to stick to a shade that goes well with your eyebrows (a black is fine for dark brows, but if you brows are blonde stick to brown or dark brown mascara).


Before applying mascara, curl your lashes to give them a nice shape and then apply a mascara primer to help mascara last during the day. Refrain from pumping the mascara wand as this can cause mascara to dry out.
Consider using a waterproof mascara to help keep mascara on during the day. However, make sure to use an oil-based makeup remover at the end of the day.

, Starting at the root of your lashes, wiggle the wand through your lashes to get as much mascara on the roots as possible and then pull the wand through to the tip of your lashes. Do this two to three times, or until your eyelashes have a nice coat of mascara.


Do not overcoat mascara as this will make your lashes look spidery and unnatural. There's a fine line between having a good coat of mascara on your eyelashes and overdoing it.
Only put a small amount of mascara on your lower lashes. You want to define them, but you want to make sure the lashes above your eye are the most visible. For some people the mascara you blink onto your lower lashes from putting it on the top is enough.

, Not everyone will want to wear these, but if your eyelashes have become very thin or almost nonexistent, it could be beneficial to invest in some natural looking false eyelashes to give your eyes a younger look. Make sure to wear individual lashes (good quality ones will be more expensive), rather than a whole length of false eyelashes. False lashes are reusable, as long as you're careful with them. You can buy eyelash glue separately to the lashes if they don't come with enough.

, As women get older, eyebrows can become thin and sometimes almost invisible. Seeking out a professional's advice on how to improve your eyebrows can often help your eyes look younger because they will likely try to improve the arch of your brow, which prevents your eyes from looking droopy. You can also tend to your eyebrows yourself and give them a thicker, fuller look to create more youthful eyes. Using powder and an eyebrow pencil a shade or two darker than your hair can help give color and shape to those thin eyebrows. Use thin, light strokes to imitate the look of natural hairs as opposed to a thick drawn-on line.

, You don't need to drown yourself in it, but you need enough to make it actually work. Holding it 20-30cm from your face and spraying it in a T shape followed by an X shape will be enough to hold your makeup all day.

, Matte primers are great for everyday use, because they tend to last longer and give you a more neutral base for your eye makeup. Even if your skin is not oily, eyelids tend to get a little greasy throughout the day, and the matte finish will help absorb the grease and keep your makeup in place.A satin or shimmery finish works when you are wearing no shadow over your primer or plan to use a sparkly eyeshadow. Keep in mind these don't have quite the staying power as a matte primer, and that you shouldn't use a matte eyeshadow over a shimmery primer or it will look off.If you have very dry skin, try a gel-based primer or one that illuminates skin.Matte primers work with both matte and shimmery eyeshadows--they allow you to add all the shine using the makeup, not the primer.Matte primers are especially effective in hot and humid weather, because it will keep the grease and shine under control., Primers come in gel, cream, liquid, or stick form. The texture of your primer will influence how it feels on your lids and how long it will last. Gel primers usually last the longest and can be worn with all types of eyeshadow. They're great in hot weather and minimizing creasing.Cream primers have a mousse texture and are the easiest to find. They work with most eyeshadows and can feel a little heavier on your lids.
Liquid primers are very lightweight, but are prone to showing creases if applied too lightly. Make sure you thoroughly blend liquid primers into the creases of your eyelids when applying.Stick primers can be applied directly to your eyelid, instead of using your finger or a brush. They are very convenient for this reason, however it can be difficult to gauge how much primer you are applying., Aloe vera gel or unscented and unflavored Milk of Magnesia can substitute for primer in a pinch. Both will absorb excess oil, and the aloe can actually moisturize your eyelid as well. Just apply a tiny bit with a cotton swab, being careful not to get any in your eyes.Mix the following ingredients to make your own:


1/2 teaspoon unflavored chapstick, softened (run it under water for about 1 minute).
1 teaspoon cornstarch.
1 1/2 teaspoon liquid foundation that matches your skin.
Combine all the ingredients together in a small container.You can use a tiny bit of highly-refined petroleum jelly if you don't have the chapstick, but it won't have the staying power of the wax in the chapstick."

, Start by applying moisturizer, then primer which will help your makeup last all night without the worry of having to re-apply. Then follow with applying a shimmer free foundation with a sponge or brush which matches your skin tone, or, use your own favorite foundation, or even no foundation at all if you have lovely skin naturally. Tinted moisturizers sometimes include sun block, you can try these if you like. They look good on many people and can help protect your skin from UV light damage. You might not want to try any makeup you have never used before prior to a dinner date. You might not get it on just right first time, it's up to you though.

, Next, apply concealer under your eyes, around your lips and any other places where you need extra coverage, pimples, blemishes, scars or moles. Leave that beauty spot showing if you like and only hide your freckles if you want to. Blend the concealer with your ring finger as this will prevent you from poking your eye out with a brush. Next, set all your makeup so far with a translucent powder and a kabuki brush.

, You can choose a brow pencil which is a few shades darker than your hair shade. Fill in your brows using light feather strokes, and then blend out any harsh lines with a or brush, then just comb through your brows so that the brow hairs face all the same way.

, Taking a matte brown or taupe eyeshadow, find the hollows of your cheeks by making a fish face. Using a kabuki or blush brush, take the shadow and by starting at the top of your cheek bone, follow the brush down your face until you reach a small distance away from the lips. Then, blend any harsh lines and follow on the other cheek. Also contour down the sides of your nose bridge and blend to reduce shiny or oily feeling of your complexion. Next, apply a highlighter or matte white eyeshadow onto you nose bridge, under your eyes and onto your forehead, if you feel the need.

, You can keep it simple. Apply a matte brown or taupe shadow to your lids and blend into your crease. Then keep building up the smokey effect with a darker more hazy colored shadow. Line your eyelash and water line to brighten up your eyes. Finally, add white shadow to your inner corners to make your eyes look bigger, or, do what you prefer. Think about what will be flattering in candlelight if your dinner date will be a romantic candle lit affair. Beware the fluorescent lighting of the fast food chain restaurant too, fingers crossed for candlelight though!

, You can apply a thick mascara line to your upper and lower lashes after curling. Brown or black mascara may be your go to colors but grey can be nice if you want something a little different without heading into the out there territory of blue.

, Add some flushing pink blush to the apples of your cheeks. Be careful not to apply too much, you don't want to look like a clown. Cream blushers that are applied with the tips of your fingers can look nice too.

, You can apply a nude lipstick to finish your look or any other color you like. This is a dinner date though so think about how well your lipstick will stay in place when you eat and drink. Consider a lip stain product and a really shiny lip gloss might not be a great idea, especially if you might be doing a little kissing at the end of the date.

Cleanse your face and apply moisturizer.,
Dab a small amount of primer on the back of your hand--it should only be about the size of a grain of rice.,

Allow the primer to absorb and dry (about 20 seconds) and then do your eye makeup as normal.Your eyelid should feel like a flat canvass and your shadow should go on smoothly.,
Finished.








",How to Apply Eyelid Primer2," It is essential to always start with a clean face, removing any oil or dirt that may be on your skin. Moisturizer will keep the makeup from drying out your skin. Wait at least 20 seconds after applying moisturizer, or until your skin feels dry and not dewy.If the moisturizer is still wet it can interfere with the application of your primer.








, While you want the primer to cover your eyelid completely, too much primer can completely backfire. It can cause your makeup to pill, clump, appear chalky or shiny.Too little, and your eye makeup won't stay.


This amount of primer should be enough for both eyes.
It's always better to start with less product and build layers if you need to instead of starting with too much and trying to wipe it off. Remember: less is more when it comes to primer.

, You want to gently dab, pat, smooth, and blend (but not rub) the primer into your skin.You can start near the inner corner of your eye and spread out and up toward the brow bone and outer corner of your lid, or you can start at the center of your lid and blend outwards and upwards. Whatever works best for you.









A (clean) finger is a perfect tool for applying primer, and most of the time it's all you will need. You can easily control how much product you are applying, and the warmth from your fingertips can help you spread the primer.
A small makeup brush can really get into the little corners and edges by your tear duct and lash line and usually helps you get an even application.
Always be gentle and never pull on the skin around your eye, as this can lead to sagging and wrinkles later in life.
Really work the primer into the creases of your eyelid. The primer's job is to fill the fine lines in your skin so that your makeup doesn't settle into the creases.If you are applying makeup to your bottom lid, use a thin brush or your finger to gently dab it along your lower lash line.

, If it appears cakey or clumpy, you used too much primer and should use a little less next application.Try using the primer on your eyebrows to keep brow powder in place, too.,"

Find the perfect fragrance.",How to Make Bath Bombs Without Citric Acid," Once the ingredients are all mixed together, you'll need to work quickly. You don't want to be digging through your pantry to find a mold last minute.


Keep in mind that this recipe will make approximately one large, softball-sized bath bomb. If you would like to make a different amount, adjust the recipe while keeping the proportions the same. (For example, if you wanted to make two softball-sized bath bombs, you would start with 2 cups baking soda instead of 1.)
Try organizing your ingredients by grouping the wet ingredients separate from the dry ones.;
, Place the baking soda, cream of tartar, cornstarch, and salts into the bowl.









Avoid using plastic bowls and spoons, as plastic can soak up essential oils. This won't affect your bath bomb, but the plastic will probably smell like soap for a very long time.You have a few different choices of which salt you can use. One common frugal option is Epsom salts. You can also use sea salts, which are more expensive. In a pinch, you can even use table salt, but it must be non-iodized.Some hobbyists claim that cornstarch can cause yeast infections and leave it out of their recipes. However, studies have shown no correlation, and cornstarch continues to be a common ingredient in commercial bath bombs.If you don't want to use cornstarch, add an additional 1/4 cup baking soda and 1/4 cup salts. Keep in mind that cornstarch acts as a filler and slows down the fizzing reaction. Without it, a bath bomb will fizz much more vigorously but won't last as long., Take a metal whisk and use it to mix all the ingredients together well. If you don't have a whisk available you can improvise one with two forks or a set of chopsticks.








, Measure out the oils and food coloring into a second bowl. Whisk these ingredients together, but keep in mind that the food coloring and oil are unlikely to mix; the first ingredient in most food coloring is water.









Essential oils add fragrance to your bath bomb. Be careful when handling undiluted essential oils, as these can burn your skin.
The second oil is optional and acts as a moisturizer. Sweet almond oil, coconut oil, and olive oil all work well., Gently spoon the wet ingredients into the first bowl and mix well before adding more. Mix well as you go. If the mixture starts to foam, you may be adding the ingredients too quickly.








To keep from staining your hands, you may want to wear gloves. The best way to mix the ingredients at this stage is to knead them by hand., You will probably need to add some water to your bath bomb to blend the ingredients well. The exact amount of extra moisture you'll need will vary, so it's best to add it little by little as you work. In general, you'll need less than a tablespoon. Spray in some water whenever you have difficulty working the mixture.


You should end up with a mixture that is crumbly but holds its shape when squeezed together., Pack the mixture in as tightly as you can. Pat it down to make a smooth and even surface.









If you're using the popular Christmas decoration option, overfill each half of the ball. Press the two together lightly., Allow your bath bomb to dry for at least a few hours and ideally overnight.


If you try to remove it prematurely, it is more likely to fall apart.Rinse all metal tools carefully. Epsom salt can corrode metal over time., Once it's out of the mold, the bath bomb is ready for use. Simply fill up your bath tub with warm water, drop in your bomb, and relax.









It's best to use a bath bomb within a few weeks. Older bath bombs lose their effervescence., Almost anything can be used as a mold, but plastic and glass items work best. You can pick something big enough to hold a few cups for one big bath bomb or use smaller molds for little bath bombs.


Plastics can soak up undiluted essential oil, but this is less likely to happen after you've mixed everything together.
The most popular ""mold"" is a spherical plastic Christmas ornament. Look for the two-part, snap-together type of ornament commonly sold at craft stores. It will make the round, softball-sized shape often seen in commercial bath bombs.
Chocolate molds come in many cute shapes that are perfect for making bath bombs.
Tart and cupcake tins also work well., You don't have to use dyes right out of the box. Try mixing them together to create you favorite colors.


A bath bomb that looks pretty when you make it may not necessarily make the best-looking bath.
Keep a record of which combinations you've tried and which work out best.
Make sure to always use dyes that are non-toxic, non-staining, and water soluble.

, Get creative with your bath bomb's scent. Blend different oils together to create your own unique aroma.


If you don't know where to start, you can look up essential oil ""recipes"" online for suggestions. You don't have to look specifically for bath bomb-making blends. Information for soap making and aromatherapy will also apply to bath bombs.
Some popular combinations include: 4 parts spearmint to 1 part patchouli, 2 parts orange to one part vanilla, 1 part patchouli to 1 part cedarwood to 2 parts bergamot, equal parts lavender and peppermint,and 1 part peppermint to 1 part tea tree to 2 parts lavender.You can bottle and store larger amounts of your favorite blends for later use.
Be careful when handling undiluted essential oils. Some can burn or irritate your skin."

, Take the avocado skins that you just separated and stack them on top of each other. Then place the stack of avocado skins in an orange press.An orange press is designed to juice oranges and other citrus fruits, but it also does a good job of pressing the oil out of avocado skins.

, Pull down the lever of the orange press until the mallet of the press touches the avocado skins. Then pull down on the lever with as much force as you can. The mallet will press the avocado skins together and squeeze out the oil.The avocado oil should fall into the reservoir under the press.

Make sure to leave enough room so that when you get in, the bath doesn't spill over!Rest in the milk for 15-20 minutes. If you do this every day for a week, your skin will be brighter and more radiant. If Cleopatra did it, it's gotta be good, right?
Always wash off after! You want naturally glowing skin, not skin that's glowing with a milky residue.;
, You can mix a couple of tablespoons of milk with a tablespoon or two of honey, lemon juice, baking soda, or all three. Break open a vitamin E tablet for additional purifying power. Your skin needs them as much as your body does!


Apply it to your face (or whatever area you choose) and let it stiffen -- this should take about 10 to 15 minutes. Then rinse off with warm water. Your skin should feel smoothed and refreshed.

, To get rid of that top layer of skin and expose a brand new you, use milk to exfoliate. Take 1 cup of milk and 3 tablespoons of oatmeal and apply it to your skin, gently rubbing it in. The oats provide the grittiness while the milk provides the nourishment.


Allow it time to dry. Then rinse it off with warm water, scrubbing gently. If you'd like to make this in advance, make it with powdered milk and store in your refrigerator.
Or you can soak 1/2 cup of almonds in milk overnight. Then in the morning, grind 'er up into a paste and apply to your skin, following the same drying and washing routine.

, Just as lemon juice is said to lighten skin, the lactic acid in milk is said to work in a similar manner.If you have dark patches on your skin, take a cotton ball, soak it in milk, and apply it to the desired area. Allow it to dry overnight and then wash it off in the morning.

, If you're not crazy on the idea of soaking your face in a layer of milk overnight, just use it as a toner. Apply milk to your face with a saturated cotton ball, leave it on for at least 15 minutes, and rinse well. With repeated use, it can bring out your skin's natural glow.


Some say that milk lightens the skin. While it may or may not, keep this in mind if you choose to use milk to tone your skin. Overuse may have results you weren't looking for.

, It isn't just milk that can do your skin good -- it's all those dairy products, too. If you're looking to shrink your pores, get sour -- with sour cream or buttermilk. All you need do is apply a thin layer to your skin and let it soak in for 15 to 20 minutes. Rinse it off with warm water and rinse it well -- you don't want to be smelling like a sourpuss in the morning!

, It's the first thing many of us go to when we think of milk, but there are so many varieties out there. Full fat cow's milk is great, but goat's milk is super good too -- in fact, goat's milk has a pH level that's close to our skin's natural level, so our skin takes to it very well. And for you animal activists, the good news is that rice, soy, and almond work similarly!


But don't forget powdered milk! It's easy to store and doesn't go bad nearly as fast. 5 tablespoons or so in any concoction will get the job done.

, Just for the record, if you're using milk, don't scrimp on the fat. The thicker and creamier it is, the better. It hydrates your skin even more, moisturizing it with the vitamins and proteins from the fat.For this reason, whole fat goat's or cow's milk is probably best (though others can work in a pinch).


This goes for yogurt and other dairy products, too (buttermilk, sour cream, etc.). You can totally substitute these for milk if you're out -- or saving it for your bowl of cereal come morning.

, Milk baths and the like are so popular that many beauty companies have caught on -- you can actually buy pre-mixed milk bath powders that make the process even easier. They're a bit more expensive though and can't be drank if you're thirsty!

, That milk bath can be made even more enjoyable if you add a little extra something to it. Namely, herbs, dried petals, salts, or essential oils. We're getting aromatic up in here, folks. It's not just good for your skin -- it's pleasing to your nostrils and uber-relaxing to boot!


Bath salts can help exfoliate while dried petals, herbs, and oils are just plain soothing and relaxing. There are dozens and dozens of options out there, so take a trip to your local scent shop and try a few out for scent.

Understand how makeup works and what trends exist in makeup.,
Experiment at home.,
Consider which area of cosmetics you want to concentrate on.,
Learn marketing skills.,
Think of a name.,
Consider whether you wish to start from home or lease premises.,
Talk to financial and legal advisers when setting up the business.,
Sell your cosmetic line in as many ways as possible.,
Have key selling points clearly in your mind.",How to Start Your Own Cosmetics Line," If you really want to go into business selling cosmetics, you must be fully versed in the details of why and how makeup works. This goes well beyond just putting it onto your own face––it means truly understanding the chemistry behind makeup products, the methods for making the most of facial features and the ways in which cosmetics can be used to remedy specific problems, from dandruff to skin breakouts. Some methods for improving your deep knowledge include:


Getting a college diploma in Cosmetology
Reading the biographies of people who have started some of the most famous cosmetic lines, such as Helena Rubenstein, Estée Lauder and so forth
Getting a basic background in chemistry, perhaps even doing coursework in chemistry
Learning about alternative ingredient options (the greening of makeup is now big business)
Spending time learning which ingredients go into different types of cosmetics, such as lipstick, foundation, etc.;
, Borrow and buy books on making your own cosmetics. This hands-on experimenting, coupled with the knowledge you are gaining, will help you to get a good feel for how ingredients work together and for the ability of these products to deliver the things you hope they will, from softer skin to brighter hair.


There are many good books on making cosmetics available in libraries and book stores. There are also lots of online suggestions but be careful about these; check that they are safe and don't automatically believe that they will achieve the end results you're after––you'll need to test that aspect for yourself.
Ask friends if they would like to try your products.

, The term ""cosmetics"" covers a broad range of products, including hair, skin and facial products. It even covers toothpaste and deodorant, so it's a good idea to know which area you want to concentrate on initially. Your business will be more successful if you narrow it down at the beginning. For example, Poppy's Lipsticks are famous worldwide, quite probably because she didn't also try to have Poppy's Eyeshadow, Poppy's Shampoo and Poppy's Skin Bedazzler all at the same time... Concentrate on the area that interests you most, that you know you will be good at and that you know the market can handle at this point in time.


As your business gets off the ground and feels more robust, you can add new lines to your existing line. Until then, concentrate on being the best in one line. Perfect it, build your name and use that to gain the respect needed to launch more ideas.

, Cosmetics is a field already full of people vying their products. What sets most successful cosmetics apart from the rest is the marketing––from packaging to promises of ever-lasting youth, you'll need to find the right hooks to draw in your future customers. And ask yourself the tough questions:


What is so special or different about your product over others?
Why should a customer try your line and forgo using another line they already enjoy using?
What sort of packaging will create a recognizable brand for you that has wow factor, trustworthiness and reliability all rolled into one?
What special ingredient or factor are you focusing on? Many products choose something that they sell as their special niche, such as ""organic"", ""natural"", ""rose infused"", ""macadamia nut softening"", or whatever! And do you have scientific facts to back up your claims that your product will do what you're promising?

, This is going to be a very important part of your business and defines the line as well as the business. In some cases, you may consider your own name to be sufficient. In others, you might like a boring company name, like Backroom Industries Inc., to cover all the administrative things, and have an exciting line name, such as Blackhole Galaxy Facial Powder.

, Leasing premises can be expensive at the start. One option can be to rent space in an industrial kitchen or a laboratory to test and make your products, then have these stored somewhere safe and dry before shipping to the sales locations. If you do want to rent premises, keep the overheads low and don't try to move into an area that is expensive––start at the lower end and change to more expensive premises when you can afford more.

, They will need to cover aspects such as insurance, patents and trademarks, meeting safety standards for the production of cosmetics (you need to know these rules too) and other such things as leases, safe storage of the goods and employment contracts/salaries for staff.


Register your cosmetics business once you've sorted out the finer details.

, This includes visiting department stores directly to ask them to stock your cosmetics, selling online in your own shop and through auction or consignment stores and even through parties at which you demonstrate the cosmetics.

, Have about five major reasons ready to tell people as to why your cosmetics line is amazing and worth trying. Be honest and have a background story as to why you started this business.


For example, you might tell people that your lipstick is brighter than other lipsticks because you've included the glowing aura of the Ophelia flower picked at the stroke of midnight. You got the idea when hiking the backwoods of Opfiala county one summer three years ago, during a time in your life when you despaired of ever finding a lipstick that worked at night... and so on, you get the drift!

, Every single time that you make a new preparation, be sure to thoroughly wash and dry the equipment that is being used.


It is preferable to keep equipment used for the preparation of handmade cosmetics for this purpose alone, rather than sharing the equipment with other household tasks such as cooking or cleaning.

, Without fail, storage containers should be sterilized in whatever manner is appropriate for the type of container.


This includes lids, stoppers, and any other attachments used with the container.
Glass containers are the easiest to sterilize. See wikiHow's article on how to sterilize glass jars for cosmetic products.
Ensure that the storage container is thoroughly dry prior to use unless the instructions say otherwise.
If you reuse makeup or cosmetics container, wash, dry and re-sterilize them thoroughly.

, The natural ingredients can easily react with the metal or non-stick ingredients.


Stainless steel or enamel are usually suitable for heating, boiling, or steeping plant-based concoctions.
Ceramic and glass are usually ideal for storage, heating (heatproof versions), or steeping plant-based concoctions.
Always use wooden spoons for stirring. These will not react with any of the ingredients.

, Labels are vital because they inform you quickly of the contents of the container, the date of production, and any other information you considered essential to provide. Without labels, it is impossible to remember when a homemade cosmetic was made or whether or not it contains ingredients unsuitable for some people.


Don't rely on your memory. It will fail you!
Keep a list of exact ingredients, especially where the ingredients might cause allergies or should not be used by people with certain medical conditions, or where it is not suitable for pregnant women, breastfeeding mothers, or children.

, Substituting ingredients can change the entire composition of a cosmetic and it won't necessarily be ideal. Follow the advice of the instructions, and only if you are confident that you know enough to deviate, allow yourself to do so.


If using herbs or flowers, fresh versions are usually preferable over the dried versions. Always get recently dried herbs or flowers if you intend on using them instead.

Remember that being comfortable doesn’t mean dressing like you just rolled out of bed. At the same time, remember that being chic doesn’t mean chasing every trend: never wear something that doesn’t suit your body just because it’s in style.


Be stylish and learn how to dress for your body type as a woman or as a man. Choose colors and cuts that make you appear thinner.
Always dress for the occasion. Going to a movie? Be casual; you'll just look like you're trying too hard in your prom dress. And the same is said for going out on the town – leave your Converse at home and take a moment to dress to impress.;
, Do you want to be a professional? Business casual? A skater? This will make it easier to determine your priorities. However, make sure you're not mimicking a friend's style –often times it won't work for you due to different body sizes and shapes.


Don't be afraid to look silly. Looking good and having a designer's eye can be learned skills but they often come from trial and error. If you get complimented or if you feel good, you're on the right track.

, Poorly-applied makeup will make you look worse, not better. If you have a tendency to over-apply, experiment with wearing natural-looking makeup. To accentuate your eyes, you should also learn how to properly shape your eyebrows.


Less is more. With make-up the minimalist look will almost always set you up as appearing more good looking than if you go out in 3 miles (4.8 km) of foundation and a bus full of mascara.
Sometimes make-up can take care of facial hair, sometimes it can't. If you have dark hairs that you want covered, consider getting them waxed off, using a depilatory cream, or plucking them.

, Choose something that will flatter your face shape. Don’t keep your hair long if you’ve outgrown the look; you might be reluctant to cut those hard-earned tresses, but you’ll be amazed by how chic and revitalized you look with a shorter ‘do.


And if you don’t believe in the power of a bad haircut, just do a quick Google search for your favorite celebrities. They often easily go from a smokin' 10 to the bottom of the barrel for a role – and sometimes just with a haircut.

, Not only does drinking water help you lose weight, but it helps your skin clear and glow, too. Aim for 2–3 liters (0.5–0.8 US gal) a day (some of it can be consumed in food). The bigger you are, the more water you should drink.


Try to stay away from drinks that dehydrate you, like coffee and sodas. They're just sugary, empty calories anyway. Water is your best bet for being beautiful.

, One of the easiest ways to be good looking is by keeping up with your physical maintenance. These details make a big difference; after all, who wants to be around someone who can’t even take care of themselves? Focus on:



Cleanliness: shower daily, wash hands regularly

Scent: wear deodorant; apply a light cologne or perfume, if you wish

Skin: wear sunblock; apply lotion daily to keep your skin soft; if you have acne, try to keep it under control

Hair: keep it neat and clean; if you have unwanted body hair, consider shaving or waxing it

, Keep your nails looking good by keeping them trimmed and clean; if you have long fingernails, keep them painted and shaped. Often it's the little things that really stand out.



For the rest of your hands, apply lotion after every time you wash your hands to keep them soft and smooth.

Feet are important, too. Apply lotion after taking a shower; keep them clean, and be conscious of foot odor.

, Brush at least two times a day, especially after coffee or smoking. No one likes being around a person with bad breath. Flossing is important, too – did you know that it can lessen your chances at heart disease as well as leave your breath minty fresh?What's more, visit the dentist regularly to make sure you don't have any cavities and whiten your teeth if necessary. You can get whiter teeth at home or with the help of your dentist.

, People who look healthy look good. And what better way to look healthy than to be healthy? If you aren't taking good care of your body, now is a good time to start. Begin with the basics: drink more water, eat healthy, and get fit.



Sleep well every night. You know the phrase ""beauty sleep?"" That exists for a reason. If you get 8 hours, you'll look better.

Quit smoking and, if you’re addicted, stop drinking as well. Both of these habits add years to your skin, bones, tooth enamel, hair, and organs.

, Interval training is an excellent way to quickly burn fat and improve your cardiovascular health. If you’re shy about going to the gym, working out at home is a discrete (not to mention cost-effective) way to sculpt your body, too. What it boils down to you is that you need a regimen you'll stick with. If it's walking after dinner, great. If it's biking through town, great. As long as you do it, great.


Taking care of your body by exercising is essential for looking good. Exercising has innumerable benefits for you, inside and out. But, to focus on aesthetics, exercising improves your muscle tone so that you have better posture, stand taller, and move more confidently. Exercising also improves the circulation to your muscles and skin. This will give you a healthy and radiant glow.

, Self-esteem can give you an incredible makeover. To start, improve your posture to project confidence – a sullen sloucher never looks sexy, regardless of how genetically blessed you may be. While you’re at it, learn how to connect with people through body language so that you look more approachable, too. Confidence is the ultimate sex appeal.


For good posture, throw your shoulders back and your chin up. Keep your eyes straight ahead of you, not on the ground.
For approachable body language, keep your arms uncrossed and head up, not buried in your phone.

, Everyone has something beautiful about them – eyes, smile, hair, and especially personality. Always look groomed by taking time to look your best, but don't think of your best as a comparison to someone else.


Being beautiful doesn't mean every waking hour having a kabuki make up face or always wearing designer clothes. It means being you.
Whatever your best asset is, make that your focal point. Maybe you don't have the body of Barbie or Ken, but no one does. Your body works and gets you around, and that's what's important.

, Develop good character to match your good looks. Be humble and honest. Give people more to appreciate. Have you ever met someone you thought was okay looking, gotten to know them, and found out they were a true babe? It's not all about looks – it's about what's on the inside, too.


It works the other way as well – have you ever spotted someone from across the room, marveled at their good looks, and then they opened their mouth? Whoops, they shouldn't have done that. A person can go from hot to not in a matter of seconds with their attitude.

, Human beings gravitate toward what is rare and unique. You're an individual – there's no one in the world like you – and you should take advantage of that. There's a lot of pressure to look like others, but no one remembers a clone. Be yourself and flaunt it.


Emphasize the things that make you unique, whether it's your hair, your height, your shape, your eyes, and so on. Make your appearance reflect your unique personality. This is how you'll stand out.

, Walking around with a constant frown is like wearing a ""Keep Away"" sign. Even a little smile will brighten your face, making you look friendlier and, thus, more attractive. What could be more inviting and approachable?


A genuine, beautiful smile is the answer. Beauty doesn't come from your looks – it comes straight from your facial expressions and body language. Be graceful and happy, but don't look too fake. Otherwise people will assume that you're trying too much.

Think about perfumes.",How to Have an Alluring Scent," Without basic hygiene you can't expect to smell alluring, or even the slightest bit sweet. Start with a clean, fresh base daily so you have something to work with. Shower daily, brush your teeth two times a day, apply deodorant when required, clean your hands and wash your hair on a regular basis. Basically, just follow the typical hygiene rules, easy as pie.;
, These products may include hair shampoo and conditioner, body wash, soap, moisturizer or body butter. Body butter is a great moisturizer and will leave your skin soft with a sweet scent. When using scented products, try to use products with similar scents so the smell is more distinct. A mixture of too many different smells may lead to a confusing aroma or something rather bland.

, Your hair has a smell of it's own, you may not realize it because the scent is always there, but you can be sure that your hair does have a unique scent, whether you can smell it or not. This is why regular hair washing is important; oily hair does not look or smell attractive. Use some sweetly scented hair products or spray a gentle amount of body spray into your hair, when the wind blows those lovely locks of yours, your peers will get a whiff of that alluring scent. Experiment with many hair products to find the one that works best for you. Also, remember that it's not only shampoo and conditioner that supply a nice scent for hair, but also leave in conditioners, hair spray and more.

, It doesn't occur to most people how much the smell of their clothes affects their over-all scent. So be sure to recognize the importance of this. Recognize the fact that if your clothes smell bad, then odds are that you will not smell too pleasant either, even if you are wearing perfume. Lucky for us, a vast variety of lovely smelling clothes detergents and powders have been created, some scents include Lavender, Sunshine and Rose. Consider investing in clothes detergents/powders with sweet, synthetic scents, you will find yourself pleasantly surprised and everyone will be wanted a whiff of you.

, There are so many different perfumes to chose from, so which one of them is the most alluring of all? With such a variety it can be incredibly hard to chose a favorite. When shopping for perfume, try to go for something that will suit your personality. For example, if you are a sweet person try a floral scented perfume. If you are aiming for a touch of mystery, try something with musky undertones. Even more confused? Well, they all have their own unique properties which makes them alluring, so consider which one is best for you by reading the following.


Urban scents: The urban scent is one that is 'earthy'. Earthy scents include musk, sandalwood and amber. This type of scent gives the impression of tranquility and peace, use it to draw people into you with the relaxing vibe it emanates.
Floral scents: When it comes to a floral scent, you don't want to go over-board. Keep away from florals that seem overpowering or synthetic. Go for a delicate, dainty natural scents such as the scent of a rose, a jasmine flower or a lily. These create the aura of femininity and will draw people toward you.
Citrus scents: These scents give of a unique, bubbly vibe. Some scents include orange, lemon, mandarin and sunshine. These scents draw people in with the offer of an exciting personality and a fun time.
Fresh scents: If your wish is to be subtle, then try a fresh scent. This could mean going without perfume and letting the scented products do their thing, or you could go for scents such as green tea, peach, coconut or kiwi.

Department stores are always the safest way to buy perfume, as you have the advantage of being able to closely examine the bottle in its packaging and talking to the retail staff. This allows you to approach the staff if it’s possibly a fake, and you are able to return the perfume if it’s not authentic.
Be very cautious at flea markets or swap meets where sellers can easily rip you off without recourse. Always carefully inspect the perfume before you purchase it, and if at all possible get the vendor’s contact information in case it turns out to be unsatisfactory.
Feel free to ask the buyer very direct questions based on the information explained here. For example, ""Can you please tell me the batch number?"" and ""Can you put up a photo of the text on the back of the box?"", etc.
When buying online through eBay or Amazon it’s important to check for product and online seller reviews. Make sure the seller is PayPal verified as this means they had to disclose their contact information. Check to see if they have a return policy, and demand one if they don’t. Pay attention to whether the listing is written with proper grammar and spelling. ;
, Although this isn't always indicative of the quality of the perfume, if it's really cheap for the ""brand"" it claims to be, then it's likely to be too good to be true and it isn't the real perfume. There may be exceptions, such as a stock clearance where a store is closing down, but on the whole, the price provides a good indication of authenticity., Check the manufacturer’s website to see if they have provided sufficient information on the packaging, bottle and the placement of the bar code. You might want to visit mall stalls to see how the bottle and cellophane wraps look on the authentic perfumes to get a good idea of what to expect.

, Legitimate perfumes typically have cellophane tightly wrapped around the boxes. See if the cellophane is loosely or poorly wrapped, to the point where it is moving around the box. Improperly wrapped cellophane is a telltale sign of counterfeit perfumes. , You can often discern the authenticity of a perfume merely by inspecting the right parts of the box. Before opening your perfume, carefully examine the box for any signs of unprofessional packaging and design.


Examine the text on the back of the packaging. Check for grammatical errors, misspellings, poorly laid out information, etc. Real packaging for a real perfume should ideally be grammatically correct. Spelling or grammar mistakes can indicate the mark of a counterfeit. Real packaging is made from high quality paperboard. Boxes made from thin, flimsy material are often counterfeit.
Look for the barcode on the packaging. The barcode must be placed on the lowest back portion and not on the sides.
Check to see if there is any excess glue or tape. Real perfume shouldn’t have any messy glue residue or extra tape inside or outside the container.

, Authentic perfume will have all of these numbers on the packaging, which can then be used to independently verify its authenticity. Consult the manufacturer to see whether the numbers match with their production numbering. , Real perfumes have smooth bottle containers while imitation bottles are often a bit rough and are usually poorly made, sometimes constructed with plastic. Quality perfume bottles have tight fitting caps that are spill-proof. Be aware that designer perfume labels treat the bottle as part of the perfume experience, so the bottle should be of a superior quality

, The scent of authentic perfumes is complex and intricately constructed. While smell can be a difficulty measure of authenticity, those who know the perfume's scent can often sniff out a counterfeit., Authentic perfumes will have three layers of scents that reveal themselves over time, consisting of top, middle and base notes. This complexity ensures that the scent is varied and multidimensional, allowing the scent to change from the initial application until complete skin absorption. Fake perfumes will have one dimensional fragrance layer and it will often have an ""off"" smell after only a short time of wearing it.

, Authentic perfumes have had a lot of work put into creating the different notes in the perfume. They will use a mixture of scents derived from natural products and synthetic products. Cheap perfumes tend to be completely synthetic and therefore lack the complexity of layered perfumes created with natural ingredients.

, An imitation perfume will initially smell similar but you will usually find that the authentic perfumes outlast their imitators in terms of longevity and effectiveness, which makes them better value in the long run. Opened bottles of authentic perfumes should retain their scents from six to 18 months. Citrus-based scents generally deteriorate around the six month mark, whereas floral-based scents should maintain until 18 months. Cheap opened bottles of perfume will lose their scents in a matter of weeks or a couple months.

, When researching the perfume you’re about to purchase, it’s important to know whether it’s supposed to have a ‘single note,’ or a complex scent. Single note perfumes contain only the top notes, so a lack of middle and base notes doesn’t always indicate a counterfeit. When checking the authenticity of a single note perfume, pay attention to whether the scent smells strange and if the scent matches up with the description listed on the manufacturer’s website. , You should only test out the perfume once you’ve examined the packaging and analyzed the scent beforehand. Be cautious because counterfeit perfumes can often cause allergic reactions, or leave unwanted rashes on your skin. Once you’ve thoroughly checked every aspect of the perfume, apply it on your skin and pay attention to the way it smells throughout the day. If it’s an authentic complex perfume, then you should notice the tapering of the top notes throughout the day while the middle and base notes reveal themselves. A counterfeit perfume will often only keep its top scent for a few hours at the most.

When do I wear what?,
What do I wear when?,
So, how do I apply this stuff?,
So.. what about deodorant?,
Where do I get this stuff?",How to Choose and Wear Cologne," There are three categories that break this answer down. They are age, event and season. Age is not a huge factor to take into consideration, but it is one. Some people, however, are under the presumption that, say, a 23 year old's nose cannot appreciate a high class cologne. This is bunk. The caveat, however, is that wearing a $200 bottle of a cologne is fairly useless in a high school setting. Season is a pretty logical one, actually. Wearing a strong, musky woods scent can be overpowering in hot, summer weather and scents consisting of marine or aqua notes are too weak in a cold winter.;
, This is not a question that can be easily answered, so I will divide it into situations and explain a good scent to wear.


15 year old in high school. If you're in high school, chances are the most formal thing you're going to is the school dance. A decent cologne for the age group would be Reaction by Kenneth Cole. It smells good for a Kenneth Cole, is relatively cheap, common and projects well. It smells like melon and apple at the top, and sandalwood at the base. Good workhorse. Alternatively, there's Paul Smith for Men, which basically smells like nice cut grass. It's a light everyday scent, exactly what you need.
First day at your new big office job. You're going to need to make a good impression on your new boss and colleagues. A good choice is Caron's The Third Man, consisting of lavender and spices that never gets offensive. This is a warm and confident cologne and will develop great over the day.
Clubbing. My favorite club scent is A*men. It consists entirely of chocolate and vanilla.. with more chocolate.. and more chocolate.. It endures hours of sweaty dancing and has great projection. Plus, women love it.
Formal dinner. Himalaya by Creed works wonders here. It smells like cool winter air mixed with woods. This scent is pricey and does not last longer than a few hours but it's worth it. People, this is what money smells like.
Please help me I need a woman. Envy by Gucci is a great cologne for attracting women. This is not an everyday scent, but the opposite gender reacts well to it. Woods, spices, tobacco and incense make this a good choice.
Normal, everyday use. DKNY Be Delicious is a good choice for casual wear. It's sweet and light so it'll work in the summer and it has enough spices to work in the fall. It is also relatively easy to find.
A light summer scent. Dolce and Gabbana Light Blue for him is a new and fresh cologne which is great for teenagers and even some kids since it has a great light scent that doesn't have the extreme strength of the original cologne, Dolce and Gabbana, light blue is good for spring and summer, the original cologne is good for autumn and winter and it has a more stronger and adult scent, but light blue can be worn by more age groups.

, Cologne reacts to body heat, so the best places to apply are on the wrists and around the chest/neck. My routine is to apply one spray to the left wrist and one spray on the right wrist. Then, I spray once or twice on the chest. Some people like to put some on the back of the neck to create a scent trail or on the backs of the ears, and don't rub the cologne in it breaks down the molecules and doesn't last as long as it should. In any case, use discretion. You don't need to let everyone know you're coming.

, Unscented deodorant will be your best bet from now on. I swear by Mitchum. A definite no-no is using any deodorant with stupid smells like ""Ocean Wave"" or ""Jazz Fusion"" or whatever.

, There are lots of eBay retailers that are reputable (remember to check feedback), and that's probably where the best deals will be found. For real world stores, try Neiman Marcus, Sephora or any department store like Macy's.

Order from perfume retailers.,
Sign up with the perfume company.,
Contact customer service directly.,
Sign up for free sample websites.",How to Get Free Perfume Samples1," Many online perfume retailers offer free samples when you purchase from their store. Choose a perfume and place it in your online cart. As you checkout, you will be prompted to choose free samples. Some retailers will offer only perfume and cologne samples. Other retailers will offer samples of perfume and other beauty products. Choose the samples you want and they will be automatically added to your cart.


Some places require you to spend a certain amount to be eligible for free samples. For other stores, you must buy something from the beauty department. For example, you couldn't buy a dress and qualify for free perfume samples.
Online retailers that offer free perfume samples include Sephora, Macy's, Ulta, and Nordstrom.;
, Many perfume manufacturers will send e-mail offers for free samples of new and upcoming scents to people on their mailing list. Decide which perfume companies you like and want to receive samples from, and then sign up for their mailing lists.


Make sure to look for offers when you know new perfumes are coming out.
This can be time consuming and may yield little rewards. Many companies will have limited amounts of samples, so you have to make sure you check at the right times.
Get a separate e-mail address for this. That keeps spam from your regular e-mail.
Some companies you may want to sign up with are Hermes, Burberry, Calvin Klein, Marc Jacobs, Ralph Lauren, and Dolce and Gabana. Browse perfume catalogs and the perfume counter to get ideas for companies to sign up with., Instead of waiting for a new fragrance to come out, try to get a sample now. Write the perfume manufacturer's customer service and ask them for free samples.


Make sure to be polite. Don't be offended or upset when they say no. Some companies will send you a sample; others will not., There are websites that collect free online offers, like free samples. They find them through the manufacturer's websites, Facebook, and other offers. They will send e-mails with daily or weekly offers, or post them on their website.


Use an alternate e-mail address. Don't use your primary address. You don't want to end up with a lot of spam.
Don't give out your credit card information. These sites should send you to free samples, not places where you have to buy things. The same goes for shipping costs. Also don't get tricked into buying products for the samples through these websites.

Visit the perfume counter.,
Ask for samples from retailers.,
Participate in a sample swap.",How to Get Free Perfume Samples2," Most stores that sell perfume have open bottles on the counter for customers to try. While you can't take these bottles home, you can spritz some of the fragrance on a piece of cardboard to sample the fragrance.


If you want to try a new perfume before buying, spray some from the sample bottle on yourself. Spritz it on your wrist or behind your ears. Allow it to dry and see how it smells on your body. Go into a store to spray some sample perfume on yourself before a big date.
Carry empty glass vials around with you and ask the retailers if you can make your own samples. Higher end stores, like Bergdorf Goodman, Saks, Neiman Marcus, and Bloomingdales, let people make small samples of their perfumes.Be prepared to be told no, however.

, Many retailers have perfume samples on hand that they give away to customers. Some large department stores with perfume counters will have perfume samples attached to cardboard cards lying on the counter next to the products. Other retailers will supply the samples when asked.


Browse around the perfume sections of stores. Keep an eye out for free samples. If you don't see any, find a sales representative and ask if they have any samples.
Some of these samples are dependent on whether the store has run out and if the manufacturer has sent them out.
Try Sephora and Nordstrom, who commonly have perfume samples. Other retailers that may provide samples are Bloomingdales and Neiman Marcus., Swapping is a way to get rid of the samples you don't like and get something you want to try in return. You also can share some of the perfume you own with someone who has the scent you just have to have. Basically, you send samples to people and people send you samples in return.


Swapping can be a great way to obtain samples, but also comes with some cons. People don't always consider the same things as fair trades. You can get old samples. The sample might not be what you thought. In rare cases, you can get cheated. However, most of the online swapping forums have terms of service and review systems that help try to make it a safe, fun environment for everyone. Just use caution.Try the forums at Basenotes. They have an ""items for sale"" and ""items for swap"" section. Other perfume exchanges include Reddit's perfume and cologne exchange and Perfume Posse's Swapmania.

, Ralph Lauren Polo is sweet smelling but has a bit to it at the end of the spray. It's great for going out to dinner or a walk around town. Because of the luxury, it's pretty expensive.

, Ferrari Black is a great example because it's a scent for all ages, including teenagers. It's also great for outings to the movies, but not clubbing since it doesn't work well with sweat.

, Try Nautica Blue for its light, clean smell. It's also very inexpensive and a good buy for the cologne.

, Jake is a brand mainly targeted towards teenagers and young adults because of its tropical smell (with a hint of sandalwood).

Consider purchasing a sampler set.",How to Choose a Perfume," Perfume is a luxury item and its cost can vary hugely between products. Some perfumes are under 20 dollars while others cost hundreds or even thousands of dollars. Before you go shopping, decide how much money you want to spend on a perfume.


If the perfume is a gift, consider both your personal finances and your relationship with the recipient of the gift. If you are giving perfume to your wife, you may want to spend more than you would on perfume for an acquaintance you don’t know very well.;
, Perfumes have different names depending on their lasting power. Typically, the most expensive perfumes are the ones that last longest, while cheaper perfumes don’t have as much staying power. You can usually see the type or concentration of the perfume under its name on the front of the bottle.Eau de cologne has the lowest fragrance concentration, lasting about two hours. It is 3-5% oil in a mixture of water and alcohol.
Eau de toilette is a slightly more concentrated type of perfume and will last three to four hours. It is a about 4-8% oil.
Eau de parfum has a higher oil concentration than eau de cologne and lasts around six hours. It is 15-18% oil mixed with alcohol.
The perfume with the highest concentration is simply called perfume or parfum. It has great staying power and will last all day. It is 15-30 oil mixed with alcohol.

, Consider which scents you or the perfume recipient enjoy. Perfumes generally are separated into four scent categories, though many perfumes contain a subtle mix of scents. If you are buying perfume for someone else, see what kinds of perfumes they use. If you have no idea what kind of scents you like, don’t worry: you can figure out what scent family you prefer when you are trying perfumes in the store.Floral/Sweet perfumes smell like freshly-cut flowers. Common scents used in floral perfumes are rose, lavender, carnation and orange blossom. Floral perfumes are the most popular perfumes for women because of their sweet, feminine scent that most enjoy.
Citrus/Fruity perfumes smell like fruits, particularly citrus fruits. Common tones are citrus fruits like orange, grapefruit and lime, but also other fruit like apricot, apple or peach. In general these scents are bright and refreshing.
Oriental/Spicy perfumes smell musky and complex. Many of them contain tones of spices like star anise, cinnamon and vanilla.
Woody/Chypre perfumes smell woody and earthy. Many contain scents like bergamot, oakmoss and patchouli.

, Be conscious of the scents people around you are wearing, no matter if you're at work, on the train or in class. If you catch a whiff of something you really like, ask the wearer what kind of perfume it is. You never know, you could find your new scent without even stepping into a store.If you don’t like the scent of your friends’ perfumes, try to pinpoint what about them you don’t like. This is valuable information that will help you narrow down your options.

, Don’t try to pick the perfect scent in one shopping trip. The more scents you smell, the more your nose will get desensitized to the smell of the perfume, making it hard to try multiple perfumes. Because you’ll want to smell a range of scents to make your decision, try to space out your shopping trips over a few days., When you are shopping for your perfume, don’t wear any scented skin products like body lotion, body sprays or even strongly-scented deodorant. These scents can distract from and interfere with the scent of the perfume., Consider bringing along a friend to help you make your decision. Especially if the perfume is a gift, the input of another person who knows the recipient can be very useful. If you are picking out the perfume for yourself, consider whether inviting a friend would be helpful or if it would make your decision harder., Pick out the stores that you are visiting carefully. Makes sure that the stores are reputable with a knowledgeable staff, and that they provide personalized customer service. Also make sure that the stores you go to are within your price range.


Department stores like Macy’s have great customer service, though their products tend to be expensive.
Small boutiques may be pricey and have less variety, depending on the size, but their products and customer service should be high quality.
Try to shop at a store where perfume is one of the major products sold. If you go to a clothing store that also sells a few perfumes, there won’t be many options and their staff may not be as knowledgeable as the staff at specialty stores.

, By now you should already have a good idea of what scent you are looking for. Approach an available salesperson and ask if they can help you find the right perfume. They will be happy to help and their knowledge about the products will make the search much easier.


You can say something like, “I was wondering if you could help me pick out a perfume for myself. I’m looking for a semi-long lasting perfume with a clean, citrus-y smell. My price range is $70-120.”
If you have no idea what you like, ask the salesperson to let you smell one of the most popular perfumes from all four scent categories.
If you are giving the perfume as a gift and have no idea what the recipient likes, ask the salesperson to show you the most popular perfumes, especially floral scents since these are the most universally liked scent category., Don’t overload on fragrances. Limit yourself to trying six fragrances a trip at most. This will allow you to fully appreciate the complexities of each scent, and won’t overload your sense of smell. Because you have already narrowed down your options, you won’t have to waste your smells on perfumes that are wrong for you., When you are testing perfume, first take a whiff from the bottle. This will give you an indication of whether you like the perfume or not. If you end up not liking the smell at all, you will be glad that you didn’t spray it on yourself.Don’t inhale too heavily, as it may make your sense of smell dull even quicker.

, If you smell a perfume in the bottle and like the scent, spray a small amount of perfume onto a blotter sheet. Allow the scent to set on the sheet, about ten seconds, then smell it. If you still like the scent, label the sheet and put it into your purse or your bag. This way you can smell it later and remember which perfume it is., If you really like a perfume and think it could be the one, spray a small amount onto your wrist or the crook of your elbow. Give the scent about 10 seconds for the alcohol to dissolve, then gently inhale the perfume. The scent of a perfume changes slightly upon contact with your skin, so it’s important to test top contenders on your skin as well as from blotter sheets.Don’t apply more than one perfume on each arm, or the scents will start to mix.

, Between each scent, refresh your senses by smelling something neutral, like your skin or your shirt. The neutral scent will refresh your sense of smell so that the smell of the last perfume won’t linger and interfere with the next perfume you smell., If you try a perfume that you love, keep the blotter sheet you sprayed and also ask if it’s possible to get a sample of the perfume. Tell the salesperson that you are thinking of buying the perfume but want to sleep on the decision. Most major perfume carriers have samples of their products that they are happy to give away if they know that the customer is seriously interested., After you have visited all the perfume stores you planned to and have several choices, gather all the samples and blotting sheets. Use the same procedure as in the store to test each perfume. Keep narrowing down your options until you make your decision!

, If you can't seem to settle on just one scent, buy a sampler set from a store like Sephora or Ulta. Sampler sets contain sample or travel-sized bottles of multiple perfumes.You can test out each perfume over the course of a few weeks and eventually purchase a regular sized bottle of the one you like best. Some of the sets even come with a certificate for a full sized bottle.

The top notes are what you smell initially right when you get near the spray bottle. These are usually citrus, fruit, and herb smells. They often wear off very quickly, so it is important to check the bottom notes as well.The bottom notes are generally wood and natural smells. To find out if you like the bottom notes, spray a little of the perfume on the back of your wrist, wait 20 minutes and smell the perfume again.You can also filter your decision by going to an actual perfume store (like Bath and Body, or at a perfume counter at a department store) and ask for help.;
, If you are simply going out on the town, going to work, or visiting the beach, try a daytime fragrance. If you are planning a date, or going out to dinner, you might try a nighttime fragrance instead.


Look for labels on the packaging. They will usually say either ""daytime"" or nighttime."" If they do not say explicitly, you can usually tell by the color of the packages. Bright yellows, and oranges mean springtime, and are generally daytime fragrances. Dark blues, reds, and purples suggest a nighttime fragrance.Nighttime fragrances are generally sprayed on, or near the neck area. This is because they do not last as long, and you will want a more immediate impact. In that case, apply a little extra moisturizer to the area of choice to hold the fragrance better.Daytime fragrances are generally sprayed down by the hips or knees. This is because they rise as the day goes by, and last longer. Therefore, use some extra moisturizer near the area of choice in order for the fragrance to hold on better., Your skin absorbs perfume better after it is nice and warm. Make sure when you take your shower or bath that the water is hot, so that your pores can open.Use a body wash or soap that is unscented, or has very little scent. You do not want your perfume to clash with the smell.This is also a great time to moisturize your skin. Use a cream or oil so that your skin becomes more openly receptive to the perfume.
Washing your hair can also help out if you plan on using the perfume in your hair. Make sure to use conditioner so that your hair if soft, and receptive of the perfume.

, After you take a warm shower or bath, make sure your skin is dry. If you do not, when you spray the perfume on it will not stick. Specifically, get the hard to reach places like the back of your knees, your neckline, and your hair. These are what are called ""pulse points,"" or places where your perfume goes on, and acts at it's highest level., If you did not apply moisturizer during your shower, definitely do this after you dry off. The perfume has a much better chance to lock on to your skin if it is smooth and soft, rather than dry and rough.A lotion or body oil work best. Apply a small amount to your hands and rub it between them. Then take your hands and apply the lotion/oil to the rest of your skin.Another great option is petroleum jelly. The perfume will stick to the jelly molecules, rather than the pores, thereby keeping the fragrance alive longer. Apply small dabs and smooth them out on your skin.The key is to hit the ""pulse points."" These include, but are not limited to: feet, knees, elbows, collarbone, and neck. These places are where you will apply the perfume, and where the perfume will be most effective., Perfume sprayed directly onto clothes can cause water marks which look unseemly, particularly if you are going out to a nice dinner date. Perfume also works much better on ""pulse points"" rather than clothes, because the molecules interact with direct contact with skin., You will want to be at least 5-7 inches away from your chest/body. Point the nozzle in the direction of your body. If your skin gets to wet from the spray, you are holding it too closely., These points are places where blood vessels are close to the skin. There is extra heat at these points, and because heat rises into the air, your fragrance will more likely be smelled. Some of the most commonly used are collarbones, knees, and necklines., Rather than walking through a cloud of perfume mist, direct the spray exactly at the ""pulse points."" This will increase the effectiveness of the spray, and not cause you to lose so much of the smell., If your perfume is not a spray type, you can always use your hands to add the perfume onto a ""pulse point."" Simply shake a bit of perfume out onto your hand. Rub it between your hands. Gently apply to the skin, and rub gently in a small circle.

, Keep your clothes off until the area is dry. Try and wait at least ten minutes. Neat and natural oils change the scents of the perfume, so you do not want to rub the perfumed area.Rubbing your wrists together after you have perfumed them is a consistent idea perpetuated over and over again. However, rubbing your wrists together breaks down the molecules of the perfume, and dampens the smell., A little bit goes a long way when it comes to perfume. It is best to put on too little, than too much. You can always sneak a bottle in your purse, and apply some later if you feel it is not strong enough.

, Fragrances latch onto fibers, so your hair is a great place to smell good for long periods of time. The perfume also attaches to hair products, such as shampoo and conditioner, making the fragrance last even longer.


Simply mist the spray onto the comb/brush. You can also apply some perfume with your hand or a towel to the comb/brush. Run it gently through your hair. Make sure to get it all over, rather than just in a few spots.Make sure not to get too much in your hair, otherwise the alcohol in the perfume will dry your hair out.

, Veins are very close to your skin in this ""pulse point."" Put a small amount of perfume on the edge of your fingertips, and dab it behind your ears. Placing perfume behind your ears gets immediate effects and it best for nighttime perfumes., Your neck/collarbone area has a lot of dips because of the bone structure. This gives the perfume plenty of room to rest, and interact with your skin. You can either dab some perfume on with your fingertips, or spray a little on, 5-7 inches away., The back is not the typical place to put perfume. However, because it is a place entirely covered up by clothes, it has a long shelf life, and not be so overbearing when you go out. Simply reach your hand around and spritz a couple sprays down your backbone. You can also get a friend to do it for you if you cannot reach around., Because your knees are constantly moving throughout the day, there is a lot of heat generated. This works with the perfume, and gradually moves the scent upwards as the day goes on. Simply dap a bit of perfume with your fingertips behind the knee, or spray about 5-7 inches away., Just like your knees, your elbows are ""pulse points"" that constantly move throughout the day, generating heat. Dab some perfume in your elbows with your fingertips, or spray it on 5-7 inches away., This is a rather odd place to put perfume, but it is a great place for your perfume to rest and interact with a ""pulse point."" It is also covered up with a shirt, so it is not so overbearing. Take a bit of perfume and place it on your fingertips. Run your fingers around and inside your belly button to apply the perfume., Skin reacts in different ways to different perfumes. Notice whether you can smell the perfume after a few hours is up. Check that your skin is not reacting negatively to a particular perfume., Even the best perfumes do not last very long. Ask a friend or family member whether they think you need some more. Often times you can get used to the smell of your perfume, but it still might be strong., If you think that there is too much perfume on you, simply take an alcohol wipe (baby wipe) and some hand sanitizer and wash that area off. You can then dry, and reapply the perfume. Make sure this time not to spray or dab too much., This is because heat and light change the chemical make-up of the perfume. The perfume then changes smell, which does not bode well for your date night. The best place to store your perfume is in a refrigerator., Like other products, perfume goes out of date. If you notice that there is a sharp smell when you open the bottle, that is another sign that your perfume is way too old."

Wear cologne at the appropriate times.,
Wear cologne because it makes you smell good, feel good, and act confident.,
Choose different colognes for different occasions.",How to Apply Cologne1," Cologne is not necessary at work, but it's generally acceptable. A big event, such as a wedding, funeral, party, or night out on the town, might easily call for cologne.Be aware of how your body's oils interact with your cologne. If you're going clubbing, for example, it may not be the best idea to apply lots of cologne: your natural body odor mixed with cologne may be even worse smelling than just your natural body odor.
Some people are allergic to cologne. You'll need to be sensitive of this potential issue when working in an office or spending time in other indoor areas.;
, Any other reason to wear cologne (""Because I want to feel like a man,"" ""Because my friend is doing it,"" etc.) is pointless. That being said, apply it when you feel like it and enjoy your scent.

, Many men prefer to wear one cologne during the day, at work, and a completely different one when they go out. Some sources recommend a lighter, citrus-based scent for afternoons and workplace environments, and a stronger scent with spice undertones or musky notes for the night."
"
Apply the cologne to your pulse points.,
Consider the chest.,
Don't forget the neck.,
Keep it clear of areas where you sweat excessively.,
Choose one or two spots.",How to Apply Cologne2," These are the areas of your body that produce a lot of body heat. The heat will cause the fragrance to continue to smell good all day long. If you just put the cologne on your clothes, it may not be detectable for long.


The insides of your wrists are a good spot for cologne.
Behind the ears is another spot that many men like to utilize.

, This is a great place to apply cologne, since it scents your shirt and provides a nice burst of scent to whomever you might end up hugging.

, If you're relatively sure your date's head may be close to your neck at some point during the evening, be sure to dab some cologne on your neck for good measure. Cologne applied here mixes with your natural scent, creating a unique smell that is truly you.

, If you tend to get body odor, don't use cologne as a way to mask it. Less appealing smells don't mix well with cologne, so it's best not to layer it on in the wrong areas.

, You don't have to put cologne on every pulse point; in fact, if you do so your scent will probably be overwhelming for those around you. Choose a few spots, and keep it subtle.

"
"
Take a shower first.,
Spray from several inches away.,
Dab very sparingly.,
Don't rub it in.,
Don't mix cologne with other smells.You shouldn't wear cologne with strongly-scented deodorant or aftershave.,
Don't reapply too often.",How to Apply Cologne3," The hot water cleanses your skin and opens your pores, providing a good base for the cologne. It won't smell good mixed with dirty skin, and if you spray it on dry it may not last as long.

, If your cologne has a spray bottle, do not spray right next to your skin; you don't want the liquid dripping down your shirt. It'll be way too strong, so hold it a few inches from your body and give yourself a light squirt.

, If your bottle doesn't have a spray nozzle, use the dabbing method. Cover the open bottle with your finger, tip the bottle, then right the bottle and put it down. Dab the liquid on your finger in the area where you wish to apply the cologne.


One small dab is sufficient; don't double-dab.
Wash your hands after using this method, so you don't get cologne smell on everything you touch.

, This changes way the cologne smells and makes the scent go away faster. Instead of rubbing the cologne, just spray or dab it on and let it dry on the skin.

, The smells might not go well together, and the combination could leave you smelling like a department store perfume counter.

, You'll quickly grow used to the smell of your cologne, to the point where you might think it's completely worn off. Other people, however, will still be able to smell it. You probably don't need to apply cologne more than once a day, right before you go out. If you absolutely feel the need to put on some more, keep it light.

Straight from the bottle: Unscrew the cap from the vial/bottle.,
Using an atomizer: Using an atomizer to apply your fragrance can be tricky.",How to Purchase and Apply Perfume," Finding the right fragrances for yourself can be a challenging task. Before you venture out and invest a fortune in perfumes, know your own lifestyle, the kind of activities you do, and the kind of person you are.;
, Visit the fragrance counter in a larger department store. Speak with the representative(s) of several perfume brands. Tell them you are looking for fragrances suitable for you. Let him/her know the types of fragrances you’re most interested in trying. Spices – for casual wear. Floral – for more elegant occasions. Natural scents – for work and everyday.

, Before you go shopping, tuck a few cotton balls, a handful of plastic sandwich bags and a small note pad into your purse or pocket. Most fragrance representatives will provide you with either a sample vial of the scent or apply a sample to a small, business card size piece of paper. On the paper, write down the name of the scent and where you obtained it. Put the scented paper into a sandwich bag, fold it up and take it home with you. If this courtesy is not available, squirt a sample from the ""tester"" bottle onto a cotton ball. Make yourself a note reminding yourself the name of the fragrance and where you got it. Put the paper or the cotton ball (or both) into a sandwich bag. It’s oh-so-tempting to pick up a ""tester"" bottle of the newest product on the market, saturate your wrist with it, and immediately put your nose to the test. Resist this temptation! You will not get a true sense of the fragrance. There will be too many other scents in the store environment to isolate the one you are trying, and the fragrance will not have time to ""mingle"" with your own body chemistry.

, Remove one of the ""tester"" cotton balls or paper slips from the sandwich bag. (If you collected fragrance vials, moisten a cotton ball with a little of the sample.) Rub your wrists with the cotton ball, and then tuck the cotton ball into your bra. Go about your activity. It takes a minimum of 5 minutes for the oils from the fragrance to mix with your natural oils -- give it time to breathe. The scent after that 5 minutes is the base notes, it will not differ much from that. Either you or someone who comes into contact with you will identify if this fragrance is right for you.

, Less is more; you want to bring people to your attention, not clear the room. Real perfumes usually have a stronger power than colognes. Use either of them with discretion and in good taste. Applying your fragrance to the insides or your wrists and a bit behind your ears is usually the best way to go. Be careful, however. Some people have sensitive skin around their neck and perfume could possibly irritate it, leaving large red splotches.

, Holding the bottle in one hand with your finger over the bottle opening, tip the bottle until the fluid moistens your fingertip. Apply the fragrance by dabbing the perfume to the pulse points of your body, i.e, on your neck just below your ear lobes, behind your knees, at your ankles, between your breasts, and at your wrists.

, Many atomizers distribute too much fragrance to a specific point. To avoid ""overdose,"" squirt the fragrance into the air above or directly in front of you and ""walk"" into the falling mist. If you choose to spray your body directly from an atomizer, apply it to your body trunk and rub your skin to distribute the fragrance.

Think through the reasons behind hair removal.,
Confront your worries about turning off potential partners.,
Focus on what you will gain by allowing your natural hair to remain in place.,
Decide the extent to which you want to be a hairy woman.,
Care for your natural body hair that you keep.,

Deal with put downs and critical comments with grace and dignity.,
Be confident with your decision.",How to Be a Hairy Woman," Removal of certain parts of body and facial hair that grows naturally on the female body is viewed by some cultures as a beauty essential. This societal conditioning in itself is not a reason for you to shave off your body or facial hair. Obviously, if you want to do so, then that is totally your right but so is choosing not to; what matters is that it is your choice and not something you feel compelled to do. Some things to consider include:

If the whole idea of keeping your body hair intact causes you to think ""how gross?"", think again. Do you dislike the sight of your bodily hair or have you been conditioned to dislike it by societal pressure stating that it is not acceptable? This is a hard question to untangle but it's not one to back down from, especially if you find yourself spending a lot of time conforming to beauty ideals that impact your wallet, energies and self-esteem.
Shaving bodily hair does not equate to cleanliness. This is about conformity to a body or feminine ideal, not about being dirty. You are clean whether you have body hair or not, provided you shower or bathe regularly.
There is a large industry behind hair removal products. This is one fairly heavily marketed and socially condoned reason for obliging women to remove hair.;
, There are plenty of men who like women with body or facial hair.You may be assuming too much about men disliking it. Sure, some men have been conditioned to dislike it but there are plenty of men who find it erotic, beautiful or just plain normal. Indeed, maybe it's a good indicator of how a man perceives you as a person or as an object when you reveal your hairier self… What you may find is that it is sometimes other women who will criticize your choice to remain hairy.


Many European women are far less obsessed about the removal of body hair than their North American counterparts. And yet, their love lives and general relationships are certainly not suffering for being a little hairier!
Women like Frida Kahlo, Julia Roberts, Drew Barrymore, Jennifer Love Hewitt and Brooke Shields have at one time or other sported famous body hair.
Just be aware that some men feel embarrassed to admit they like hairy women. You could be hiding your hairiness from him, he could be hiding his like for it from you, and this could just go on forever. Be honest and see what happens.

, There are so many benefits to letting the hair grow where it will, that these might tip the scales in favor of keeping your natural hair. Time and money once spent on hair removal is now a thing of the past. Not to mention forgoing the pain from waxing and shaving nicks. Gone is the after-pain of shaving or tweezing. And deodorant works just as well on hairy parts as on shaved parts (despite an oft-touted and unfounded insistence to the contrary). Standing up for freedom of choice as to how you, as a woman, express your beauty is a valuable gain. Finally but not least, you'll also start to discover the silent proportion of men who are just fine (and maybe even turned on by) hair on the female form.


Having hair on your body or face can be a great way to pick the boys from the men (or the misogyny infected girls from the real women), the conformists from the true thinkers and the mature from the immature. People's reactions will tell you a great deal…
Shaving pubic region hair can result in painful regrowth if the hairs become ingrown. This is definitely one area worth avoiding such painful outcomes!

, There are varying degrees of hairiness and anything you choose is fine. Some women prefer to shape out the monobrow, while some women are happy to shave their legs but keep armpit hair. Then, there are women happiest not to touch any of it. The extent of hairiness rests with your personal comfort level, the reasons behind wanting to keep your natural body hair and even the style of clothing you wear normally.


For some women, bleaching is a solution. Keep the hair but lessen its impact by bleaching it. Realize that this starts to get a little crazy when your leg skin bleaches too… You might want to look into professional bleaching services if you take this option seriously.
Sometimes skin sensitivity or high pain levels in one region (such as the armpits) could cause you to leave one part of your body free from shaving while still shaving another part.
Another possible choice is ""seasonal hairiness"". During winter, let it grow like wildfire, while in summer, tame the growth.

, Whether you're keeping all of your body hair, parts of it or seasonally adjusting it, there are some helpful hair care tips to follow:


Try to make any kept hair softer. Use hair conditioner on it regularly, but be careful around the pubic area.
Brush body hair with a damp nail brush if you feel it looks messy. Otherwise, leave it well alone and it'll usually take care of itself.
If you wish, cut hair a little shorter with nail scissors to keep it looking neat and even.
Keep clean. If you don't have time to shower, wash your underarms at the sink with shower gel as you would in the shower, then apply deodorant.
Avoid shaving if you do choose to remove any hair. Stubble is prickly and not as soft as grown hair. It can lead to irritated skin and ingrown hairs. Go for waxing or laser treatment for any hair you want removed.

, There will always be someone with a thoughtless, less-than-insightful comment seeking that you conform to their notion of the beauty ideal. There are several possible ways to respond to unkind words said about your choice to keep your natural body or facial hair:

Say nothing. Simply smile and turn away from them.
Ask them if they'd feel the same way about getting rid of hair if all of their hair suddenly fell out. Then comment on how funny it is that in a world where women would do anything not to go bald on top of the head, we insist that women go on removing naturally growing hair!
Make a joke out of it.
Probe them. Ask them exactly what it is that they think is so gross about naturally growing body hair on the female form. Be prepared for a long discussion and a lot of rebuttal. Bear in mind that you can have quite a lot of fun with this one because ""gross"" is not a reason and getting to the real reason behind the person's dislike can be very revealing.
Ask them if they really do prefer relegating women to the status of pre-adolescence by insisting on a beauty standard that infantilizes women. This is only for the woman who likes a good, potentially heated discussion that may, or may not, involve barbs about feminism. Stand your ground and call the bluffs as you see them.
Stare them straight in the face and tell them that they have truly offended you. Leave it at that.

, People may not notice anyway, and if they do, who really cares? As with all things that matter to you personally in life, navigate toward the people who don't give a toss about your appearance or who are supportive. The rest you can do without.


By all means remained well groomed (which is a different matter from appearance) but don't feel that you have to conform.
Being ashamed of your decision to stay hairy is a turn-off and can cause you to hide behind clothes and closed doors. Don't be ashamed; wear the hair proudly so that other women may also feel as confident as you do.
Look for support online. There are online blogs, forums, and groups devoted to women who put the razor down.

Keep a certain amount of control over your hair.,Take care of your personal hygiene, such as keeping your nails trimmed, ears clean, etc.,
If you prefer facial hair try to keep it tidy.,
Take care of your skin.",How to Approach Basic Grooming (for Men Over 30)," It is not recommended reaching for the hair dye as soon as greys appear but if you feel that they have come too early for your liking or are particularly self conscious about grey hairs why not go along to a professional hair stylist for advice? The most important thing to consider is your style whatever the colour. If you feel you could benefit from a new look consider hairstyles you've seen lately and liked before going for your next cut and if possible take a magazine clipping along to your stylist for reference. If you are receding, losing you hair, or have lost it altogether this doesn't have to be a negative! Many men choose to have shaven heads and losing you hair early can be associated with virility and high levels of testosterone. The most important thing to avoid here is the dreaded ‘comb over’. This style is neither attractive or necessary so don’t do it!;
,, A little 5 o’clock shadow can look very attractive on some men and a well kept mustache or beard can compliment your features, but many men look at their best when clean shaven. This is often a matter of taste. If you would like to address stray hairs around the ears or visible nostril hair there are specially designed trimmers that can be easily used to keep it in check. Don’t be afraid to trim particularly long brow hairs either, though it is not recommended plucking for men. If you have a ‘mono/uni brow’ and feel that it could benefit from some attention please do not attempt to address this yourself, you may wish to get advice from a beauty therapist who can offer you advice.

, The rules for younger looking and clearer skin are generally the same for men as they are for women so begin by investing in a good moisturiser, staying hydrated and washing your skin twice daily, morning and night, to keep pores clear. Moisturiser is most effective at night but for optimum results use yours after every time you wash or shave. Look for one that contains Keratin which is great for retaining moisture in the skin.

Go heavy.,
Pay attention to base notes.,

Try woody.,
Go rogue with a summery scent.,
Try a fragrance quiz.,
Skip applying fragrances before you go shopping.,
Spray it on a card.,
Spray it on your skin.",How to Choose a Winter Perfume," Summer is the time for light, ephemeral scents, while in winter, you can go for heavier scents. Scents fade faster in colder months (because your skin is so dry), so picking a heavier scent will help it stick with you for longer., The base notes of a fragrance are more important in the winter months. Perfumes consist of top notes, middle notes, and base notes. The base notes are the heaviest part of the fragrance, the part the lingers, while top notes fade quickly. Patchouli, vanilla, and sandalwood are common base notes you'll find more regularly in winter perfumes.To figure out the base notes of colognes, you can talk to the people at the perfume counter, who will be glad to assist you. You can also research perfumes online to find out more.

, In the winter months, you may need to move to a slightly denser scent.Eau de cologne is only about 5 percent scent, while eau de parfum is about 15 to 18 percent. Perfume is can go up to 30 percent scent, though it can also be as low as 15. The key is, you want something stronger in the winter, as most scents won't have as much punch as they did in the summer., Winter is filled with cold weather and lots of sweet flavors, such as your favorite Christmas cake. When you're picking a fragrance, picking one that reminds you of those desserts is a sure-fire way to pick something appropriate. Gourmand fragrances fall into this category, as they are quite sweet and are often reminiscent of all things sugary.Some gourmand perfumes to try are Salted Caramel by Shay and Blue, Candy by Prada, or Le Petite Robe Noire by Guerlain.

, Spicy scents are ones that fall into the ""warm"" category. Think about your favorite winter spices, such as cinnamon, nutmeg, and cardamom. These scents are also known as Orientals, and usually have a rich, exotic smell.Shalimar by Guerlain is a classic example of this type of scent.

, Woody and earthy scents are also a good choice for winter because they have a rich, heavy scent, reminiscent of pine trees and burning wood. Bergamot, patchouli, oakmoss, and labdanum are all in this category. You may find they are paired with something citrusy.Hypnose by Lancome is a perfume in this category.

, If winter is not your favorite, you can simply use your scent to remind yourself of better days ahead (in the summer). Choose something sweet and floral, or simply pick something that reminds you of summer. That way, every time you spray it, you'll be transported back to warm summer days.To make the scent more wintery, pick a floral with a deeper, more intense scent, that has a base of jasmine or tuberose, for instance.Vera Wang's Princess is a good example of this type of scent., Sometimes, visiting the perfume counter can be overwhelming. To help you narrow down what you might like, try taking an online fragrance-finder quiz. That way, you'll have a place to start when you get to the store.You can find a fragrance quiz by doing a simple search, but many major perfume websites also have them.
You can also test out samples that come in magazines or ask people you know what their scent is if you like it.

, When you go to the store, you want a blank canvas, so to speak. Skip putting on any perfume that morning so it won't compete. Also, skip other items you use with strong scents, such as lotions and body washes., The first step to testing a perfume is spraying it on a card. Smell it when you first spray it, but also try smelling it again in about 5 minutes, once it's had time to dry and settle. If you like it both times, you can move on to the next test.Often, perfume counters will have coffee beans on the counter to help you clear out your nostrils. Take a good whiff between scents to help clear your palate, so to speak.

, Next, try it out on your skin. You may wonder why you have to smell it both on a card and your skin. However, each perfume interacts with your skin and body chemistry, giving it a unique scent, different from every other person who wears it. Therefore, you want to make sure you like the smell on yourself before you buy it.Consider leaving it on for a few hours before buying it. You may find you don't like it after having it on for a while."

Avoid sitting or standing for long periods.,
Aid circulation with your body positioning.,
Opt for low heels.,
Wear compression hose.,
Use sunscreen.",How to Prevent Spider Veins1," If your job requires you to be on your feet all day, break up the time you stand still by walking around the office or taking a walk at lunch.;
, Since spider veins are caused by poor blood flow and circulation, it's important to avoid positions that impede circulation and use positions that aid it.Avoid crossing your legs when you sit at home or work. Crossing your legs for long periods interrupts the blood flow from your heart to your legs, which can cause vein walls to weaken and spider veins to appear.
Elevate your feet using a footstool when you're sitting down. Raise your feet to 6 to 12 inches (15-30 cm) above the level of your heart, which will improve circulation and help regulate the blood flow in your veins. It also reduces swelling in your ankles and calves, which will reduce the risk of spider veins.

, Avoid wearing high-heeled shoes, especially if your job requires you to sit or stand for long periods. High heels put extra pressure on your legs and can restrict the flow of blood from your heart to your legs, causing the limited circulation that can cause spider veins to appear.

, Wear low-grade compression hose, available at most drug stores or health stores, to prevent spider veins. Compression hose stimulate your blood vessels and improve circulation, making your legs less swollen and achy and preventing the poor circulation that often causes spider veins.

, It's important to use sunscreen to protect the fragile skin on your face, but sunscreen can also help prevent spider veins from appearing on your legs, calves and ankles as you get older. Make sure you protect yourself from the sun every time you spend more than a few minutes outside.

Maintain a healthy body weight.An important part of keeping your legs and feet healthy and preventing spider veins is maintaining a healthy body weight.,
Eat less salt and more fiber.,
Exercise regularly.",How to Prevent Spider Veins2," Follow a balanced diet and work with your doctor to reach a goal weight that is appropriate for your height and body type. This will reduce excess stress on your feet and blood vessels.

, Salt causes your body to retain water and swell, which can put pressure on veins. Fiber prevents constipation, another form of pressure that can lead to the appearance of spider veins.


Avoid processed foods like snacks and prepackaged meals, since these are often loaded with sodium.
Eat plenty of fresh fruits, vegetables, whole grains and lean meats. Avoid using salt when you cook at home.

, Getting daily exercise improves your circulation even when you aren't moving, and it helps keep your body weight healthy. Focus on exercises that keep your feet and legs moving to prevent the appearance of spider veins.


Develop an exercise regimen that involves cycling, running or jogging.
If that's too high-impact, take daily walks or light swims.
Weight training is good for circulation, too. Start incorporating weights into your exercise routine.

Spider veins are hereditary.,
Pregnancy can lead to spider veins.,
Having a sedentary lifestyle can lead to spider veins.,
Obesity can cause spider veins.,
Sun exposure causes spider veins on the face.",How to Prevent Spider Veins3," Veins carry blood from your legs, arms, and other parts of your body back to your heart. As your body ages, the valves in your veins weaken, and blood can collect and cause your veins to enlarge and become more visible. This is especially true of veins in the legs and ankles, which have to work against gravity to carry blood up to the heart.


Spider veins affect at least half of adults age 50 and older.Spider veins are similar to varicose veins, which appear on the legs as people grow older for the same reasons that spider veins do.

, About half of people who have spider veins have relatives who also have them. This means that while spider veins can be prevented to some degree, in some cases they may be unavoidable.

, Since the veins of a pregnant woman are under a greater amount of pressure than usual, spider veins may appear, especially on the legs and ankles.Spider veins caused by pregnancy usually fade a few months after the baby is born.
Subsequent pregnancies usually lead to the appearance of more spider veins.

, Sitting for long periods of time is detrimental to circulation, making it harder for veins in the legs to carry blood up to the heart. This extra strain causes spider veins to appear.

, Having extra weight puts strain on veins, since the veins must work harder to carry blood to the heart., The veins close to the surface of the face can weaken and become more visible, especially on people with fair skin."

Do minimal lip color.Most scene makeup involves a pale mouth, so avoid dark lipstick completely.",How to Apply Scene Makeup As a Preteen," Before applying makeup, you should always have a freshly washed and moisturized face. This will keep breakouts to a minimum and your makeup will go on more easily and look better once it’s on.


After you apply the moisturizer to clean skin, wait about 10 minutes before you start applying your makeup. This will give the moisturizer time to absorb completely into your skin.;
, Scene makeup emphasizes bold eye makeup choices, but as a preteen you don't want to go too overboard with it. Using the best palette for your skin tone allows you to be a little daring with your eye makeup without looking overdone.


Regardless of your skin tone, get some natural-looking, soft eyeshadow colors - those look good on everyone. Think soft nudes, pearly beiges, soft browns, and shimmery champagnes.
If you have pale skin, light red tones and soft greens are good for eyeshadow.If you're tan, pale yellows and vibrant greens are good eyeshadow choices.
If you have dark skin, go with soft golds and purple berry shades., Brush the eyeshadow of your choice over the entire eyelid, starting at the inner corner of your eye and working outward. Then sweep that same eyeshadow color under your eye, very close to the lash line.


With scene makeup, lots of older girls will wear multiple neon shades at one time. Until you get the hang of it, try experimenting with two.
Eyeshadow brushes are best for applying scene eyeshadow, as opposed to eyeshadow wands. Wands are the tiny little tools that all eyeshadow compacts come with.
Eyeshadow brushes are purchased separately and they basically look like paintbrushes. You can get one for cheap in any makeup department.

, Use a little more of your main shade to go over what you've already done to brighten it up. If you want to add another color, choose one that's darker than your main shade and work it into the crease of your eyelids. This will make your eyes really pop with color, which is what you want when doing scene makeup.

, Starting at the inner corner of your upper eyelid and working outward, gently draw a line all the way to the edge of your eye, where your eyelid ends. Follow the natural shape of your eyelid, very close to your lash line.


The older scene girls will be using heavy black eyeliner all the way around their eyes, so you'll want to go for that look, just less intense. The idea is to make the colorful eyelid pop with the addition of the dark eyeliner color.You can draw a line lightly under your bottom lash line if you want to go for a slightly bolder look. Another step bolder would be to connect the two lines, creating a rounded edge on the outside corner of your eye.Use an eyeliner pencil or a kohl pencil. As a preteen, liquid liner maybe be a little too dark and unnatural looking. It’s can also be pretty hard to work with - it takes a bit of practice to get right. Master the eyeliner pencil first!

, If you don’t have an eyelash curler already, invest in one. Yes, it looks a bit intimidating, like some kind of torture instrument! But they are very easy to use and can make a huge difference in your final look. Curling your eyelashes really opens up the eye, and remember - scene makeup is all about the eyes!

, Brush the mascara wand softly across the lashes, starting close to your lid at the bottom of your lashes and sweeping out to the ends of your lashes. You can gradually move up to more layers of mascara once you get into the groove of makeup, but start slowly and naturally with one coat for now.


Wait until your mascara dries completely before moving on to the rest of your makeup - about 3 to 5 minutes.

, You’ll notice that the older scene girls are using lighter foundation makeup on their faces to make their complexions look paler, but that can look very unnatural. For now, go with a natural skin tone. Use a sponge applicator to apply a very thin layer of foundation all over your face. Make sure to cover your skin evenly.


You want this to be as sheer and natural looking as possible. You can try a BB cream instead of a true foundation if you want something much easier to work with – and those creams look far more natural, as well.
You apply BB cream with a sponge applicator, just as you would regular foundation. You can buy them in the same area of the store where you’d get the foundation.

, Choose a concealer that matches your skin tone, just as you did with the foundation. Dab the concealer lightly onto the blemish area and blend the edges to make it look more natural.


Skip this step if you don’t have any blemishes! Concealer can look heavy and unnatural if you use too much of it, and you want to avoid that completely. Don’t try to cover up your freckles or anything like that.
Wait about five minutes before moving on to the next steps. This will give your foundation and concealer time to absorb completely into your skin.

, Start by smiling into the mirror. See those round cheeks pop up? That’s where you want to apply the blush. Use a big fluffy brush to apply your blush with light circular strokes on the apples of your cheeks.


You only need to use a little bit of blush to brighten your face, especially since the older scene girls are going so pale with their makeup. It’s more scene looking if you use just a hint of blush.
Choose a soft, natural looking rose color for your blush.

, Use a big fluffy brush for this, as well. Not the same one you used for your blush, however! You’ll want to keep those brushes separate.


Dusting the translucent powder on last “sets” your makeup, which means it keeps it in place and makes it last longer.
Powder also gets rid of any shine you have on your face. The older scene girls will be going for a very matte (not shiny) complexion.

, Now that you’re at the end of the scene makeup routine, you’ll want to step back from the mirror and take a look at your face as a whole. It’s easy to get distracted by one particular thing when you are focused on applying makeup to different parts of your face, but the important thing is the final, overall look.


If the color is uneven, lightly apply a little more eyeshadow to the eyelid that needs a color boost. Step back from the mirror and check again before adding any more. You probably only need a tiny bit to even them up.

, If you find that your eyeliner is thinner on one eye than it is on the other, lightly add a bit more until they are evenly matched. It doesn’t have to be perfect, but it needs to be as close as you can get.

, You want to make sure there is no visible line around the edges of your face left by the foundation, because that would look very unnatural. If you do notice a line, take a sponge applicator and dab at it until it looks evenly blended.

, It’s the eyes that you really want to emphasize with color. Apply a plain lip balm or a light berry-colored gloss to your lips as the final step.

Pick the right areas on your skin.,
Consider intimacy.,
Use your clothing.,
Wear it in your hair.",How to Apply Perfume for a Date1," Your own skin is probably the first place you would think to put perfume, but not every area is equally good for application. You will want to pick areas that are warmer, like pulse points, which help to produce the scent more strongly, as well as areas where the perfume can naturally pool as it settles.Good areas include:


Behind the ears.
Your wrists.
Inside elbows and behind the knees.
The belly button.
Your decolletage and collarbone.
You can also try using more unusual areas, like down your back, the backs of your hands, your calves, and even your ankles.;
, Are you hoping to get close and comfortable on your date, maybe even take it to the next level? Getting a mouthful of alcohol may put the brakes on your momentum; you want your date to smell, not taste, your perfume. Consider the areas where your date might put their mouth, such as your neck, cheek, or the back of your hand, and avoid placing perfume directly in those areas.


Choose areas adjacent to where they may be putting their face, such as the ears or hair (more on that soon).

, As anyone who has smelled dirty laundry can attest, scent particles cling onto fibers. As mentioned before, heat helps to activate the scent of a perfume; your natural body heat will warm your clothing, making it even more ideal for spray to settle. Use this to your advantage by spraying perfume onto your clothing.


Spraying around the collar area of a shirt or dress or the back of your top is a strategic place as this portion of your clothing may be close to their nose should they hug or kiss you.
This method of application is especially helpful for people hoping to get intimate on their date as you can still smell nice without risking your partner tasting something unsavory.

, Applying perfume to your hair is not universally recommended due to the drying qualities of alcohol, but careful application should not cause much damage.This area is a good choice for the same reasons your clothing is: perfume particles will settle onto hair fibers and stay there. Additionally, your scalp tends to be quite warm, heating the roots of your hair, so the scent will be stronger here.


Spray it directly above your head to let the particles settle naturally on your hair.
Apply the perfume by spraying it first on your brush before running it through your hair for a less damaging application.
Some fragrances are designed especially for hair; use these if you are very concerned about potentially damaging your hair.

, Use your favorite facial cleanser to get your facial off to a great start. Wash your face with warm water (not hot or cold, since these temperatures are harsh on facial skin) and pat it dry with a soft towel.









Make sure all of your makeup has been removed before you continue with the facial.
For a luxurious twist, try using the oil cleansing method to wash your face. Rub coconut, almond, olive or jojoba oil into your skin, then wipe it away using a towel moistened with warm water. Rinse your face and pat it dry.

, You can use a store-bought facial scrub or mix one up using ingredients you have at home. A good exfoliating scrub contains sugar that will “scrub” away the dead skin without damaging the healthy skin underneath. Try one of these great combinations for your scrub:


1 tablespoon sugar, 1 tablespoon honey, and 1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 tablespoon finely ground almonds, 1 tablespoon honey, and 1 tablespoon aloe
1 tablespoon finely ground oatmeal, 1 tablespoon honey, and 1 tablespoon milk

, Apply the scrub in a gentle circular motion all over your face, from your T-zone down your nose, across your cheeks, and under your chin. Instead of pressing into your skin, let the scrub do the work for you and lightly lift away the top layer of dead skin cells.








, Use warm water to rinse away the scrub, leaving your face fresh and gleaming. Pat your face with a soft towel to get it ready for the next step in your facial.








, If you don’t want to use a scrub, there are other ways to exfoliate your face. You can use a dry brush, an exfoliating cloth, or an application of an acid exfoliant such as glycolic acid. Any method is fine, but don’t use two methods in combination. Over-exfoliating the skin on your face can damage it.


If you use a dry brush, purchase one made with very fine fibers and designed for the face, not the body. Start with a completely dry face and brush your face using a circular motion.
If you use glycolic acid, allow it to sit on your skin for five minutes before rinsing.

, While your pores are still moist and open from the steam treatment, apply a mask to draw out impurities. The type of mask you use should be based on your skin type. Either by a mask or peel from the store, or try one of the following mixtures:









For oily or acne-prone skin, mix 1 tablespoon of honey, and 1 tablespoon white bentonite clay.
For dry skin, mix 1 tablespoon of olive oil, 1 tablespoon of honey, and 1 mashed avocado or banana.
For regular skin, mix 1 tablespoon of honey, 1 tablespoon of yogurt, and 1 mashed avocado or banana.

, During this time, the ingredients will nourish your skin, and when you remove your mask it will look brighter and more vibrant. If you want to relax while your mask goes to work, slice up a cucumber, lie down in a comfortable place, and put one slice over each eye. This will keep the mask from dripping into your eyes and moisturize your eyelids at the same time.

, When the 15 minutes is up, use warm water to rinse it away. Honey can be quite sticky, so make sure you rinse off all traces of the mask. Use a soft towel to pat your skin dry.








, The last step in your facial is to apply a moisturizer to keep your skin glowing long after your facial is complete. Smooth on your favorite moisturizing cream and let it fully absorb into your skin before putting on makeup.

Apply after showering and moisturizing.,
Spritz, don't mist.,
Do not reapply too often.,
Avoid dabbing or rolling on.",How to Apply Perfume for a Date2," You want your perfume to be clinging to you, not oil and dirt that you have picked up throughout the day, which may distort the scent.Scent also lasts longer on skin that has been properly moisturized, and perfumes themselves tend to be drying due to alcohol content. For these reasons you should always be sure to bathe or shower and then properly moisturize your skin before applying it to your body.


Rub an occlusive ointment, such as Vaseline, onto the spots you intend to spray after you moisturize in order to help the fragrance last longer.One spritz in each area should be enough, especially if you are spraying multiple areas. You don't want to overwhelm people with your smell.
Make sure that you're using an unscented body lotion or one that matches your perfume. Mixing scents can create an unpleasant, overpowering effect.

, Although some people recommend spraying a cloud of perfume in front of you to walk into, this method results in wasted product and allows it to settle all over you including in unwanted areas.Instead, choose the areas you want to target specifically and give a direct, spritzing spray.


Use restraint, especially with perfumes you have grown accustomed to over time. Your application may be stronger than you realize.
Make sure that you spritz with the perfume bottle 20-30 centimeters away. If you spritz too close, the perfume will pool and the scent won't apply in a natural way, distorting the scent.

, You will grow acclimated to scents both in the long-term and short term, so don't think that just because you can't smell your perfume you need to reapply. Smells that are too strong to others can be unappealing and even cause nausea and headaches. Pay attention to the exact kind of perfume you are wearing in order to know when you will need to reapply.


Eau de toilettes last from 4-6 hours.
Eau de parfums last from 6-8 hours and the scent will change organically over time.
Parfum lasts all day; you will not need to reapply.
Eau de cologne is particularly lightweight, so you can more generously apply this.

, Although rollerball applicators are very handy, there is a downside to using them. With every application to your skin, the perfume becomes increasingly contaminated by your skin's oils.This will cause the fragrance to degrade over time.


The same thing happens to tiny vials of perfume meant for dabbing, so beware.

"
"
Experiment.,
Pick a scent you like.,
Pick a scent they'll like.,
Choose a perfume with heavy base notes.",How to Apply Perfume for a Date3," Try lots of different scents, and be sure to actually try them on your body. Your natural oils will mix with each fragrance to produce a unique scent. In order to tell whether or not you will actually like the way something smells, you'll need to try it on yourself first.


Wait until after the perfume has dried before sniffing in order to tell what the scent will be like.
Use a makeup wipe to get rid of any unwanted scents.

, The most important opinion to consider in selecting a perfume is your own. Perfume is meant to make you feel attractive and confident, and if you don't like what you're wearing then you will probably feel self conscious. Consider owning multiple perfumes to suit your different moods and to give yourself the opportunity to change things up., Part of the point of wearing perfume on a date is to seem attractive to the other party. Although you might not know what scents he or she likes, you can always ask. In a more established relationship you should have an idea of their preferences. If you know that they hate the smell of oranges and lemon scented soaps, avoid citrusy smells.


Be careful to pay attention to whether or not your date has any kind of perfume or scent allergies. If you are less familiar with them, ask. If your date has an allergy to perfume, be considerate of them and do not wear any.

, Although every perfume has top, middle, and base notes that determine what the scent smells like, top notes are very short lived and middle notes are meant to harmonize.Base notes are what you want to pay attention to in a perfume as these are the smells that will stay with you the longest. Choose perfumes with heavier base notes in order to know you will have a perfume that will last throughout your date.


Musk, oriental, and wood-based scents like sandalwood and patchouli will remain the longest.Citrus notes are the lightest and usually evaporate the fastest."

",How to Make a Coconut Oil Lotion Bar2," Use a cleansing soap and water to wash skin, then exfoliate using a loofah or another device. Remove dead skin cells using a loofah, soap and water. Rinse thoroughly.

Give dry brushing a try.,
Use an exfoliating scrub.,
Shave or wax regularly.",How to Get Silky Soft Skin1," Skin often starts to feel rough and dull as a result of the accumulation of dead skin cells. Dry air causes the top layer of skin to dry out and flake off, causing your skin's texture to feel less smooth. Brushing off those dead skin cells immediately makes your skin feel softer, and because the technique improves circulation, it also enhances your skin's silkiness in the long term.


Dry brushes are sold at beauty stores and drugstores. Choose a body brush made from natural fibers. Natural fibers are easier on your skin, so avoid brushes with plastic bristles.
Always make sure both your body and the brush are completely dry when you begin. Brush from your toes up your legs toward your heart using quick, firm strokes. Focus on the areas where your skin is the driest. Keep working on your skin until your legs, torso, and arms have all been brushed. The procedure should take about five minutes.
If you want to brush your face, buy a special brush made with softer fibers.;
, Scrubs are usually made with salt or sugar and lotions that hydrate your skin while you exfoliate. While you're in the bath or the shower, apply a heap of scrub mixture to the area of your body you want to exfoliate and rub it vigorously into your skin. The sugar or salt scrubs dead skin cells away without scratching or otherwise harming your skin.


For best results, use scrubs once or twice a week. Don't use them too often, or you may end up drying out your skin; scrubs remove dead skin cells and dirt, but they also scrub away the natural oils in your skin that prevent it from getting too dry.
Scrubs are available for purchase at drug stores and beauty stores, but it's quite easy to make your own. Combine the following ingredients and store the scrub in an old cosmetic container or a jar with a lid:

2 cups sugar or salt (use fine-grained sugar or salt, rather than course-grained)
1/2 cup olive oil or almond oil
1/4 cup honey
1 teaspoon vanilla or a few drops of your favorite essential oil



, If you want silky, soft legs, shaving or waxing regularly can help. Not only do these techniques remove hair, which can cause legs to feel less soft, but they also remove the dead skin cells that accumulate on the surface of your skin.


Shave your legs with a moisturizing lotion or shaving cream, rather than a cleansing gel, to prevent your skin from getting too dry.
Choose a leg wax that is fortified with moisturizing ingredients, like aloe, for even softer results.

If the area is swollen, releasing pus or blood, or is very tender and painful, you should go immediately to your doctor or local health clinic. Skin cracks are very prone to infection and these infections require professional treatment.


If you do not have health insurance (and you live in the US), go to the official listing of clinics for low income individuals. You should be able to find a clinic which will scale your bill to the amount of money you have available.;
, Start treatment of basic cracks by soaking your skin. Sanitize a bowl, bucket, or tub and then fill it with warm (not hot) water. You'll then want to pour in a little apple cider vinegar to help disinfect your skin. Use about 1 cup per gallon of water. Disinfecting will help cut down on chances for the cracks to become infected.

, Using a clean washcloth, gently rub the affected area. This will remove dead skin cells and allows the products you'll place on your skin to absorb better. Be sure to be gentle and that the washcloth you use is clean.


Once you've healed the cracks, you can use more aggressive forms of exfoliating but this should not be done more than once a week. Your skin is sensitive and needs to be treated carefully.

, Give your skin a final rinse and then apply a layer of moisturizer. You'll want to lock in the moisture that your skin received with the soak, or else you risk drying out your skin even more.


We recommend a lanolin product but you'll find other recommendations in the next section.

, If you have time, such as if you can treat your skin overnight or on a weekend, wet dressings may help heal the skin and can at least provide you with greater comfort.Wet dressings consist of a moist layer of fabric covered by a dry layer. So, for example, let's say your feet are cracked. Wet a pair of socks and then wring them so they don't drip. Put those on and then cover with dry socks. Sleep like this overnight.


It is important not to do this if you suspect the cracks are infected, since this can make the infection worse.

, For treatment during the day, fill the cracks with liquid or gel ""bandage"" product, or at least with an antibiotic product like Neosporin. You can then cover the area with a protective cotton surgical pad and wrap with gauze. This should reduce pain and speed up the healing process.

, Now you just have to be patient while the cracks heal. Be sure to keep the affected area clean and covered, to prevent further irritation. If the cracks are on your feet, wear socks which are clean and change them at least once (if not twice) a day until the cracks heal. If the cracks are on your hands, wear gloves when you're outside and for activities like washing dishes.

, Once you've started to heal the cracks in your skin, your best bet is to start a long term routine to prevent more cracks. Unfortunately, this is a skin problem that is better to focus on preventing then on fixing once it occurs. Whatever moisturizing routine you use, just make sure that it's something you can keep up long-term and use regularly, since this is the best way to prevent future issues.

, Lanolin, which is a wax-like substance made from wool-producing animals, is nature's best way of protecting skin. Used consistently, you should be able to apply it every other day or every third day and still see the same soft skin. When you first start using it, apply it liberally at night and give it time to soak into your skin.


Bag Balm is the most common brand of lanolin product in the US and can be found at most drug stores.

, If not using lanolin, you'll want to analyze what moisturizing products you do buy. You'll want products with the right kinds of ingredients, to guarantee that you get the right effect. Many moisturizers will include lots of natural, healthy sounding ingredients but they won't actually help your skin very much. You'll want to instead look for these in the ingredients list:


Humectants, which draw moisture into your skin. Examples include glycerin and lactic acid.
Emollients, which protect your skin. Examples include lanolin, urea, and silicon oils.

, Every time you bath or expose your cracked skin to water, you're washing away natural oils which protect your skin. Apply at least a light level of moisturizer after every shower, as well as any time you soak your feet.

, If you can, apply a thick layer of moisturizer before going to bed at night. This will give your feet time to really soak all of that healing product in, while making sure that you're not bothered by squishy skin. Cover your skin thickly in moisturizer and then put on a layer to protect the moisturizer while it soaks in.


If the cracks are on your feet, use socks. If the cracks are on your hands, use gloves.

, There are many health problems which can cause severely dry skin like this. You might want to evaluate your health and make sure none of these problems are affecting you. If you are suffering from a larger condition, it's important to treat it before the cracks reappear and become infected...or before other, more dangerous symptoms come up.


Diabetes is one common example of an illness which can cause severely dry skin in the extremities. Talk to your doctor for help in figuring out if you have outside health factors.

, Your body will naturally produce oils which help protect your skin and prevent cracks. However, an incorrect bathing routine can strip your skin of these natural oils and put you at risk. Mostly you'll want to avoid harsh soaps and hot water, since both will send your body's oils running.


If you soak your feet, don't use soaps in the water. Generally you want to avoid soap on sensitive skin, like your feet. Water and a washcloth should be more than enough to get them clean.

, When the air gets really cold, it also dries out. The area you live in might also be naturally dry. This dry air, draws moisture out from your skin naturally. Protect your skin from drying out by evening out the moisture in the air or by protecting your skin. Place a humidifier in your home or office and wear socks and gloves when you go outside.


You skin should also be protected from the sun, which can create damage and dryness over time.

, If the cracks you experience are mainly on your feet, you might want to take a look at your shoes.Shoes with open backs and poor padding can lead cracks to form by putting too much pressure on already sensitive skin. Use closed shoes and make sure they're very comfortable.


Switch to jogging shoes or at least use insoles to protect your feet from pressure.

, Dehydration can definitely make your skin more prone to being dry and when you combine it with improper washing and a dry environment, it's a recipe for cracked skin. Drink plenty of water each day to keep your body properly hydrated.


How much is the right amount depends on the individual person. Generally, if your pee is pale or clear, you're getting enough. If it's not, you need to drink more water.

, Your skin needs lots of vitamins and nutrients in order to keep growing in healthy. You can make some improvements to the quality of your skin by making sure that nutrient deficiency is not the source of your problem. Get lots of vitamin A, vitamin E, and omega 3 fatty acids, to help your skin get what it needs to be healthy.


Good sources of these nutrients include: kale, carrots, sardines, anchovies, salmon, almonds and olive oil.

, Obesity and excess weight are commonly attached to conditions of severely dry skin. If you find yourself unable to beat this dry skin problem and no outside health factors are in play, you will want to consider trying to lose weight. Remember that this cracked skin poses a serious risk of infection: while the problem might seem small, it can actually be very dangerous and you shouldn't dismiss the problem.

, Again, if you are ever concerned because the cracks won't go away or because they're infected, please see your doctor or go to a clinic. This is a common problem and there are many solutions available. You doctor should be able to help you figure out if this is a problem you can beat with a routine, or if medication will be needed to help prevent infections.

Use the SPF that's right for you.,
Max out your SPF at 35.,
Look for complete UV protection.,
Choose mineral sunscreen for sensitive skin.,
Buy sunscreen formulated for oily skin.,
Purchase moisturizing sunscreens for dry skin.",How to Look After Your Skin in Summer1," Think about how quickly you burn on a sunny day. Multiply that number in minutes by the sun protection factor (SPF) of the sunscreen you're considering. The result will tell you the maximum amount of time the sunscreen will keep you protected.For example, if your skin turns red after 10 minutes in the sun, a sunscreen with SPF 15 should allow you to spend 150 minutes (2.5 hours) in the sun.;
, There's no proof that SPFs higher than 35 protect you for longer periods of time. They may simply contain more chemicals.Check the Environmental Working Group's Skin Deep Cosmetics Database for information about each sunscreen on the market., The sun emits ultraviolet (UV) light in long-wave (UVA) and shortwave (UVB) rays. Both can cause skin cancer, but not all sunscreens contain UVB protection. Check the front of the packaging for terms like “Broad Spectrum.” This indicates protection from both kinds of UV rays., Mineral sunscreens don't contain the irritants that many chemical sunscreens contain. Zinc oxide and titanium dioxide are the most common. If you're prone acne, stick to the zinc oxide. Titanium dioxide can make you break out., Read the packaging carefully. Look for oil-free formulas. If you have acne-prone skin, purchase sunscreens labeled “Non-Comedogenic.” These formulas won't clog your pores., Look for terms like “cream,” “lotion,” or even “ointment” on the front of the packaging. Moisturizing sunscreens are often formulated as these skincare products. Check for moisturizing ingredients like oil and lanolin. "

Use lotion every day.,
Deep condition your skin.,
Try a variety of moisturizing products.",How to Get Silky Soft Skin2," Protecting your skin from dry air with a layer of moisturizing lotion is one of the best ways to make it feel soft and silky. Choose a hydrating lotion for dry skin. Apply it as soon as you get out of the shower, while your skin is still damp and warm, to trap in the moisture that keeps your skin soft.


Carry a travel-sized bottle of lotion with you throughout the day to treat areas that might become dry, especially your face and hands.
Moisturizing sunscreen is a good option for your face, since it keeps your skin hydrated and protects you from damaging rays at the same time.

, When lotion just doesn't seem to be keeping your skin soft, it's time to deep condition your skin with oil. The process might be a little messy, but the resulting silky skin is worth it. Complete the following steps before going to bed:






Rub oil all over your body. Use olive oil, almond oil, jojoba oil, or another cosmetic-grade oil. You can purchase these at grocery stores, natural food stores or beauty stores.
Put on long-sleeved pajamas and pajama pants. Your long-sleeved clothing will keep the oil against your skin and prevent it from getting all over your bed while you sleep. Choose cotton pajamas, rather than silk or another fabric that might get stained by the oil. If you want, you can also wear socks and gloves.
In the morning, take a shower and moisturize with lotion as usual. Your skin should feel unbelievably smooth and baby-soft after your deep oil treatment.

, Not every moisturizer works for every person's skin. You may find that the commercial lotions, even those that are made for extra-dry skin, don't keep your skin from flaking a few hours after application. Experiment with these natural moisturizers until you find one that keeps your skin feeling silky.


Coconut oil spreads on smooth and melts against the skin.
Shea butter is great for treating rough knees and elbows during the winter.
Lanolin is the natural substance that sheep produce to keep their wool soft and waterproof.
Aloe vera is a light, everyday moisturizer that doesn't leave your skin feeling oily.

Take an oatmeal bath.,
Try a seaweed wrap.,
Make a mask.",How to Get Silky Soft Skin3," Oatmeal has soothing, healing properties, and letting your skin absorb oatmeal water in the bathtub is a great way to get softer skin. You may be averse to bathing directly in oatmeal, but there's an easier way to get the benefits of oatmeal:


Pour a cup of old-fashioned (not instant) oatmeal into the foot of an old pair of pantyhose and tie a knot at the top. You can also tie the oatmeal up in a piece of cheesecloth.
Fill the bathtub with warm (not hot) water and place the oatmeal-filled cloth in the tub.
As you soak in the tub, squeeze the saturated oatmeal over your body. Run it over your skin, concentrating on the areas that are dry or irritated.

, This spa treatment is designed to improve skin tone. Buy a package of unsalted seaweed. Fill a large bowl with cool water and place the pieces of seaweed in the bowl. Situate yourself on a towel and place wet strips of seaweed on your skin. Let them dry on your skin until they begin to shrivel, then remove them. Rinse your skin and moisturize with oil or lotion to finish.

, Masks are used on the face and body to smooth and exfoliate the skin. Buy a mask from the drugstore, or make one of these using ingredients you already have in your kitchen:


Make a honey lemon mask. Place two teaspoons of flour into a bowl. Add two teaspoons of honey and a teaspoon of lemon juice. Stir the ingredients together and apply the paste to your face or another dry part of your body. Leave it on for 30 minutes, then rinse off with cold water. Beware, however, that prolonged exposure of lemon juice on the skin may lead to a condition called ""phytophotodermatitis,"" which produces a painful chemical burn on the skin.






Make a milk mask. After taking a shower, take a cotton ball and dip it into warm milk. Rub the cotton ball onto your face, and let the milk dry. After the milk has been fully absorbed into your skin, wash your face with cold water to close your pores. You can also add milk to your bath to soften your entire body.

If the coconut oil is solid, which often happens in the winter months as it get cooler, place the coconut oil jar into a bowl filled with “warm” water until it becomes a more manageable consistency.

, Mix the two ingredients together until fully blended., Using your fingers, scoop the scrub and apply to face and lips. Rub the scrub lightly into the skin for ultimate exfoliation.


The coconut oil has amazing hydration properties so leaving the scrub sit for 5-10 minutes would be beneficial but not necessary for the exfoliation process.

, This can be done over a sink or in the shower. Be sure to get all of the scrub off your face.


If you plan to use a washcloth, be sure to use a softer one as a rough washcloth post exfoliation could over exfoliate and cause irritated skin.

Grow out your perm gracefully.",How to Care for Permed Hair," It can be tempting play with your new curls or waves. But it can take the perming chemicals anywhere from 24-48 hours to lock the shape in your hair permanently. In addition, your hair will still be fragile from the process. Leaving your hair be for a couple of days can help ensure that your hair maintains its shape for the longer term.


Use your fingers to style your hair only as necessary during this time. You should also avoid brushing or combing your hair.;
, For this first 24-72 hours after you get a perm, don’t wash or condition your hair. This keeps the water or other chemicals from deactivating your perm and making your curls fall apart. It can also help keep your perm fresher for a longer time.Make sure to keep your hair as dry as possible, especially if it is raining or snowing outside.
Ask your stylist how long you should wait until washing your hair. The length of time may depend on your hair and the type of perm you got. If you absolutely can’t wait to wash your hair, call your stylist to find out the best way to handle the situation. She may suggest using dry shampoo or another product until you can get your hair wet.

, You may want to make the most of your new perm with different styles that require pins, barrettes, or winding your hair. You may even want to get your hair out of your face to play sports or study. But because your hair is still settling from the perm, it’s important to let your locks flow loosely for a few days after your perm. Putting your hair in a ponytail, braid, or other style that requires accessories can reshape parts of your hair with dents and may even break off fragile hair.You should never run your fingers through your hair with a perm because it can break up the curls and make it looser.
Use a silk scarf to gently pull back your hair if absolutely necessary. Make sure to tie it as loosely as possible to keep your hair back without leaving a mark., Keep in mind that permed hair is often stressed and needs a lot of love. This is especially true during the first week after a perm. Avoid getting any type of color treatments on your hair for at least a week after your perm. This can avoid causing your hair further stress or damage and may even prevent your hair from breaking off.Talk to your stylist about scheduling your color treatment within a safe time frame from your perm. It is best to get both your color and perm done by a professional.
Consider using a hair tint, colored powder, or color shampoo instead of color treatments because they are unlikely to harm your hair, unlike dye. Only use these products 24-48 hours after you got your perm.
Even if you do wait at least a week to color your hair, you may still experience breakage.The type of dye and the level of developer (if one is used) can make a difference in how it affects your hair. Ask your hair stylist what they recommend., No matter what, permed hair needs special and gentle aftercare. Getting specially formulated products can restore luster to stressed and fragile permed hair. In addition, they can help maintain your curls for a longer period of time.Look for product labels with ingredients such as biotin, eucalyptus oil, and soy. Avoid products with parabens and sulfates.Ask your stylist for product suggestions. Stylists have specialized knowledge about the best products to use on permed hair. However, you shouldn’t feel pressured to buy any products your stylist sells. You can also buy products for permed or chemically treated hair at most large retailers, grocery stores, pharmacies, and beauty stores. Read the product labels, which may say “for permed hair” or “for chemically treated hair.”

, Cleaning your hair can keep your curls fresh and bouncy. But washing it too often can strip your already delicate hair of essential oils and make your perm relax faster. Treat your permed hair like silk or another delicate fabric: washing it once a week is enough to keep it clean and help maintain its beauty.Wash your hair with warm water. Hot water can strip your hair of oils that help keep it moisturized and looking lustrous. Hot water can also ruin the curls.Make sure to thoroughly rinse with warm or cool water. Lingering residue in your hair can weigh it down and make it dirty more quickly. Chemicals in the residue may also keep your perm from staying fresh over time, requiring repeat perms.Use dry shampoo on your roots if your hair gets dirty in between washes. Spray a small amount ten inches from your roots and let it absorb for a couple of minutes. Then, gently massage the rest into your scalp to remove any residue. Consider a dry shampoo for chemically treated hair that can add some moisture and volume., Even the gentlest perm can strip hair of moisture, making it look dull and frizzy. Although some think that conditioner can relax your perm, it’s actually a myth. Conditioner formulated for permed hair will restore moisture and luster to your locks, keep your hair soft, and make your perm last longer. It also helps detangle curls.


Apply conditioner first by putting it on your ends, which are the driest part of your hair. Then extend the conditioner up towards your roots. Leave on the conditioner for the time specified by your product. Use warm water to rinse out the conditioner. Make sure that all of the product is removed. Remember that not rinsing long enough can leave residue that will weigh down your curls, make them appear dull, and can attract dirt to your hair.Comb your wet hair using a wide-tooth comb while the conditioner is still in it. This will minimize hair breakage.Use a treatment mask for permed or stressed hair once a week. Treatment masks are heavier than your usual conditioner and can give your hair an occasional boost of moisture. They can help keep your hair from getting more damaged and restore moisture and shine. Either leave on your treatment mask in the shower or consider putting it on overnight with a shower cap.Consider using leave-in conditioning treatments if your hair is very dry or stressed.

, Detangle your hair carefully with a wide-toothed comb after you’ve finished rinsing your hair. Don't comb your hair too often to avoid breaking or damage your strands. This can also make your hair frizzy and lose its shape more quickly than if you only comb after a shower.Make sure the teeth of your comb are spaced widely apart so that your curls are not split into little pieces that may frizz.
Comb your hair after you’ve applied conditioner while it's still wet, which helps prevent breakage. If you comb while in the shower, you shouldn’t need to comb it again once you’ve rinsed.
Use your fingers to comb your hair if you don’t have a wide-toothed comb.

, No matter how you detangle your hair, never use a brush on permed hair. This will separate your curls and can cause your hair to be frizzy. In addition, brushing may damage delicate permed strands., The best way to keep your curls bouncy and looking fresh is to scrunch them a bit with your fingers. This beauty basic can enhance your new style and create soft sultry waves.Use your hands and fingers to gently lift and scrunch up individual sections of your hair. Mist your hair with water and hold for a few seconds to better define your curls. You can also define individual curls by wrapping them around one or two fingers and holding for a few seconds.

, A hair dryer can sap moisture from any person’s hair. But if you have permed hair, it can damage already stressed hair and make it frizzy. Either allow your hair to air dry or put a diffuser on a blow drier to help define and protect your curls.


Set your hair dryer on the coolest setting possible. If you can, put the drier on a cool setting or hold down the “cold blast” button.
A diffuser attachment disperses the airflow of the hair dryer. Install your diffuser on the end of your dryer. Either turn over your entire head for extra volume and defined curls or dry individual sections. Scrunching each section as you diffuse it will make your curls bouncy.

, Just like with a hair dryer, use heated tools sparingly. Curling and flat irons can damage already stressed out tresses and may even cause your hair to break.


Try using steam to your benefit. You could wrap your hair in a few rollers for curls or even just put on a shower cap. Then get in the shower and let the steam from the warm water reactivate your curls. This can add moisture and volume to your hair without causing it more damage.

, Your hair will continue to grow and extra weight can weigh down your curls. Getting regular trims can keep your curls bouncy and your hair healthy. See your stylist every 4-6 weeks for a trim.


Ask your stylist to trim off the bare minimum if you’re concerned about losing length. Your stylist may even tell you that you can wait longer in between trims.

, Perms can last for anywhere from 6 weeks to 8 months. Caring for your perm will maintain it longer. However, once your curls start to fall apart and you have a lot of visible roots, you’ll need to get another perm.Consider only getting your roots re-permed so that your other hair doesn’t get damaged. Talk to your stylist about your best options.

, If you decide that you want to grow out your perm, you can do it without much headache. Caring for your hair with special products and little heat can keep it looking good during in-between stages. Remember that the permed hair will continue to be delicate so give it the best care you can.

It’s always a good idea to have any spots on your skin checked by a dermatologist. Once your dermatologist has verified that the spots are merely cosmetic, you can take measures to reduce the appearance of the spots.

, Dermatologists often talk about the “ABCDEs” of skin cancer-- ways to distinguish between skin cancer and a benign (non-cancerous) growth. Skin cancer tends to be:Assymetric
With uneven Borders (edges)
With varied Colors (Different shades of brown, black and tan)
Larger in Diameter (>¼ inch or > 6mm)

Evolving (changing) in size, shape, color, how much above the skin surface they are raised etc)

, Most cancerous spots are marked by change, so keeping track of the way your skin looks can help you with early detection. Depending on factors such as time spent exposed to UV rays and family history, you may need to have your skin checked regularly by a professional dermatologist.

Keep your hands off your face.",How to Get Rid of Dark Spots on Your Face," Since dark spots can be caused by a number of different factors, learning about the different types will give you a head start when it comes to figuring out how to get rid of them. Here are the three different types of hyperpigmentation:Lentigines. These are dark spots caused by exposure to UV rays from the sun. 90 percent of people over the age of 60 have them, but many much younger men and women have sun-related dark spots as well. The spots appear scattered in no particular pattern.

Melasma. This type of dark spots are caused by hormonal fluctuations. Women might see darker splotches appear on their cheeks during times when their hormones are in flux, like during pregnancy or menopause. It's also a side effect of birth control pills and hormone therapy treatments. Melasma can also occur as a result of thyroid dysfunction .

Post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH). These are dark spots that occur as a result of trauma to the skin, which can be caused by psoriasis, burns, acne, and certain skin care treatments that are hard on the skin.;
, Once you know what you're dealing with, you'll be able to choose a course of treatment and start making lifestyle changes to prevent more dark spots from showing up. Ask yourself these questions to determine what's behind your dark spots:


Do you frequently use a tanning bed or go tanning in the sun? If you tend to get high sun exposure and you don't wear much sunscreen, you might have valentines. Topical treatments and avoidance of sun exposure are the best way to get rid of this type of hyperpigmentation.
Do you have a current medical condition for which you're on medication? Are you pregnant, on birth control, or taking hormone therapy? It's possible you have melanoma. This can be difficult to treat, but there are certainly methods that can make a difference.
Have you had severe acne, plastic surgery, or other long-term skin conditions? You could have PIH, which responds well to topical treatments and may go away with time.

, The dermatologist will have a special magnifying lamp he or she can use to take a close look at your skin to determine what's behind your dark spots. In addition to conducting a physical examination, the doctor will also ask you a series of questions about your lifestyle to help figure out what's going on. The dermatologist will advise the best course of action for treating your existing dark spots and preventing more from showing up.


Since hyperpigmentation is a common condition for which many people seek treatment, there are a lot of products and treatments on the market promising to make the dark spots go away, fast. Seeing a dermatologist will help you sort through what ingredients work and which ones don't.Some of the best treatments for dark spots are available by prescription only, which is another good reason to see a dermatologist for further treatment.
Finally, it's important to rule out melanoma or another type of skin cancer as the potential culprit behind one or more of your dark spots. Getting a regular full-body examination every year is an important way to catch skin cancer before it advances., If you've only had the dark spots for a month or two, they may be contained within the top few layers of your skin. You might be able to get rid of them by simply exfoliating your face. Exfoliation is the process of removing the top layer of skin, bringing new skin to the surface.


Find an exfoliating cleanser that contains tiny particles that gently scrub the skin to take off the top layer. You can also make your own by mixing ground raw almonds or ground oatmeal into your regular cleanser. Apply it to the dark spots in a circular motion.
Electric exfoliators such as the clarisonic dig a little deeper than your standard exfoliating cleanser. They work by gently scraping the dead skin cells from your face. You can find them online or in drugstores.

, These are available both by prescription and over the counter. They contain alpha hydroxy acids, beta hydroxy acids or retinoids. The application of these different acids removes the top layer of dead skin cells, allowing fresh cells to grow so that the skin is rejuvenated. These treatments are used to treat hyperpigmentation of all types.


Alpha-hydroxy acids include glycolic acid, mandelic acid, citric acid, lactic acid and others. These acids are often derived from produce and other food products. They exfoliate the skin effectively, but are gentle enough for people with sensitive skin. Alpha-hydroxy acids can be found in serums, creams, moisturizers and peels.
Beta-hydroxy acid is also known as salicylic acid. It's a common ingredient in over-the-counter acne medications and skin treatments.Salicylic acid can be applied in a cream, serum, cleanser or peel.
Retinoic acid is also known as tretinoin, or Retin-A. Retinoic acid is a form of Vitamin A. It's a very effective treatment for acne and dark spots. It is available in creams and gels, only by prescription in the United States.
If you're looking for an over-the-counter product, try to find one that contains a combination of these ingredients: hydroquinone, cucumber, soy, kojic acid, calcium, azelaic acid, or arbutin., If surface treatments don't sufficiently fade your dark spots, you might consider a chemical peel. Chemical peels literally remove the top layers of your skin. They often contain the acids describe above in high concentrations. They are classified by three levels of strength: light, medium and deep.Light chemical peels usually include alpha-hydroxy acids. Glycolic acid and lactic acid are common ingredients. They're considered the most effective peels for dark spots.
Medium chemical peels include TCA, or trichloroacetic acid. Many recommend this peel for dark spots due to sun damage. For best results, it is usually repeated every two weeks until the spots have sufficiently faded. These peels are generally not recommended for people with darker complexions as they can cause more dark spots to appear after the skin has healed.
Deep chemical peels contain phenol, or carbolic acid, as their active ingredient. They are often used for deep wrinkles, but also for correcting severe sun damage. Phenol peels are very strong, and are administered under anesthesia. It may take several months for results to show as the skin heals.

, Microdermabrasion is a procedure that uses very fine crystals to ""sandblast"" the dark spots off your skin.A new, fresh layer of skin grows in place of the skin that was removed. Treatments are usually done once a month over several months.


Find an experienced practitioner. Abrading the skin can cause irritation, making the discoloration worse. If someone does it wrong, you might end up very disappointed with the results.
Microdermabrasion should not be done too often, since your skin needs time to heal between treatments.

, Laser treatment, also called Intense Pulsed Light (IPL) therapy, uses quick pulses of light to destroy dark-spot causing melanin. The pigmented areas absorb the light and shatter or vaporize. Your body heals the spot by forming a scab and growing new, fresh, unpigmented skin in its place. Laser treatment is highly effective, but expensive, and can be painful.


Laser treatment is usually the best option when the spots have been there for a long time. Dark spots you've had for a year or longer are deep within the skin, and topical treatments won't be able to reach them.
If you have very light skin, 4 or 5 laser treatments may be needed before the spots are completely gone., Citrus fruits contain abundant amounts of Vitamin C, also known as ascorbic acid, along with citric acid. These acids help slough off the top layer of skin without causing damage. Here are some ways to use them.


Squeeze some juice and dab it on your skin. Women have used straight lemon juice to lighten their skin for centuries, but you can use an orange, grapefruit or lime if you prefer. Slice the fruit in half and squeeze the juice into a cup or bowl. Using a cotton ball, dab it onto your dark spots. Leave it on for 20 minutes, then rinse off. Repeat once or twice a day.
Make a lemon and honey face mask. Combine the juice of half a lemon with 2 teaspoons of honey. Mix well, and apply to your face. Leave it on for 30 minutes, then rinse well.
Make a citrus and powdered milk scrub. Combine 1 teaspoon each of water, powdered milk and the juice of your favorite citrus fruit. Mix into a soft paste and massage into your skin. Rinse well.

, You can use Vitamin E as a topical treatment alone, or boost its benefits by also eating foods high in Vitamin E.



Topical application: Massage pure Vitamin E oil directly onto your dark spots. With daily application, your spots will fade.

Dietary sources: Add these foods to your diet to get even more Vitamin E power: nuts (almonds, peanuts, pine nuts), sunflower seeds, wheat germ oil, and dried apricots.

, Papaya fruit contains the enzyme papain. Papain helps exfoliate the skin, making way for new skin cells to emerge. Papaya also contains Vitamin C and Vitamin E, so it's a dark spot fading superstar. Papain is most concentrated while the papaya is still green, but you can use riper fruit as well. Peel and remove the seeds from a papaya, and try one of the following treatments:


Slice a piece off of the papaya, and lay or hold it on the dark spots that you want to get rid of. Hold it there for 20-30 minutes. Repeat twice a day for best results.
Make a papaya facial mask. Cut the papaya into chunks, then use a blender or food processor to blend the fruit into a smooth paste. Apply the mask to your face and neck. Leave it on for about 30 minutes, then rinse well.

, The aloe vera plant has many health benefits. It's an excellent moisturizer, and is effective for healing sunburns. It can also help fade dark spots. If you have an aloe plant at home, break off a small piece, squeeze the pulp into your hand and apply it directly to your dark spots. You can also find aloe gel in stores. Pure aloe vera will work best, so make sure you're purchasing a 100% aloe vera product.

, Onions have acidic properties that act to lighten dark spots on skin. It's worth a try if you don't have a lemon on hand! Peel a red onion, cut it into chunks, and process it in either a juicer or a blender. Use a cotton ball to dab some of the onion on your dark spots, and let it sit for 15 minutes before rinsing it off., Exposure to UV rays is one of the most common causes of dark spots. No matter what kind of dark spots you have, staying out in the sun too long can make the problem worse. As far as prevention goes, staying away from these harmful rays is the best thing you can do to protect yourself. Take the following measures to keep your skin safe from too much exposure to UV rays:


Wear sunscreen. Even in the winter, wear sunscreen on your face with SPF 15 or higher.
In strong, direct sun, wear a hat and sunglasses. Cover the rest of your face with strong sunscreen.
Don't use tanning beds. The direct exposure to UV rays is harmful to your skin (as well as internal organs).
Don't sunbathe. When your tan fads, dark spots will be left behind.

, If you have melasma that's caused by medications you're on, you might be able to get rid of dark spots by switching to a different medication. Talk with your doctor to discuss your concerns and see if there's something else you could take that doesn't have this side effect.

, Hyperpigmentation can result from a skin treatment that wasn't properly administered. Plastic surgery or deep chemical peels can end up leaving dark spots behind. Before you get any kind of skin treatment, do thorough research to make sure the technician or physician has plenty of experience in the area and a good track record.

, Whenever you find a pimple on your face, do not try to press, rub or touch it. The more you touch a pimple, the more are the chances of developing a dark spot. Remember, dark spots arise as pimples vanish!

Apply a leave-in conditioner to wet hair to return your hair to the 4.5 to 5.5 natural acidity, if your hair is naturally dry or damaged.",How to Balance pH in Hair Naturally," There are a number of conditions that can indicate the pH of your hair. It is important to establish a general pH before you can balance it to the healthy level.


If you have problems with flaky, itchy, dry scalp, eczema, fungi or bacteria on your scalp, it is likely that your scalp and hair are too alkali. Usually, this means that you are using a product that has a high pH above 7, and it is stripping away your naturally acidic sebum that fights bacteria. Lower pH shampoos may also cause less frizzing and breakage. This is why a shampoo with a pH of 6 or 7 should be used.If you have permanently dyed or relaxed hair, your hair was first treated with a highly alkali substance to expose and change the hair's cuticle, and then, it was ""neutralized"" with a highly acidic substance to flatten the cuticle again. This is a damaging process and slightly acidic hair products are needed to keep the hair cuticle lying flat.
If you have curly hair, then your cuticle is already partially open. It is especially important for people with curly hair to return their hair to a slightly acidic pH level, since the open cuticle prevents natural acidic sebum to keep the entire hair at a pH level between 4.5 and 5.5.
If you have straight hair, you should use hair-care products that are pH balanced, but may not need to apply extra products because the sebum moves through your hair, creating a natural pH balance.;
, If they do not say they are pH balanced for your hair, then they should be tested to see how they affect your hair. A pH between 4 to 7 works well on hair.


Buy test strips online or from beauty supply stores. Pour your liquid product into a glass, stick the test strip into the glass for the amount of time the strip directions indicate. Remove the strip and compare it to the diagram to find the pH of the product. Discontinue the use of any product outside of the 4 to 7 pH range.

, Rinse your hair. This will return your hair to a neutral, rather than acidic pH level. Water has a pH level of 7, so it is more alkali than your hair.

, You can pour aloe vera juice in a bottle and mist it over your hair. This will also close the cuticle and remove frizz.


You can also use apple cider vinegar. It has a pH level of about 3. It should be diluted with water until it has a pH level of 4. Many people prefer aloe vera gel because the vinegar smell is too strong. If you rinse your hair after using the natural acid, the water will deactivate the acid.







, Use a homemade leave-in conditioner composed of the following recipe.


Pour 2 tbsp. (30 ml) of a silicone-free conditioner, 2 tbsp. (30 ml) of whole-leaf aloe vera juice and 2 tsp. (10 ml) of jojoba oil into a bowl. Mix well with a spoon and use a pH test strip to ensure the pH is not under 4.5.
Apply the mixture to damp, washed hair. Allow it to dry and style as usual.

Examine the final results.",How to Balayage," To get this look at home, you'll need three separate boxes of hair dye: a dark shade, a medium shade, and a light shade.


The dark dye should be one to two shades lighter than your natural hair color. It will be used to color your roots.
The medium dye should be two shades lighter than the dark dye. You'll use it to create an ombre effect on the tips/ends of your hair.
The light dye should be at least two shades lighter than the medium dye. In many cases, hair bleach is an acceptable choice. This shade will be used to add the trademark highlights of the balayage style.

, Most hair kits will come with a developer. If you need to purchase one separately, however, opt for a 20-percent concentration.


Avoid developers with 30-percent through 50-percent concentrations. These are professional level developers and, if applied improperly, can cause major damage to your hair.

, Part your hair down the center and tie it back into two even pigtails at the sides of your head.


Tie the pigtails off just below your ears.
You'll dye the hair beneath the ties during this part of the process, but the hair above the hair tie will be left untouched.;
, Gently tug on the hair above the ties to loosen some of the strands. Continue as desired to create messier pigtails.


If you dye neat, even pigtails, you'll end up with a visible line between the dark and light sections of your hair. Messing up your pigtails before dyeing them will help prevent this, creating a more natural look as a result.
You should also completely pull out a small, 1/2-inch (1.25-cm) thick section from the front of each pigtail. These two sections should frame your face.

, Mix the hair dye with the developer according to the instructions on your box of hair dye.


The process can vary depending on which product you use, so you must read and follow the package instructions.
Usually, you will need to mix equal parts dye and developer in a disposable plastic bowl. Mix the dye using a dye brush until the two are evenly blended.

, Thoroughly lather the medium dye into the loose hair using gloved hands.You need to apply the dye to all of the loose hair hanging from the ends of your pigtails.
Also apply dye to the two sections of hair framing your face. Start at the bridge of your nose and paint these sections down to the very tips.

, Leave the dye in your hair for the manufacturer's recommended amount of time, then rinse it out with lukewarm water.


The exact amount of time can vary depending on the dye you use, but you should expect to wait roughly 45 minutes.
After you rinse the dye away, you should give your hair a rest by waiting a few more days before continuing with the next part of the process.

, Use a comb to section off the bottom layer of hair. Tie the remaining sections into a top knot to keep them out of the way.


During this part of the process, you will dye the remaining portions of your natural hair color to make the transition into your medium color look more natural.
If the transition between your medium dye and natural color already looks fairly natural, you can skip this section completely and begin the final part of the process.

, Using a clean dye brush, mix the dark hair dye and developer in a disposable plastic bowl until evenly blended.


Follow the instructions on the back of the dye box carefully.
While the exact instructions may vary from dye to dye, you will usually need to mix equal parts dye and developer.

, Dip the dye brush into the dark dye and carefully apply the dye to the dark roots of your hair.


Only apply dye to the bottom section of hair still hanging down.
Paint from the natural root to the start of your medium hair color. You can overlap onto the medium dye slightly, but you should not cover it by much.

, Carefully undo the top knot and release another layer of hair.


Tie up the remaining upper layers in another top knot again.

, As before, paint the naturally colored roots of this section with your prepared dark dye.


Paint from the roots down to the lightened portion of hair.
Make sure that you apply dye to the roots around your face, as well.

, Continue to release and dye the layers of your hair in the same manner, applying the dark dye only to the naturally colored roots of each layer.


Repeat this pattern until you reach the top middle portion of your hair.
When finished, the hair along your scalp should be completely saturated with dye, but the previously dyed eyes should all remain dry.

, Let the dye remain in your hair for the manufacturer's recommended amount of time. Rinse it out with lukewarm water when ready.


Expect to wait for about 45 minutes. This amount of time can vary depending on the dye used, however.
Once the dye has been rinsed out, you should wait a few more days before continuing on to the final part of the process. Doing so will give your hair a chance to rest and minimize the risk of damage.

, Part your hair down the center, then separate each side into four or five sections.Use a comb to evenly separate the hair from your forehead to the nape of your neck.
The number of sections may vary depending on the thickness of your hair, but each section should be about 2 inches (5 cm) wide. Keep the sections separate by tying each one into a small ponytail.

, Remove the hair tie from the top ponytail on one side of your head. Gently tease some of the hair out of this section using the tail end of your comb or dye brush.


The easiest way to do this is by weaving the tail through the section of hair in a zigzag motion.

If you cannot zigzag through the hair, twist the section and gently tease some of the hair out of the twist by brushing upwards with the teeth of the comb., After teasing the first section, you should be left with two distinct portions of hair. One will by dyed and the other will be left alone.


Tie the top section into a small bun or knot at the back of your head. That section will be left alone.
Tie the loose hair into another small ponytail toward the front of your head. Keep the tie high and fairly close to your scalp. This section will be highlighted with your light dye.

, Separate each of the remaining ponytails into two sections following the same procedure used for the first ponytail.


Leave the bottom ponytail on either side of your head alone. These two ponytails are the only ones you should not twist apart and separate.
When finished, you should have six to eight buns at the back of your head, depending on how many sections you originally started with. These buns will all be left alone.

You should also have eight to ten ponytails hanging down toward the front of your head, depending on how many sections you started with. These ponytails will all be dyed again during this part of the process.



, Following the package instructions, mix the light hair dye and developer.


The instructions will vary depending on the dye you use, but generally, you will need to mix equal parts dye and developer until evenly blended. Use a clean dye brush to mix the dye in a disposable plastic bowl.

, Use gloved hands to work the dye into each ponytail. Thoroughly coat all of the loose ends hanging from each hair tie.


For less dramatic highlights, consider applying the dye to the bottom two-thirds of each ponytail only.
Do not apply dye to any of the hair separated into buns. The buns should remain completely dry and untouched during this part of the process.

, Allow the dye to sit for approximately 45 minutes, then rinse it out with lukewarm water.


Follow the manufacturer's recommended amount of time. This may or may not be 45 minutes.
After rinsing the dye away, wash your hair with dye-safe shampoo and apply dye-safe conditioner. Dry your hair as usual.

, At this point, the entire process should be complete and the results should be ready to show off.

Wash your hair with a volumizing shampoo.,

Work a volumizing mousse or gel through your hair.,

Choose a section of hair to backcomb.,
Tease the hair backward.,
Repeat with the next small section of hair.,
Use a comb to smooth out the top layer.,
Finish styling your look however you desire.,
Finished.

",How to Back Comb," If you're going for extreme body, this is a good first step. Pick a shampoo that is labeled as ""volumizing.""


Shampoos labeled as ""clarifying"" are also a good choice when it comes to getting more volume. They'll clean away conditioning agents and oils that might be weighing your hair down.
Don't use shampoos that are made for dry hair if what you want is volume. These contain conditioners that might make your hair flatter.;
, Again, you want to go with a brand that says it will add volume, rather than smooth your hair down. If you want, skip the conditioner; when your hair is on the dryer side, it will have more texture, helping the backcomb style stay in place.

, Start at the roots, and spread it through to the ends. For best results, run a brush through your hair after applying to help distribute the product evenly.








, This helps create volume since the hair can dry virtually weightless.









Use a low temperature setting to add volume but prevent heat damage from occurring.

Using a diffuser is a way to preserve some natural wave and volume.

, Determine what part of your hair needs volume, and grasp a small section of hair in your hand. Hold the hair straight upward, and pull it taut so that none of the strands can escape.


A lot of people like to start with the section of hair on top, right above the forehead. Adding a little lift right there can make a dramatic difference.

, Place your brush or a fine-tooth comb about halfway between your hair's roots and your hand, and apply firm brush strokes downward toward the scalp. Repeat this motion until there is a cushion of hair at the base of the hair section. Use your hair spray to help hold the back combing.









At this point your hair will look wild. That's totally normal! If you backcombed it correctly, your hair should look like you haven't combed it in days. You can smooth out the top layer to hide the tangles later.

, Continue until you have volume in all the areas you desire. Most people use the technique on the top and sides of the head.








, Place your comb at your roots and gently comb out the very top layer of hair so that it hides the backcombed sections. You need enough pressure to blend the hair together to cover or hide the back combed areas but not enough to flatten out the areas where you just added volume. Your hair should appear smooth and full, and the back combing should not be visible.








, Add extra hair spray where necessary to hold the look.


Backcombing can be used to create gorgeous dreads.
Backcombing is the first step to creating the classic French twist.

Choose the right conditioner for your hair type.,
Wash your hair.,
Rinse out your shampoo.,
Wring out your hair.,
Apply your conditioner.,
Let the conditioner set.,
Rinse out the conditioner.",How to Apply Conditioner to Your Hair1," A traditional conditioner is applied every time you shower, just after you rinse out your shampoo. This type of conditioner works to repair the damage done by hot tools, chemicals, and general wear-and-tear that your hair experiences on a daily basis. Choose a type of conditioner that is advertised for your specific hair needs; whether you have curly and frizzy hair, dry and damaged hair, colored hair, fine hair, relaxed hair, or limp and lank hair, there is a specific conditioner that can help with each.;
, Hop in the shower, and go along with your regular washing routine. You’ll condition your hair after you wash it, so give your scalp and strands a good scrubbing with your favorite shampoo. Focus most of your washing power on the scalp, being careful not to tug at your wet hair as you wash as this can damage the ends and cause more breakage.

, Use warm water to wash out the shampoo. Warm water is safer on your hair than hot water is. Be careful not to tug on the strands if you run your fingers through it. When your hair feels ‘squeaky’, you’ve rinsed out all the shampoo.

, If your hair is sopping wet, any conditioner you try to apply will run right off and won’t stick long enough to affect your hair. If your hair is very short, you probably won’t have to do much wringing. If, however, you have long hair, spend a bit of time getting as much water out of it as you can.

, Pour a bit of conditioner into the palm of your hand; the amount you need will vary depending on the length of your hair. A dime-sized amount is usually recommended for professional conditioners, while drug store brands may require more because they can be diluted.If your hair is very long, you may need a whole palm-full of conditioner. Run this through the ends of your hair, trying to apply it to every strand that you’re able. Your conditioner should be applied only to the ends of your hair, as this is the part that is damaged (it’s the oldest). Putting conditioner near your scalp and roots can actually clog your follicles, and slow hair growth/increase oil production.

, This step is slightly optional; the longer you wait and allow your conditioner to set, the more it will be able to do to improve the health of your hair. If you’re in a rush, you can rinse it out nearly immediately after, but it won’t make your hair as soft and shiny as it normally would. Try applying your conditioner, and then washing the rest of your body/face while it sets. Then when you’re finished (normally a minute or two later), you can rinse out your conditioner for maximum effect.

, Assuming you’ve turned the water temperature back up for comfort’s sake, turn it back down as cold as you can handle it. As aforementioned, the cold water is healthier for your hair. Spend a few minutes rinsing out the conditioner; if your hair still feels ‘slimy’, then you haven’t gotten it all out. When your hair is smooth and no longer feels super slippery, then you’re set! Wring out your hair and you’re done conditioning.

Try a top mohawk with braids.",How to Braid Short Hair," Use a comb to draw a part down the center of your hairline. Brush the hair flat on either side of this part.For this style, you'll need to create two standard braids along the front sides of your head. These braids should roughly mirror one another in position, width, and length.
This style is good for very short hair, as you can decide to braid only a portion of your short hair if you do not have enough hair to put it all back in a braid.;
, Gather approximately 3 inches (7.6 cm) of hair toward the front of your face, working to the right of the part.


If you have short bangs that you wish to keep out of the braid, begin the section immediately behind the right end of your bangs.
If you have long bangs that you want to include in the braid, split the bangs in half down the center. Include the right half of your bangs in this first section and the left half of your bangs in the second section.

, Split the gathered section of hair into three portions. Try to make each portion equal in length and width.

, Braid the three separated portions into a standard braid. Direct the braid so that it points down and toward the back of your ear.


Cross the left portion of hair over the middle section. The previous left portion now becomes the new middle portion.
Cross the right portion over the new middle portion to complete one full braid.
Repeat as many times as needed until the braid reaches your desired length.

, Tie the end of the braid with a small hair elastic, then use a bobby pin the tack the loose end to the unbraided hair at the side of your head.

, Create an identical braid on the left side of your part by following the same steps used to create the first braid.


Separate the section into three portions, then braid those portions down toward the back of your ear.
Note that the two braids don't need to be exactly identical, but they should look very similar to one another to maintain enough symmetry.

, Check your braids in the mirror and redo them if necessary. Once they look the way you want them to look, the style is done and ready to show off.

, Use a comb to draw your part along either side of your head. Brush the hair on both sides of this part to keep it smooth.To create this look, you'll create a partial French braid that drapes down along one side of your head. As you form the braid, though, you'll leave some hair hanging down from beneath it, creating a “waterfall” effect.
This style may be better for individuals with short hair that comes to at least their shoulders or just above their shoulders. Alternatively, if your hair is very short you can try to do a waterfall braid on a section of your hair, not your entire head.

, Gather approximately 2 inches (5 cm) of hair toward the front of your face. This section of hair should be taken from the wider side of your part.


If you have long, sideswept bangs, your first section of hair will mostly consist of your bangs. If not, draw the section from the hair closest to your part and at the front of your face.

, Split the section of hair into three equal portions, then braid those portions together into one or two full braids.


To form a single braid, cross the left portion of hair over the middle portion, then cross the right portion of hair over the new middle portion (previous left portion).

, Gather a new portion of hair into the braid by drawing it from the top of your head.You'll add this hair to your braid using a traditional French braiding technique.


Pick up a section of hair directly next to the topmost section of your braid. The section should be roughly one-third as thick as the overall braid.
Draw the new portion together with the current topmost piece, essentially forming one large portion.
Create another single braid using this newly joined portion of hair.

, Gather a new portion of hair into the braid from beneath. Instead of incorporating it into a standard French braid, however, you'll use this new section as a substitute for an old section.


Pick up the second new portion will from directly beneath and behind the braid. Draw together a portion of hair roughly one-third as thick as the overall braid.
Drop the current bottom portion of the the braid and allow it to hang loose down the side of your head.
Create one new braid using the new bottom portion. Leave the previous bottom portion alone.

, Continue drawing new hair into the braid using the same technique as before. Braid the hair in this manner until you reach the back of your head.


Each new portion of hair taken from above the braid should be woven into the braid with the previous top portion.
Each new portion of hair taken from beneath the braid should be woven into the braid instead of the previous bottom portion.

, Tie the loose end of the braid off with a small elastic hair band. Allow the loose ends to hang down naturally off the back of your head.


Carefully brush the loose hair hanging from beneath your braid to remove any tangles and smooth out any frizz.

, Check your braid in the mirror. If you like the way it looks, the braid is done and ready to show off. If not, unbraid and redo until you have the desired look.

, Draw your desired part using a comb. This style works with both center and side parts alike.


Regardless of which part you choose, brush your hair flat on either side of the part after defining it.
For this style, you'll create one French braid on either side of the part and along the lower hairline. Afterward, you'll secure the two braids together, forming the shape of a crown. This style is also known as an “around the world” braid.
This style may be best for individuals with short hair that is at least to their shoulders or above their shoulders as it works best with more hair.

, Gather together three sections of hair along one side of your part. These sections should be roughly equal in length and width.


Each section should be about 1 inch (5 cm) wide. If you have long bangs, the front section will include hair from your bangs.

, Create one or two full standard braids from your original three sections of hair.


A single full braid includes all three sections of hair. Cross the back portion over the middle, turning the previous back portion into the new middle in the process. Complete the braid by crossing the front portion over the new middle, turning the front into the newest middle.

, Draw two new portions of hair into the current braid. Create one full braid with each new section to begin your French braid.


The first new section should come from the top of your head and further back along your part. Combine this new section with the current topmost section of your braid, then create one new braid using the newly combined portion.
The second new section should come from in front of your braid and just beneath it. Combine this section into the current bottom section of the braid, then create one new braid using the combined portion.

, Continue French braiding down the side of your head. Work around the entire lower hairline, drawing in all of the hair from beneath your braid as you do.


Pay special attention to the hair around your ear. This hair will need to be braided tightly to create the most flattering appearance possible.

, Once you reach the center back of your head, braid any remaining loose hair on that side into a standard braid. Tie off the end with a small hair elastic.

, Braid the hair at the other side of your part by following the same steps used for your first braid.


Pick up three equal portions of hair along the other side of your part.
French braid the hair on the opposite side of your head, leaving no loose-hanging hair in the process. Continue along the lower hairline in this manner.
Braid down as much of the loose ends as possible into a standard braid, then secure the end with an elastic hair tie.

, Crisscross the hanging ends, then tuck them beneath the braids to hide them from view.Depending on how tight your braids are, tucking in the ends can be a difficult challenge. Work carefully to avoid pulling out the braid, and hide the unbraided ends and hair ties as best as possible.
Note that you'll probably need to insert a few bobby pins through the tucked ends to help hold them in place.

, Use your fingers or the handle of a rat-tail comb to carefully pick up and loosen each individual braid.


Only pull on each braid enough to give it a little more body. Do not pull hard enough to completely undo the braid.
Skip over the sides and focus on the front and back of the braid. Doing so will add volume to the braid without sacrificing an appealing face shape.

, Check your halo braid in the mirror and make any desired adjustments. Once you're satisfied with the way it looks, you should be ready to show it off.


If the top of your head looks too flat or slick, carefully swipe your hand over the hair, working it back and forth several times. Doing so should gently loosen and volumize the hair there, making it messy and natural without destroying the braid.

, To make styling easier, you should use natural hair oil on your scalp and massage the oil into your hair. Use natural oils like jojoba or coconut and avoid heavy oils like lanolin, petroleum, and mineral oils. These oils will clog up your scalp and attract dirt and dust.You can also use a boar bristle brush to brush the oil into your hair to make it easier to braid. If you have very thick, afro-textured hair, you can skip this step as it can make your hair more frizzy.

, It will be easier to work with your hair if you divide it into sections using a rat-tail comb. Divide your hair into two sections and clip each section with a hair clip. You can then focus on one section at a time.You can then decide if you are going to do simple braids where you braid each section into simple braids, creating two side braids or a more elaborate design like a top mohawk with braids.

, This is an easy option for afro-textured hair as it only requires you to know how to do simple braids. Because afro-textured hair can be very thick and tricky to work with, many people do small side braids in a row rather than two big side braids.Start with one section and do a small braid with 1/4 of the hair on one side. Start the braid just above your ear, at the top of your hairline. Collect hair as you braid, forming a small braid that lies flat against your scalp. Pull the hair so it is taunt but not too hard, as you do not want to damage your hair or your scalp. Once the braid is done, use a bobby pin to secure it.
Then, make another small braid above the braid you just created. Make sure the braid starts right at your hair line and is parallel to the first braid. Secure this braid with a bobby pin.
Finish with one more small braid above the second braid. It should start at your hair line and move parallel to the second braid. There should now be three braids on one side of your hair, forming diagonal lines.
Repeat these steps on the other side of your head. You should now how small braids on either side of your head, framing the rest of your hair. You can then leave the rest of your hair natural or finger curl it using your fingers and hair oil.

, This option is a more elaborate braided hair style and may require a second set of hands or help from a professional hair dresser who knows how to work with afro-textured hair. If you are experienced with braiding your hair type, you may be able to do this one at home.Divide your hair into four sections and pin each section with a hair clip. Then, unclip the section at the front end of your hair, right above your ear. You will then braid a small section of the hair above your hair moving upward. Pull the hair taunt but not too tight as you braid upward. You want the braids to be as vertical as possible. When you reach the top of your head, pin the braid and then let the rest of your hair sit on your head.
Move on to braid the next small section of the front section of your hair. Make the braid vertical and tight, leaving the remaining hair from the braid loose once you reach the top of your head.
Repeat these steps, moving from section to section of your hair. The braids should all be vertical and in line with each other. Keep the hair at the end of the braids lose and let it sit on your head. This hair will act as the top mohawk.
Once you have finished braiding your hair into vertical braids, you should have a row of 9-10 braids on each side of your head. You can then style the mohawk using hair oil and your fingers for a fun look.

Comb through your hair.",How to Apply Conditioner to Your Hair2," As with regular conditioner, there are many varieties of leave-in conditioner depending on your needs. There are two general styles of leave-in conditioner: cream and spray-on. The former variety is best for thick, long, or curly hair, as it weighs down the strands a bit. The latter variety is best for thin or straight hair, as it is a bit lighter-weight.

, Go about your regular hair treatment regimen. Leave-in conditioner does not need to be rinsed out (as the name suggests) but does need to be applied to damp hair. Use the aforementioned directions for washing and conditioning your hair, and then towel-dry it so that it is just damp.

, Most products will recommend a pea-sized amount for medium length hair of average thickness, but the amount will vary from person to person. You can always add more product to your hair, so begin with less than you think you will need.

, Rub your hands together to thin out the conditioner a bit, and then begin running it through the ends of your locks. As with regular conditioner, avoid getting it near your scalp or the roots of your hair; keep it on the most damaged (oldest) parts of your hair, typically from half the length downwards.

, Use a wide-tooth comb to brush your hair after applying the leave-in conditioner. This will spread the product out even further, and help to avoid clumps of the conditioner from making certain sections of your hair greasy while others are left dry."

Therefore, there aren’t too many ‘types’ of deep conditioner to choose from, just different brands. Find a deep conditioner that meets your hair and budget needs.

, Rinse through your hair with warm or cool water (the colder the better). You can choose to shampoo your hair first if you would like, but all you really need to do is to get all of your hair wet. When you’re finished wring it out, removing as much extra water as you can.

, Scoop some of the conditioner out of the container with your hands, and apply a thick coating to your entire head. Focus most of the conditioner on the ends of your hair, but feel free to spread it all the way to your roots. Be sure to separate any large chunks of hair so that each strand gets a thorough coating.

, Apply a shower cap to your head to keep your hair off your clothes/away from your face. Follow the directions for your specific conditioner, and leave it to cure. Typically, it should take between 20-30 minutes for the conditioner to work its magic. If you want an added boost, you can set your hair dryer on ‘warm’ and heat up the conditioner as it sets.

, Remove the shower cap, and turn your water on as cold as you can handle it. Spend 3-5 minutes rinsing out all of the deep conditioner, being careful not to leave any extra to set in your hair. When your hair no longer feels ‘slimy’, you’ve likely removed all of the conditioner. At this point you are free to dry and style your hair as you wish."

If your hair is already tangled, move slowly and gently, working through knots with careful movements.


The thicker your hair is, the more sections you should use. Brushing through small sections of hair will aid in keeping hair smooth and frizz-free, which can help prevent knots.
Once you have combed through all sections, run the brush once or twice through all of your hair to minimize the appearance of parts and sections.;
, If your hair is tangled, moving from root to end can make knots worse. Instead, grasp your hair by the middle of the hair shaft, and brush from the middle down. Work your way up, gently easing any tangles that might have developed.This is a great way to avoid tangles, as well; brushing from the mid-shaft down, then going from the root down will sort through any stray hair or flyaways, and will help your brush avoid yanking.

, To keep knots at bay, avoid brushing wet hair. Brushing wet hair can cause breakage, which increases the risk of developing tangles. Instead, brush hair only when damp or dry. If you cannot avoid brushing wet hair, do so with a wooden, wide-toothed comb, and move slowly and gently.Even with a wide-toothed comb, you should approach any existing knots gently. Separate the knot as much as possible with your fingers, then move on to combing.

, Fine-toothed combs are great for short hair (think 1-2 inches and shorter) and facial hair, but are very quickly damaging to medium-length and long hair. Instead of a fine-toothed comb, use a wide-toothed comb.Although plastic will do, plastic combs often have small barbs and rough edges that can damage hair. If possible, use a comb made of wood or bamboo for a smoother, gentler finish.

, Once you’ve worked through your hair with a comb, brush your hair (morning and night) with a boar-bristle brush. Boar-bristle brushes are gentle on the hair shaft and spread natural oils evenly throughout the hair, leading to fuller, moisturized, healthy hair, rather than dry or brittle hair.Dry, brittle hair results in knots and tangles, so minimizing dryness is a must. When brushing with a boar bristle brush, brush in sections, and finish by turning your head upside-down, brushing from the base of your hairline to the crown of your head.

, When you shampoo, start at the root, and work your way to the middle of your hair, avoiding the ends altogether. Instead of scrunching your hair into a bun and lathering all of your hair with your shampoo, leave the ends of your hair down, and work your shampoo through your hair, massaging your scalp as you do so. If your ends have product in them or are oily, continue to spread shampoo through the ends. If not, however, avoid putting shampoo on the ends entirely, as this can dry your hair out, leading to more tangles.Shampooing can be extremely drying. If you are prone to dry hair, shampoo only once every other day, or even once per week.

, Whether or not you shampoo the ends of your hair, you ought to condition them. Starting at the middle of the hair shaft, work conditioner down the hair shaft, avoiding the roots. This will keep the ends of your hair soft and pliable, while avoiding excess oil at the root.One of the most common causes of tangles is dryness. Keeping your hair moisturized and healthy will cut down on tangles.

, Regular trims will stave off split ends and breakage, which can lead to knots and tangles. If you notice split ends in between trims, you can even perform a quick trim yourself, or increase the frequency of your hair appointments. Split ends are usually caused by dry, damaged hair, so if you notice a recurrence of split ends, trim more often.If you do trim your hair yourself, instead of a licensed cosmetologist, avoid cutting extreme lengths, layers, and cutting straight across. Instead, cut in small sections, holding your scissors at a slight angle to keep the ends even.

, Like conditioner, hair oil can be used to smooth and moisten hair ends. You typically want to avoid using hair oil at the root, but can use a gentle hair oil from mid-shaft down.Not all oils are created equal. Although coconut and olive oil can be great for hair treatments, they are not ideal for everyday use, as they can weigh hair down. Opt for a thinner oil, such as argan, when searching for an everyday hair oil.
Less is more where hair oils are concerned. Use only one or two drops, rub the drops between your hands, and comb your hands through the ends of your hair. Your hair should not feel stringy or damp following the application of hair oil. If it does, you have used too much oil, or the oil is too thick.

, Sometimes, tangles will prevail despite your best efforts. In these cases, a detangler can help soften and loosen hair to make brushing through existing tangles and avoiding additional tangles easy. Even with a detangler, however, be careful to use a wide-toothed comb rather than a brush or fine-toothed comb.


When purchasing a detangler, pay close attention to the ingredients. The ingredients should be moisturizing (think oils), rather than drying. If a detangler has alcohol or other drying agents in it, it may do more harm than good.
If you do not have a detangling spray, mix ⅓ cup of filtered water, ⅓ cup of apple cider vinegar, and 1 teaspoon of oil. Using a spray bottle, spray this mixture onto your hair and comb through as usual., While placing your blow dryer underneath your hair and blowing up may give you added volume, it will also create a mass of tangles. Instead, blow dry your hair using a round brush or stiff-bristled brush, and pass the dryer along your hair shaft in smooth, long strokes.


Using a dryer too often can result in breakage. Avoid drying when you are able, and refrain from holding the dryer closer than 4-6 inches.

, Hair ties can contribute to breakage. Small rubber bands are particularly harmful, though thread-wrapped bands can also lead to breakage via the hair tie’s seam. To avoid breakage, use a nylon band whenever possible.


You can purchase nylon bands from your local supermarket, or you can make your own using an old pair of tights. To make your own, simply cut your tights into 1-inch strips width-wise.
Nylon bands will stretch out faster and easier than rubber bands, so expect to get only 2-3 months’ use out of each one. Because they don’t last as long, cutting up old, unused nylons is the more economical option.

, One of the easiest ways to tangle hair is to sleep on loose hair. Avoid going to sleep with loose hair, instead opting for a braid or loose bun. This will keep your hair strong and contained, and turning your head throughout the night will not result in knots.Use nylon hair ties during the night, especially, as you will likely experience some tossing and turning. Rubber bands can dig into the hair during this time, causing breakage overnight.
All sleep styles should be done loosely. A tight ponytail, bun, or braid will tug on hair and risk breakage. A loose french braid or loose, low bun are the safest options.

, If possible, do not go to sleep with wet hair. When hair is wet, it is far more prone to damage. Tossing and turning while your hair is drying can create frizz, rather than a smooth hair shaft, which leads to tangles. If you must sleep on wet hair, be sure to comb with a wide-toothed comb, and place in a braid or bun first.If you prefer showering at night, try to do so at least an hour before going to bed. On days when this is not possible, you can use a hair dryer on its lowest setting. If you do this, be sure to brush your hair before getting into bed.

, Cotton, polyester, and similar fibers can make hair more prone to tangling. This is largely due to the nature of the cloth; these fibers are usually somewhat rough in texture, which can catch hair strands, and cause knots or damaged shafts. Instead, use silk pillowcases so hair can move freely, without catching or knotting.This does require a bit of an investment, as silk pillowcases are not cheap. Be careful when choosing your pillowcase. Search for 100% silk, and avoid satin and other synthetic fibers.

, Conditioning treatments are best left on overnight, and rinsed off in the morning. Apply a treatment before bed, laying a towel on your pillow to avoid staining. Leaving the conditioner on overnight with ensure your hair shaft soaks up as much of the moisture as possible, while keeping your hair strands slick and smooth, allowing them to slide against each other freely.Oil treatments are best for dry, coarse hair. Use treatments with argan, olive, or coconut oil for thick, dry hair. Keratin treatments can be supplemented using oils.
Fine, thin hair is best helped by lighter ingredients, such as keratin. If your hair is fine or thin, oil might weigh your hair down and should be avoided.

, Tossing and turning lends itself to tangles. One of the simplest ways to avoid tangles is to get good-quality sleep, where your body does not require a lot of moving around. When you get ready for bed, try to relax and create a calming sleep environment.


To help yourself relax before bed, drink a warm cup of tea and read a book or listen to soothing music.
Avoid using electronics right before bed, as the blue light from electronics can disrupt sleep cycles and lead to fractionated sleep, resulting in more movement and additional knots.

",How to Apply a Hair Relaxer,"


The strength you use is determined by the texture of your hair. For instance, if you have coarse hair you would use a ""super"" strength hair relaxer.;
,


Since a hair relaxer is made up of chemicals, it is important to protect clothing in case the chemicals splash. Use a hair dresser's cape or towel wrapped around your shoulders.

,


Work with dry hair and divide the hair into 4 quadrants: front left, front right, back left, back right.

,,,


Typically, hair relaxer comes as a cream or paste and there will be chemicals that will be mixed together to complete the relaxer chemical process. This achieves the desired straightened effect.

,


You will need to use a color brush or a 1-inch (2.5 cm) paint brush to apply the relaxer to the sections. Saturate the hair with the relaxer. Apply the relaxer to all 4 sections until the hair is completely coated.

,


Begin at the section you started with when applying the relaxer. Divide the hair, again, into small sections. An eighth of an inch (3 mm) is fine. Using your fingers, begin to pull the hair to stretch out the curl. You can use the back of a comb for this as well, just run the flat spine of the comb along the hair. Repeat this in all 4 quadrants and twice to each quadrant.

,,


Hot water opens the hair cuticle, which allows you to rinse the relaxer thoroughly from the hair. Rinse for at least 5 minutes depending on the length of the hair.

,


The manufacturer's directions may indicate that you shampoo immediately after rinsing out the relaxer. Each hair relaxer manufacturer has different processes when it comes to this step.

,


Hair relaxer chemicals are harsh so they can alter the structure of the hair. Damage to the hair is to be expected.

Cover all of your visible root regrowth with the gel.,
Blow dry your hair to blend the gel in.",How to Apply Root Concealer2," The gel-based formulas can be used on wet or dry hair, but you may prefer to use it while your hair is dry. Root regrowth is easier to spot in dry hair, so you’ll be able to target the problem areas more successfully. Like its spray counterpart, most gel formulas wash out with your next shampoo.Check your brand for specifics, since there are a few out there that can last up to three shampoos.

, Most gel-based formulas come in “wand” form, with a spongey applicator on the end that you use to “paint on” the concealer. Squeeze the wand until you see that the sponge is loaded with the gel. Dab at your hair with the applicator to paint on the gel, squeezing when necessary to reload the sponge., Only use enough product to fully cover the visible roots. You can always add a little more if you need additional coverage, but start off slow. Give the product a minute or so to penetrate your hair shaft. You may want to keep a towel or tissues nearby so that you can clean up any drips or spills immediately., Even if you’ve applied the gel formula to dry hair, blow drying it helps to evenly distribute the concealer and blend it into your hair so that it looks natural. Set your blow dryer to low heat and aim at your roots. Continue until the gel is no longer visible and your roots are completely dry."

Choose from loose powder or a palette.,
Pick up powder on the applicator brush.,
Blend the powder in with the brush.",How to Apply Root Concealer3," Some brands come in a loose powder form, along with a big fluffy brush that looks a lot like a makeup brush you would use to apply blush. Other powder formulas come in palettes that are situated into compacts, similar in appearance to eyeshadow palettes. The palette style concealers come with small, stiff applicator brushes.Powder formulas allow for a very precise application, which is a big plus for many users.
However, if you have a significant amount of regrowth, powder may not be the best option, since this formula takes longer to apply.

, When using a powder formula, you definitely want to start with clean, dry hair that has already been styled.Start with a small amount of the concealer until you know how your product performs on your hair. Place the loaded applicator brush on your roots and softly brush the powder into your hair.

, Keep dabbing and brushing at your roots until the powder blends in. Take a look at the results. Powder formulas are very buildable and blend easily, so if you need more concealer, load your applicator brush again and repeat until you are satisfied with the results.Set with hairspray, if desired."

Rinse out the mask and condition your hair.",How to Apply a Hair Mask1," Many commercial hair masks come with special instructions. Some may only be designed for weekly use and some may need to be kept in for specific timeframes. Not all hair masks can be used interchangeably in terms of the duration and frequency of use. Make sure to read instructions carefully before applying a hair mask. If you use a mask and find it has adverse results, you may have missed certain instructions., Hair masks can get messy. When applying a hair mask, put an old t-shirt on or another item of clothing you don't mind spilling on.

Go natural.",How to Prevent Gray Hair," Vitamins (including B12) are essential for hair and skin health. When you have a deficiency, your hair can prematurely begin to lose some of its pigment or even fall out (it may fall out if you have a zinc deficiency), making you gray or bald (you'd want to avoid both). Vitamins are found in animal products such as beef, fish, eggs and chicken, as well as fruits, vegetables, nuts, and dairy.


Consider taking multivitamin supplements if you’re concerned about going gray too early. Taking supplements isn’t a magic potion guaranteed to keep your hair colorful, but it may give you a little extra time before it turns gray.
Vegans are more likely to have a B12 deficiency because it’s hard to get enough B12 through food other than animal products. Vegans should pay special attention to their B12 intake, through supplementation if necessary. Vegetarians can get B12 from milk and egg products.;
, Massage your scalp twice a week with egg oil and leave it on overnight. Egg oil contains anti-oxidant xanthophylls like lutein and zeaxanthin which arrest premature aging (graying) of hair and even reverses early stage grey hair. A tip for leaving it overnight is to cover your bed with a plastic sheet; it may be uncomfortable but it saves a ton of time when you want to clean your bed!

, Smoking tobacco has been tied to going gray before the age of 30. If you’re a smoker and you’re concerned about going gray, it’s one of many good reasons to take measures to stay away from cigarettes starting right now. If you just smoke occasionally, the habit might not be difficult to break on your own. If you’re a heavy smoker, you probably need some support to quit. Either way, it’s never too soon to get started. Any other form of tobacco use is equally harmful.


Smoking also causes hair to look prematurely dull and brittle. Damaged hair can fall out more easily than healthy hair.
Smoking also ages your skin prematurely and may even make its color look off (in some cases even the persons skin will turn gray).
Smoking furthermore ruins your teeth making them weak, lose color, causes gum disease as well as enamel damage and will cause premature loss of teeth.

, While unhealthy hair doesn’t turn gray any sooner than healthy hair, unhealthy hair is more likely to fall out. When new hair grows back in, it often has less pigment than the original hair, especially as you start to get older. Think about how you can change your hair care routine to keep your hair strong and undamaged so it won’t fall out.


If you bleach your hair, always keep it dyed, or use a chemical straightener, your hair might be more prone to falling out.
Hair extensions are known to cause hair loss, especially if they’re put in improperly.
Using a hair dryer, curling iron or straightener every day is damaging to hair, even when you use a heat protectant. It’s better to let it air dry and go natural.
Even brushing your tangles out, especially when your hair is wet, can cause hair loss and breakage. Be gentle with your hair and use a wide-toothed comb instead.

, While there are no conclusive studies to show that natural supplements can prevent gray hair, there are several remedies popular in India and other areas that are said to stop it in its tracks. If you decide to add a supplement to your daily diet, consult with a doctor or nutritionist first to make sure it’s a healthy choice for you. Here are some popular options:


Blackstrap molasses
Black sesame
Chlorophyll supplements
Nettle leaf
Seaweed
Amla (an ayurvedic herb)

, Probably the most popular myth about gray hair is that it starts growing in more quickly when you’re stressed. You’ve probably heard harried parents say “You’re going to give me gray hair!” to their misbehaving children a million times. The truth is, stress itself does not cause hair to grow in gray, so you can stop worrying that your job, family, lack of sleep and other issues are going to sap away your gorgeous color.


However, if you’re so stressed out that your hair is actually falling out, that’s cause for concern, since when your hair grows back in it could be lighter in pigment. If you’re that stressed out, it’s time to take measures to get some help. Consider talking to a therapist, meditation, and other practices that will help you feel happy and healthy again.

, That’s an old wives’ tale that has no factual basis. If you have a prominent gray hair and it annoys you every time you notice it, feel free to pluck it out without worrying that you’ll cause a mini explosion of grays.


However, plucking grays isn’t a great long-term solution. Firstly, when you pluck, you can damage the hair follicle and prevent hairs from growing back. Secondly, the plucked follicle is gray and will always be gray; it won’t come back in your other color. And thirdly, eventually you’ll have too many to pluck, so you’ll need to find a better solution.

, If you went through a long phase of dyeing your hair every color under the sun, you might have had someone tell you that dyeing your hair turns it gray prematurely. This isn’t true at all, so cast your worries aside. However, excessive dyeing and bleaching can damage hair, which can cause it to fall out and grow back in a lighter pigment.

, The sun will lighten your hair, but it doesn’t make your hair turn gray. Hair turns gray naturally due to the loss of melanin, which gives hair its pigment.Outside factors like sun exposure don’t make a difference when it comes to grayness.

, When your roots are just starting to grow in gray, there are powder, gels and other products you can use to temporarily mask the gray. Choose a product that comes in a color that matches your color. In most cases you’ll apply it to the roots once you hair has been washed and dried, then shampoo it out next time you wash your hair.

, If you’re not a fan of your new gray look, you may want to dye your hair permanently. Keep in mind you’ll need to touch up the roots often, too. There are a variety of options and hundreds of colors to choose from, so do a little research before dyeing your hair to decide what look will be right for you.


You may want to make an appointment with a colorist who has been professionally trained to dye gray hair. He or she can help guide you to a choice that you’ll be happy with.
You may instead want to save some money and use a boxed hair dye. Be sure to read reviews online before choosing a product. Buy a type of dye that specifies it’s for use on gray hair.

, Many women and men are embracing their gray hair and letting it grow in as it naturally does. Instead of trying to hide it, why not be proud of your hair? Gray hair can be just as eye-catching as any other color if you style it in a way that shows the world you’re still in the game. To keep it looking bright and healthy, look for shampoos, conditioners and other hair products designed especially for gray or white hair.

Softening the skin with a warm water and mild soap foot bath will make removing that skin much easier.Use warm water instead of hot water. Hot water can dry out your skin and irritate your feet.
If you have diabetes, the you should wash your feet every day. Use lukewarm water with a mild soap and dry your feet well. Then, moisturize you feet with some lotion, petroleum jelly, or baby oil.;
, After you’ve soaked your feet, or had a shower or bath, use a pumice stone, foot file or emery board to remove excess dead skin from your calluses.Pumice stones and foot files work better if you wet them in warm water before using them.
If you do not have a pumice stone, foot file or emery board, you can also use a wash cloth to scrub away the dead skin.
After you’ve scrubbed your feet, apply moisturizer to your feet to lock in the moisture and keep the skin on your feet soft and pliable.
If you have diabetes, make sure that you ask your doctor before using a pumice stone to remove calluses., Calluses (and corns) develop on areas of your feet that rub against your shoes and socks when you’re walking. You might find you have some shoes that are worse than others in this regard. Your first choice should be to wear shoes that fit properly so they do not cause calluses or corns, but as an alternative you can use over-the-counter unmedicated pads to protect your feet.These pads come in various sizes and shapes for different parts of your feet, but they also come in larger-sized squares that can be cut to size for whatever area you want.
Some of these pads come in a medicated version, however you should avoid the medicated versions unless directed to use them by a doctor.

, If you have calluses or corns that have become extremely painful or swollen, you should consider making an appointment to see your doctor to discuss the best course of action.A doctor has the proper facilities and equipment to potentially cut off the excess skin from a callus or corn. This should never be done at home.A doctor may also suggest or prescribe an antibiotic ointment (like Polysporin) to use on a corn or callus if it has become infected, or there is the possibility it will become infected.

, There are several medicinal options to help with calluses that your doctor may suggest.Small patches that contain a 40% salicylic acid solution can be used directly on a callus or corn to help soften the skin for easier removal. These patches can be purchased over-the-counter at a drug store under several brand names. If you doctor does not provide instructions on when and how often to use these patches, follow the instructions on the package.
Prescription-strength salicylic acid gel is also available for areas larger than a patch can cover.
You should only use salicylic acid with a doctor’s guidance. Because it is an acid, it does have the ability to burn and irritate your skin, which in turn can lead to an infection. Your doctor will instruct you on which products to use, how often to use them, and how much to use each time., One reason you may have calluses is due to a foot deformity.The deformity could be quite minor, but it could be enough to cause excess rubbing of certain parts of your feet against the insides of your shoes. Obtaining custom-made shoe inserts or orthotics could help fix the deformity and reduce your chances of getting a callus."

Do a deep treatment on your hair.,
Massage liquid coconut oil into your scalp.,
Wet your hair and apply a leave-in conditioner.,
Divide your hair into sections and moisturize them with oil.,
Detangle each section of your hair.,
Twist your hair.,
Do edge control along the front sections of hair.,
Finish twisting the front section of your hair.,
Pin your hair and lay your edges down.,
Moisturize your hair several times a week.,
Avoid shampooing your hair too often.,
Protect your hair.,
Cut out the chemicals.",How to Add Moisture to Your Hair," Apply your favorite deep treatment hair mask to wet hair. For example, you might rub mashed avocados or bananas, honey, or mayonnaise into your hair to add moisture. Once your hair is covered in the hair mask, put on a shower cap and let the treatment sit for 30 minutes. Rinse out the hair mask with warm water.If you're short on time, you can skip the deep treatment, but your hair won't get as much moisture.;
, Fill a plastic squeeze bottle with liquid coconut oil. Squirt the coconut oil directly onto your scalp. Use your fingertips to massage the oil into your scalp and the hair closest to your scalp. This will immediately add moisture to the hair.If you're worried about squirting too much oil onto your scalp, you can squirt the oil onto your fingertips instead. Run your fingers through your hair to moisturize the hair and scalp.

, Fill a spray bottle with fresh water and spray all over your hair until it's wet. Apply your favorite leave-in conditioner. To do so, squirt the conditioner on your hands. Rub the leave-in conditioner closer to your scalp and work in through your hair. Ensure that you rub the leave-in conditioner to the very tips of your hair.Spraying your hair with water adds instant moisture to your hair and makes it easier to detangle., Portion your hair into 4 or 5 parts using hair clips. You should have one section of hair near the front of your head and 3 or 4 sections of hair near the back of your head. Moisturize each section of hair by rubbing olive oil through the hair and scalp.If you don't want to use olive oil, you could use another preferred oil or conditioner. For example, consider using castor oil, almond oil, jojoba oil, or shea butter., Squirt a cream moisturizer (like a curl defining cream) into the palm of your hand and rub it through your hair. Ensure that each section of hair is evenly moisturized. Take a rubber brush and slowly brush from the tip of your hair towards your scalp to detangle the hair. This will prevent damage to your hair.If you have dry curly hair, consider detangling your hair with a Denman brush. The rubber can help spread moisturizing products evenly through your hair as you brush., If you have curly hair, twist each hair section on the back of your head tightly. You should be able to make a couple of twists from each section of hair. This is a protective style that will keep your moisturized and detangled hair out of your face as you moisturize the front of your hair.For an even tighter twist, consider twisting the very tip of each strand of hair so that it's tightly wound around itself.

, Bring the front section of hair down onto your forehead. Rub edge control gel into the edge that separates the front section of hair with the back sections of hair. Work the gel into the edge along your scalp. Brush the hair back and apply edge control along the edge of hair where it meets your forehead.Edge control will help smooth and hold any flyaway strands of hair and will add moisture to the hair near your scalp.

, Once you've applied edge control gel to the front section of hair, twist it into a protective side plait or braid. The end of the twist should be one one side of your face. This way, you can tuck it behind your ear, if your hair is long enough.


If you want the plait twist to lay flat, ensure that you twist it under rather than over itself.

, Use bobby pins to pin the front plait or braid twist of hair to the side of your head. Take the edge control gel and use your fingertips to carefully lay your edges down. Dab the gel with your fingertips to the small wisps of hair along your scalp and forehead.Laying down your edges will prevent flyaways and keep the small hairs along your scalp moisturized.

, Keep your hair moisturized throughout the week. Try to moisturize your hair every 2 or 3 days or as soon as you notice your hair drying and frizzing. For a quick moisturizing routine, just remove your hair from the twists and spritz it with water. Rub through a leave-in conditioner and brush your hair. Rub through olive oil for extra moisturizer.You can leave your hair down or re-twist it into a protective style.
For the most moisture, do a deep moisturizing treatment once a week.

, Dry hair is often caused by removing the natural oils from your hair. If you currently wash your hair every day, start waiting a day or two in between shampoos. This will give your hair a chance to stay moisturized from its own oils.When you do shampoo, choose a gentle shampoo that contains aloe vera or apricot kernel oil. These ingredients can help your hair stay moisturized.

, Your hair may dry out more quickly if it's exposed to wind, sun, chlorine, dry air, or saltwater. If you'll be encountering any of these, cover your hair with a scarf or hat. You should also increase your conditioning before and after coming into contact with these damaging elements.If you'll be in the sun, you can also spray your hair with a protective spray that blocks UV rays.

, Even the most moisturized hair can dry out if you use too many drying treatments. Coloring your hair or getting perms, relaxers, and chemical smothers can all dry out your hair. Consider doing these rarely to avoid drying out your hair.If you do color or highlight your hair, choose chemical-free or ammonia-free treatments since they're less damaging to your hair.

Go for a high-protein diet.,
Eat eggs.,
Try seafood.,
Eat plenty of vegetarian sources of protein.,
Get plenty of iron.,
Ask your doctor about vitamin D supplements.,
Increase your vitamin C intake.,
Stock up on vitamin A. Vitamin A is also essential to healthy, beautiful hair.,
Drink plenty of water.,
Limit sugars.,
Stay away from junk food.,
Limit your use of caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol.",How to Achieve Gorgeous Looking Hair With Healthy Eating," Increasing the amount of protein in your diet can help your hair grow strong and beautiful. Hair is made of protein, so a high-protein diet is essential for your hair's health.Opt to include a serving of protein in every meal. Things like poultry, beef, eggs, nuts, and legumes all contain protein.
Go for protein-based snacks. Have a piece of low-fat cheese in the afternoon. Go for a hard boiled egg or a handful of nuts when you feel hungry.;
, Eggs contain biotin, which is a water-soluble B vitamin. Too little biotin can cause hair loss, as well as brittle hair. Try eating a couple of eggs every day. Make sure to eat the yolks, as egg yolk is what contains biotin.Other sources of biotin include liver, soy flour, and yeast.

, Fish contains omega-3 fatty acids, which help hair stay hydrated. Oysters contain zinc, which can prevent hair from becoming dry and flaky.In general, oily fish are better. Go for salmon, herring, sardines, trout, and mackerel.
In addition to fish, omega-3 fatty acids are found in avocado, pumpkin seeds, and walnuts.

, Non-meat options contain a lot of vitamins and minerals necessary to keep hair strong. Opt for nuts, legumes, and soy products for healthy hair.Nuts are particularly good for hair. They contain zinc, selenium, and vitamin E, all of which are great for your hair's health. Try snacking on nuts between meals.
Be careful not to overindulge on nuts, however. They tend to have a lot of calories.

, Iron is vital for healthy hair growth. Brittle hair could be caused by an iron deficiency. If you want healthy hair, make sure to include a lot of iron in your diet.Dark green vegetables tend to contain a lot of iron, so add a lot of greens to your diet. Put some spinach on your sandwich at lunch, or order a small side salad. When you go out to eat, see if you can order something like grilled asparagus or Brussels sprouts for an appetizer instead of french fries or potatoes.
Red meat is another very good source of iron. Look for lean cuts of red meat to avoid unhealthy fats.
Whole grains also contain a lot of iron, so always opt for whole grains when possible. Go for whole wheat bread and pasta over white varieties. Have a bowl of oatmeal for breakfast in the morning.
You can also take iron supplements, but you should talk to your doctor first to make sure supplements are safe for you.

, Vitamin D is related to the health of your hair. Unfortunately, few foods contain vitamin D naturally. You can get juice and milk fortified with vitamin D for your hair's health, but you can also ask your doctor about supplements. Your body synthesizes vitamin D when exposed to sunlight, so a vitamin D deficiency may be more common in the winter.You should always talk to your doctor before taking any new supplements. You never know how supplements will interact with existing medication.
If you're unable to take supplements, try spending more time in the sun each day; however, be careful to wear sunscreen with UV protection. Too much exposure to UV rays can be dangerous to your health.

, Vitamin C helps with circulation. This can encourage hair growth. If you want strong, healthy hair, work on increasing the amount of vitamin C in your diet.Citrus fruits are all rich in vitamin C. Go for oranges, lemons, limes, clementines, and other citrus fruits.
Many vegetables contain vitamin C. Cucumbers, tomato, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, leafy greens, and red peppers are all sources of vitamin C.

, There are many foods you can eat that naturally contain vitamin A.Fruits and vegetables are the main sources of vitamin A. Green and yellow vegetables tend to contain the most vitamin A, so go for things like green and yellow peppers, bananas, leafy greens, and other green and yellow plants.
Sweet potatoes, broccoli, and apricots are also great sources of vitamin A.

, Water is essential to strong and healthy hair. In addition to eating healthy foods, up your water intake.Drink only water with meals. If you have trouble drinking plain water, try drinking flavored seltzer water or putting fruits, vegetables or herbs (like lemon, cucumber, or mint) in your water to improve its taste.
Keep a water bottle with you throughout the day. Make a point of periodically taking a sip.
Take every opportunity you can to drink water. Stop by a water fountain and take a drink every chance you get.

, Refined sugar is bad for your overall health. Your body uses up vitamin B to metabolize sugar, which is important to your hair health. Make a point of limiting the amount of sugar in your diet.Make sure to read food labels. A lot of foods have a surprising amount added sugar. It's not uncommon for a seemingly healthy food, like granola or pasta sauce, to be loaded with sugar.
If you need to indulge your sweet tooth, do so sparingly. Try going for a fun-sized candy bar instead of a full sized one. Have a diet soda at lunch instead of a regular soda.
Eat fruit if you're craving something sweet. Fruit has natural sugars, and also contains vitamins and minerals that can help your hair stay strong and beautiful.

, Junk food is full of empty calories, high in salt, and can contain harmful preservatives. This can have a detrimental effect on the nutrients needed for hair growth.Do not buy junk food. If you have things like chips and candy in your house, you'll be tempted to overindulge.
Bring healthy snacks to work if candy and junk food will be provided. This way, you'll fill up on quality snacks and won't be tempted by junk food.
If you're having a craving, indulge it reasonably. For example, get a 100 calorie bag of chips so you don't end up overeating.

, All these things can block your body's ability to absorb nutrients. This can have a negative effect on your hair.As smoking is bad for your overall health, try to quit if you're a smoker. Talk to your doctor about how to taper off nicotine.
If you drink, limit the amount of alcohol you consume. Stick to one or two drinks at happy hour with co-workers. Try to avoid keeping alcohol at home, as you may be tempted to drink it.
Stick to one or two cups of coffee in the morning, and avoid caffeinated beverages throughout the day. Soda, energy drinks, and some teas contain caffeine.

Select the proper shoes.,
Keep your feet dry.,
Moisturize your feet every day.,
Work to avoid and remove corns.,
Put your feet up.",How to Get Rid of Calluses on Feet2," Buying and wearing the proper shoes will go a long way to help prevent calluses from forming on your feet. There are several things you can be on the lookout for when shopping for new shoes, including:Make sure the salesperson measures both of your feet. Chances are, like most people, you have one foot that is larger than the other. You’ll want to select a shoe size that fits the larger of your two feet.
Leave shopping for shoes till as late as possible. Throughout the day your feet swell and you want to size your shoes based on your swollen feet. This ensures that your shoes are large enough to accommodate your swollen feet and won’t become uncomfortable as the day goes on.
Buy shoes based on how they actually feel on your feet, even if the size on the shoe doesn’t make sense.
While it may seem obvious, buy shoes that are shaped like feet. Many ‘stylish’ shoes come in odd shapes which can end up hurting your feet and causing calluses.
When trying on new shoes, make sure your whole foot feels comfortable inside the shoe — from the tips of your toes, to the balls of your feet, to your heel.
Leave approximately ⅜” to ½"" of space at the tip of the shoe between the end of your big toe and the start of the shoes.

, Socks can be just as important as shoes in keeping your feet callus-free and healthy. Cotton socks, or socks made of a natural fiber, are the best type for keeping your feet dry inside of your shoes. This is especially important when you’re doing any type of physical activity where you’ll sweat more than usual.Make sure to allow your shoes to dry out before wearing them again — don’t put on wet footwear.
Avoid wearing the same socks two days in a row if you can, especially if they get wet or sweaty.
If you socks do get wet, change them as soon as possible.
Remember to wash your feet every day as part of your regular cleaning routine, including between your toes. Plus, after you’ve washed your feet, make sure they’re completely dry before putting socks on.
Also consider wearing flip-flops or sandals when walking around a public swimming pool and even inside a public shower., Calluses form because of spots on your feet that rub against your socks and shoes. But you can help prevent and heal calluses by moisturizing your feet every day and keeping the skin nice and soft.Keeping your feet moisturized and soft is even more important in the winter time when the air is colder, and therefore drier.Don’t apply moisturizer and then attempt to walk around in your bare feet, this can be dangerous!
Get into the habit of applying moisturizer to your feet right before you go to bed.
Take the opportunity to give your feet a massage when applying the moisturizer. This feels great, but also increases blood circulation in your feet.
If possible, buy and use only moisturizer designed for feet on your feet.

, Corns are calluses, but they’re calluses that form on your toes instead of other parts of your feet. Corns are usually caused by the tips of your shoes rubbing against your toes. And this in turn can be caused by shoes that are too small in the toe area, or by high heels that are forcing your feet downwards due to gravity.Removing and preventing corns can be accomplished using the same methods as you would for calluses, but make an appointment to see your doctor if they get really severe and painful.

, Resting your feet on a regular basis is also very important. Your feet need a break from the stress just like any other part of your body. Plus, if you tend to sit with your legs crossed, change the leg that’s on top every now and again to improve circulation.

Soak your feet in lemon juice.,
Make your own cracked-heel cream.,
Oil your feet before bed.,
Create your own overnight foot mask.,
Try paraffin wax to moisturize your feet.",How to Get Rid of Calluses on Feet3," The acid in lemon juice can be very helpful with softening and removing calluses. Soak your feet in lemon juice for about 10 minutes before scrubbing your feet with a pumice stone or foot file.While foot razors or shavers can be purchased at drug stores and pharmacies, they are not a good idea to use. They can easily cut your feet, and these cuts can easily become infected., Your heels tend to be one of the places that build up a lot of calluses. You can help keep your heels, and the rest of your feet, soft and moisturized by making your own cracked-heel cream at home. All you need to do is put a spoonful of olive oil in a small bottle and add a few drops of lemon or lavender essential oil. Shake the bottle until the liquid turns thick and milky and then apply it to your feet, specifically your heels.You can make this cream and store it for future use as long as you remember to shake the bottle before you use it.

, The best time to moisturizer your feet is right before bed. And you can moisturize your feet with more than just store-bought moisturizer — you can also use vegetable oil. Simply apply a layer of vegetable oil to your feet before bed and then put on a pair of thick socks. Leave the socks on all night while you sleep and then wipe off any excess oil in the morning.Vegetable oil (and other oils) can stain fabrics, including your socks and sheets. The best socks to use in this situation are wool socks, as the wool absorbs the oil and doesn’t stain. If you can’t use wool socks (or if they’re too hot) use a pair of old socks instead.

, Your face, hands and hair can benefit from masks — so can your feet! It’s easy to make your own at home using 1 tablespoon of Vaseline (or another similar product) and the juice from 1 lemon. Mix the Vaseline and lemon juice together in a bowl and apply the mixture to your clean feet before bed. Wear a pair of socks on your feet all night and wipe off the excess Vaseline with a towel in the morning.Dedicate a pair of old socks to this process so you don’t have to worry about the Vaseline staining them, or your sheets.

, Aestheticians often use paraffin wax as part of a spa pedicure, but you can also use paraffin wax at home. Simply melt the wax in a large bowl in the microwave and add an equal amount of mustard oil after the wax is melted. (The mustard oil is what moisturizes your feet.) Dip each of your feet in the bowl of wax (once it’s cool enough) twice, waiting enough time between dips to make sure the wax has dried on your feet. Then wrap your feet in plastic wrap or a plastic bag for 15 minutes. Remove the plastic and the wax at the same time."

Use a curl wand on second-day hair.,
Curl hair, scrunch with dry shampoo and piece out with pomade.",How to Add Texture to Your Hair1," For lasting texture and beachy waves, set one to three braided sections with your flat iron. Clamp and iron braids down while working through sections the same width as your iron. Loosen the braids, then toss and lift your roots to work hairspray underneath.

Braid hair into three sections for thick hair. Place one on each side starting above your ears and one in the back starting at your nape.
Braid hair into two sections for medium to thick hair. Place one on each side starting above your ears.
Braid hair into one section for fine hair. Place one in the back starting at the nape.;
, Velcro rollers work by giving you soft lift off your scalp. Start with a section the same width as your roller in your crown area. Use three rollers back to back and roll one to two more perpendicularly on each side. Continue this pattern all the way to your front hairline if you want maximum volume.

Make sure you roll each section directly off and perpendicular to your scalp.
Add extra volume by pulling each section towards your face at a 45 degree angle and rolling back.

, Your natural oils will give you the grip and texture you need for a tousled look using a curl wand. Hold the wand with the small end pointing down and wrap 1 inch (2.5 cm) sections away from your face.

Swap your wand for a regular 1 inch (2.5 cm) curling iron and make sure you point the top down., Make your curls look effortless and lived-in instead of perfectly placed by spraying dry shampoo and piecing them out with pomade. Curl your hair with a 1 inch (2.5 cm) curling iron, spray and scrunch dry shampoo through the mid-lengths, ends and roots of your hair. Rub a fingernail sized amount of pomade through your palms. Then, twist 1 inch (2.5 cm) sections of your curls while you run the pomade through 3 to 4 inches (7.6 to 10.2 cm) of your ends."

, Just make it so that the drawstring is on the outside., You may wrap and pin it if the style is sleek and straight. If your style is wavy or curly, try putting the hair up in a loose, high ponytail with a scrunchie. You can also try putting the hair into two braids or french braid pigtails. Twist the braids around each other at the base of your head. If your hair is naturally dry, try adding some conditioner and water to the ends to preserve moisture for second day hair., (The shorts should be upside down.), If the drawstring is inside the shorts, flipping the waistband up so it's outside may help it stay in place.

Use baby powder or another absorbent powder.,
Use an antiperspirant on your palms.,
Carry a handkerchief or alcohol wipes.,
Wash your hands more frequently.",How to Get Rid of Clammy Hands1," One simple, direct, and fairly long-lasting way to get rid of unwanted hand moisture is simply to soak it up! You can do this a variety of ways, including applying an absorbent powder to your hands. Try pouring a thimble-sized amount of baby powder into your hands and spreading it around gently and evenly — you should immediately notice your hands feel cooler and dryer. Below are just a few more powders you may want to consider using:


Chalk
Talcum powder (note that talc can be poisonous if inhaled in significant quantities)Corn starch (sometimes specifically used for this purpose in Hispanic countries, where it is called ""maizena"")
Baking soda;
, Many people apply antiperspirant under their arms every today to control underarm sweating. Believe it or not, you can get the same effect by spreading a little antiperspirant on your palms. Dry your hands by wiping them with a towel before you apply your antiperspirant so that it can do its job of plugging your sweat pores properly.Make sure to use an antiperspirant — not just a deodorant. Though the two products are often combined into one, they're not the same thing. The former fights excessive sweating, while the latter simply controls the odor from sweating.
For the strongest effect, use an antiperspirant with aluminum compounds as its active ingredients. Aluminum is one of the strongest, most effective antiperspirant chemicals available. For serious situations, you may even want to investigate prescription antiperspirants (like Drysol) which have higher concentrations of aluminum., For mild cases of clammy hands, sometimes simply carrying around something you can use to soak up moisture throughout the day is enough to beat your clamminess. Cloth handkerchiefs make great re-usable hand towels, while disposable paper towels and alcohol wipes offer instant convenience.


Though alcohol wipes are wet, they don't usually make hands more moist in the long run. Alcohol evaporates very quickly, taking other sources of moisture with it as it leaves the hands. In fact, some people with delicate skin complain that alcohol wipes leave their hands feeling too dry for their liking., If you're having a hard time keeping your hands dry, you may want to experiment with washing your hands frequently. Washing with soap and water can strip your hands of their natural oils, making them feel drier, so you may be able to get your hands drier in the long-term if you make a conscious effort to increase the number of times you wash your hands each day.


Note, however, that frequent hand washing can sometimes leave hands too dry, especially if you use harsh bar soaps or soaps that contain detergent.If your hands become irritated or dried out from frequent washing, switch to a moisturizing soap — it's almost always more unpleasant to have raw, cracked hands than it is to have hands that are a little clammy.

Reduce the amount of stress you put on your fingers when you write.,
Provide extra protection for your hand by wearing a soft glove or using moleskin as padding.,
Take a bath and soak your hand in the warm soapy water to help soften the thick protective layer of dead skin.Keep your hand submerged until the skin around the callus becomes wrinkled and then gently massage the callus.

,
Use natural remedies to soak your hand.,
Rub the dead skin away with a nail file, emery board, pumice stone, or washcloth.This should not cause pain because the skin is already dead.,
Apply moisturizers to soften the callus.,
Use naturally acidic household substances to soften the callus and loosen the dead skin.",How to Get Rid of a Writer's Callus1," Because calluses are your body’s defense mechanism for preventing irritation to sensitive skin, you may be able to get rid of your callus by simply reducing the friction when you write.


Relax your grip on the pen or pencil when you write. If you are squeezing too hard, it is likely that the pen or pencil is digging into your skin and rubbing. Take short breaks while you write and stretch your hands to remind yourself not to cramp up and grip the pen or pencil too tightly.;
, This will cushion the skin and prevent the pen or pencil from rubbing directly on your skin.


If it is too warm to comfortably wear a thin glove, protect just the area with the callus by wearing a Band-Aid or moleskin over the callus when you write.
You can create a donut-shaped pad by folding the moleskin in half and cutting a half circle out of it. Then apply the moleskin donut around the callus. This will reduce the pressure on the callus.Or alternatively, you can put the moleskin on the pen or pencil to make it softer.

,, These methods will help soften and exfoliate the callus. You can try them all until you find the one that works the best for you. Soak for at least 10 minutes to get the best results.


Soak your callus in warm water with Epsom salt dissolved into it. Follow the directions on the box to adjust the concentration of salt to water.Create a solution of warm water and baking soda. Baking soda is a natural exfoliant.
Or alternatively, soak your hand in warm chamomile tea. Chamomile has anti-inflammatory properties which will soothe irritation from the pen or pencil rubbing.
You can also try a warm mixture of castor oil and apple cider vinegar. The oil will have a moisturizing effect and the acid in the vinegar will help soften the skin and promote healing.

, Do not grind down so deeply that you hit sensitive, live skin underneath. You may need to do this repeatedly over several days.


Do not use a pumice stone if you have diabetes because it increases your risk of infection.Do not cut or clip the callus away as this increases your chances of going too deep and injuring yourself., Gently massage the moisturizer into the callus and surrounding skin. You can use commercially manufactured moisturizers or various home-remedies including:


Vitamin E oil
Coconut oil
Olive Oil
Aloe. Aloe can be applied using either a commercially prepared mixture, or if you have a plant in your house, you can split open a leaf and apply the soothing, gooey gel directly onto the callus.

, These substances can be held in place against the callus with a bandage. Leave them on for at least a few hours or even overnight to give them time to work. Some things you can try include:


Lemon juice, soaked into a cotton ball
Vinegar, soaked into a cotton ball

Blow-dry hair with sea-salt spray before pulling it up.",How to Add Texture to Your Hair2," Even if you thought you didn’t have enough waves to rock them naturally, you will after you use sea-salt spray. Towel dry your hair thoroughly and let your locks air dry, until they’re just slightly damp. Spritz sea-salt spray through your mid-lengths and ends, while you hand scrunch the ends.

Continue to let your hair air dry or use a diffuser to enhance your waves and add more texture., Sea-salt spray is great at adding texture to curls made with an iron. Use a 1.25 inches (3.2 cm) iron to curl hair and spray 3 to 4 squirts on each side and the back, while you scrunch the ends with your fingers and palms. Spray more of your favorite brand if you like, because sea-salt spray has a light to medium hold., Sea-salt spray can be made at home with sea-salt, gel, leave-in conditioner and argan oil. Fill an empty spray bottle with 3/4 full with warm, filtered water. Add 2 teaspoons of sea salt, 2 tablespoons of leave-in conditioner, a squirt of gel and a half of teaspoon of argan oil. Shake until the mixture is dissolved and let it cool before using it in your hair.

Substitute coconut oil for argan oil if your hair is dry.

, Create a rockstar, just rolled out of bed, look by spritzing sea-salt spray throughout straight hair. Spritz sea-salt spray throughout dry hair using 3 to 4 squirts on each side and the back. Scrunch the mid-lengths and ends while you rub 2 inches (5.1 cm) pieces with your fingertips., Whether you’re pulling hair into a bun, braid or ponytail, sea-salt spray can give the texture you need to hold them in place. Spritz all over damp hair and lift roots with your fingers while you blow dry. Continue drying by raking your fingers throughout the lengths."

Use dry shampoo throughout roots and mid-lengths.,
Piece short hair out with pomade.,
Add invisible volume with texturizing spray.,
Volumize your roots with texture powder.",How to Add Texture to Your Hair3," Dry shampoo can be a life saver on no wash days and when you want to add texture. Sprinkle or spray your favorite dry shampoo by tilting your head to one side and lifting roots with your fingertips. Lightly rub the product into your scalp for an extra lived-in look, but make sure you don’t brush your hard work out., Short hair needs texture sometimes more than longer styles. Piece out the ends of a short cut with pomade. Scoop out a fingernail sized amount, rub it between your hands and piece out the ends with your fingertips and your palms by rubbing them on 1 inch (2.5 cm) sections of hair. Use a light pomade for fine hair and a heavier one for thick hair., Texturizing spray is great for all hair types, because it adds weightless volume and light hold. You can layer many of them for added hold too, so spray it a little more on buns, braids and curls. Tilt your hair over to the side, flip your roots up with your fingers and spray away for body in medium to long lengths., Texture powder, sometimes referred to as teasing powder, will give your style serious lasting power. Sprinkle texture powder onto your roots and rub it in with your fingertips for volume in any style.Prevent your style from falling flat by not combing or brushing the powder out.

Avoid greasy lotions.,
Avoid pockets and gloves.,
Avoid perspiration-causing food and drink.,
Lower your stress levels.",How to Get Rid of Clammy Hands2," If you frequently use lotion on your hands, you may be inadvertently making them clammy. While some lotions (like those that contain antiperspirant chemicals) can actually help dry your hands out, others can make them much moister. Some substances, like petroleum jelly, can even make your hands extra wet or greasy. If you use lotion frequently, consider switching your go-to lotion for one that's lighter or one that's specifically formulated to have a drying effect.

, Gloves, pockets, and any other types of clothing that surround the hands can lead to excess sweating and moisture. These items trap moisture and heat against the hand, causing the hands to produce more sweat and making it more difficult for the sweat that is produced to evaporate. To fix this, simply leave your hands uncovered throughout the day when you can — their natural moisture should evaporate more freely.


If it's too cold to leave your hands uncovered, try using fingerless gloves or gloves made out of a lighter material if possible. Ideally, these will keep your hands warm while allowing some air to reach them.

, Sometimes, even something as simple as a person's diet can lead to excessive sweating. Certain foods can trigger a sweating response, which, if you're susceptible to clammy hands, can make your problem much worse. Consider avoiding the following food and drink items if they're frequent additions to your diet:


Spicy foods: Believe it or not, hot, spicy foods trigger the same responses in your body that are caused by actual physical heat, often leading to sweating.Caffeine: Some people sweat if they consume excessive caffeine because the chemical stimulates the nervous system leading, to jumpiness, heightened activity, nervousness, and so on. The effect is often greatest when drinking hot caffeinated beverages.Alcohol: For some people, getting drunk or ""buzzed"" can lead to excessive sweating due to a process called vasodilation in which the body's blood vessels expand and increase the temperature of the skin, giving the feeling of warmth., For some people, sweaty hands aren't a symptom of a physical problem, but instead a reaction to sources of stress or nervousness in their life. In these cases, removing moisture from the hands is only a temporary solution — to get lasting relief, it's necessary to eliminate the underlying mental or emotional stresses. There's no single ""right"" way to do this — everyone's personal stresses are different — so if you think this may apply to you, try talking to your doctor or a licensed therapist for advice. Below are just a few techniques frequently prescribed to deal with stress:Yoga
Biofeedback
Meditation
Giving up harmful habits or substances
Making more/different social connections
New exercise regimens
Different work/life arrangements

Consider asking for anticholinergics.,
Consider iontophoresis.,
Consider botox injections.,
In extreme cases, consider surgery.",How to Get Rid of Clammy Hands3," If your sweaty, clammy hands are a serious problem and you haven't been able to eliminate them with basic home remedies or lifestyle changes, you may want to consider talking to your doctor about medical solutions. One class of drugs that can treat excessive sweatiness (and thus clammy hands) is called anticholinergics. These drugs work by blocking the action of a chemical called acetylcholine in the brain, which, among other things, controls the body's sweating.Note, however, that anticholinergics can have significant side effects, including:


Higher body temperature
Blurry vision
Constipation
Decreased saliva production
Confusion
Drowsiness

, One relatively unobtrusive procedure that can treat clammy hands is called iontophoresis. In this procedure, the hands are submerged in water for about half an hour while a mild electric current passes through it. This closes the pores in the skin of the hands, decreasing sweating.The current is not usually great enough for it to be painful. For best results, multiple repetitions are usually necessary.


While iontophoresis doesn't usually cause side effects, in rare cases, it can cause skin irritation and/or blistering., Though botox injections are most commonly known for their cosmetic uses, they can also be used to reduce sweating in certain cases. Botox treatments work by injecting a very small amount of a poison called botulinum toxin under the skin. In tiny dosages, this toxin tightens the skin and interferes with a chemical that causes sweat glands to activate. Though it may take several applications, a regimen of botox injections can prevent excessive sweating for over a year. Side effects from botox include:Bruising/redness at the injection site
Headache
Flu-like symptoms
Muscle twitching/drooping
In very unlikely cases, dangerous symptoms of botulinum toxin poisoning (trouble breathing, trouble speaking, vision problems, weakness)

, For sweaty or clammy hands that won't respond to any other treatments and are a having a significant impact on a patient's quality of life, surgery can be recommended, although this is usually seen as an absolute last-resort. Endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy (or ETS) is a surgical procedure that involves cutting certain nerve pathways that cause sweating in the hands and under the arms. Though it's sometimes described as a ""minimally-invasive"" procedure, ETS is in fact a major surgery that requires general (whole-body) anesthetic. Though problems are rare, there is a small chance of serious complications or even death with ETS (as is there with any major surgery).Note that ETS is a permanent procedure — there is no way to reverse it once it's performed.
In addition, it's important to know that the vast majority of people who undergo ETS for sweaty hands or underarms experience ""compensatory sweating"" (sweating that is as heavy or heavier than the original sweating) somewhere else on their body after the surgery."

Try soaking your hands in tea.,
Try using apple cider vinegar.,
Try herbal cures.,
Consider homeopathic supplements or treatment programs.",How to Get Rid of Clammy Hands4," There are a number of ""alternative"" or ""natural"" remedies promoted as cures for clammy hands online. Though some practitioners swear by these solutions, there is very little scientific evidence (if any) supporting these cures' effectiveness. For one easy alternative cure, try soaking your hands in cool or lukewarm tea. For best results, soak your hands in tea (or hold onto wet teabags) for 30 minutes each day for a week.


According to some (dubious) sources, the tannic acid in the tea can help gradually dry out your hands, reducing moistness throughout the day., Another easy alternative remedy for sweaty hands involves apple cider vinegar. For this method, try soaking the hands directly in a bowl of apple cider vinegar for five minutes each, then washing with soap and water. Note that washing with soap and water is known to sometimes have a skin-drying effect on its own (see above).


Alternatively, you may want to try running a bath and adding a cup or two of vinegar to the water before you get in.

, Some alternative medicine sources purport that consuming certain ""detoxifying"" herbs like turmeric, shatavari, and patola can help alleviate sweaty hands and/or feet. While some of these herbs may be used in traditional or non-Western medicinal cures (for instance, turmeric is known for its traditional use as an indigestion cure and anti-inflammatory), there is very little scientific evidence to support claims that they are reliable cures for clammy hands or any other condition.While most ""detox"" schemes provide little measurable or quantifiable benefit, note that some have even been found to cause harmful (though rarely dangerous) side effects., A simple search engine query can reveal dozens of so-called homeopathic or ""natural"" cures for sweaty hands. These cures are often in the form of herbs, vitamins, pills, supplements, or some combination of these elements. Though they are often advertised with bold claims about their effectiveness, in reality, very few (if any) homeopathic treatments have been scientifically proven to work.


In addition, because homeopathic supplements aren't regulated by agencies like the FDA, there's no guarantee that they are held to the high quality standards that ""normal"" drugs are. For this reason, most doctors will advise against investing too heavily in homeopathic cures.

Try over-the-counter medications for removing calluses.,
Apply aspirin as an alternative source of salicylic acid.,
See a doctor if these methods do not help.,
Contact a medical professional if your callus shows signs of being infected.",How to Get Rid of a Writer's Callus2," Patches containing salicylic acid are available which you can put on the callus.Follow the manufacturer’s instructions and your doctor’s recommendations for how often to change the patch.These medications must be applied carefully, because if they come in contact with the healthy, live skin around the callus, they may cause chemical burns.Do not use these methods if you have diabetes, poor circulation, or are prone to numbness. In this case, consult your doctor., By crushing up aspirin tablets, you can make your own topical medicine and apply it.Grind five aspirin tablets into a powder and add a half teaspoon lemon juice and a half teaspoon water. Mix until a paste forms.
Apply the paste to the callus, not to the healthy, live skin surrounding it.
Wrap it in plastic wrap and put a warm towel on it for 10 minutes. Afterwards scrub away the paste and any loose dead skin.

, The doctor will be able to examine it to confirm that it is a callus.


The doctor may prescribe a stronger medication to get rid of the callus.
In extreme cases, the doctor may remove it with a scalpel., Calluses generally are not associated with infection, so if yours shows any of these symptoms, it should be examined by a doctor:Redness
Pain
Inflammation
Discharging blood or pus

Apply pressure to the area.,
Use epsom salts and warm water.,
Dab on some castor oil.,
Swab on some white glue.,
Clean the area.,
Prepare your tweezers.,
Get your foot in position.,
Use the tweezers to pull out the glass.,
Wrap the area with a bandage.",How to Get Glass out of Your Foot," Without pinching or squeezing, apply a firm rubbing pressure to the area around the location of the glass. This will help to slowly move the glass towards the surface of your foot, making it easier to extract.;
, Fill a small tub or bowl with warm/hot water (to your liking) and add a cup of epsom salts. Stir the mixture until the salts have completely dissolved, and then place your foot in the water. Let your foot soak for 20-30 minutes; the heat will cause your skin to swell slightly which will make the glass move to the surface, and the epsom salts will aid in drawing out the glass.

, Castor oil is a great at-home remedy for a small piece of glass lodged in your foot, as it works to naturally draw the glass to the surface of your skin. Heavily soak a gauze pad or cotton ball in castor oil and hold/tape it to your foot over the location of the glass. Leave the castor oil on your foot to soak as long as you can; the longer you let it set, the further out the glass will come., White school glue dries quickly and pulls up whatever is stuck underneath of it, making it perfect for pulling out glass. Wipe some white glue onto your foot just over the location of the glass. Allow the glue to dry completely, and then peel it off from the edges working inwards. The glass should stick to the glue (if it was near the surface) and peel outwards with it. The glue may not remove it completely, but will hopefully move it a bit closer to the surface.

, Rinse your foot in cold water to remove any glass that might be stuck on the outside of the skin along with any debris or dirt. Use alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, or iodine to clean the area where the glass is located. Pour some onto a cotton swab and rub the area around your foot to disinfect it.

, Find a pair of tweezers with a sharp point, and disinfect them prior to extracting the glass. Put them in a pot of boiling water for 10 minutes to kill any bacteria that might be present and could infect your foot. Pat the tweezers dry with a clean towel when you’re finished boiling them, and allow them to cool.

, Sit in such a way so that you can see the bottom of your foot clearly, or have a friend set up to help you extract the glass. Move to an area with good lighting or place a lamp/flashlight near your foot so that you can clearly see the extraction point/glass.

, Gently tug in the glass in your foot to try to remove it. You may need to pinch the skin or dig just a bit to try to remove the glass; however, do not insert the tweezers into your foot or cause further damage and pain by damaging the skin.


If you cannot remove the glass, visit a doctor and have it removed professionally. You could cause serious damage or cause an infection if you try too hard to pull it out.

, Apply a small bandage or gauze to the area once the glass is removed to quell any bleeding that may occur. You can add a bit of antiseptic cream to help prevent infection as well. Dispose of the glass safely, and you’re finished!

Exfoliate and tend cuticles weekly.",How to Get Perfect Feet for Summer," Soak a cotton ball or pad in a small amount of polish remover. Rub the pad across your toe until the polish has dissolved and soaked into the cotton.


For sensitive skin, use non-acetone polish remover. It may take a little longer to dissolve the polish, but it is gentler on skin and strips away less moisture.;
, Take a bath or prepare a basin or warm water for foot soaking.


Add Epsom salts to the water. This can sooth achy feet but also eliminates foot odor as well., You can do this using a nail brush in the bath, the nail cleaning tool attached to most clippers, or the pointed end of an orange stick. You want to clean gently, being careful not to bruise or puncture the nail bed at all.


Using an orange stick or the tool on your clippers, position the tip so that it rests against your nail bed on the left side of your nail. Using gentle pressure, follow the line of your nail bed and pull the tool sideways under your nail. This will pull any dirt or debris out from under the nail when you reach the other side. Repeat if needed until nail is free of debris.
If nails show discoloration from debris or staining from old polish, use a lemon wedge to brighten the nail and oxidize the stain., Nails are easier to trim after soaking. Using toenail clippers, cut the nail straight across, being sure not to cut too close to the nail bed. .


Use the filing surface of a buffing block to round sharp edges from trimming. This also helps prevent ingrown toenails. Be sure to file in only one direction.

, Clearing feet of dry, dead winter skin is the first step to summer sandal weather.


Get a pumice stone. Named for the abrasive, porous volcanic rock, a pumice stone is perfect for removing dead skin from heels and callouses. Press the stone to tough skin and, using light pressure, rub back and forth. Be careful not to rub too much, as this can create skin irritation.
Use an exfoliating scrub. You can get exfoliating scrubs from drug stores or boutiques that specialize in body products. Additionally, exfoliating scrubs can be made at home, using equal parts of an abrasive element (like salt or sugar), olive oil, and honey. Apply the scrub to the skin and rub in circular motions.
Trim dead skin from toes. Toes can collect thickened skin along the sides of the nail. This skin turns white after soaking. Using toe nail clippers, gently trim back white skin without cutting or trimming the cuticle at the base of the nail.

, Cuticles often look like dry skin; however, it is important not to trim cuticles on your toenails, as this can lead to nail fungus or infection.Follow the steps below to push back cuticles on your toes:


Moisturize cuticles. To prevent tearing and make pushing the cuticle easier, be sure to moisturize the cuticle with oil or a cuticle creme.
Use an orange stick. The orange stick will have at least one angled tip. Using the angled end, gently push the cuticles toward the base of your nails. If the cuticles are resistant, soak them for longer to soften them up.

, In the same way that masks can exfoliate and moisturize the skin on our face, a foot mask can make winter feet look sandal-ready.Mix together 4 tablespoons of honey with a quarter cup of sour cream and a few drops of lemon juice.
Sit on the edge of your bathtub or shower. Apply the mixture to your feet, focusing on the top of your feet and toes, along with ankles and heels.
Let set for 10 to 15 minutes, then rinse well with warm water.

, After exfoliation and cuticle care, it is important to retain the skin's moisture so your feet don't look dry.


Apply lotion or oil in a light coating, focusing extra attention on areas prone to callouses or cracking.
If your feet are really dry, apply a heavier layer of lotion, then cover with socks. This can be done before bed each night to improve the skin texture and overall health of your feet.

, You want to choose polishes that are right for your skin tone and that will coordinate with your sandals, swimsuits, and summer attire.


Polishes can look slightly different after they dry. Before polishing nails, apply a small amount of polish to your skin. Let it dry there and see how it looks. You can do this with as many polishes as you like to see which one is right for your nails.
If you know that you will be changing the color of your nails frequently, invest in a nail polish, as opposed to enamel, Nail enamel is usually more expensive and more difficult to remove.

, If polishing right after moisturizing, be sure to clear your nail of moisturizer, as this can prevent the polish from drying properly.


One way of preparing the nail surface is to take a cotton swab and apply a small amount of nail polish remover to the nail surface. Rub in lightly, then wash and dry the tips of your toes. The polish remover breaks down the oiliness of the moisturizer.

Buff the nail surface. Using a buffing block, start with the side for removing ridges (should be the second roughest in texture) and buff the surface of the nail, being sure to compensate for nail curvature. Repeat with the less rough sides of the block, in order from roughest to least rough. Once you've reach the polishing side, the surface of the nail should be shiny.
Use a toe spacer. Toe spacers are made of rubbery foam and are shaped with grooves for each toe on your foot. By separating the toes when polishing, it is easier to add polish neatly and toes do not rub against each other, marring the polish. Be sure to leave the spacers in place until the polish is dry.Apply a base coat before polishing. Base coat is usually clear or milky. It strengthens nails and helps the polish adhere to the nail surface. Be sure to let the base coat dry completely before applying polish.

, Using even, perpendicular strokes, apply a thin coat of nail polish to your nails.Experts say three strokes for each coat is enough-- left side, middle, and right side.
Avoid drips. Be sure to wipe the brush and stem on the inside of the mouth of the nail polish bottle to remove excess polish.

, Nail polish or enamel should set up and be dry within 10 minutes. You can expedite this by putting your feet in front of a fan.

, Especially with dark, saturated colors, multiple coats help to avoid streaks and improve color uniformity.


Apply the same way as the first layer, being sure to avoid drips and uneven application.
The second coat may require longer drying time than the first.

, Top coat is applied to help finish the drying process, as well as offering a more finished surface to the nail. Many top coats also prevent chipping and help polish last longer.


Be sure to leave the toe spacers in place and not to walk around on carpet or rugs until the nails have dried completely.

, Dry skin is less obvious when you have a daily moisturizing routine.Look for a glycerin-based moisturizer for intensely dry feet.
Avoid walking around after moisturizing your feet. This can cause your feet to pick up dust or dirt and also cause you to slip on tile or wood floors.

, To avoid possible exposure to nail bed fungus or athlete's foot, never go barefoot in public showers, at public pools, or in locker rooms., After using, wipe pedicure tools with a disinfectant cleanser and store in a clean, dry place.


Consider purchasing a pedicure kit or case with zipper closure. This ensures that your pedicure supplies stay together and protected from contaminants.

, In order to keep your feet looking perfect for summer, do a daily spot check for damage to polish.


Apply a thin coat to areas where polish has been scuffed or chipped.
If the chip is deep and affects the uniformity of the surface, buff lightly to smooth rough edges then apply polish over the chip. If this doesn't work, remove polish and repaint the nail.

, Set aside time once a week to exfoliate feet, apply a moisturizing foot mask, and push back cuticles.


This prevents any build-up of dry skin and keeps feet sandal ready.

","How to Get Healthy, Clean and Good Looking Hands and Nails"," There's no use in painting your nails and rubbing in lotion if your hands and nails are dirty. If you have nail polish on, remove it before washing your hands.Grab a toothbrush and squirt some soap on it, then rub it in. Leave it next to you. Wash your hands in warm water, not cold or scalding. Use a good quality soap. Rub the soap everywhere: your wrists, in between your fingers, and the area around your nails. Wash the soap off, and then use the soapy toothbrush to scrub the actual nail and the dirt under it. Then make small circular movements around your whole hand with the toothbrush. This gets the hand really clean and makes dead skin disappear.






;
, Use a clean, preferably fluffy, towel. Don't make them starch dry; leave them a little moist. Don't put on any lotion or clip your nails just yet.








, Search for something to massage your hands with. Almost anything will do: massaging lotion, olive oil, yogurt, warm milk, even lemon juice. Rub a little on your palms and use it to massage the whole hand. Massage slowly; don't rush. Just relax and make sure you actually enjoy this step—that's pretty much the whole point. Rinse off whatever you used with warm water. If you used olive oil or something that can be rubbed in, just leave it in—it'll treat your skin. If you used a lot of yogurt or milk, wash away a little bit and rub in the rest. Don't scrub your hands and wash them thoroughly, completely washing away what you used to massage your hands (that'll make them feel tight and dry).








, You might want to use face cream if you want. Some good brands are Sorbolene (it's great on dry and peeling skin), DermaVeen (again, for dry and peeling skin), and the new Vaseline range. Do it properly: don't slather on the whole lot, but use enough to really get deep down.








, Thoroughly clean the undersides of your nails before clipping the nails: make sure that there isn't any dirt left. It's best to keep them short, which looks neat and is easier to manage. Try to cut all your nails the same length and shape. If you need to, file them afterward. Rub in some cuticle cream on each nail. If you don't have any cuticle cream, use lip balm instead. Leave the cream in for twenty minutes.








, Grab your favourite colour if you're going out. If you're not going out or doing anything special, just use a clear gloss. Your nails really need a break from strong nail polish, or they may get weak or turn yellow. Some nice colours for your hands would be a pearly pink, deep red, or a natural colour. Metallic, glittery and shiny nail polish is very cool too. If you're painting your nails using an actual colour, make sure to sandwich the colours between a thick coat of clear polish, to protect and add shine. How many layers you paint is totally up to you, and depends on the thickness of the polish. Once you're done, wait for your nails to dry. Be careful. If you can, slip on a pair of gloves to lock in all the moisture and protect your hands for a little while. Do this repeatedly if necessary for best results.

Remove callouses and rough skin.,
Un-stain toenails.,
Treat blisters appropriately.",How to Get Nice Feet1," Feet often end up calloused or rough with time. If you want to improve your feet, you can smooth out your skin using an electronic callous remover, a foot file, or a pumice stone.


An electronic callous remover is a motorized device that you move over callouses and rough spots on the feet. It removes dead skin cells and shaves down the rough, outer layer of skin and leaves your feet smooth. A callous remover is fairly efficient, but can be somewhat expensive in comparison to other options.A foot file is a metal device that you use, much a like a nail file, to wear down callouses and rough skin on feet. Foot files are relatively inexpensive and can be purchased online or at most beauty stores.Pumice stones are spongy devices that you can rub over to remove callouses and rough skin. They are probably the cheapest option for treating callouses but are less effective than other options. They can be purchases online, or at drug stores and beauty stores.Look into getting callous-removal gel and use it alongside one of the above methods. It can help increase the efficiency of an electronic callous remover, a foot file, or a pumice stone.;
, Toenails frequently get stained by dirt and debris. If you're worried about discolored toenails, you can use household supplies to remove stains.


Toothpaste, whitening strips, and hydrogen peroxide can all be applied to toenails to remove stains.Dap a cotton ball with hydrogen peroxide and gently swab your toenails. Let the liquid sit for five minutes and then wash it off. Your toenails should look clearer and cleaner.You can also use toothpaste or whitening strips in a similar fashion. However, such substances may need to be left on for a bit longer than 5 minutes., If you have blisters, you should not try to remove them. Instead, treat them in a way that promotes healing.


Keep the blisters clean and protected. Wash them every few hours and then cover with a fresh bandaid.Use antiseptic soap. When at home, take off your shoes and socks and remove any bandages. This will allow the blisters space to breath which can promote healing."

Remove dead skin on a daily basis.,
Keep your feet moisturized.,
Use petroleum jelly to soften your toenails.,
Do not soak your feet in hot water.",How to Get Baby Soft Feet1," Regular daily use of your feet will produce calluses and blisters, which are mainly made up of dead skin. To keep your feet baby soft, remove this dead skin everyday after you’ve had a shower or a bath.Use a pumice stone or foot file to remove the dead skin from your feet. Concentrate on the edges of your heels, the balls of your feet, and the outside edges of your large toes. This areas are more likely than others to build up with dead skin.
Pumice stones and foot files work like sandpaper. The coarse or rough surface of the stone or file slow (and gently) removes any dead skin cells from the outside layers of your skin.It’s usually easier to remove dead skin after your feet have had a chance to soak in warm water, which is why it’s best to perform this step after a shower or a bath.
Use a circular motion when rubbing either a pumice stone or foot file on your skin. You’ll only need to perform this step for a few minutes on each foot.
If you’ve never exfoliated your feet before, it may take several days of performing this step before your feet feel baby soft.;
, Unlike other parts of your body, your feet don’t have sufficient means to keep themselves properly hydrated. Plus, as we age, skin cell regeneration slows down and can increase skin dryness. To help keep your feet hydrated and feeling baby soft, apply a moisturizing lotion or cream to your feet every day.Ideally you can perform this step after you’ve had a shower or bath and exfoliated your feet. But you can also get into the habit of applying moisturizer to your feet every night before bed.
Remember that lotion and cream can make your feet slippery, so be careful if you step onto a tiled or hardwood floor with your bare feet after applying moisturizer.

, An important part of your feet are your toenails. So getting baby soft feet should also include getting soft, non-brittle nails. You can do this by applying petroleum jelly to your toenails each night before you go to bed.While not required, you may wish to put socks on over your feet after you’ve applied the petroleum jelly so it doesn’t rub off on your sheets before it’s had a chance to soak in.

, Hot water, in general, isn’t that great for your skin. The high temperatures can cause your skin to dry more quickly than using warm or even cold water. In order to prevent the skin on your feet (and the rest of your body) from drying out, shower and bathe in warm water instead of hot water. And if you soak your feet, use warm or cool water."

This will help protect your hands from discoloration such as sunburns or age spots.Drinking water is not enough to keep your skin hydrated: you need to apply moisturizer directly to your skin to reap the full benefits., This will help you remember to use it more often. For instance, keep one in your bag, one at your desk, and one at your bedside.A good-quality moisturizer must contain emollients and humectants. Emollients like lanolin, jojoba oil, squalene, and isopropyl palmitate lubricate and smooth the skin. Humectants like glycerin, hyaluronic acid, and urea transfer moisture from the environment to the skin., If your skin is cracked, chapped, sore, and/or bleeding, regular moisturizers might not be enough. A great remedy for this is the following overnight treatment:


At bedtime, apply a lot of petroleum jelly or another heavy moisturizer containing dimethicone, cocoa or shea butter, or beeswax to your hands. Then, put on a pair of cotton gloves and leave them on overnight.Coconut oil and aloe vera are great natural moisturizers. With coconut oil, slather it on to your hands and then put on a pair of gloves. Aloe vera is less oily and more suitable for healing any cracks or sores you may have on your hands., Use warm — not hot — water and a mild cleanser to wash your hands.Avoid soaps that contain fragrances, preservatives, and sulphates, which are drying. A mild, moisturizing, soap-free cleanser would be ideal.To dry your hands, pat them gently with a towel or paper towel, and then apply moisturizer immediately after.Avoid using a hot-air dryer as this could further dry out your hands.Some experts recommend that people who have to wash their hands more than 12 times a day alternate their hand-washing with moisturizing hand-sanitizing gel or wipes. The alcohol in the sanitizers can be drying, but not as drying as regular soap and water sessions., Wear gloves or mittens when you go outside in the winter if it’s for more than a few minutes. Wear rubber gloves when you wash dishes or clean the house.If you dye your hair, garden, or do anything else that can dry out your hands, make sure that you wear gloves.
If you have eczema or sensitive skin, you can benefit from wearing cotton gloves when doing household chores like folding laundry or dusting. You can cover these with neoprene or lined vinyl gloves if you need waterproofing.Avoid vinyl gloves, which can dry out your skin. The best options are cotton or leather or, if you must wear waterproof gloves, disposable vinyl., A humidifier will not only help moisturize your hands, but also your skin and lips. It can also help with a plugged nose. Be sure to clean it regularly to avoid filling the air with bacteria and mould., This is particularly good if you have dry, inflamed, red, and/or itchy skin. Grind oats (quick or old-fashioned are fine) down using a mixer or a mortar and pestle, then sprinkle them into the bathtub as you fill it with warm water. Soak for at least 15 minutes.If you don’t have time for a bath, you can soak only your hands in a tub of warm water and ground oats for at least 15 minutes.
You can also mix ground oats in a basin with warm olive or jojoba oil, and then soak your hands in that for 10 to 15 minutes., Do not do this if your hands are severely dry or chapped. This is more for if you have relatively healthy hands that just look a bit dull. Do this up to four times a week, being sure to moisturize immediately afterwards.Pay close attention to how your hands respond to the exfoliation. If your hands become worse, decrease how many times you exfoliate them each week. If they don’t improve, discontinue exfoliating all together.
A natural exfoliant you can make with ingredients in your pantry comprises 1 to 2 tablespoons of sugar (avoid the coarse raw stuff) mixed with olive oil.If your hands are particularly dry and calloused, you might need to use something stronger than an exfoliating cream — for instance, a pumice stone., If you’ve tried everything and your hands are just not improving, consider seeing a doctor to rule out any health issues that you may have.

, Make sure that you regularly wash your nails when washing your hands. Use a soft-bristled nail brush to gently clean around and underneath your nails.









If you have stubborn dirt under your nails, you can gently scrape it out with a metal file. Just be careful that you don’t damage the skin between your finger and your nail while doing so.

, Get a smooth, fine file — a rough, coarse-grained one will only break and tear your nails. In addition, file your nails in one direction only. Sawing back and forth at your nails can cause them to fray and break.







, Cutting your nails regularly can put physical stress on your nails and cause them to break or have growth problems (e.g. ingrown nails). It’s better for your nails to file them regularly instead of cutting them.


If you must cut your nails, aim for straight or curved edges to reduce the risk of growth problems., Your cuticles help prevent fungus and bacteria from getting into your nails. When you cut or otherwise manipulate them, you not only break that barrier, but you also risk your cuticles becoming inflamed or ragged.It can be tempting to push back your cuticles in order to make your nails appear longer, but don’t do it! If you regularly get manicures, ask that your aesthetician leave your cuticles alone, too.

, When applying moisturizer to your hands, be sure to work it into all parts of your hand, including your cuticles and nails.








Cuticles and nails can become dry too, so be sure to keep them well moisturized so that they look their best.
Putting oil around the cuticle is a great way to keep your cuticle and nails looking great. You can use household oils like olive oil or coconut oil, or invest in a cuticle oil, which you can find at most drugstores., Nail hardeners can make your nails more brittle and prone to breakage. Unless your nails are very flimsy, fragile, and weak, you don’t need to use a nail hardener., Research has shown that acetone strips the nails and causes them to become brittle. It may also irritate the skin of your hands.Opt for removers that say “acetone-free” on their labels.These are generally not as aggressive as acetone-based removers, but they’ll still get the job done over time.

, If you want to put something on your nails, try a ridge-filler. This can help make your nail polish go on more smoothly. It is preferable to a nail buffer, which will remove ridges but will also weaken the nail over time.







, When painting your nails, start with a protective base coat (there are ones that also contain ridge-fillers). After you’ve painted your nails, follow it up with a top coat, which will help lock in the color.









Experts recommend using nail shellac instead of nail polish. Shellac lasts longer and helps prevent brittle nails by boosting their hydration.Be aware that nail polishes can contain toxic chemicals that will weaken your nails or worse. Try to find polishes that don’t contain toxic chemicals. Even then, give your nails a paint-free break once in a while., You can fake a french manicure by running a white nail pencil under the rims of your nails to make the tips of your nails look white.


Just be careful not to damage the skin between your nails and fingers while you’re doing this.
Massage cuticle oil into your nails before applying the pencil to give them a healthy-looking glow.

, Getting regular manicures and pedicures can actually worsen the appearance of your hands by increasing the risk of infection. In addition, hands and nails can become dry from the chemicals used at the salon.If you don’t want to give up your manicures, consider bringing your own tools to the salon to lower the risk of infection.If you must get fake nails, choose tips instead of ones that fully cover your actual nails. This will minimize the risk of damage to your nails., Taking biotin supplements has been scientifically proven to improve the thickness of your nails. Try taking 2.5 mg of biotin each day for several months, and you should see a difference."

, Put lotion or foot cream on as a part of your routine. One way to achieve soft, moisturized feet is to rub on some lotion or petroleum jelly before bed, and slip on some socks. When you wake up in the morning, you'll find that your feet are very soft and are free from dryness! Just remember to never let the area between toes become over-moisturized, as this will cause fungus.

, Your feet will stay healthier if you wear proper footwear designed to keep your feet clean, dry and at a comfortable temperature. You dress the rest of your body to stay comfortable in different weather conditions, and you should do the same for your feet.


Keep them cool in the summer with sandals and footwear that breathes. If you wear shoes that make your feet hot in the summer, you could end up with odor or a fungal infection.
Keep them warm in the winter with waterproof boots and socks. If you wear shoes that don't keep your feet warm enough, you're more prone to getting frostbite.

, Dealing with odor is a problem many people face, since feet produce more sweat than the rest of the body and tend to harbor bacteria that creates a smell. If your foot odor has gotten out of hand, there are measures you can take to make them smell better right away.


Try changing your socks more often. If your feet tend to sweat a lot throughout the day, bringing an extra pair of socks with you could really help to decrease the odor that builds up. Change your socks when they get damp with sweat.
Keep your shoes clean. Sometimes the odor is worse when sweat and bacteria build up in shoes. Then every time you put them on, the problem is perpetuated. Wearing socks with your shoes, cleaning them every so often and buying new shoes when it's time are all ways to reduce odor.
Try foot powder. There are many products designed to keep feet dry and odor-free. Try sprinkling foot powder, baby powder or talcum powder in your shoes before you put them on.

, Athlete’s foot and other foot fungus tends to grow in moist conditions. A few tweaks in your hygiene routine can prevent you from having to deal with these unpleasant afflictions, which often cause itchy rashes. Do the following to keep your feet clean and dry:


Change your socks often. It's the top prevention method for all kinds of foot-related issues, from odor to fungus. Wearing damp socks provides the perfect environment for fungus to grow, so change them often, especially if you sweat a lot.
Use foot powder. Many people sprinkle powder in their shoes to keep everything clean and dry.

, If you shower in a locker room or another public place, take precautions so you don’t end up with someone else’s foot fungus. Showers are typically damp environments that can harbor fungus and bacteria. It's not a good idea to step into a public shower without protection on your feet.


Wear flip flops or shower shoes when you shower in locker rooms and other public places.
It's also important not to share shoes with other people. If you're an athlete, don't share cleats and other athletic equipment.

, Every few weeks, trim your toenails to keep them healthy and strong. Trimming them the wrong way results in ingrown toenails, which can be quite painful. Trim them strait across, rather than trimming the edges into a curve. You should also avoid trimming them too short, since this could result in ingrown toenails or an infection.If you would really prefer a rounded shape instead of a straight square, use a nail file to smooth out the ridges and to give the edges a bit of a curve, so you would end up with a square shape with rounded edges.

, Painting them does not necessarily have to be part of every pedicure routine, but regular pedicures really make a difference in keeping your feet soft and free from dry and rough skin, and your toenails clean and neat. You don't need to spend a lot of cash to have your pedicure professionally done in a salon, and with a few tools, you can do your own pedicure right in the comforts of your own home.

, If you’re on your feet a lot and they tend to be sore, massage them before you start your pedicure. While this step isn't absolutely necessary, it's a nice way to pamper yourself a little. If you're already taking time to give yourself a pedicure, why not?


Knead the soles. Use your thumbs to press into the soles of your feet in a circular kneading pattern. This well help loosen the tight muscles there.Stretch the toes. One by one, gently pull your toes back and forth to stretch them out and ease tightness and soreness.

, As an added treat, you may also wish to infuse the water with a few drops of essential oils or Dead Sea salts, to keep the feet smelling good and to soften hard skin respectively. The soaking time indicated here is merely just a suggestion -- you may choose to soak your feet for much longer if you want to relax, or if the hardened skin on your feet need extra hydration.


Exfoliate your feet with a foot scrub to slough off dry and dead skin, and to moisturize your feet as well. The skin on your feet is thicker, and to keep it soft and smooth it’s important to remove dead skin with exfoliation. Massage the scrub in circular motions, and rinse off afterward. To exfoliate the hardened skin on the heels and bottom part of the feet, use a foot file or a pumice stone. Make sure to use a gentle filing motion, and to never rub too hard. If you have tough callouses, try a callous shaver to remove them from your heels and the sides of your toes. This will prevent them from getting larger and causing pain.

, Trimming your nails while they're still soft from soaking makes the task much easier. Remember to trim them straight across, and not too short. Use an orange stick or a cuticle pusher to gently push your cuticles back toward your skin. Finally, rub some cuticle oil on your nails and cuticles to moisturize the area and keep your cuticles from tearing.


Cut your toenails straight across, as opposed to a curved shape, to prevent ingrown toenails from occurring. If you would really prefer a rounded shape instead of a straight square, use a nail file to smooth out the ridges and to give the edges a bit of a curve, so you would end up with a square shape with rounded edges. Ensure that the nails are cut and filed to just the right length -- short, but not too much that you end up hurting yourself.
Remember to include your cuticles too. While you shouldn't cut your cuticles, if desired, you can apply cuticle oil to your toenails to soften and moisturize the hardened edges, and push the cuticles back with an orangewood stick to create a smooth, open area ready for your polish. Make sure that you do not push too hard, or you might risk cutting the cuticles and exposing your feet to possible fungal infection. Some people also prefer to skip this step completely and leave their cuticles untouched -- this is okay as well.

, With all the wear and tear your feet experience, it's important to moisturize them from time to time. After you've soaked your feet, exfoliated your skin and trimmed your nails, use a lotion or cream to protect your skin. Rub it all over the top and bottom of your feet, including your toes.


If you have a tendency to get callouses, consider a very rich cream. This will keep your skin moist and slow the growth of more callouses.
If your heels tend to crack in dry weather, wear socks to bed after moisturizing.

, If you'd like to end your pedicure with a pretty final touch, apply the nail polish color of your choice. If you want a long-lasting pedicure, you might want to start with a clear base coat. Let that dry, then paint with the color you have chosen using the ""three stroke method"", which consists of using one stroke on each side and a stroke in the middle. This ensures that the polish is evenly applied on the whole nail. Finish with a clear top coat to set the polish in place and prevent it from chipping.Use toe separators to keep your toes apart. This makes the process of painting easier, and prevents a freshly painted toenail from staining another toe.
Remove nail polish after a few days so it won’t stain. If you leave the polish on your toenails for too long, you might find that your nails look yellowed when you finally take it off.Acetone, the active ingredient in most nail polish removers, has a severe drying effect on skin and nails. Consider using a nail polish remover that doesn't contain acetone.

, It's a common foot affliction that you can deal with on your own at home. Be careful what equipment you use, though, since an ingrown toenail can easily become infected. Start by clipping the toenail straight across. Gently lift the ingrown part and slide a tiny ball of cotton under it to keep it from growing deeper. Change out the cotton every day until the problem is corrected.


Protect the toe while it's healing. You might want to bandage it to make sure it doesn't get infected.
If you see any signs of infection, see a doctor.

, If you have an itchy rash, chances are it's athlete's foot. There are over-the-counter creams that can be successfully used to treat athlete’s foot and other fungus. Use a cream according to the manufacturer's instructions until the rash goes away and your foot feels better. In the meantime, make sure you change your socks often.


If the condition doesn’t go away after a few days, see a doctor.
Toenail fungus is a different type of fungus, and it's much harder to treat. If your toenails are brown or yellow and cracked, see a doctor to discuss a prescription that might help.

, A bunion occurs when the bone on the side of the foot experiences stress and begins to grow outward. This condition can become very painful if you don't take measures to correct the problem. Bunions are often genetic, but they can also be caused by wearing shoes that are too pointy at the top (like high heels or ballet shoes).


Make sure your footwear isn’t causing problems. It might be time to trade in those stilettos for some comfy flats.
Wear bunion pads. They're available for purchase at drugstores. You place them over the bunion to prevent it from rubbing against your shoes.
Consider surgery. If you have a very painful bunion, you might want to consider surgery, since there's nothing you can do to make it go away on its own.

, If you experience pain that doesn’t go away, it’s important to seek medical attention.


There are many bones in the feet that can easily become fractured.
Walking on a hurt foot can exacerbate the problem.

Turn on the shower and lather up.,
Wash your feet.,
Dry your feet.,
Trim your toenails.",How to Clean Your Feet2," Add washing your feet to your daily routine. Daily washing prevents foot odor and infection. Adjust the water temperature to your comfort and step into the shower.


Get your washcloth/loofah wet in the water and wring it out so it’s moist, but not soaked.
Use a bar of soap or pour some body wash onto the moistened washcloth/loofah.
Rub together until bubbles start to form.

, Use a towel, loofah, or sponge to scrub the dirt away. If you have built-up dirt, you will need to scrub a little harder and use more soap.


With your washcloth/loofah, gently scrub each foot focusing your attention on the arch of your foot, in between toes, and under toenails.
Rinse the towel, loofah, or sponge between cleaning each foot. Add more soap if necessary.
Remove any soapy bubbles or residue by thoroughly rinsing your feet.
Turn the water off and step out of the shower.

, Excess moisture on your feet and between your toes can promote growth of bacteria and fungi . To prevent infection, it is important to keep your feet as dry as possible. Drying after washing will also prevent the build-up of new dirt on your feet.


Remove your feet from the tub and dry them with a clean towel.
Be sure to dry between your toes because that is a common place for fungal and bacterial growth. , While washing your feet, you might have noticed your toenails were getting too long. Properly trimmed nails prevent over-grown toenails and the build-up of dirt underneath the nail.


Be sure to use toenail clippers, not scissors.
Trim the nail straight across so it is just over the toe. Cutting nails too short can lead to the development of ingrown toenails. File down any pointed edges with an emery board.

, Just like shirts, socks come in different sizes and shapes, and though they may stretch somewhat, one-size socks often fit poorly and are a common cause of blistering. If you can feel your sock move up and down your leg, it's causing abrasion. A good brand of socks will offer at least four sizes.

, These allow the sock to grab the arch of the foot, giving a snug feeling. The arch support also helps prevent the sock from bunching up.

, Denser socks wick more moisture and provide cushion for a longer period of time. They support the feet better, and they often last longer.

, Look for socks with reinforced heels and toes, as these are the areas that wear out the fastest.

Soak your feet.,
Exfoliate.,
Moisturize.,
See your doctor.","How to Care for Rough, Dry Feet1"," Although spending a long time in a chlorinated pool or hot bath is not good for the skin, soaking your feet for 15 minutes prior to moisturizing or exfoliating is helpful. Once your feet have healed and are no longer dry and rough, you won't have to soak them for treatment.


Long soaks in a hot bath deplete the natural oils in the skin and the heat reduces the moisture in skin's outer layer, all of which contribute to dry skin, so limit the time you soak.
Do not soak your feet more than three times per week or you’ll contribute to the drying skin instead of treating it.
You can make different soaking mixtures, including:

A mixture of baking soda, water and a splash of vinegar in a bucket of warm water.Mild soap (scented if you wish) with a bucket of warm water.
Half a cup of epsom salts in a tub of warm water.A quarter cup of white vinegar in a bucket of warm water.
A quarter cup of lemon juice that will dissolve dead and dry skin.;
, Mechanical exfoliation means removing the dead top layer of skin in order to treat the underlying layers. You can use a pumice stone, stiff brush, or loofah after softening the top layers of skin through soaking.A pumice stone is found at a pharmacy or in the pharmacy department of a large store.
You don’t need a specific type of stiff brush. Even a brush from the household cleaning department works as long as you don’t use it for anything else.
It's a good idea to soak your feet in warm water or take a warm shower for 10–15 minutes before exfoliating.

, Once you have removed the outer layer of dead cells it’s time to add moisture back to the skin. Moisturize immediately after a shower or soaking using a non-alcohol based product to trap the moisture that is on the skin and keep the skin moist. Some moisturizers work to seal in the moisture on your skin and others work by penetrating the skin to the dermal layer.Thick creams like Eucerin and Cetaphil work to trap the moisture in the skin. Other products with lanolin work in the same way. Olive oil has the same effect on the skin and is likely in your kitchen cabinet. Use just a little, rubbing it and massaging it into the skin.
Other moisturizers will be absorbed into the skin and work at the dermal layer. Coconut oil is an oil that has many beneficial properties, including being naturally antibacterial and antifungal. Used on your feet it will moisturize the skin, improve healing of any cracked areas, and help prevent infections.Alcohol-based products may be less “greasy” feeling, but the alcohol will also dry the skin out faster.
After moisturizing your feet put on a pair of cotton socks to reduce the potential for slipping and falling on the floor and to keep the moisturizer on your feet.

, If these remedies are not successful after repeated use, you may need to see your doctor. Expect to be tested for hypothyroidism if the dry skin extends to your arms and legs as well.If your dry skin is resistant to the measures you have taken at home, your doctor may recommend an over-the-counter product that contains lactic acid or lactic acid and urea. These ingredients help the skin to hold more moisture.
A more serious condition might require prescription ointments or creams to reduce the potential that the skin will crack due to dryness.

Stay hydrated.,
Watch the side effects of any medications you are taking.,
Wear cotton socks.,
Wear shoes that allow your feet to breathe.,
Avoid harsh, drying soaps.,
Use warm water in the shower or bath.","How to Care for Rough, Dry Feet2"," Your skin uses the moisture in your body to stay hydrated and nourished. When you get dehydrated, the water in your body is used for the highest priority functions, like blood flow, before it is used in the skin. By drinking at least eight 8 oz glasses of water per day, the skin all over your body will stay hydrated and not dry out quickly.Try to avoid alcohol and caffeine whenever possible as these can heighten the itchiness of dry feet., Diuretics used to decrease the amount of water in the body or topical or oral retinoids used to treat acne can cause temporary dry skin.If the side effect of dry skin is present for more than two weeks, discuss a potential medication change with your physician.

, Cotton socks allow your feet to breathe and dry off if you’re sweating. Keeping sweat against your skin will increase the rate at which moisture leaves the skin and your feet dry out.Change your socks daily or after sweating (e.g., from a workout or a long walk). Wash them well after each use.
Sleep in socks after you moisturize your feet each night.

, Avoid wearing the same pair of shoes day in and day out. Your feet need to breathe in order to retain moisture so try to wear supportive sandals during the summer or other shoes with air pockets. During the winter, avoid wearing your heavy winter boots indoors at work or school and instead bring another pair of lighter and more breathable shoes to change into., Harsh soaps do not get you any cleaner than one that is gentle to your skin. However, they do dry out your skin and leave you prone to dry skin. Harsh soaps deplete the fats in your skin, which leaves your skin feeling tight and dry.Dermatologists often recommend soaps with a high glycerin content, such as pure glycerin bar soaps and naturally made bar soaps. You can find these at most drug stores and all natural health stores., Instead of a having a hot shower or bath, keep the water at a warm temperature and limit your time to less than 10 minutes in the water. Hot water and low humidity in the air reduce the water in the outer layer of in the skin, which results in skin that feels tight and dry.A good rule of thumb is to set your water temperature in the shower/bath to one that feels comfortable but that doesn't make your skin red.

Know the functions of your skin.,
Diagnose dry and rough feet.,
Understand the causes of dry feet.,
Prevent dry and rough feet.","How to Care for Rough, Dry Feet3"," Your skin, your body's largest organ, is tough and stretches. It has the job of protecting your body from bacteria, viruses, and fungi. When there are cracks and breaks in the skin, this allows infectious agents to access your blood supply. In addition, your skin functions in thermoregulation, or keeping your body temperature at an optimal temperature for functioning.Your skin is sensitive which allows you to feel different types of sensations which are interpreted by the brain. There are no areas of the body that are normally numb, or without feeling, including your feet.
New skin cells are made each day. Your body gets rid of between 30,000 and 40,000 skin cells from all over the body every minute of every day.The dead skin cells are on the top 18 to 23 layers of skin.Your outer layer of skin which consists of dead skin cells is called the epidermis. This area of the skin is very thin in some areas of the body — such as the eyelids — and thicker in others — such as the bottom of your feet. When the old skin cells in the epidermis fall off, new cells are underneath.

, Dry skin is called xerosis. It will appear lighter in color than the rest of the foot and will often feel rough to the touch. You might experience:Itchiness
Cracked skin
Redness
Fissures (deep cracks) in the heel of the foot
Peeling skin
Both the heel and ball of the foot where most of the contact with the ground is made, are at higher risk of becoming rough. This increases the risk of cracking and peeling skin.

, The skin on the bottom of your feet can become dry and rough for a number of different reasons, including:Age: Age and hormonal imbalances caused by aging (due to processes like menopause) cause your skin to lose elasticity and lipids, which increases the risk of dry skin.

Climate: Living in a dry climate can reduce the amount of moisture in the skin and result in dry skin. In addition, air conditioning removes humidity from the air, reducing the natural moisture in the skin. Winter weather is also damaging to the skin.

Skin conditions: Atopic dermatitis and psoriasis are two skin conditions which can develop dry and rough patches where they affect the skin.

Chlorine: Swimming or soaking in highly chlorinated pools can reduce the natural moisture in your skin.

Medical conditions: People who have diabetes often suffer from dry skin on their feet, which increases their risk of infections. Poor blood supply can lead to reduced moisture to the skin cells and increase the risk of complications.If you have diabetes and dry feet, visit a doctor or podiatrist for your foot care needs.

, Prevention is always the best medicine. It is easier to keep your feet well cared for than to reverse the effects of dry and rough skin. Here are some tips for maintaining healthy and soft feet:As you age, take good care of your feet, using the treatments mentioned above.
If you swim consistently in a chlorinated pool, take extra precautions to care for the skin over your feet. Chlorine will remove moisture from your skin and result in dry skin.Shower and bathe only as long as necessary to get clean but not longer. Opt for showers over baths to decrease the risk of reducing the natural moisture in your skin. Always moisturize (with a non-alcoholic moisturizer) after each bath or shower.
If you suffer from atopic dermatitis or psoriasis, take special care of the skin on your feet to reduce the potential for cracked and peeling skin.
If you have diabetes, evaluate your feet every night for breaks in the skin. You can reduce the risk of developing complications related to your diabetes if you practice prevention and care for your feet."

It doesn’t matter how gorgeous they are, buying a pair of shoes which is one size too small or too big is a fashion faux pas. You won’t feel or look comfortable and it’s not worth the pain. The size is just indisputable.;

Use the sanitizer correctly.",How to Make Gel Alcohol Hand Sanitizer1," The components needed to make gel alcohol hand sanitizer are common household products, so it’s quite possible that you already have them. If you don’t, you can obtain them easily at any drug or grocery store. You will need rubbing (isopropyl) alcohol that is at minimum 91% pure and plain aloe vera gel. That’s it!


To be comparable to store-bought products like Purell or Germ-X in terms of effectiveness, the final product needs to be at least 65% alcohol.Using 91% isopropyl alcohol will place your final product within that range.
If you can find 99% isopropyl alcohol, choose that. It’s not required, but it will increase the germ-killing effectiveness of your final product.
Aloe vera gel also comes in a variety of purity options. You’ll want the purest that you can find – simply check out the label to get the purity information.This doesn’t alter the effectiveness of the product, but using the purest you can find will ensure that your final mixture contains the least amount of additives and additional chemicals.;
, The tools needed are also very common household items, which makes this process even easier! You’ll need a clean bowl, a spatula (or spoon), a funnel and a recycled liquid soap or hand sanitizer bottle. If you don’t have an empty bottle on hand to upcycle, you can use any kind of container you want, as long as it has a lid.

, Measure out 2/3 cup of isopropyl alcohol and 1/3 cup of plain aloe vera gel and dump both of them together in to the bowl. Use your spatula (or spoon) to stir vigorously until the ingredients are fully mixed together.


If you’d prefer not to mix by hand in a bowl, you can use your food processor instead.

, Use the funnel to pour the mixture directly from the bowl into the bottle you’ve chosen to use. Replace the pump, lid or cap on your bottle. Now you have your finished product and it's ready to use immediately!


The mixture will keep for 6 months or more. Store it away from direct sunlight to get the longest shelf life possible.Put the mixture in smaller bottles that can easily fit into a purse, backpack or briefcase for use on the go. If you purchase any commercial sanitizers, save the bottles so that you can upcycle them later, since those are perfect for this.
You can usually purchase new empty bottles of this size at the grocery store. Check the aisle with travel size personal care items.

, There is actually a proper way to use sanitizer to get maximum effectiveness from the product. Before you start, make sure your hands are clean of visible dirt and grime. Sanitizer isn't meant for situations when you find your hands dirty with actual dirt.


Using about a palm-sized amount of the sanitizer, rub your hands briskly together for 20 to 30 seconds, taking care to get underneath your fingernails, between your fingers, the back of your hands and your wrists.
Allow the sanitizer to dry completely, without wiping your hands off or rinsing them with water.
Once the sanitizer dries completely, the process is complete."

Determine your goal(s) for adding essential oils.,

Choose essential oils for medicinal purposes.,
Use caution.,
Add your chosen oils to your sanitizer.",How to Make Gel Alcohol Hand Sanitizer2," Essential oils can be added to your sanitizer for fragrance alone, but the benefits of essential oils extend well beyond simply providing a pleasant scent.The oils have been used for thousands of years by cultures all over the world to provide healing effects for mental, physical, and emotional ailments.Inhalation of the different scents offers a wide range of psychological and physical benefits known as aromatherapy.Essential oils can also be used medicinally by way of both scent and physical application to provide additional health, hygiene and beauty advantages.
The use of essential oils in your hand sanitizer will not only deliver a terrific smell, but they can also address specific physical and mental health issues.

, Inhaling the scent of a particular essential oil can stimulate your brain to trigger a variety of mental and emotional reactions. By adding them to your hand sanitizer, you can have a therapeutic experience while also killing pesky germs. You can choose one oil or combine oils to create multi-layered effects. The world of aromatherapy is far too vast for a detailed examination here, but there are some specific essential oils that are most commonly employed for use in hand sanitizers.


Cinnamon essential oil has fragrance properties that can reduce drowsiness and enhance concentration.
Lavender essential oil is a rejuvenating scent that can induce relaxation and feelings of calmness.
Rosemary essential oil has properties known to boost information retention, alertness, and memory.
Lemon essential oil has an uplifting scent that can help ease depression and sadness while also boosting energy.
Peppermint essential oil is an invigorating scent that can soothe frazzled nerves and improve mental clarity., Essential oils have naturally occurring chemicals in them that can provide medicinal and curative benefits when inhaled into the lungs or applied to the skin.There are several essential oils that are known to have powerful antibacterial, antifungal and/or antiviral properties. These qualities make the oils ideal for use in hand sanitizer because they will boost the effectiveness of the product with natural ingredients.


Cinnamon essential oil is known to be a potent antiseptic and its fragrance can also decrease headache pain.
Lavender essential oil can relieve pain associated with headaches and migraines pains, and can be applied topically to relieve minor skin irritations.
Tea Tree essential oil is known to have powerful antiseptic and antibacterial properties when applied topically.Eucalyptus essential oil has antibacterial properties and can help relieve achy muscles. Inhaling it can clear sinuses and boost the immune system., Essential oils are highly concentrated and can have negative side effects if used improperly. Pregnant women and those with immune deficiencies shouldn’t use them without consulting a doctor first. If you’re new to the world of essential oils, do a skin patch test before adding it to your hand sanitizer and using it topically.


Never apply an essential oil directly to the skin without diluting it first. Because they are so concentrated, some of them can be skin irritants.When working with essential oils, use the highest grade products that you can find. Check the label for terms like “pure grade”, “aromatherapy grade”, “certified organic” and “therapeutic grade” when purchasing.

, Measure out 2/3 cup of isopropyl alcohol and 1/3 cup of plain aloe vera gel and dump both of them together in to the bowl.Add ten drops of your chosen essential oil(s). Do not exceed 10 drops! Use your spatula (or spoon) to stir vigorously until all of the ingredients are fully mixed together.

Tear up rags for a trial run.,
Make your own from flannel.,
Set up your storage system.,
Wet before wiping (optional).,
Wipe as usual.,
Wash the cloth.",How to Make a Substitute for Toilet Paper1," Wash whatever rags or old clothing you have around. Tear them into squares measuring 4x4 inch (10x10 cm) or larger. Try a sports jersey or washcloth, since these tend not to fray.This is a cheap way to try out the idea. Keep reading for more durable options, followed by instructions for use.;
, With a little initial expense, you can make a long-lasting, comfortable ""toilet paper."" In the long run, it will make a big difference in household expense and environmental impact. Here's how:


Buy a yard of cotton flannel from a fabric store. Choose a patterned cloth to hide stains.If your family is squeamish about sharing these, buy one pattern per person.
Cut into squares between 4 and 6 inches (10–15 cm) on each side. Ideally, use pinking shears to reduce fraying.
Optionally, stitch around the edges with a serger, preventing fraying. Flannel rarely frays anyway, so this is not required., Set up an open container for the clean cloths. Choose a second container with a lid for the used cloths. Ideally, use a small trash can that you can open by stepping on a pedal. Line this with a pillowcase so you can easily transfer the cloth to the washing machine.Some people add water and vinegar to the used container to disinfect the cloths. A wet container becomes much smellier and grosser than a dry one, so this is not recommended. This may not even reduce bacteria, since they thrive in moisture.Place a ""Cloth only"" sign on the used container.

, You can use the cloth toilet paper dry, which keeps odor low in the used container.However, a little water might make the cloth more comfortable and easier to wash. There are several ways to add this to your bathroom routine:


Wet the cloth in the sink or with a spray bottle before wiping.
Rinse yourself with a bidet before wiping.
Dampen the stack of clean cloths each time you load the container. Due to the risk of mildew, you'll need to wash remaining cloths every two or three days.

, There's no special trick here. Cloth will clog the plumbing if flushed, so tell the household to use the container for used cloth.


You can use ""personal cloth"" for both urine and feces. Some households choose to use it only for urine, and stick to regular toilet paper for feces.

, About every two or four days, toss the pillowcase and the used cloth into the washing machine. You can combine them with any other laundry except for towels, kitchen cloths, or jeans (which may trap the cloth in pockets).To ensure they are disinfected, follow these guidelines:Agitation is an important part of cleaning. Wash laundry loads large enough to rub against each other, without tightly packing the machine.
If residue remains, increase the length of washing or the amount of detergent or (for high-efficiency washers) the amount of water.
Use the high-temperature setting.
Add bleach to the laundry, or sun-dry as a more eco-friendly disinfectant.

Act perky.",How to Look Fresh," Sleep is arguably the most important part of looking fresh. After all, when people are thinking about freshness, the first thing they think of is probably someone who is at the start of their day following a long and fruitful rest. People who sleep at least 8 hours per night actually feel more attractive, and they tend to look it too.Prolonged sleep deprivation comes with a laundry list of negative traits, not least of which includes dark eye circles and a bloodshot complexion.


If you find yourself having trouble getting to sleep at a normal time, try making a point of going to sleep at the same time each night. It may be tough to adjust to at first, but your body will eventually fall into the habit of tiring out at that time.
Oversleeping isn't usually as big of a risk for people, but it is something you'll want to be mindful of. If you oversleep, you'll feel just as groggy as you would without sleep, but you'll have also lost precious morning hours while you're at it.;
, Freshness has a large part to do with the way your hair looks. Greasy hair doesn't make for a good look on anybody. Though rinsing your hair in the shower each morning is recommended and feels good, you may not need to use shampoo as often as you think. Everyone's hair has its own set of needs, so rather than sticking to a single strict guideline, it's best to listen to your body's indicators and do what seems best.The amount you shampoo your hair should depend in part on your lifestyle choices, most specifically how physically active you are. The more physically active, the more often you should clean your hair.
Overwashing with shampoos is a bad idea as well. Although no one will ever hold a value on hygiene against you, you can inadvertently remove healthy natural oils out of your hair (and skin!) by overdoing it on the hair cleaners.

, Eating well is something everyone knows they should do, so it is lamentable that few follow through with it. Nonetheless, it should be made a priority if you want a fresher look. A healthy diet is manifest in virtually every part of your body, from the hair to the skin and everything internal.Although each person's diet should be custom-tailored to match the needs of their body, there are probably some things you eat regularly you know you could do without.


Cutting out 'empty calories' (like soda) and replacing them with healthy alternatives will transform your appearance by itself in as little time as a month.
Eating well has a considerable effect on your mood as well as your appearance. Being in a chipper spirit will make others perceive you as fresher than they normally would otherwise., Cardio exercise involve exercises like swimming and running that strain the lungs and heart. The benefits for these exercises are numerous.Not only will your lungs and heart get significantly stronger, your skin will look tighter and you're bound to lose pounds if weight is a current issue for you.


If you struggle with motivation concerning exercise, remember that it's only difficult to start. Once you get going, the subtly addictive properties of the endorphins you'll get during exercise should keep you coming back for more once you've made a habit out of it., While black eyeliner frames your eyes, white eyeliner opens them up. Running a line along the lower lid will make your eyes look more awake.

, It's especially important if you're not getting enough sleep regularly, as your body depends on full sleep to naturally rehydrate. Make moisturizing part of your daily hygiene ritual and you should see rewards in the way your skin looks before too long.


There is some debate as to whether an eye-specific moisturizer is really worth it, but it is recommended if you want the best effect on your eyes. Eye moisturizers have more delicate properties in them that are custom made for the area around your eyes.

, Everyone deserves to pamper themselves every once in a while. If your hands and feet are looking weary, taking them for a gentle, thorough treatment will improve the look in a potentially big way. Although it can be a bit costly if you're going on a regular basis, the way it changes the way you look can affect change in your self-confidence and the way you perceive yourself.


You can give yourself manicures from home if your budget is a concern.Nail clippers, a nail file, a rich cream and some polish can be used to give a great at-home makeover of your hands and feet. You may not be able to get the perfect look as you would in a professional studio, but you'll save a lot of money in the long run.

, When you're feeling tired, the first thing that suffers are your eyes. With that in mind, looking fresh with makeup has a lot to do with making your eyes look more alert. As lashes frame the eyes, curling them upwards can open them up wide. Use an eyelash curler and hold it up for five seconds.You can achieve a similar effect with curling mascara.

, While eyeshadow is less versatile for given events and situations than an easy eyeliner or mascara, it's still something you might want to look into if you're wanting to get the freshest look.

, Lighting powder is handy for a look of freshness because it takes your surroundings into consideration.A light dusting across your face will let light pick up on your face more effectively, which in turn will have a freshening effect on the way you look. Lighting powder is especially effective when you're going to have photos taken of you.

, Even if you've had the best sleep of your life and a long shower to boot, you won't look fresh if your clothes are a big mess. Giving things a 'sniff test' doesn't always cut it. Instead, you've got to put different regulations on different pieces of clothing.For example, in the case of jeans and most pants, you can wear them over the course of several days before they begin to lose their stretchiness. Tops should be laundered much more frequently however, as natural body odour is most concentrated from the torso upwards.


You should also keep your bedsheets in mind if you want the ultimate freshness. Sweating into your bedsheets can leave them smelly and gross. If you're prone to sweat or body odour, washing them as often as once per week is a good idea. Pillows and comforters can be done a few times a year., At the end of the day, you should carve out a unique and personal look for yourself. That doesn't mean, however, that you shouldn't at least have some appreciation for the sorts of fashion styles that come and go over time. This is especially true if a fresh look is important to you. Staying up to date can make you look contemporary and hip, and it's relatively easy to stay up to date.Subscribe to some hot fashion magazines, or take a trip to the mall to see what styles are getting showcased.If you're really daring, you can work these current trends into an existing style you've designed for yourself. Then, as time goes by, you can continue reinventing your personal style with the new looks these trends provide.

, Form-fitting clothes will make you look your freshest. Wearing something that's too baggy (or awkwardly tight) won't make it look like a lot of thought went into your outfit. Your best bet is to do some research into the kind of clothing types that best fit certain body types. It should go without saying that one natural body type is no better or worse than any other.Rather, it's the way you work with it that counts.


At the same time, don't let yourself get tied down by your body type. Your fashion sense should be liberated if anything, and if you think you can pull off a certain outfit in spite of what the guidelines say, you absolutely should.

, If you've got your chin up and your head invested in whatever you're involved with currently, people are bound to perceive you far differently than if you're looking glum and hate the world. Of course, it's never enough simply to want to be in a good mood. Knowing how to bring out the best side of yourself is crucial. Be mindful of the way you're feeling, and don't be afraid to laugh.If you're in a good mood, you'll have a positive impact on the way others feel when they're around you.


Laughter is a wonderful thing, and it's probably the easiest way to improve your mood outside of mindfulness. If no one's around to make you laugh, try putting on a comedy. Seeing the lighter side of life for a change can have a transformative impact on the way you feel for the rest of the week.

Common mullein (Verbascum thapsus), found throughout the world.Lamb's ear (Stachys byzantina), native to Asia but cultivated in most temperate climates.Pine needles still attached to the branch.This may not be as comfortable as other options, but the natural brush shape makes it easy to wipe.

, Although popular among the Romans, this method is no longer considered a great idea. Sponges pick up filth and bacteria quickly, so you'd better know where the sponge has been.

Brush your teeth.,
Wash your hair regularly.If left unwashed for more than a couple of days, your hair will build a shiny layer of oil that will make you look unkempt and greasy.,

Shave or style facial hair.You can have facial hair and still be considered clean by virtually every standard.,
Moderate the use of makeup.,
Moisturize your face.Dry skin will add years to your appearance and make you look like you're in a permanent need of sleep.",How to Look Clean1," Your teeth bear the brunt of a lot of abuse and gunk over the course of your day. Between food and other factors, it's important to keep your teeth clean and white. Brush your teeth twice a day; once in the morning, and another time before going to sleep. Take at least two minutes to brush your teeth. It may help to divide your teeth into sections and spend 30 seconds brushing each quarter of your mouth.Although whitening strips have nothing to do with actually cleaning your teeth, getting your teeth a few shades whiter can make your mouth look cleaner.
Flossing is recommended as well. Flossing helps clean your teeth in the spaces your toothbrush isn't able to reach. Even if you brush twice a day, you should floss a maximum of once daily.;
, Having a shower and cleaning your hair thoroughly with shampoo is recommended at least three times a week. Apply the shampoo evenly throughout your hair, and massage it to the scalp. Although you should rinse your hair in hot water every morning, you should only shampoo your hair every other day. This will allow for a healthy build of natural oils to make your hair shiny without becoming excessively greasy.


Keep your hair properly maintained. Even if you're trying to grow it out, you should be regularly trimming the ends to prevent split-ends. If your hair is long, you should make a point of brushing it throughout the day, especially if you're spending time outdoors where it's windy or rainy.
Your hair should be thoroughly brushed or combed after washing it. This will keep it from being a mess once it dries.

, Applying a lip balm regularly will keep them from getting chapped or flaky. This is especially important if you have a natural tendency for dry lips. Even if you look clean everywhere else, unkempt lips will attract negative attention.

, However, you should take care to keep your beard neatly trimmed. For a truly clean look, facial hair should be kept less than half an inch long. Use a specialized beard trimmer to keep your beard evenly cut every couple of days. Because every strand of hair grows at a slightly different pace, it's a good idea to make a more common habit of facial hair maintenance, rather than waiting for the point where it gets too long.


Cleanly shaving your neck is a good idea as well. A scruffy neck looks unkempt by most standards.

, Makeup can effectively highlight and emphasize certain facial features, but heavy cosmetics should be left for the fashion runway and horror films. Caking on makeup can look suffocating or even cartoonish, and the build-up of material on your skin will look anything but clean. Even for the most glamorous occasions, it's better to use too little makeup than too much. A natural look is ultimately a clean look, and cleanliness will attract the best sort of people toward you.


Makeup should be promptly removed at the end of each day. If you leave it on it will have a negative effect with the oils in your skin. This can lead to blemishes.

, Although a full body moisturizer can also be recommended, it's most important to moisturize your face, as this is the part of you people look at the most. Take a dab of moisturizer and apply it in a slow, gentle and circular motion evenly across your face, focusing on the cheeks and the area around your eyes.


Moisturizing your skin is especially important if you have a tendency for oily skin and acne. Keeping your skin free of preventable blemishes will keep you looking clean. Don't pick at any acne marks or you'll risk potential scarring.
Consider getting a specific moisturizer for your eyes. Eye moisturizer is composed of a more delicate material than regular moisturizer to compensate for the gentle skin around eyes.In a pinch, washing your face with a damp warm cloth can help scrub away excess dirt and oil.

Shaving body hair should be done at the end of your shower, when the hair follicles will open up more easily.Waxing is a more effective way of getting rid of hair, but some consider it too painful to do on a regular basis.


Alternatively, you can purchase an epilator. An epilator is a machine that removes individual hairs one by one. They are less painful than a waxing strip, but unfortunately take much longer to get rid of all the hair.

Iron your clothes.,
Bring an umbrella if it's wet outside.,
Make sure your clothing fits.,
Keep your outfit simple.",How to Look Clean3," It should come as no surprise that looking clean includes making sure your clothes are clean too. Clothing builds up an excess of body sweat the longer it's worn without cleaning, and stains can occur for a number of reasons. How often you clean clothes depends on the article in question as well as your lifestyle. The same pair of pants may be worn for a few days before it needs cleaning, while underwear and shirts are generally ready for the laundry after one use.Give your clothes an inspection to judge for yourself how often you should be laundering them.

On the other hand, clothes that are far too tight look constricting and uncomfortable. Depending on your body type, you should pick clothes that give an accurate shape of your body. Don't hide yourself in your clothing.

, If cleanliness is a priority to you with regards to your appearance, you should take lengths to simplify your outfit.

Take to your orthodontist about ways to floss if you have braces, such as dental threads.
Be sure to clean in between your back teeth too, using the floss around all sides of the molars.
Mouthwash does not physically remove plaque and food and is not a substitute for flossing.

, While going to the dentist every six months is not strictly necessary for healthy adults, children and those with dental issues should talk to their dentists about frequent checkups. Monitor your teeth, note any changes or worrisome pains, and get your teeth professionally cleaned at a minimum of once year. Smokers, diabetics, and people with a history of cavities should see the dentist twice a year or more. "

There are certain concentrations of chlorine bleach you can use for different surfaces.For stainless steel surfaces and items used for food consumption: Dissolve one tablespoon of bleach in a gallon of water and clean the stainless steel.
For non-porous surfaces like countertops, sinks, or tile floors: Dissolve one third of a cup of bleach in a gallon of water.
For porous surfaces, like wooden floors: Dissolve one and two thirds of a cup of bleach in a gallon of water.

, After cleaning the surfaces, leave the solution to work for 10 to 20 minutes. After the time period elapses, rinse the surface with clean water. After these two steps, close off the area, and leave it like that for one hour.

Fever. Just like in any other infection, the norovirus infection will cause fever. Fever is a way in which the body fights infection. The body temperature will rise, making the virus more vulnerable to the immune system. Your body temperature will most likely rise above 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius) when suffering from a Norovirus infection.
Headaches. High body temperatures will cause blood vessels to dilate in your entire body, including your head. The high amount of blood inside your head will cause pressure to build up, and the protective membranes covering your brain will suffer inflammation and become painful.
Stomach cramps. Norovirus infections usually settle in the stomach. Your stomach may become inflamed, causing pain.
Diarrhea. Diarrhea is a common symptom of Norovirus contamination. It occurs as a defense mechanism, through which the body is trying to flush out the virus.
Vomiting. Vomiting is another common symptom of an infection with Norovirus. Like in the case of diarrhea, the body is trying to eliminate the virus from the system by vomiting.

, Unfortunately, there is no specific drug that acts against the virus. However, you can combat the symptoms that the norovirus causes. Remember that the virus is self-limiting, which means that it generally goes away on its own.


The virus generally lasts for a few days to a week.

, As mentioned above, most infections subside after a few days. If the virus persists for longer than a week, you should consider seeking medical help. This is particularly important if the person who is sick is a child or elderly person, or a person with lowered immunity.

Carefully shave your pubic hair.,
Get your pubic hair waxed.,
Consider removing certain parts of your pubic hair.",How to Look After Your Pubic Hair2," If you choose to remove your pubic hair, shaving is less painful that waxing and the most economical option. To ensure a comfortable shave:


Trim your pubic hair before shaving. Use scissors to cut your hairs as short as possible. This keeps hairs from snagging onto the razor and pulling at your skin.
Choose a razor designed to shave pubic hair. Most razors will work fine but if you plan to shave in a delicate and hard to reach place like between your buttocks, a specialized razor can prevent nicks and cuts from happening. For example, some razors are equipped with a trimmer or are coated with a soothing lotion.
Bathe or shower before shaving to open up your pores and soften coarse hairs. Typically, pubic hair is thicker than the hairs on our heads.
Use shaving cream to help protect your skin while shaving. However, be careful not to put shaving cream onto your genital area as it can cause irritation and inflammation.
Apply aloe vera or baby oil after shaving. Don’t use moisturizers with chemicals or fragrances.

, You can get waxed by a professional or do it at home. However, there is an element of pain that comes with pubic waxing. To relieve pain, take aspirin or ibuprofen 30 minutes before waxing.To ensure a comfortable waxing experience:


Wait until your pubic hair is about a quarter of an inch (1 cm) long before waxing. The wax will grab onto the hair follicle, making it easier to remove.
Follow the instructions of at-home wax kits carefully. Some kits will have a pot or cup of wax for you to heat and apply, while others will have premade strips ready for you to use.
Test the temperature of the hot wax before applying it to your pubic area. A burn down there can be extremely uncomfortable. Test the temperature by applying a bit of wax to the inside of your wrist. Wax needs to be hot enough for it to spread over your skin but not hot enough that it will burn it.
Wear cotton underwear and clothing after waxing to allow your skin to breathe and avoid irritation.

, There are different looks and styles you can give your pubic region. Some popular styles include:



The Landing Strip: This look leaves a narrow and vertical strip of hair right above your genitals. The width and length of the strip depends on you.

Bikini Wax or Trim: This look takes away pubic hair that would be visible if you were wearing a bikini bottom or underwear.

Completely Bare or Brazilian Wax: All hair is removed in this look.

Figure out your skin type.,
Understand your needs if you have normal skin.,
Know how to address oily skin.,
Learn to care for combination skin.,
Understand the needs of dry skin.,
Start each morning by cleansing your skin.,
Apply toner after washing your face in the morning.,
Moisturize after toning.,
Apply sunscreen every morning.,
Wash and moisturize your face again before bed.,
Use a serum before bed to address spots.,
Exfoliate once or twice a week.,
Do a self-exam every month.,

Amend your routine to address changes in your skin.",How to Have a Good Face Care Routine," The four major skin types are normal, oily, dry, and combination. Each of these different skin types has different face care needs, and using products formulated for your type will improve the health of your skin.


Normal skin may get a bit oily in the T-zone (the area covering your chin, nose, and forehead, in the summer) but doesn’t really get dry and rough.
Oily skin is characterized by oil production and large pores all over your face.
Dry skin often feels tight and rough because of lack of moisture, gets flaky in winter, feels itchy after swimming or showering, and is accompanied by small pores.
Combination skin is similar to normal skin in that there will be some oil production, but you'll also have large pores in the T-zone.;
, People with normal skin tend to have the easiest time caring for their faces. The main thing to remember is to avoid toners that have alcohol, which can dry your skin. Ingredients to avoid include:Isopropyl alcohol
Denatured alcohol
Ethanol
SD alcohol 40

, The big challenge with oily skin is excessive oil. Many people often use products that strip oil from the skin, but this leaves your face dry and leads to more oil production. Light moisturization is what you're going for instead:


Wash your face with a dissolving or gel cleanser at least twice dailyUse an alcohol-free toner that contains sodium PCA and witch hazel
Use an oil-free moisturizer that contains glycerin
Go for a zinc-based sunscreen
When it comes to serums, try an AHA, BHA, or retinol serum that will reduce the appearance of pores

, Combination skin can be a problem to care for because some areas will be dry while others will be oily. Essentially, use the same face care products as you would if you had oily skin, with the exception of the moisturizer. Instead of an oil-free moisturizer, opt for a lightweight one.Many lightweight moisturizers will have the words “lightweight” or “light” on the label.

, Dry skin is very sensitive to products, so it’s important to use the right ones. The key with dry skin is to avoid anything that could dry your face further, and to use products that will add moisture back to your skin:


Use a mild cleanser that doesn’t foam or lather
Avoid all products, especially toners, that contain alcohol
Use a hydrating moisturizer with a thicker consistency that contains sweet almond, jojoba, evening primrose, or borage oil
Try an antioxidant serum that has vitamins A, C, and E, Wet your face with warm water. Apply a dime-sized dollop of cleanser to your fingers and apply the cleanser to your face. Rub in a circular motion for 30 seconds. Use your hands to rinse the cleanser from your face. Pat your skin dry with an absorbent towel.


Use warm water instead of hot, as hot water can lead to natural oils on your skin being stripped away.Do not rub or scrub your skin when you dry it, as this can cause damage and irritation.

, Once your face is clean and dry, soak a cotton ball or pad with toner and gently rub it onto your neck and face. The toner will remove excess cleanser, leftover dirt and impurities, reduce the appearance of pores, and prime your face for absorbing moisturizer., Moisturizer keeps your face hydrated throughout the day, and protects it from dryness and irritation. Apply a nickel-sized dab of moisturizer to your fingers and gently rub it into your face in a circular motion. Give the moisturizer a few minutes to soak in before continuing with your routine.


Consider using a moisturizer with a broad-spectrum SPF 30 for added protection against damaging UV rays.Make sure you still apply moisturizer after washing your face, even if you choose to skip the toner.

, A daily sunscreen application is the best way to protect your face from developing wrinkles, freckles, melanoma (a form of skin cancer), and other damage that the sun can cause. Apply a grape-sized dab of sunscreen to your fingers and gently rub it into your face, neck, and ears.Use sunscreen with an SPF 30 every day of the year, even if it’s the middle of winter. UV rays are just as damaging in winter as they are in summer.
Don’t skip the sunscreen just because you use a moisturizer with an SPF.

, Washing your face twice a day will keep your skin free of dirt, oil, pollutants, and other impurities. Before you hop into bed for the night, wet your face, massage your face with cleanser, rinse, and pat dry. When your face is still slightly damp, apply moisturizer.


Washing your face before bed is especially important if you have oily skin or wear makeup. Never go to sleep with makeup on., Most serums are designed to be applied at night, and the purpose is usually to reduce the appearance of lines, wrinkles, blemishes, and spots. Apply a pea-sized amount of serum to the palm of your hand, and use one finger to apply it to spots and lines.


Antioxidant serums are ideal for moisturizing and nourishing your skin.
Retinol serums are good for reducing the appearance of lines and wrinkles.
AHA and BHA serums are often used to brighten skin and reduce the appearance of pores., Exfoliating removes dead skin as well as dirt, oil, and other impurities. Apply a dime-sized amount of exfoliant to your fingers and gently rub it into your skin for 30 seconds. Rinse your face with warm water and pat it dry.


There are also chemical peels and scrubbing brushes you can use to exfoliate your skin if you don’t want to use an exfoliating scrub.
Don’t exfoliate more than two or three times a week, as this can damage and irritate your skin., Regular skin exams are a good idea because they can help you detect possible problems, such as melanoma. Talk to a doctor or dermatologist if you notice any changes. Things to look for include:New moles
Raised moles
Moles turning a darker color
Moles changing size
Open sores
Pink growths with raised edges and a lower center
Raised red patches
Patches of scaly red skin
Small bumps
Flat yellow areas

, A proper face care routine involves daily, weekly, and monthly tasks. Creating a schedule can help you keep track of these tasks, and ensure you don’t miss anything important. Here are some important parts of the routine to remember:


Morning and night: cleanse and moisturize
Daily: tone, apply sunscreen, and apply a serum if necessary
Weekly: exfoliate at least once a week, and possibly twice
Monthly: do a self-exam to check for changes and problem areas

, Having a good routine is all about getting into good habits. The easiest way to do this is to set aside time at the same time every day to address your face care needs. That way, you do the same thing at the same time every day, and eventually it will become second nature.


For instance, if you start work or school at 9 a.m., set an alarm for 7 a.m. every day to remind your self to wash, tone, and moisturize your face.
Similarly, if you go to bed around 11 p.m. every night, set a reminder to wash and moisturize your face before bed.

, Your skin changes over time, and as this happens, you may have to change the products you use. Similarly, if you notice that your skin is reacting badly to a specific product or step in your routine, consider using a different product.For instance, if your skin starts to become drier as you get older, you may need to switch to a more hydrating moisturizer.
Similarly, if you start to break out often, you may need to change the type of cleanser you're using.

Your armpits naturally sweat more once you go through puberty, and underarm hair can trap sweat and bacteria.Wear deodorant every day to feel and smell fresh. There are lots of different kinds of deodorant – roll-on, spray, stick, and those with or without antiperspirant (decreases sweating as well as covers odor). Some are perfumed and others are unscented. It’s up to you which kind to choose.Different deodorants are marketed towards men and women, but really the only thing that’s different is how they smell.

, Whether or not you want to shave your legs, underarms, and private area is completely up to you. Long hair in your armpits and groin might trap moisture and odors, but showering regularly and keeping the area clean and dry should solve that. If you do shave, do it safely and hygienically:Use clean, new, sharp razor blades and plenty of shaving cream or gel (not just regular soap). Never dry shave!
Take your time and go slowly. Ask your mom, aunt, or older sister for help or advice.
Do not shave your face. Pluck stray hairs or tweezers or try a bleach, cream, or wax that is formulated for facial hair. If you have lots of facial hair, see your doctor and ask about electrolysis or laser hair removal to get rid of it for good.Use a non-greasy moisturizing lotion after you shave to keep your skin from drying out. Never use men’s aftershave – it stings!

, Shaving your pubic hair might make the skin in that area itchy, irritated, or prone to ingrown hairs and folliculitis (infection of the hair follicle).Remember that it’s only up to you how you want to groom down there. You can shave your “bikini area” on your inner thighs and leave pubic hair natural, keep your pubic hair (carefully) trimmed with scissors, or stay completely natural. Just be sure to wash well in the shower. If you do decide to shave, follow these guidelines:Use clean scissors to trim long hair first to make shaving easier (do this over the toilet so you don’t make a mess). Make sure no one else uses those scissors!
Soak in a hot bath or shower for a few minutes to soften the hair and skin.
Use a safety-razor (no straight blades or disposables), preferably with moisture strips.
Pull the skin tight and smooth, and shave in the direction of hair growth – be gentle, don’t apply much pressure.
Rinse off with warm water, pat the area dry, and use baby oil, aloe, or a non-perfumed moisturizer on your skin.
See the articles Trim Your Pubic Hair, Shave Your Pubic Hair, Deal With Pubic Hair, or Look After Your Pubic Hair for specific instructions.

, Brush your teeth, floss, and use mouthwash at least twice a day – after breakfast and before bed. This decreases tooth decay, gum disease, and bad breath. Try to use toothpaste or mouthwash with fluoride.If you have braces or aligners, you may want to brush after every meal.


Gently use your toothbrush to brush your tongue, too.

Get a new toothbrush every 3 months, or after you’re sick with something contagious like strep throat.See your dentist about twice a year for checkups and cleanings., Yeast and bacteria can live on your appliance or appliance case if you don’t clean it well. Brush your appliance case every time you brush your teeth, and disinfect it once a week.For retainers, put some denture cleaner like Efferdent or Polident in a cup of warm water, and let your retainer soak. Rinse it well before using it again., If you wear contact lenses, it’s important to keep them as clean as possible to prevent eye infections. Don’t just rinse them with tap water and reuse them, or reuse the same contact solution day after day – this is setting you up to put bacteria in your eye! Rinse your contacts well every time you take them out, clean your contact case thoroughly, and use fresh contact solution. Be sure to replace your contact case regularly, about every 3 months., It’s normal for your feet and shoes to start to smell, but you should try to keep this under control. Make sure your feet are dry before putting on socks and shoes. Alternate which shoes you wear, and let your shoes air out overnight somewhere ventilated (not the bottom of your closet).Wear socks with closed-toed shoes, and choose cotton socks instead of synthetic fibers.If you have red, itchy, or scaly patches between your toes or on your feet, you might have Athlete’s foot. Avoid this by wearing flip-flops in school and locker room showers instead of going barefoot. If you need to, use an over-the-counter foot powder, or see your doctor for help., It’s nice to share, but not when it comes to things like your toothbrush, razor blade, or hairbrush. Keep your personal hygiene items to yourself, and don’t use other people’s personal items. Also, keep your own towels and washcloths."

Change your feminine hygiene products regularly.,
Shower regularly.,
Keep track of your period.,
Ask for help.",How to Have Good Hygiene (Girls)3," On average, you probably need to use three to six pads or tampons per day. For heavier flow (the first few days of your period) and at night, use longer, heavier pads with wings (side protectors) to prevent spilling. Change your pad or tampon every four to eight hours, depending on your flow.Never wear a tampon for more than eight hours because of the risk of toxic shock syndrome (TSS).Don’t be embarrassed if you accidentally bleed into your underwear or on your sheets. This happens to most women at some point. Rinse the linen with cold water and immediately put it in the wash.
During your period, wear dark underwear and clothes. That way accidental spotting will be less noticeable. If this happens at school or in public, tie a sweatshirt around your waist to cover up until you get home.Getting comfortable with tampons can help if you like to swim, play sports, or be active. Tampons with applicators are easier to use than those without. If using a tampon is still uncomfortable, try a bit of vaginal lubricant on the end before inserting it. However, do not use petroleum jelly due to the risk of infection.You can also try alternate products during your period, like cups or THINX period undies.

, It’s not only okay to shower during your period, it’s important to do so. Showering helps you feel clean, and the warm water can improve menstrual cramps. Shower like normal, washing your vagina with warm water. When you’re done, pat yourself dry with a dark colored towel to avoid staining linens, or dry your vagina with paper towels first. Then use a fresh pad, tampon, or cup before getting dressed.


You can remove tampons and cups before showering, but you don’t have to. Of course, take off your underwear and dispose of your pad first.
If you’re bleeding heavily, you should probably avoid taking a bath. The running water in a shower will wash blood away better than still bath water.

Rinse any residue out of the shower when you’re done – don’t leave it for the next person.

, The best way to avoid accidentally bleeding into your underwear or being caught without tampons when you need them is to know generally when to expect your period.There are many websites and apps for this, like WebMDs Ovulation Calculator. Or use a journal, diary, or period calendar. Write down the first day of your period, and keep track over several months.


The average menstrual cycle is 28 days long, but this can vary a lot. Count from the first day of your period one month to the first day of your period the next month. If you take an average over three months, you’ll probably have a good idea how long your cycle is. For example, if it’s 29 days one month, 30 days the next month, and 28 days the third month, add all these together and divide by 3 months – your average cycle is 29 days long. However, keep in mind that your period can vary a lot while you are a teen and it may range from 21 to 45 days.If you have an irregular cycle, talk to your parent or a doctor for advice and possible treatment.

, If you’re not sure how to use a tampon, need help buying hygiene products, or have questions or concerns about your period, ask an older relative for advice. Remember that your mom, aunt, and older sister went through this at some point, too! You can also talk to your doctor, if that feels more comfortable.

Treat your acne.,
Don’t overdo your makeup.,
Care for your nails.,
Wear some nice perfume, but not too much.",How to Have Good Hygiene (Girls)4," If you get pimples, use a gentle, non-abrasive, and alcohol-free acne treatment. Don’t vigorously scrub your skin when you wash your face, because this takes away the natural oils and can make your skin dry, flaky, and can even cause more acne.Try to treat your acne naturally, or talk to your doctor about products you can use.


Ask your doctor for a referral to a dermatologist if you have acne that won’t go away within four to eight weeks of using an over-the-counter treatment or if your acne is painful.There are medications you can take, but some of them, like Accutane, have lots of side effects.Never use your fingernails to scrape your skin or pick at acne scabs. Squeezing, popping, or picking at pimples can cause infections and leave scarring., If you feel self-conscious about your skin you might be tempted to go heavy on your makeup. However, wearing too much makeup can make your skin dry or oily and cause breakouts. Only apply light layers of foundation and use makeup minimally for a natural, healthy look.


There are techniques you can use to hide acne with makeup.

, Keep your finger and toenails trimmed and free of jagged edges. Clean underneath your nails when you wash your hands (and feet), and use an under nail scraper to get dirt out from under your nails if you need to.Use sharp clippers or small manicure scissors to cut straight across your nail, and round out the corners in a gentle curve with a nail file. Use hand lotion on your nails and cuticles.Don’t bite your nails or pull off hangnails. This can cause an infection and look messy. Use clean nail clippers, instead.Paint your nails if you want to! Or just apply a protective layer of nail hardener or top-coat for some shine.Only use acetone-free nail polish remover., If you want to wear perfume or body spray, go for it! Just avoid wearing too much. This can be overpowering and unpleasant to some people. Spray your perfume two to three times in front of you and then walk through it – this will give you a nice smell without being overpowering.


Do not dunk your hairbrush in perfume or spray perfume directly onto your hair. This can dry your hair out.
Remember, wearing perfume does not take the place of taking a bath or shower every day.

Take a look at the ingredients of your shampoos, conditioners, moisturizers, hair gels, lipsticks, mascaras and perfumes.,
Understand the problems you face when using many everyday commercial personal care products:


many beauty products are not well regulated
health and beauty products top advertising breaches (they don’t do what they claim they do)
many use varying mixtures of synthetically produced chemicals
many of these synthetic chemicals have not been approved by regulation authorities, but find their way into products and onto shelves through loopholes in regulations
as much as a third of personal care products contain at least one chemical linked to cancer
mineral oil and petroleum are the basic ingredients in many cosmetic products – these have their origins in fossil fuels
the meanings of ""natural"" and ""organic"" are generally not regulated and can mean whatever the company wants them to mean!,
Choose organic products.,
Be careful of sunscreen.,
Be careful with body lotions, face creams, make-up.,
Be aware of the ingredients in your deodorants and toothpastes.,
Stay aware with hair care.,
Keep learning and researching (see links below).,
Make your own personal care products.",How to Green Your Personal Care," Do you understand the ingredients? It is probable that there are very long words that make very little sense... If one or more of the below statements about your personal care product is true, then the ‘safety’ of your products is questionable. All of the chemicals mentioned next (see ""Tips"" for details) have been linked to health problems and some or all of them are banned in certain countries:


shampoo & body wash often contain sodium lauryl sulphate
hair products often use a combination of: sodium lauryl sulfate and TEA (triethanolamine, DEA (diethanolamine), or MEA (monoethanolamine)
methylparaben appears on many labels, from cosmetics to deodorant and perfume
dibutyl phthalate, or DBP, or diethylhexyl phthalate, or DEHP appear on many labels too.;
, “Organic 100% active ingredients” reads a loud label that misleads you into believing that the product is organic, when it is most definitely not.

, Organic products should be certified, but if they are not, another good way to assess their validity is to look out for a list of natural ingredients. True organic personal care products do not contain preservatives – so there should be absolutely no sign of methyl or propylparabens. It’s up to you – learn to read the label and be careful of products claiming that they’re organic when they are not!

, There are concerns about both chemical and mineral blocking sunscreens. The higher an SPF the more chemicals are involved in its production, and sunscreen encourages a false sense of security – we think we can stay out in the sun longer than is either smart or safe. See further Understand Your Sunscreen Label. It’s all a question of balance – stay out of the sun as much as possible, cover up when in the sun. The average t-shirt has an SPF of 7 and according to an Australian study, and 85% of fabrics have an SPF of 20 or more. Use organic or natural sunscreen properly but as infrequently as possible.

, As already outlined above, the biggest issue with the incredible range of lotions, potions, gels and pastes is the unregulated chemicals that make up their composition. It is medically recognised that the body absorbs a lot of what goes on our skin. A sobering thought: the average adult uses 9 personal care products exposing them to 126 chemicals. Look out for chemicals that are harmful to you (see top 4 chemicals to avoid below) or, rather than scrutinizing every label, go for organic or natural alternatives.

, Household essentials – we can’t do without them. But we can question what goes into them. Did you know that most commonly used antiperspirants contain aluminum – toxic to the nervous system and a cause of irritation? Consider that antiperspirants block pores and stop the body regulating its temperature naturally. Toothpaste contains parabens, titanium dioxide (for whitening) and high levels of fluoride – there is growing concern about the level of fluoride we consume from a combination of our drinking water and toothpaste. We are told that fluoride helps fight tooth decay, but high doses can be poisonous. It is mandatory for toothpastes in the USA to carry a poison warning (since 1997), if they contain fluoride. Look for the natural alternatives in health food stores, or make your own, such as baking soda toothpaste.

, Hair might be dead (it contains no living tissue), but it’s as absorbent as the skin, and the number of chemicals we put on our heads in the name of beauty is particularly scary – shampoo, conditioner, hair spray, gel, serums, wax, hair dyes etc. Shampoos and conditioners use petroleum products, whilst hairsprays and gels use formaldehyde, phthalates and synthetic fragrances – time to start reading the label! The hair colour ingredient Toluene-2.5 Diamine (TDA) is known to be highly toxic. Not only is it dangerous for your health, but it’s harmful to the environment, as is coal tar, which is sometimes also used in anti-dandruff shampoos and preparations. There are natural hair colours using vegetable-based ingredients such as henna, walnut and chamomile extracts which you can use as alternatives.

, You’ll begin to realise that greening your personal care is a long and hard process that is not being helped by numerous cosmetic and personal care product industries bent on protecting profits rather than studying health impacts and providing healthy alternatives. And the frightening aspect isn’t so much the use of the chemicals, but the cumulative effect, because we use so many different products, and the chemical soup that we wash down the drain every time we shower or clean ourselves. Be proactive and read your ingredient labels, demand that changes to products be made by writing to companies that manufacture these chemically laden products and ask your local pharmacist to stock safer products from companies that have taken a conscious choice to remove the potentially dangerous chemicals from their products.

, You can make many different products at home from nature's products, unprocessed in the main. For example, visit wikiHow's Handmade Cosmetics category for many great ideas.


Ionized acidic water from a water ionizer is an eco-friendly multipurpose ""beauty water"" that you can make for pennies on the gallon by hooking a water ionizer up to your tap and filling a glass amber or cobalt spray bottle with it. Great as an all-natural toner, hair rinse, mouthwash, deodorant, hand sanitizer, wrinkle reducer, skin softener, and for treating minor skin irritations.

Pretend that you have body odor.,
Deflect the situation onto yourself.,
Decorate your work space with pleasant smelling items.,
Exercise good hygiene when you’re with them.,
Limit the amount of time you spend with them.",How to Work With a Person Who Has Body Odor1," A common non-confrontational way to bring this issue up with the person is to act as if you have this problem yourself. This is a great way to bring up the subject of body odor with someone, especially if the person is not someone you are very close with. Bringing it up in this way will make them think about their own smells, which may make them realize that they are a little stinky.Try saying something like:


“I’m so sorry if I smell a little; I went for a run during lunch and didn’t have time to reapply deodorant.”
“Do you think the office is hot today? It’s making me sweat, and I feel like I’m a bit smelly.”
“I’m sorry if you can smell my feet; it’s was raining outside when I was running errands and my shoes and socks are soaked.”;
, Another non-confrontational way to bring up offensive odor with a person is to couch your opinion in statements that put the blame on you, not them. Since it can be uncomfortable to tell a person that they smell bad or are wearing too much perfume, it can sometimes be easier to say you have allergies or are very sensitive to smells. This way you can plant the seed in their head that maybe they do have an offensive odor without actually saying it directly. To deflect the issue onto yourself, try saying something like:“What type of perfume are you wearing? I’m allergic to most perfumes, which makes me too sensitive to wear even a little bit of it.”
“I have such a sensitive nose that I can only use a little cologne. It’s like an allergy; even one spray makes me sneeze!”

, If your workplace allows you to bring in scented candles or air fresheners, try keeping them at your desk to see if this helps with the smell. Even if you can't light the candle due to safety reasons, an unlit candle will still give off a fair amount of scent. If these aren’t allowed, try putting a flowerpot or potpourri at your desk for some decoration that subtly refreshes the air around you. Your new scented decorations will mask bad odors and could even hint to the person that the air is in need of refreshing. If they ask, you can say, “I feel like it just sort of smells in the office lately, so I thought I’d perk my area up.” Some plants with pleasant aromatherapy smells include:Lavender
Jasmine
Lilies
Chamomile plant
Geraniums

, Another way to hint at a person’s body odor is to subtly remind them of good hygiene habits. Maybe they are a bit stinky because of a medical issue, a cultural difference, or a simple lack of awareness. Whatever the reason, your practicing good hygiene in front of them will be a subtle cue that your hygiene habits are different. By noticing that you and other people have hygiene habits unlike their own, this awareness could cause them to change their own habits. Try showing them good habits by:Talking about how you always have mouthwash and deodorant in your desk because you get so anxious about your odor before meetings.
Offering them some of your cologne or perfume by saying, “You’ve got to try this, it smells so good!” and handing them the product.
Offering them scented hand sanitizer or lotion after a meal saying, “I just hate when my hands smell like onions all day!”

, If none of your hints are helping with the person’s odor, and you don’t want to confront them about it, just try to avoid them as much as possible. This is really only an option if the person does not work in your immediate location or you don’t have to see them often throughout the day; otherwise, avoiding them will come across as rude and even damage your reputation in the office. If you can avoid them without issue, this is a good way to sidestep their body odor without having to take any additional action."

Avoid gossiping about the coworker's body odor.,
Consider how close you are to the person.,
Talk to the person about their odor in private.,
Let them know gently.,
End the discussion on a positive note.",How to Work With a Person Who Has Body Odor2," When you have to deal with something that involves constant invasion of your senses, like body odor, you may feel an urge to vent your frustration with other coworkers. However, try your best to not bring the problem up with others, especially if you are planning to speak with them directly. Gossiping about the problem could make you seem mean and cruel to your coworkers. Also, since office gossip tends to travel fast, the offending coworker could hear that you were speaking unkindly about them, and any attempt to speak with them about the issue later will seem disingenuous., In general, the closer you are to the person, the more direct you should be. If the offending person is a close work friend, being direct is a great strategy; however, if the person is a superior or a client, being direct about a personal matter like body odor is inappropriate. In this instance, the most appropriate course of action would be to either drop hints first or go straight to Human Resources to help you. If they are not a superior or client and you do have a friendly relationship with them, it would be appropriate for you to tell them directly., No matter how nice you say it, bringing up bad body odor to a person will be uncomfortable. The person will most likely be embarrassed, so waiting to talk to them in a private setting is very important. It is a kind gesture that makes you seem respectful, and it creates a space where the person may feel comfortable explaining their odor. Perhaps they have an allergy to deodorant or a medical issue that requires a colostomy bag. Some tips to initiate the private conversation:Invite your colleague out for coffee or lunch to get them alone and away from the office.
Ask the person to take a walk with you to relieve some stress after a long meeting.
If you can’t talk to the person in complete privacy, be sure to at least pull him/her aside where others can’t hear. Make sure to pull them aside subtly, and don’t draw attention to yourselves.

, It is important to understand the distinction between being direct and being insensitive. In order to be direct without being unkind, you want to be sure to avoid teasing them or using any judgmental language. Don’t prolong the conversation with a long explanation, and instead get to the point quickly. It’s also best to avoid telling them that other people in the office are talking about their odor unless this is not the first time you two have spoken about body odor. Some compassionate conversation starters include:“I want to discuss something that’s awkward, and I hope I don’t offend you. You’ve had a noticeable body odor lately, and since this is the kind of thing people often don’t realize about themselves, I wanted to bring it to your attention.”
“It’s been so hot lately that sometimes, despite proper cleanliness, the heat causes occasional body odor. I’ve noticed, only once or twice, that you’ve suffered from this recently, and I wanted to tell you in order to avoid any future embarrassment.”
“I wanted to meet with you one-on-one because I need to share something with you privately, discreetly, and with as much sensitivity as possible. You may not realize it, but it appears you have a bit of a body odor problem.”

, After discussing the issue, it’s pretty likely you will both feel a little awkward and embarrassed. Because this person is someone you work with, you want to avoid letting this unpleasant interaction linger on any longer than it needs to. End the conversation positively by letting them know you are glad you talked, and invite them to do the same for you if you ever need it. You can even offer some suggestions to help them fix the problem, like buying a desk fan to combat the office heat or suggesting a brand of deodorant you love."

Leave an anonymous note.,
Secretly give them a fresh kit.,
Send an anonymous email.,
Speak to the Human Resources department.",How to Work With a Person Who Has Body Odor3," If you are afraid to tell the person, the least confrontational way of letting them know would be to leave an anonymous note on their desk. One drawback with this method is that it might cause the person to try to figure out who sent the note in the first place, distracting them from the real issue. Just make sure to word the note as kindly as possible, avoiding any language or handwriting that could give you away. Also be sure to place the note somewhere where no one else could accidentally come across it, as this will embarrass the person unnecessarily., Leaving a kit with some refreshing products is a great way to anonymously let the person know that there is a problem with their body odor. Include things like mouthwash, deodorant, scented lotion, or wet wipes in a caddy or gift box, and make it look nice so it seems more like a gift than a mandate. Leave the fresh kit in their gym locker, on their desk, or somewhere where they can find it in private., Bad body odor is such a common problem in office settings that there are many sites that send someone an anonymous email for you. By filling out a few fields, the sites send an email explaining to the person that they have body odor, and some sites even include tips for managing body odor. This is a great way to not only let the person know, but also to provide them with some information so that they can treat the problem proactively. Try one of these sites or look one up yourself:

, If the offending person is your superior or you have tried other methods of telling them without success, you should go to the HR department at your work. Whether the body odor is unavoidable due to a medical condition or the coworker is unwilling to do anything about it, the HR department will handle it in a way that appeases both of you. Perhaps another discussion from a third party will let the person know it’s not just you that things they have an odor issue, or maybe HR will move you to a desk further away from them. Either way, HR will help to resolve the issue delicately so that no one has to feel uncomfortable while at work."

Wash your hands.,
Cool off your hands.,
Sprinkle some powder on your hands.,
Don't use items that cause more sweating to occur.,
Start using an antiperspirant.,
Stay relaxed.,
Look into iontophoresis.,
Take an oral medication.,
Research botulinum toxin injections.,
Consider getting a sympathectomy.",How to Treat Sweaty Hands," Sweaty hands don't dry up on their own, so you'll have to wash them more often than most people do in order to keep them dry. Wash them when the amount of sweat starts to bother you, then thoroughly dry them off with a towel or washcloth.

When you aren't washing up for dinner or after using the bathroom, it's fine to use plain water, rather than soapy water, to wash your hands. This way you'll avoid drying out the skin on the back side of your hands from using too much soap.



 


Carry alcohol-based hand sanitizer (not antibacterial) for the times when you can't get to a sink to wash your hands. A squirt of alcohol works to temporarily dry up the sweat.






Carry a cloth or a package of paper towels so you can wipe off your hands when you need to. Use them before situations when you'll be shaking hands with someone.





;
, Many people get sweaty hands when their bodies are slightly overheated, so cooling them off can be a quick and effective remedy. Hold your hands in front of a fan or air conditioner to dry the moisture and slow down the production of sweat.


To cool your hands down quickly when you aren't at home, find a bathroom and run them under cold water, then dry them thoroughly with a paper towel.
Avoid getting too hot in the first place, if possible. Don't use a heater unless it's absolutely necessary, and turn down the thermostat in your room.

, If you're at home and don't mind your hands looking a little white, sprinkle them with a powder to temporarily absorb the sweat. This can come in handy if your sweaty hands inhibit daily activities like lifting weights, jumping rope or complete chores that require a tight grip. Try the following types of powder:


Baby powder, either scented or unscented.






Baking soda or corn starch.







, Keeping your hands free of articles of clothing and products that inhibit air flow will cause your hands to stay moist, rather than naturally getting the chance to dry. Avoid the following items whenever possible:

Gloves, mittens and other items that cover your hands. Wear them when it's freezing outside, of course, but avoid wearing gloves indoors or in situations where they aren't necessary. Gloves are effective if you want to hide the sweatiness of your hands, but they'll keep your hands so warm that they'll sweat more than usual.






Petroleum-based lotions and other skin products. Petroleum jelly is used by people with dry skin to seal in moisture, and it has the same effect on sweaty skin. Petroleum jelly can prevent your sweat from drying and cause your hands to become greasy. The same goes for coconut oil and other cosmetic oils used to hold moisture against skin.







, You may not think to use an antiperspirant on your hands, since they are usually used in the underarm area, but the same chemicals that prevent your armpits from sweating excessively can help your hands, too.Choose an unscented ""clinical strength"" antiperspirant containing aluminum zirconium, which many find to be effective.
Prescription-strength antiperspirants containing aluminum chloride hexahydrate, a stronger antiperspirant chemical, are also available; talk to your doctor.

, Excessive perspiration is often triggered by anxiety and stress. Practice meditation, yoga or another activity that will help reduce your stress and prevent your sweat glands from going into overdrive.If you get sweaty while thinking of a certain problem that's bothering you, think through a solution and tackle it head-on. If you need help, consider talking to a counselor.
For a quick solution to anxiety-related sweating, have a seat, close your eyes, and take a few deep breaths. Try to calm your mind before going about your day.

, This procedure involves using water to send an electrical current under the skin, which temporarily prevents sweating from occurring.During iontophoresis, the hands are submerged in water while an electrical current is sent through the water. A tingling sensation may be felt, but the procedure is painless.
Iontophoresis kits are available for home use. Talk to your doctor about purchasing one so you can use it any time.

, Oral medicines known as anticholinergics stop sweating as a side effect, so doctors sometimes prescribe them to treat excessive sweating in the hands.This might be a good choice if you aren't an athlete, but if you're an active person, it can be dangerous to interfere with your body's production of sweat, which functions to cool the body when it becomes heated from exercise.
Anticholinergics can also cause dry mouth and other side effects., Botox injections, which are often used to smooth wrinkles in the face or plump up the lips, can also be used to block the nerves that produce sweat.However, injections can be painful, and they only stop excessive sweating temporarily.

, This procedure involves surgically removing a nerve from inside the chest, permanently disrupting the nerve signal that controls the body's sweating.This surgery should be considered only as a last resort, since in half of the cases the body compensates by overproducing sweat in a different area. The sweating in your hands might go away, but you may experience increased sweating on your back or in another area.If you wish to undergo this procedure, find a doctor who has done it before. Don't risk getting such a risky procedure done by someone unfamiliar with the process."

It is a particularly good choice for those looking to avoid aluminum based deodorants. , It is preferred by many because it is believed to be less altered by manufacturers than the other versions. It also lasts much longer than the other varieties. One large stone, if taken care of, could last a lifetime. Stone crystal deodorant does have tendency to develop a slight stink over time. This might not be the best option for those with sensitive noses.
This variety works best for people who shave or have little body hair.

, These are particularly useful for people with armpit hair and a great choice if you want to avoid the smells associated with the crystal rocks. They also do not leave any residue or discoloration on anything it comes in contact with, like clothes and furniture. , This variety is more convenient and easier to use since it is already wet. The roll-ons are ideal for traveling and the gym.


Roll-ons also feel and apply more like regular deodorant, adding to the convenience.

, Powders are messier than the other varieties but you can make them yourself. They are often mixed with natural materials, such as cornstarch, to create a fine powder.Powders are great for deodorizing shoes and socks, as well as body odor.

, Since the deodorant works by preventing bacteria from growing on your skin, you need to scrub with soapy water to ensure that you're as clean as possible. Applying the deodorant to already stinky skin will not eliminate body odor.

Consider what being intelligent and refined means to you.,
Read a lot and read widely on all subjects.,
Learn more languages.,
Keep up with current affairs and news.,
Read critically.,
Speak carefully and use words well.,
Join a few clubs and societies.,
Take advantage of opportunities at school or out of school.,
Work hard, study hard.,
Find intelligent issues to talk about with adults.,
Form your own opinions.",How to Be an Intelligent and Refined Teenager or Young Adult," Are you merely trying to impress others, or are you making a conscious effort to make positive decisions and actions for yourself? Understanding your motivations, whatever they are, can help you achieve your goals.;
, For example, if you like a certain crime novel, read other works in the genre, by the author, and from the same time period or culture. Then expand your scope to encompass a wide variety of time periods and cultures, genres and subgenres. This will help you achieve a greater sense of the scale and variety of works available to you.

, Learning a second or third language will impress others, but it also says a lot about the type of person you are. It shows you care about the world on a global scale, and it proves that you are committed, intelligent, culturally literate, and appreciative of other cultures. It is also a useful asset when applying for a job or traveling and is good for your brain.

, Keep up with a wide range of news types and sources. Follow political, global, economic, social, sport, finance, and tabloid news to stay abreast of what's going on in the world. This will keep you engaged and interested in the world around you so that you can be an active and productive citizen, even before you can vote.

, There is a massive amount of misinformation out there, especially on the internet, and so many supposed news stories or reports are designed to be sensational and dramatic, rather than to report events accurately. And even sources with the best intentions can't fully escape biases when reporting controversial stories. Think critically about everything you read, discuss its merits and weaknesses with your teachers and friends, do plenty of background research on every issue you consider, and consciously decide how much to trust each source you come across.

, Don't rely too heavily on words such as ""like"" or ""yeah"" or ""stuff"". It doesn't show a high level of knowledge or interest in what you're saying. Instead, take advantage of the more specific, powerful words you know, and read a lot to expose yourself to an even wider vocabulary.

, Join clubs or sports teams after school or in your community, based on your interests and hobbies. Make sure to get involved in a wide variety of activities - for example, join your French club, be part of the hockey team, and do debating. This will introduce you to many very different people and ideas, and it will help make you more well-rounded and socially aware.

, Volunteer in your community, become a youth ambassador, help out at the local retirement village. It will teach you compassion and the value of service, and it will put you in close contact with people with very different backgrounds, experiences, and ideas.

, Whether high school or university, make sure you work hard and study for all your exams. Work consistently and always do your best. School is the best way to prepare yourself for a career or life in the world at large, so work to learn as much as possible while you have the chance.

, It will show off your refined knowledge, and listening to arguments and perspectives from different adults can teach you more about the issues at hand. In these conversations, defend your opinions with facts and research, but don't claim to know more than you do and always be ready to admit your mistakes.

, Don't get influenced by your friends and even adults. Don't support causes or issues in society until you look at both sides of the picture. Just because everyone has Instagram or Facebook doesn't mean you need it. However, you can use these social media sites cleverly to reach a large audience for issues you support, and get connected with the news and important ideas by leaders in our world.

Make a list of simple pleasures, and try to surround yourself with 'free beauty.",How to Be an Eclectic Spirit," Being an eclectic spirit means having a lot of interests, or finding beauty in items/ thoughts/ experiences that are classically not appreciated. This can run the gamut. You can branch out by studying a subject that is not widely studied amongst your friends. And of that subject, be sure to dig deeply. If you are studying poetry, for example, maybe read the works by newer, or less famous, authors, too. Or perhaps you are involved in a particular activity that sets you apart from the rest, but you have to remember that you have to love this activity yourself, and you're not just participating in it because you want to be 'eccentric/eclectic'.;
, If you love writing, think of starting your own library of small works or publications of up-and-rising authors, or starting a collection of writing instruments that you can also make use of in your daily life, that you deeply appreciate. Even if you alone appreciate the items. That is the essence of eccentricity, it seems. The eccentric will act in a genuine manner - not dismayed by the actions of those around her/him. An eclectic will typically have a multitude of interests, and will be in constant reflection on these items, experiences, features of life. An eccentric eclectic will then typically have a vast and sundry array of interests, but will not camouflage/ hide her interests. She will live authentically.

, Study everything. Try to see the relationships between all life, and the relationship between studies or topics that superficially seem very far removed. The way that I've acquired new interests, often, has been in 'linking' a new subject with an older subject that already fascinated me.

, Be true to your own person. You can be highly eclectic and not dramatic. You can be eccentric in how you live - by living authentically - without acting. Eccentricity is so rare, partly, because most people are hiding who they are, or acting a role. Don't worry about appearing more or less eccentric or eclectic. Be open to new experiences (but don't necessarily 'embrace' everything!) Be open to the possibility of what a new experience will bring to your life, without necessarily HAVING to engage in this new way of being. For example, if a friend wants you to try yoga, try asking yourself ""why? should I? I might like it"" - don't necessarily say ""no"" off the hop. At the same time, if - and only after you've given a topic some thought - do not want to do something, don't force yourself to do it.

, Know the people who you associate with - or try to get to know them. And don't model behaviour and/or try to be like someone, no matter how clever, eclectic or 'open' if he/ she seems cruel or cutting. There is, for example, oftentimes huge debates over the subject of art - and what should be allowed in art, be allowed by an artist. One artist was found starving dogs for performance art. Now, despite the fact that this is a very 'different' way of trying to be artistic, the plain fact of the matter is that if you care AT ALL about animals, this story is horrifying. So it doesn't matter how unique, cutting edge, etc someone/ or something is... If it doesn't sit right in your soul, AVOID going down that path.

, It is GREAT to develop new interests and be open to new experiences, but this doesn't mean you have to lose yourself, or that your personality has to change. If you are introverted and often a little shy, you can try to summon up a little courage and do something differently - say, go to an art gallery opening, or breach a conversation with a friendly looking peer. This does not mean that your essence is changing. If anything, by learning new stuff, reading more and LIVING more, you are simply going to learn more about yourself, too. Maybe the truest part of you...was simply hidden.

, They change so quickly, and what makes someone else's sense of colour/ style etc. more important - more valid - than your own?? If you love something, pursue it, and create your own fashion. A great way to do this is to go to thrift stores, and also learn how to make alterations with a sewing machine. Thrift stores carry such a wide array of styles in clothing, that you experiment. And because the prices are usually far lower - a 'mistake' purchase at a thrift store will cost far less than one made at a high end boutique, or even the mall.

, Also, being eclectic doesn't mean that your style has to clash. On the contrary! The basis of eclecticism is that if something is very durable, and of high quality, well proportioned lines and a beautiful form - it will go with other well designed, beautiful items. Eclecticism doesn't mean going for odd pieces and hoping for the best. It means being appreciative of the beauty that has existed in various forms throughout history, and not ignoring or devaluing past contributions simply because they are of the past.

, The heart of an eccentric person is childlike. Not childish. An eccentric personality will be attracted to the natural splendor, just as is a small person, a child, before he or she becomes aware that others are watching, and tries to act differently. At the heart of an eccentric being is an egoless being. This is not the same thing as having no personality. Simply...not being egoistic - not being so full of yourself, as most adults are, that every word you speak is measured, and compared to the words of others. Or every purchase you make is with another person in mind, rather than yourself. If you are buying yourself an item of clothing - go with what you love, not what others TELL you THEY love. If someone else loves your style - terrific! That's great. Flattering, yes? But don't change your style to accommodate a parent, sibling, uber-controlling boyfriend etc.

, There are times, of course, when people who care about us will want to 'help' us. Maybe they can see that we are headed down a self destructive path, for example, and want to offer advice. It is always smart to listen, to question. But if someone has a history of trying to change you into a different person, simply because they hold an idealized form of who you are or could be - and the changes would be entirely superficial - try not to be swayed. Sometimes parents want their children to always remain ""cute"" or dependent. This is understandable, but not the best for YOU and your personal growth.


If there is a character that you love, whose fashion style you love etc. - look to her as a model for ideas. This is not stealing. Very often you will find that you do not like a style of dress on your own being as much as you like it on the character. You may be totally infatuated, even, with a character and may aim to 'change' yourself to be more like the character. To a point, this isn't really harmful, because if there behavior is in sync with what you love and how you'd like to be (say, more confident, or more outspoken, or more carefree etc.) then it possibly is a positive change. But remember - you don't have to change every aspect of your behavior to have improvement. If you have traits that are holding you back, then work on those, but don't idolize another for being 'better' than you. A more confident person is not better than you, simply because she or he is more confident. Everyone has problems, or areas of their life on which they need to work. No one is perfect.

, Made truer to your own person. Take personality quizzes on-line, such as the Kiersey or the Myers Briggs Personality Inventory or the Enneagram to learn more about your personality (but remember - you are much more than a 'type'). Look at ordinary objects in a new light. When is an old, mucky rain boot from your childhood NOT an object for the trash bin? When it can be made into a potter for vine plants! (Eccentric people were probably the first recyclers - they valued what others saw, often, as 'junk' and breathed new life into that which as often rejected).

, If you were a sensitive, warm, giving child - you probably are much like that, in essence, as an adolescent or an adult. Or what to be. But increased pressures such as school and work can make it hard for our real being to be known. Stress destroys. Instead, do something in accordance with how you - as a child - would have acted or given or been. If you have an old toy from childhood, that meant a lot to you, and that won't break your heart if you give it away - then give it away to someone, say a little child - that has nothing or needs the pick me up. Sometimes 'old' or worn objects, that obviously mean something to us - will then be seen as extra special, especially if the child is the recipient of the gift. A gift doesn't have to be 'new' or 'sterile' or in fresh packaging to be a gift, or to be meaningful.


Since children are often the most eccentric, and eclectic - spend extra time with your younger siblings, younger cousins etc. Read them stories, and ask them questions. Ask them all sorts of questions, and listen to their different replies. They will often provide as the muse for change in your life. If you have no young siblings, no younger cousins etc., but are a young adult - think of becoming a mentor or helping out. If you are a teen, and too young to mentor - think of volunteering at a pound or local animal shelter. Animals are very authentic beings - they do what they want, according to their personality and take on things, and can be quite healing.

, Write anything you want! The more you write, the more you will crave to write. Free association writing is a neat exercise you can try as well.

, A trip to the library. Changing how you take your coffee - adding brown sugar instead of Splenda, getting up early enough to see the sun rise, developing your own morning prayer or meditation ritual that only YOU know about, going to various churches or synagogues - even if you are an atheist - for a new, fresh take on being alive, watching clouds. In essence - being random!. Remember, what makes you different makes you beautiful.

When you're at work, school, or even doing something more mundane, like going to the grocery store, you should opt out of responsibility with daydreaming. Imagine what it would be like to jam out on your Stratocaster with Hendrix at the Fillmore, or catch a sick wave off Point Reyes. Live in your mind and make it awesome.


Stuck in class? Not when you've got your imagination. Imagine yourself walking out in the woods, or kissing your crush, or what kind of grilled cheese you're going to make when you get home.
Daydreaming doesn't make you a failure or a slacker. Einstein's special theory of relativity? It started with a daydream, wondering what it would be like to travel beside a beam of light traveling through space. This led to what might be the most famous scientific paper ever written, ""On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies,"" which explored the daydream in depth.;
, Ambitions? Plans? Not for the airhead. Watch every sunset, smell every flower, nod at every passer-by. Be in the moment, man. Don't stress about things like jobs, college, or ""careers."" Don't worry about issues or politics. That stuff will all work itself out. Have fun.


If you struggle with always being obsessed over the future, getting nervous about an upcoming test, or graduation, or what you're going to do this weekend, take some time to meditate. Just sit. Relax. Try to still your mind for 15 or 20 minutes at a time, watching your thoughts float by.
Don't worry about the past either. Forget whatever you've done that was bad and focus on being here, now, thinking about today. Airheads are not angry, hateful, or rude. Airheads don't hold lasting grudges. An airhead's range of emotions go from happy to mildly disappointed to happy again.

, Plastered on the airhead's face should be a grin. Why not? Push away dark thoughts, stresses, and only focus on the fun things in your life. Even if you're on your way to work, you might as well grin. It'll be over soon, and then it'll be the weekend, and you can party.


Try to get along with everyone. An airhead doesn't play favorites or find people to antagonize. To be an airhead, try your best to look at everyone as being the same, for better or worse. If you want to be air-headed, you should go out of your way to say hello to strangers, striking up conversations with all sorts of people.

, An airhead handles everything–heavy subjects, successes, failures–with total indifference. An airhead doesn't need to express ""deep"" emotions, preferring to stay blissfully ignorant of stresses and cares. Think of it as zen calm.


Practice your platitudes. If a friend is going through a rough patch, or has just experienced some kind of turmoil, it's best for the airhead to rely upon cliches and overly simplistic wisdom: ""That's too bad. Sometimes you just gotta go through the darkness to enjoy the light, know what I mean?"", An airhead never needs to be anywhere on time. What's the point? What's time anyway, but a bunch of little ticks on a machine? Leave the watch at home and operate on your own internal chronometer.

, Your friends just texted to say they're heading to the beach tomorrow, but you've got to work? Call in sick. Beach bashes with friends are too good to miss out on because you've got to be stuck in the kitchen, or the office, or class. Carpe that diem.


You'll have to walk a fine line between responsibility and fun. You want to be able to work enough to maintain the airhead lifestyle you like, but not so much you tax yourself. Try to work just enough to keep l-i-v-i-n.
Try your best to find a job that you enjoy, so working will be as much like fun as possible. Check out the next method for advice about airhead employment.

, Airheads are great to have around at all kinds of social functions, and are ready to throw down and party at a moment's notice. If you want to be an airhead, you've got to commit to being ready for fun.


Don't plan out parties ahead of time, just go with the flow. Go hangout at the bar or in another high-traffic area on a Friday night to see where the night leads. Be a leaf in the partying wind. Throw your own party if you can't find a good one.
Keep a party bag on you at all times. Keep an energy drink, a sports drink for rehydration, some gum, some cash in case you wind up at a cash-only bar or need a cab ride, your toothbrush, your cellphone charger, and anything else necessary for partying. If you're serious enough, you might even need your passport.

, The real secret of the airhead? There's more going on in there than meets the eye. Real airheads surprise friends and acquaintances with moments of sudden brilliance. Airhead-ness is often just a mask that covers an inner well of enlightened dignity. At least, sometimes it is.


Keep surprise talents hidden until opportune moments. Maybe you've learned how to play the banjo extremely well, but have told no one. Wait until one shows up at a party, then play ""Clinch Mountain Backstep"" like a banjo wizard. When everyone says, ""Why didn't you ever tell us you played banjo?"" a good airhead response would be, ""Nobody asked.""
Airheads are often vague about the past, or what goes on in their lives. There's a certain mystery to airheads: where did they come from? What do they do? If someone asks you these questions, give vague answers: ""I'm just passing through, I guess. Having fun.""

, To lighten your load, find out how little you can possibly work to make enough to keep yourself in a responsibility-free lifestyle for as long as possible. Crunch a few numbers and find out what you need to make, then cut your hours until you're just on the level. How much money do you need every month for rent, food, and other expenses? Bonus airhead points if you can find some way to work from home. Doing work on the computer in your PJs? Now you're talking.


Give some consideration to changing your living situation and trying to live as cheaply as possible. It might be hard to be an airhead and own your own home, but splitting a loft space with five or six others will help keep the rent low and your living expenses manageable. You'll be out partying all the time, anyway, so who cares about roommates? More people to have fun with.

, If you're the kind of airhead who needs people around to make things a bit more fun and provide entertainment, find work where you'll be able to socialize as part of your job. If you can be having fun at work, it won't have to be like work at all.



Bartenders have to be able to do a lot very quickly, negotiating drinks and customers all at once, but if you work the day shift, things tend to be a lot quieter. Your tips may be smaller, but you'll be able to chat with customers and pour drinks at a leisurely pace.
Consider anything in the service industry. Waiting tables, selling shoes, anything in which you're dealing with customers might be a good option for the airhead. No big decisions need to be made, just the ability to pay attention and listen, both airhead qualities.

, Sunning yourself while working? That's every airhead's fantasy. Try to cultivate talents and skills that will allow you to work in the great outdoors. Some good low-stress outdoor jobs for the airhead might include:


Gardener
Surfer
Trail guide
Fishing guide
Landscaper

, Traveling on someone else's dime, touring around the world, listening to live music every night? The music industry is full of airheads, and you don't even need to be on stage to be a part of it. There are lots of employment opportunities that could be easily filled by an airhead such as yourself. Consider studying music production, live sound, or other related subjects and look for jobs such as:


Live sound technician
Roadie
Disc jockey
Guitar tech
Producer

, Airhead or genius? If you like making things with your hands, thinking conceptual about art, or just enjoy drawing, build some necessary skills to do what you love. It'll take some work to hone your skills, studying the fundamentals of painting, drawing, sculpture, and other necessary skills, but then you'll be able to break free and start breaking those rules. Making dioramas from rotten banana peels? Making flags from thong tags? Making busts from chocolate and lard? It's art, if you know what you're doing.


Secure a studio space nearby where you're living, or think about trying to find ""live-work"" studios, which are usually low-cost and will help keep your overhead low. You might have a drafty loft with a bed in it, but there'll be plenty of room for you to work and collect materials.
Research arts residencies that will allow you to live in a community of like-minded artists and dreamers, where you might even be paid to spend time working on your craft. Residencies like the Fine Arts Work Center in Provincetown, the Skowhegan School of Painting, and Djerassi Resident Artists Institute all offer space to work and live, doled out for free. What could be more conducive to the airhead than that?

, An airhead needs to be as free from commitment and responsibility as possible, to stay focused mainly on the self. Keeping pets, having children, climbing corporate ladders: these things are difficult for airheads to wrap their brains around. If you want to live this kind of lifestyle for as long as possible, it's important not to get locked into long-term commitments and consequences that mean you'll have to settle down and stop living day-to-day.

, An airhead isn't ""dumb,"" an airhead is someone who is free from worry, focused more on fun than responsibility. That doesn't make you dumb, and you shouldn't affect an ignorant persona to attract other airheads. Make arguments, have opinions, and put your intelligence on display. Being true to yourself is what being an airhead is all about, ultimately.


It's not cool, sexy, or funny to be anti-intellectual. It's just dumb. Be informed about the issues you care about and show genuine interest when someone who is informed is talking. Don't put down others if they're not automatically air-headed about everything.

, Smoking, drinking, and partying hard are all stereotypical airhead behaviors. You can avoid them entirely or indulge occasionally–it's up to you–but you need to find a healthy medium between too much and too little. Having fun might be important, but you need to take care of yourself to ensure a long life of partying to come, and avoid self-destructive behaviors that might be mistaken for fun.


Set partying rules for yourself and stick to them strictly. Maybe, ""No weeknight partying after the age of 25"" is a rule you can enforce, or the ""2 am means go home"" rule. Keep a list of your partying decrees and keep it with you. Make it part of your airhead thing.
If your partying is inhibiting your ability to work, keep relationships, or stay healthy, you need to cut back significantly. If you suspect you have a drinking problem, or are struggling with other addictions, get the help you need.

, The difference between an airhead and a slacker is that airheads can take care of themselves, so we forgive their sometimes empty-headed behavior as a personality quirk. If those quirks get in the way of your ability to feed, house, and clothe yourself, however, it's a problem. If you're going to be an airhead, it's absolutely essential that you also be able to take care of yourself and provide for yourself in basic ways. You don't have to be a homesteader or a survivalist, but you do need to be able to pay your own way through the world.


Airheads have a reputation for mess–who's got time to clean?–but Try to stay on top of your living space to avoid a hoarders-type scenario. No free-roaming ferrets or uncleaned cat boxes, please, especially if you've got housemates. Be an adult.
At a certain age, it's important that you move out of your parents house and start taking on your own responsibilities. It's nice to have a support net if you're struggling to get on your feet, but take active steps to make any return-moves as quick and temporary as possible. Having someone do your laundry and make you cereal at at 25 should be embarrassing for anyone, airheads included.

, While the occasional Hot Pocket might be a great guilty pleasure, it probably shouldn't make up a substantial part of your diet, unless you want to be the kind of airhead with cholesterol problems by the time you're 30. Balance your carefree lifestyle and your partying with healthy food choices, exercise, and smart lifestyle decisions.



Learn to cook for yourself and focus less on buying packaged frozen food or eating out. Focus on getting enough fiber and nutrient-rich vegetables into your diet, and cutting out snack foods and high-fat treats.
Find some kind of fun, carefree exercise routine that you enjoy. It seems likely that airheads won't be super-fans of CrossFit or other high-intensity exercises, but maybe playing ultimate frisbee, going on long nature hikes, or taking dance-aerobics would be more up your alley.
If you've dabbled with tobacco use, Try to quit as soon as possible. Lots of young people might experiment with it before getting concerned about their health, but it can be a scary thought to push 30 and realize you've been smoking for 10 years. It gets harder and harder to quit.

, Too many airheads together can be a leaderless ship–someone's gotta steer! Try to associate with a variety of people, some more of the Type-A personality variety, who'll round out your friendship group and allow you to settle back into the laid-back airhead role you prefer to take on. Find the ""yin"" to your ""yang,"" so you can complement the others' personalities nicely.


Ambitious people will likely be jealous of your ability to relax, have fun, and stay carefree as you get older, meaning that you'll be a fun outlet for them. Likewise, career-minded friends can offer the benefit of tutoring you on skills they've already develops for themselves, like opening retirement accounts, applying to graduate schools, or filing taxes.

Speak your mind.,
Stick up for what you believe.,
Accept others as individuals.",How to Be an All American Teenage Girl1," American culture values independence, so being “all-American” means you’re not afraid to say what you think. Share your opinions, respectfully, even when others disagree you. Be honest and confident when sharing your opinions. Make eye contact. This shows people that you are confident and trustworthy.
State your case clearly. Avoid words and phrases like “maybe,” “um,” “I think,” and “I’m not sure.” They make it seem like you either don’t know what you’re talking about or don’t really believe what you’re saying.;
, When you’re “all-American,” you’re not just willing to say what you think; you back it up with action. Get involved in issues that you think are important. Work hard to achieve what you think is right.


Make contact with decision-makers to let them know what you think. This could mean making phone calls, creating or signing petitions, or using social media.
Get involved in your community by volunteering with local clubs or organizations.
If you’re old enough, vote in local, state, and national elections.

, Part of being independent means accepting that other people are unique individuals, too. As an “all-American” girl, you don’t always have to like what other people think, and you’re not expected to. However, it’s important to remember that they have the right to their own opinions, just like you do. Make sure that you respect other people the same way that you want them to respect you.

Get the attitude.,
Begin with personal hygiene.,
Get the looks.,
Dress appropriately.,
Be well-read and educated.,
Choose a hobby.,
Learn to speak properly.,
Be modest.,
Learn to have excellent posture.,
Know how to act sophisticated.,
Have a good relationship with your parents.",How to Be a Sophisticated Young Woman," Have you noticed that it is not only their appearance that makes sophisticated people sophisticated? It is their overall attitude towards life, others and themselves. So try beginning by being more mature and responsible. People will notice.;
, It is absolutely imperative that you are always neat and clean. Shower daily, wash your hair, brush your teeth, wash your face, shave or wax the relevant areas etc.

, Without being shallow or anything like that, I have to remind that good looks are important. If you want to look sophisticated, always look nice. Have your hair and nails done, wear reasonable amounts of reasonable make-up and pluck your eyebrows regularly. Do not wear an excessive amount of cosmetics or you will be hiding your natural features--not a sophisticated thing to do.

, Apart from hair styles and make-up, the way you dress is of crucial importance as well. Always dress for the occasion (as in: do not wear the same to school and to the opera). For everyday style, go with nice clothes that fit you. You do not need to spend a fortune, just choose pieces that you look and feel nice in. For instance, a dark blue knee-length skirt, a white blouse and a black cardigan combined with a pair of stylish black ballet flats or pumps will look great at the library, museum or school. It is also an appropriate style for meeting someone in a restaurant or café.

, It is mostly education that makes people really sophisticated. So do your best in school, study hard, get good grades and aim for college. Also learn at least one foreign language and read the most significant works of world literature. Along with a general knowledge of art and philosophy, these are exactly the things that will help you make a better impression and will also contribute to your personal growth.

, Ever wondered why all the sophisticated people seem to know each other? Frankly, it is because they do. They run into each other on social or cultural occasions (plays, expositions, balls etc) but they also have common hobbies. If you want to befriend some sophisticated young people, try taking up one of the activities they usually do. Do not force yourself. Just give it a chance and most probably you will find something you will enjoy. Some activities include tennis, golf, horseback riding, rowing, chess, archery, ballet or dancing in general, classical singing, foreign languages, painting or poetry. There are many, many other hobbies and sports you can choose from.

, Before you decide to start studying a foreign language to be more sophisticated, ask yourself if you are already good enough in your first language. Many people do not realize this but it is important to speak properly and use correct grammar. Avoid using slang or cussing, those are signs of poor education and culture. For example, say ""Magnificent landscape"" instead of ""Good view"". Others will regard you in a high position, and you will impress people wherever you go.

, Sophisticated young ladies never boast and brag about their achievements. If you are asked about your strengths, modestly say that you think you are ""decent"" at it. Talk about yourself like the everyday well-educated woman, even if you are a celebrity.

, Sit and stand with magnificent, regally unapproachable posture. Never slouch or look exhausted.

, For example, a sophisticated woman will laugh softly at good, non-vulgar jokes, but she will not roar. She may consume wine but will not gulp down an entire bottle. She may breathe heavily after exercise but will not make a show of it. She may cry at terrible news but will not sob and wail loudly on the floor and throw a tantrum. She may get angry with a witty retort and a side-glance but will not hit and scream at her antagonist. She may wave at someone she knows in the mall, but will make it graceful and refined, and she certainly will not jump up and down.

, It is only a myth that the well-off families are all dysfunctional. In order to present yourself as a sophisticated young woman, try working on the relationship you have with your parents and other relatives. You and your mother do not need to be like Rory and Lorelei Gilmore but at least always be polite to each other and never ever fight in public.

Maintain your hygiene.,

Be helpful.,

Be sweet.,
Be playful.,
Be friendly and warm.",How to Be Adorable," Adorable people possess generous hearts and spirits and are always giving people the kindness and care they deserve. Be kind and compassionate to other people, whether we're talking about your best friend, your mother, or perfect strangers. Don't be rude or snappy, even if you're in a bad mood. Adorable people are supposed to enjoy life and to be loved by others, and you can only achieve those things with a healthy dose of kindness.


Ask people how they feel and how they're doing.
This doesn't just apply to being kind to humans. Be kind to cats and dogs, too! Better yet if you're always hanging out with your pet. People say owners end up taking on the characteristics of their pets, and pets are usually adorable!;
, Adorable people haven't lost their zest for life or their youthful hopefulness. This means that they generally maintain a positive attitude and are optimistic and fun to be around. You don't have to completely fake it if you've had a bad day, but you should aim to be as positive, cheerful, and upbeat as possible so people have a good time when they're in your orbit. You can't picture an adorable person who is always whining, moping, or expecting the worst, can you?


Adorable people haven't been beat down by the world and expect the best to happen. And the more you expect the best to happen, the more that it will.
If you want to be a positive person with a good attitude, then you can't go around gossiping about people behind their backs. You should work on saying mostly positive things about people or you'll get a bad reputation.
An adorable person can also help other people see the world in a more optimistic light during difficult situations.

, Adorable people have an innate curiosity about life and want to know everything about the world; it goes back to being a little kid on your father's lap, pointing at everything and asking, ""What's that?"" That's the attitude you have to maintain if you want to be adorable and stay excited about life. Stay awake and alert and continue appreciating all of the news things the world has to offer.


If your friend got a new job, ask all about what he does; if you see an item on the news, read up on it so you get what's going on. If a friend mentions a band you never heard of, ask what they're like -- and if you can go to one of their concerts.

, Adorable people are naturally a little bit flirtatious (after a certain age) because they are warm and friendly people. So, make a habit of being just a little bit flirty when you talk to members of the opposite sex, or even to ""friend flirt"" a little bit, just by teasing people, being playful, and keeping things light. You don't want to overdo it and look more sexy than you intended; just a bit of flirtation is just fine.


Talk a little more softly than you normally would.
Make eye contact and then break it every once in a while when it gets to be too much.
Play with your hair. This gesture can be interpreted as being flirtatious.

, This doesn't mean that you have to be a prude or to act like you have no idea what's going on. However, if you want to be adorable, then you don't want to be a crude person who wants to talk about the cruelest, grittiest aspects of life, either. You want to stay a little bit wide-eyed, curious, and affronted by anything that is overly vulgar and offensive. You should avoid cursing too much or just sounding like a frat boy or you won't be adorable for much longer. Be as innocent as you can without being a perfect angel.


It's a tricky balance. You don't want people to think that you're so innocent that they can't say anything around you. On the other hand, you don't want people to think your mind is in the gutter, either.

, Adorable people are always laughing and smiling and having a good time (remember the part about staying positive?). You should have a great sense of humor and shouldn't be afraid to laugh when you think something is funny, however silly or corny it may be. You should always be seen with a smile on your face, or heard laughing from the other side of the room. Adorable people have their hearts open for humor, and are often found laughing or telling jokes.


This goes back to maintaining that youthful innocence and fun demeanor. Little kids unabashedly laugh at anything they find funny; when they grow up, they are made to feel ashamed about their laughter and slowly begin to conform to grown-up standards of humor. If you want to be adorable, then you have to throw those expectations out the window and be true to the things that really make you laugh.

, If you want an adorable hairstyle, then you should avoid anything that looks too complicated or modern. You can have long, wavy hair, shorter curly hair, or a cute bob that falls just below your ears. If you have the right attitude, you can make your hairstyle look truly adorable. You should also consider getting bangs or a fringe, which can make almost any haircut look more adorable, as long as they flatter your face shape.


You can wear your hair down, half-way up, put it in loose pigtails, a high ponytail, or in a headband. You can even add a cute hair barrette into the mix for an extra adorable look.

, For girls who want to wear some makeup to be more adorable, the key is not to wear too much. Just some light lip gloss, subtle eye shadow, and a bit of mascara should do the trick. Your look should look natural, not like you spent hours trying to look like a runway model. And if you don't normally wear makeup, then keep rocking your simple, cute look.


Keep your lips soft by applying lip balm or lip gloss every few hours.

, Remember that no one has ever been too clean. If you want to be adorable, then you have to keep your teeth sparkly white, bathe every day, and use soap that smells subtle but nice. Put on some lotion to make your skin soft, and wash your hair at least every other day, if you can. Wash your face every day and night and keep your fingernails clean too.


You should also smell nice and fresh without smelling too perfumed or strong.

, If you want to be adorable, then you have to rock adorable clothes. That means you should avoid anything too tight, too revealing, or which just looks a bit too racy. You can wear simple-colored clothes, or clothes with polka-dots or simple patterns. Make sure they fit you well and that they look clean and fresh at all times. Some adorable clothes include baby-doll dresses, overalls with a cute tank top, strappy sandals, big sweaters with leggings, or button down shirts that are pastel colored.


You can try wearing a graphic tee with an image from your child hood on it, like My Little Ponies(this is really cheap, as you can get really cute graphic tees and sweatshirts from the juniors section at Walmart). This will do the trick of looking both ironic and adorable at once.
Have adorable accessories too. If you want to be adorable, then you can add a few accessories to your outfits. You don't have to do anything major. Just simple silver or gold earrings, chunky bracelets, or rings with pretty stones will do.

, Your face also has to look adorable. This means that you shouldn't be seen scowling, looking generally miserable, or furrowing your brow too much. Instead, you should look like you're happy to be alive and that you could break into a smile at any second. Your eyes should be alert and curious. You can even bite your lip occasionally, since this can make you look cute.


When you talk to other people, make sure that you really look into their eyes and follow along. This will show that you truly care about them, which is definitely adorable.

, If you want to be adorable, then keep a straight posture without hunching over, be sweet and friendly with your gestures, and look up instead of down at the ground. You can also fidget with your hands or the bottom of your shirt a bit, since this can betray a nervousness that can be seen as adorable. Don't cross your arms over your chest or you'll be seen as closed off instead of adorable and open to what the world has to offer.

, Adorable people can always be found helping others, whether you're helping an old lady cross the street, helping your little brother with his homework, or helping a puppy find a new home. Look out for opportunities where you can help people, whether they are people you know or strangers in need of help. When you're talking to one of your friends and it obviously seems like he has a problem, then you should offer to help even if he hasn't asked you for it.


This doesn't mean that you should get taken advantage of by always helping your friends and getting nothing back. If you help your friends, then they should help you. If you volunteer your time, then the universe will get you back.

, Being youthful is different from acting young or being completely immature. It just means that you shouldn't be world-weary, or look so tired and downtrodden that you've forgotten the fun, playful person you were as a child. Remember what it was like to have fun all the time, to be fascinated by the world, and to seize new opportunities. Laugh at corny jokes, try a dance class, or just chase your best friends around a park. You can be wise while still choosing to be young at heart.


Youthful people don't complain about having to walk or to do something they don't want to do; they're too busy being in awe of life to slow down to complain.

, Adorable people always know when to say ""please"" and ""thank you"" and keep everything upbeat and positive. They are always polite, respectful to their elders and people in the service industry, and they hold doors for people and avoid burping or belching in public. They put napkins on their laps before they eat, know how to be kind over the telephone, and clean up after themselves. If you want to be adorable, then you definitely have to hone your manners.

, Adorable people are also very sweet. Being sweet means being kind, joyful, and generally gracious to others. If you're sweet, then you want to make other people feel loved and special, and to show people that you really care about them, even if you're just getting to know each other. This shouldn't be faked or forced, and you shouldn't be sweet one minute only to be mean behind someone's back the next second. Being sweet takes practice, but you can learn to show love for people if you work on it.

, Adorable people are playful because they're curious about life and love exploring things. They like kicking a soccer ball around a beach, they like getting piggyback rides, and they like teasing their friends and having a good time. If you want to be playful, then you have to be open to new things, not be afraid to look at the world like a kid, and to find new uses for old things. If you want to be adorable, then being playful will help you keep up your sweet, fun image.

, Adorable people treat everyone with warmth and friendliness. They wave to people they know (or sometimes, people they don't know), they remember people's names, and they compliment people when they deserve it. They ask people questions about their lives, show them that they care about what they think, and they even invite people to go out to the movies or throw parties for their close friends. Warmth is a vibe you give off; you want people to feel your kindness, positive energy, and genuine spirit radiating all around you. Even if you're a bit shy, you could always work on being a bit more friendly.


Friendly people are also always making new friends and introducing them to their old friends. They aren't afraid to be nice to people who are pretty different from them.
Warm people are welcoming; when people meet them, they just want to be around them as much as they can.

Go the extra mile.,
Accept opportunities.,
Take responsibility for your work.,
Manage your time.",How to Be an All American Teenage Girl2," Americans are famous for their work ethic, and most Americans believe that success is the direct result of how hard you work. So being an “all-American” girl means you don’t just do the bare minimum to skate by. You know that the more you work, the more you can achieve.


Look for areas where you can improve your performance. Does your spelling need work? Could you use more practice with fractions? Ask yourself what you can do to get better, then do it.
Strive for perfection in your work. If you know an assignment could be better, keep working, even if you’ve met the basic requirements. Don’t turn in C work when you know you are capable of A work.

, When you’re an “all-American” girl, you believe that your work leads to success. That means it’s important to look for new chances to show off your skills and knowledge. Don’t wait for your boss to ask you to take that extra shift—offer to do it. Don’t wait for your Spanish teacher to offer extra credit—ask for it. If you want to be in the school play, audition. If you want to be on the basketball team, try out.

, Being “all-American” means that you don’t depend on other people to help you out or make sure you’re doing a good job. You are your own first, and harshest, critic. You hold yourself to a high standard. This doesn’t mean that you don’t ask for extra help if you know you need it. But it does mean that you don’t depend on other people to catch your mistakes for you.

, Being “all-American” means that you believe the way you spend your time is a reflection of your ambition and your drive to succeed. Strive to make the best of your own time and respect others’ time.


Be punctual. Running late all the time shows others that you don’t take their time, or your work, seriously.
Don’t procrastinate. Make sure that you do your work as soon as you are able. Putting things off means that you’re more likely to have to rush later, which means you’re more likely to make mistakes.
Meet deadlines. This shows others that you respect their time and are good at managing your own. If your paper is due on Friday, make sure it’s ready and the best it can be by Friday. Plus, if you turn things in on time, you don’t have to extend your stress time!

Keep it casual.,
Be bold.,
Keep it simple.,
Wear exciting accessories.,
Don’t forget your jeans!,
Wear sexy, sophisticated make-up.,
Keep your hair simple.,
Make sure you feel good.",How to Be an All American Teenage Girl3," The “all-American” girl is all about being comfortable. Clothes tend to have a looser fit than is typical in other parts of the world and fabric tends to be thinner (think t-shirts and cotton weaves). If you don’t feel comfortable in it, don’t wear it! , The “all-American” look doesn’t shy away from bright colors and bold patterns. When you’re “all-American,” you’re confident and not afraid to stand out. Feel free to choose patterns and colors that grab your attention. , The “all-American” style is not as focused on layering of clothing as the European and Asian styles tend to be. Pick one top (maybe two) and one bottom that work well together. The most exciting parts of the “all-American” style tend to come from accessories. Simple and comfortable clothing is the hallmark of American style. , The “all-American” look uses bold accessories. Think long, sparkly earrings and chunky bracelets. And don’t feel like you have to just choose one bracelet, necklace, or ring—the “all-American” style allows for lots of layering of accessories. , You don’t have to wear them every day, but the “all-American” style is jean-crazy. Denim shorts in summer and long jeans when it’s cool out are staples of the “all-American” look. Choose styles and cuts that you look and feel good in and wear them often. And don’t be afraid to experiment with colored or patterned jeans if you want! , Americans wear more make-up than just about anybody else in the world. Don’t wear more make-up than you’re comfortable with, but do have some fun experimenting with different make-up techniques to see what accentuates your best features. The “all-American” make-up style tends to include several parts: Eyeliner. Use a thick layer on your top lid. Don’t be afraid to try eyeliner in bright colors!
Lots of mascara. Eyelashes are key to the “all-American” make-up style. The idea is to make them look as long and thick as possible, in order to draw attention to your eyes.
Smoky eyes. Make sure you perfect your smoky eye look!
Find a bright, bold lipstick shade that makes your lips pop!

, The “all-American” girl tends to keep her hair down or in a ponytail. Longer hair is more common. A messy “bed-head” hairstyle is popular. And many girls straighten their hair to a sleek shine.

, The most important requirement for an “all-American” girl is that you are true to yourself and your style. Don’t worry about trends, social norms, or expectations. Dress in whatever way makes you feel like your best self. "

Talk to strangers.,
Smile.,
Embrace diversity.",How to Be an All American Teenage Girl4," Americans are renowned for being super friendly, so the “all-American” girl is interested in other people. As the saying goes, “a stranger is just a friend you haven’t met yet.” Standing in line at the store, sitting in a waiting room, and waiting for class to start on the first day are all great opportunities to make low-stakes small talk. Just asking someone how they’re doing is a great way to meet a new person and make them feel good.

, One easy way to project “all-American” friendliness is to smile at people. This is easy even if you’re shy. Smile at everyone you meet—people you walk past on the street, your waiter or waitress, the person taking tickets at the movies. This makes you feel good, it makes others feel good, and it makes your interactions with people more pleasant.

, America is a diverse country, and modern Americans are proud of that diversity. When you’re an “all-American” girl, you accept the differences between you and the people you meet, even if you don’t understand them. Be friendly to everyone, no matter what they look like or where they come from. Try to get to know them better. It can be fun!

Redneck life is about being prepared and capable for what comes at you, not looking any particular way. There are some associated styles, brands, and “looks” with being a redneck, but mostly that just comes from those looks being functional.


Try to wear “work clothes” as much as possible. That might mean jeans, but it might not. You just want to wear clothes that aren’t fancy, and can take a beating.
For some people, North Face gear is pretty practical, if you work in a very cold mountain climate in the outdoors. For others, it’s luxury wear. Just make sure what you’re wearing serves a purpose for your lifestyle. Carhart and Cabelas brand clothing are some other options.;
, Rednecks need practical footwear, appropriate for working on cars, trampling through the woods, and getting dirty. Rednecks don’t wear pumps, flip-flops, or sneakers. They wear work boots, and are ready to get ‘em muddy.


Thick-soled low-top shoes are also perfectly appropriate, you just want to make sure you’re in some shoes that you’d be comfortable in if you ended up in some wilderness. Hiking boots, riding boots, or motorcycle boots will all work in a pinch.
Cowboy boots are often worn for special occasions, or if you actually work on a ranch, but they’re not usually every day wear. Cowboy boots can be everyday wear if you live down south but mainly they are steel toe Justin's or Ariats.

, For men and women, redneck style can be pretty similar. You want to look like you’re ready to get to work, or like you’ve just stepped off the ranch. Flannel shirts, printed t-shirts, and denim jeans are the most common attire of the redneck, at any time of year. Camouflage pants are also a good choice or in colder climates along with a camouflage jacket.


Given the option, opt for Wranglers. Boot cut.
Layering a good deer hunting tee under your thin flannel shirt? Always looks good.

, Rednecks fit clothes shopping in somewhere between town trips to the auto parts store, the feed store, Walmart, and a quick pit stop at an uncle’s house. The less time spent shopping for clothes, the better. Tighten up your clothes-shopping by getting clothes at sporting goods stores and rural outfitters, who sell outdoors gear. Two birds, one stone.


The mall? Not so much. Rednecks love a deal, the type of which can be found at any box store with things on the cheap. Get clothes on sale at K-Mart, Walmart, and other places with good deals.
To save money, wear hand-me-downs and second-hand clothes. New shirts are just going to get dirty and ragged, so you might as well use some old ones. Also, you can make your own clothes if you want to redneck-it-up a couple notches.

, The term “redneck” comes from the fact that blue-collar workers and laborers often get sunburned on the backs of their necks. Working outside is a common thing among rural people, and hats with big brims helps to keep you protected from the sun. Wear one, if you want to look like a redneck, without the burn.


Mesh trucker caps and baseball caps are always common. Camouflage print is always a plus. Usually, redneck caps aren’t sports themed, like New Era caps, they’re more like trucker hats.
Cowboy hats can look redneck, or they can just make you look like Kenny Chesney. Try to wear cowboy hats only if you actually do farm work and have actually ridden a horse before, or it might just seem silly.

, For the redneck, hair is mostly something that gets in the way. Whatever style and length your hair, try to keep it as manageable and kempt as possible. Don’t use too much product, or go for an overly elaborate style. Just get it trimmed regularly to keep worried about other things.


For women, long hair kept in a tight ponytail is probably the most common look. Curl it up for special occasions.
For men, keep that hair high and tight. Facial hair is often trimmed into a goatee, or with long sideburns, but often very short. Unless you want to go for a Duck Dynasty kind of look.

, Again, redneck style has less to do with style and more to do with being practical, but there are a couple famous brands closely associated with being a redneck. If you opt for any of the following, you’ll be safe:


Carhartt
John Deere
Remington
Wrangler
Hillbilly

, In the United States, the term “redneck” is most commonly associated with people who live in rural areas, typically in the southeast portion of the US. Although rednecks can live everywhere, including in cities and small towns, it’s most often thought of as being a primarily rural culture.


Lots of people self-identify as a part of “redneck” culture, who don’t live in the southeast and don’t work with their hands, or have an accent. Anybody can enjoy deer hunting and NASCAR.

, Rednecks typically aren’t the foremen, they’re the workers. The blue-collar, working class, salt-of-the-earth types. If you want to be a redneck, pick up a trade and use it. All of the following are commonly thought of as being “redneck” types of jobs:


Farming
Auto mechanic
Raising livestock
Carpentry
Construction
Masonry

, Along with rural living comes rural entertainment. Rednecks typically work outside all day and stay outside when its time to have fun. All of the following are very common redneck hobbies:


Hunting
Fishing
Hiking
Gardening
Four-wheeling
Trail-building

, One of the most visible signifiers of the redneck life is the kind of truck you drive. Trucks are capable, practical, and perfect for hauling hunting gear and being prepared. They’re perfect for the rural, redneck life. The bigger and more jacked, the better.


American manufacturers are by far the most popular among rednecks. Chevrolet, GMC, Dodge, and especially Ford trucks are all common among rednecks.
It’s not essential that it be American. Pick a car you’re familiar with and comfortable working on, and find the truck line for that manufacturer. You’re not less of a redneck for driving a Toyota. That can be a reliable vehicle.

, Just as hip-hop and rap are closely associated with the inner cities, country music is associated with rural culture. Check out any CMT video or country album cover and you’re likely to see a lot of cowboy hats, pick-up trucks, and gravel roads. You’re in redneck territory.


Pop country like Miranda Lambert, Kacey Musgraves, and Eric Church appeals explicitly to contemporary rural tastes. But try to listen to classic country, like Hank Williams, George Jones, Ernest Tubb, and Loretta Lynn to get some history of redneck music. Listen to those tear-in-your-beer ballads.
Lots of rednecks listen to T-Pain and Lil Wayne, or Led Zeppelin and Guns ‘n Roses just as much as they appreciate Luke Bryan or Tim McGraw. Listen to the music you like.

, Fine dining, ballroom dancing, and opera? Nah. For the redneck, hobbies are a little more down-to-earth. If you want to be a redneck, learning a bit more about redneck hobbies is a good idea. Here are a few:


NASCAR
SEC football
Flea market shopping
4-H and FFA
Rodeo
Professional wrestling
Demolition derby
County fairs

, Being a redneck isn’t about looking a certain way or having a particular accent. It’s about working and supporting yourself. It’s about being a capable contributing force in the world, and not a lazy bum. Rednecks are rednecks because they work hard and play hard for what they earn.


Often, rural kids will start working early, as young as 12 or 13. If there’s something to be done, learn how to do it and make yourself useful to start contributing to your family.
Look for little ways to contribute, if you’re too young to get a job. Volunteer for chores around the house. Learn to clean up the kitchen and do the laundry. Help out.

, If your car breaks down on the side of the highway, you want a redneck around, who’ll be able to diagnose that problem and come up with a bootleg solution to fix it and get back on the road. Rednecks know the practical skills necessary to quickly and cheaply solve their own problems, instead of calling for help. Here’s a good list of redneck skills to learn:


Field-dressing
Basic car maintenance
Canning and food preservation
Shooting a gun
Building a shed

, Rednecks sometimes get a bad reputation as closed-minded, or small-minded individuals, who aren’t open to different cultures and different types of people. It’s good to be proud of where you come from, but it’s also good to learn as much as you can about other places, and be tolerant of the cultures from those places.In general, American culture is deeply divided. A city-dwelling Californian is often just as ignorant, if not more so, about what life is like in a rural area, than a “redneck” is of life in the big city. Remember that.
The American south is still deeply divided along racial lines in some places, and being a “redneck” can be a charged signal for some people. Keep in mind that the Dixie flag and other “redneck” stereotypes can be offensive to some people.

, Drinking alcohol, specifically beer and whiskey, is often associated with redneck culture. There’s nothing wrong with enjoying a brew every now and then, especially a good Bud Lite or Keystone, but learn your limits and drink responsibly.


Drugs are no longer a “city” problem. Cheap and available crystal methamphetamine, prescription pills, and other opiates including heroin, have flooded rural areas in recent years.
Smokeless tobacco, including chew and snuff, is just as dangerous as cigarettes and other forms of tobacco. There’s nothing redneck about mouth cancer., Typically, rural Americans are more religious than Americans from other parts of the country.For many people who identify as ""redneck,"" religion is an essential part of not only being a redneck, but being a good person. Find some faith, attend church, and make religion a part of your life.

Know the proven benefits of being generous.,
Take stock of things you're grateful for.,
Begin with small acts of generosity.It might be difficult for you to jump right into volunteering at a soup kitchen or a homeless shelter, but even a $1 donation to a charity can help someone in need.,
Support causes you believe in.,
Invest in a person you believe in.If you are more motivated by people than causes, it might be easier for you to offer help and support to an individual than an organization.,
Volunteer with those less fortunate.,
Note the times you are unkind to others.Frank Herbert, renowned writer of the Dune saga and ecological authority, once said that the first step in disarming a trap is knowing it's there.Think about the times you've been unkind and identify common factors of those times so you can disarm the trap of your unkindness.,
Accept and talk through your negative feelings.All humans have negative thoughts and feelings.,
Take care of your body.,
Shape your world view.,
Listen.,
Understand the importance of discipline.,
Limit temptation and distractions.,
Take breaks to restore your willpower.,
Exercise your discipline, actively.,
Commit to your goals and plan for success.,
Accentuate the positive.",How to Be an Amazing Person," Doing good and being generous to others has a measurable positive impact on your health.If you're the sort that has difficulty getting motivated to give back, you can use this fact to encourage greater generosity in yourself. Medical studies have shown that generosity promotes:


Heart health
Diminished pain response
Improved immune response
Longer life;
, Grab a piece of paper and a pen, or make a list in your head of the things you already have. Getting caught up in what you don't have can lead you to feeling unfulfilled, but actively being appreciative can restore your perspective to how good you have it. This, in turn, can lead you to being more generous to those who are less fortunate.Gratitude can also help you be more awesome by:


Improving your quality of sleep
Improving your overall health
Lessening aggressive behavior
Strengthening your mind, Think of small ways you can be generous to the people in your life, like:


Buying a friend a cup of coffee, or paying for the next person in line.
Buying a sandwich for a local homeless person, or bringing one from home.
Paying for breakfast for a friend or fellow diner.
Donating old clothing to a charity.

, Causes, like racial equality or environmental consciousness, will often resonate deeply with core beliefs that you hold. This might involve helping at a rally, organizing a recycling program for your building, or raising money for an animal shelter. All of these, however, will help you feel more connected to your community, which will foster even more generosity in you., Think about small ways you might help a particular person in your life. You might choose someone in your life who has been struggling recently, or you may:


Volunteer with a big brother/big sister program
Mentor at a community center

, When you see the true face of poverty, its difficult to resist the urge to offer something.Use this human impulse to help others to motivate yourself to volunteer at soup kitchens, homeless shelters, and meals-on-wheels programs.

, You can do this by interrupting yourself before saying something mean, or you can coach yourself through the negative emotions so that you become a more awesome person to the people in your life.You might respond unkindly to:


Criticism
Embarrassing situations
Interruptions
Teasing

, Giving yourself a hard time for your failures or negative feelings can fuel negativity in your life, but you can help yourself feel better by accepting these feelings as part of your humanity and talking yourself positively through the feeling.As an example, you might respond to envy you have of a friend by:


Recognizing that you are jealous of your friend.
Telling yourself, ""I'm not going to be a jealous person. I care about my friend.""
Replacing the thought with something more positive, like, ""I'm proud of my friend! She's doing great!"", When you don't feel your physical best, you can become irritable or respond to people in your life in a way you might not normally had you been feeling better. Exercise has the added benefit of releasing endorphins into your body, which naturally make you feel more positive.You might also want to:


Stick to a regular sleep scheduleEat a nutritious diet, You always have a choice in how you respond to the events occurring to the world around you, and sometimes it can help to remind yourself that you choose to be good.Remind yourself, especially on difficult days:


""I am a good person, and I will do good in the world.""
""I can do this. It's a little difficult now, but I'm doing a great job.""
""I do not want to be an angry/jealous/mean/selfish person. I am doing my best to be as awesome as I can be!""

, “Those who still think that listening isn’t an art should see if they can do it half as well.”Micheal Ende said these word in his book, Momo, decades ago, but the fact remains that in a hectic, non-stop world, it can be difficult to make time to actively listen to others. Listening to another can help you build empathy, which is a key trait in being kind to others., Discipline is often the deciding factor in whether or not you are able to accomplish something difficult, like running a marathon, writing a book, or winning a championship. Recent research indicates that discipline and willpower act like a physical muscle.This means that you need to train to strengthen your willpower and discipline.

, Phone calls, text messages, TV shows and email notifications, though, can steal your attention away from the task at hand, and derail your discipline.Don't allow unnecessary distractions to sap the strength of your willpower and crumble your discipline. Instead:


When you are actively working toward a specific goal that requires your focus and attention, you might want to turn your phone to airplane mode.
Remove temptations, like junk food or TV, from the area you are working.

, Just like you might need a break during exercise or physical labor, you may also need a break while performing a task that requires discipline and willpower. This will restore your iron-will reserves. Some activities you might do to restore willpower include:


Taking a walk in a park
Taking a power nap

Reading a book

, Just as you might physically exercise to maintain your body, you should also exercise your discipline through challenges.Trying to attain daily goals and working toward larger projects will exercise your discipline and willpower, but some other activities you might attempt include:


Physical exercise for a set amount of time, several times a week.
Meditating for a set period of time, daily.
Resisting an indulgence, like ice cream, for a set period of time.

, If you are not fully committed to your goals, when things become difficult or your reserves run low, you may find yourself about to give up. Notice these thoughts immediately and remind yourself of your commitment to see the thing through, whatever it might be.You may need to take a break and revisit the project later. To prevent avoidance, you should plan the time you will spend away from the project, and the time you will return to it.

, There may be a long distance you have to go before you reach your goal. Though you may want to despair that you have only lost one pound out of the twenty you had committed to lose, even small victories should be appreciated.Celebrating small victories can:


Boost your morale
Improve your self image
Improve your performance"
"
Seek feedback from your boss.,
Ask your peers how you are doing.,
Ask your subordinates how you can improve.,
Implement the feedback you receive.,
Be honest about the results of your work.,
Make time for solo work.,
Prioritize your tasks.,
Set specific time limits.,
Keep a time log of how you spend each day for a week.",How to Be Accountable1," A great way to begin building accountability at work is seeking feedback from the people you work with. Depending on what your job entails, specifically regarding your position in a hierarchy, you can seek feedback from those above you, those on your level, and those under you.Your job may already have specific performance standards in place which are reviewed periodically by supervisors, but you can show your boss that accountability is important to you by actively seeking extra feedback about your performance. You might seek feedback regarding a specific project or assignment you recently finished, or you might want get a general idea for how you are doing.;
, It’s also good to seek feedback from the people you work with day to day, even when they have no power or authority over you. You need to know whether the people you work with can count on you or not.


Be sure to ask questions that are specific to get the feedback you desire. For example, you might say something like, ""I worked really hard on that presentation, but I'd love some feedback on where I could improve. Do you have any input?""

, As a manager, or any upper level position, you don’t want to make all the decisions on your own and never ask how people feel you are leading. Approach subordinates in the right way so you don’t seem like you lack authority. Just be genuine and tell those below you that you want to know how they think you are doing at your job.


Try creating an anonymous survey that you can distribute to your employees. This may provide you with more honest feedback because they will be less likely to worry about the comments they make backfiring on them.

, Asking your boss, peers, and subordinates for feedback on your performance is useless if you don’t take the feedback into consideration and find ways to implement it. Maybe you can’t do exactly what the critique entails, but you can use it as a springboard for making changes.

, You may spend a lot of time working with a team, and the results are the culmination of everyone’s effort. In some settings, it may be possible to hide or be a little dishonest about the work you accomplished. Being accountable means fully owning up to whatever comes of your work.This is hardest when you have made a mistake or have not quite made the best of an opportunity you have been given. It may feel natural to shift the blame or make excuses that focus on outside forces, but being upfront and honest about your work is an important aspect of accountability. Owning up to shortcomings will show the people you work with and for that you are not trying to hide anything.
When you do mess up, and you have to be honest with someone about the mistake, it is always good to have an idea or plan for how to remedy the situation. Being honest and owning the mistake is the first step, but there is most likely still something that needs to happen. Having a solution to the problem ready when you admit the mistake will help ease the tension and show that you are not giving up.

, If you work in an office and you usually have your door open, try shutting it for a couple days. An open door invites people to stop and talk, even if it isn’t about work. Closing the door more often will give you the privacy to focus more on work and less on interacting with people., In a given day of work, you might have five or more things that need to get done. However, not all of the tasks have the same level of priority. Get in the practice of working on the most important things first and putting off the things that can wait., For less important tasks, force yourself to limit how long you spend on them. Don’t spend a whole hour clearing out spam email if someone is waiting for an email response from you. Knock out an important task that you know will take a while, and then balance it with a short, lower priority task. Alternating in this way can boost your efficiency.

, At the end of the day, or periodically throughout the day, write down what you do and how long you spend doing it. You may be surprised where your time actually goes. It’s probably best not to show your boss this log, but it will help you see what is draining your time and you can work on reducing those time-wasters."

Ask for acceptance.,
Validate others.,
Avoid being defensive.,
Accept that not everyone will like you.",How to Be Accepted for Who You Are1," Depending on the situation, you may have an opportunity to voice what you're feeling to others about being unappreciated or feeling like you don't fit in. Sometimes this can help others to understand where you're coming from. This may work best with friends and family, rather that classmates or co-workers who don't know you.Be polite and calm when you are asking for acceptance. Show that you're trying to find some common ground between you and others.
Consider saying, ""It seems like we might have gotten off on the wrong foot. I hope you can accept what I'm saying and where I'm coming from.""
For a more direct approach, consider saying, ""I hope that you can accept me for who I am. And I will do the same for you."";
, Help others to understand what acceptance and validation look like. Be present and pay attention to others’ needs. By modeling this behavior, you may help others to understand how to act in return.Listen to difficult things that others are going through. Try walking in their shoes to understand where they’re coming from.
Learn to sit with emotions rather than feeling uncomfortable or judged. Consider using this an opportunity to connect with others.
For example, if there’s someone in your class that feel is less accepting of you or others, and you see that they’re having a difficult time, think about if there are opportunities to connect with them in a real way. Offer to share something with them. Or simply tell them, “I know it’s been a tough day. I totally understand. I’ve had a tough day too.” Even if they don’t reciprocate, you’re showing them what validation and acceptance look like.

, Rather than immediately reacting and assuming the worst, have an open heart. While some people may be outright mean, others may not realize that they are making you feel excluded or unappreciated. Before you react, take a step back and take an objective view on the situation.Realize that one bad interaction may not define your future interactions with that person or other people.
Avoid withdrawing yourself emotionally from the situation, particularly among people that you care about. Consider taking a risk and trying to make the situation work rather than feeling doubtful. It’s hard to be vulnerable, but sometimes it can help to show others what you’re feeling.

, And that's okay. You can’t control how others think or act, but you can control your own thoughts and actions. Learn to accept what you can change and what you can’t. Aspire to love and cherish yourself as a person, and share that love with others.Focus your efforts on those who care about you. Don’t worry about those who ignore you.
Keep and hold onto positive people. Avoid trying to be friends with those who are negative or treat you poorly. Rather than wishing they would be better, use that time to be happier with yourself.

Make a complete list current spending.,
Make a budget.,
Calculate your income.,
List your expenses thoroughly.,
Allocate your entire income.,
Track your expenses.,
Pay off credit card bills immediately.,
Use the credit card only when you absolutely have to.,
Pay the entire bill.",How to Be Accountable2," The first step to money accountability is just taking stock of what your expenses are. The list needs to include not just definite expenses like bills, but also extras that you consistently spend money on. If you know that eating fast food for lunch is a frequent practice, write it down. Maybe you have a pet that you spend consistent money on, write it down.

, The point of a budget is to work for you by designating where your money will go. Some people see this as restrictive, but at its best it takes the pressure off you because you have a plan for what money goes where. Rather than being optimistic that you will stop spending on certain things, include them in the budget so you will be prepared for them., To complete a budget to the fullest extent, start out by figuring out your income, which you could do based on weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, and maybe even yearly income. It sort of depends on how often you get paid. Making a precise accounting of your income is essential to making a budget that will work.

, In regards to expenses, don’t go totally overboard, but try to list anything you can think of that you consistently have to spend money on. This would most likely include, but not be limited to: rent/mortgage, car payment, groceries, utilities (water, electric, gas, internet, cable), gas for the car, car/health/home insurance, student loans. Depending on your situation, you may not have some of these, but you could also have many other ones.

, If you have all of your expenses covered in the budget--all of the things you absolutely have to pay for--and you still have money left over, consider whether you want to spend this money, give it to charity, put it into a specific savings account you won’t touch, or perhaps find a way to invest it. Whatever you do with the leftover, find a way to designate the entire income.

, This practice acts as a double check to the budget you have in place. The budget tells you, “this is what you are allowed to spend,” while tracking it completes the cycle and says, “this is what you spent.” In general, making a budget is a one time--or rare occasion--event, but keeping track of what you spend is a day to day habit you have to work at.Figure out what the best method will be for you to keep track. You can go with the simple method of having a notebook that is designated as a spending log. Keep it with you all the time and write down each time you spend money. Or, if you can remember, wait until the end of the day to write the accumulated expenditures of the day. Keeping your receipts for each purchase could be a good idea.
If the notebook method doesn’t work, maybe you are more tech oriented and you can keep a spreadsheet on your computer, or a detailed note on your phone or tablet. This could be a good option for the added benefit of calculation features that spreadsheet software offers.
Consider signing up for a money management service like Mint, Good Budget, or Money Manager.

, Credit cards can be a great convenience, especially if you have an income is that is inconsistent, but they can also lead to serious financial problems. Despite what you might think, as evidenced by many people’s habits, credit cards are meant to be a temporary payment option that you then repay. Racking up expenses on credit cards and paying the minimum each month is only going to increase your debt.If you are already in credit card debt, it is probably best to seek further financial counseling, but if you don’t yet have credit cards, or just recently got one, you can start responsible practices right now.
Think of a credit card in terms of accountability: the credit card company bought something on your behalf with the express agreement that you would pay them back promptly. Paying them back a little at a time, or defaulting on payments completely, is not showing good accountability on your part.

, Don’t buy a $2000 TV on credit if you know your income can’t handle paying that off quickly. Credit cards are not good when they allow you to live beyond your means momentarily, because then you end up in financial trouble with a hard road out of it.

, Before you make a purchase, have a plan for where the money is going to come from to pay the debt. When the bill comes, pay the whole month’s worth of expenses off rather than allowing some of what’s due to roll over. Anything you don’t pay off immediately is going to amount to you paying more than you spent.

Establish a personal mission statement.,
Set SMART goals.,
Make your goals specific.,
Set goals that are measurable.,
Consider whether your goals are attainable.,
Check to see if your goals are realistic.,
Make your goals time-bound.,
Create to do lists.,
Cross off every task on your to do list.,
Create micro-goals.",How to Be Accountable3," A great way to begin working on your personal accountability is to think about what your mission in life is. You could make one overall mission statement, or a few separate ones, each focusing on one area of your life. The point of a mission statement is to clearly define what you see as your purpose and also define what ways you plan to follow and achieve that purpose.Maybe you have not spent much time considering what your life’s purpose is, but this is an important piece of goal setting and goal fulfillment. Without a specific overall goal for your life, smaller goals may end up being inconsequential.
Once you have considered your purpose and written out a succinct but thorough mission statement, you can begin to make decisions based on it. Keep it somewhere you will remember and refer to it once a week or more to keep fresh in your mind what you have committed to.

, SMART goals have long been a practice in the business and personal growth sectors, and using this technique can make a significant impact in keeping yourself accountable to the goals you set. SMART is an acronym whose letters stand for: Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, and Time-bound. It’s worth noting that the “R” is sometimes called “Relevant” or “Results-oriented.” Write these goals and refer back to them frequently to keep yourself accountable to reaching them., This means making them detailed and avoiding vague ideas. For example, you might set the goal to become a published author, but this is a pretty general goal. A more specific goal would be to get an article of satire published in the New Yorker magazine. Specific goals keep you accountable by not settling for less than what the goal intended.

, This means having criteria that will determine if the goal was met. It should add concreteness to the goal. Sticking with the author example, you could add to the goal what number of articles you want to publish. Is it just one, or is your goal higher? Getting the first one done would be a measurable milestone which shows you are working toward your goal.

, This means taking stock of what will be necessary to meet the goal. This is the time to consider financial, time, and energy costs that the goal will require. To publish an article, you might need to spend many hours across many weeks researching, writing and editing. You might need to spend money to mail the manuscript. You might need to stay up late nights and lose some sleep. So the “attainable” aspect of the goal counts the cost to meet the goal.

, This means taking an honest look at yourself and your situation. You will need both motivation and ability to achieve any goal you set. Take stock of how hard you are willing to work and what level of ability you have as it pertains to a certain goal. If you consistently slacked off in English class and your friends are constantly correcting your grammar, writing for the New Yorker may not be realistic for you. However, almost any goal can be made realistic if the motivation to achieve it is high enough.

, This means having a definite time range in mind in which to meet the goal. Goals that could drag on inevitably into the future are likely to be consistently put off in service of other priorities. Deciding on the time aspect of the goal should be relatively easy and will often be determined by forces outside your control. Setting the goal of getting published within a year helps you prioritize that goal around other things.

, In the service of following your mission statement and setting SMART goals, you will need to have smaller sets of tasks necessary to achieve those larger goals. You can write up to do lists on a daily basis that will help direct the time you spend each day, and you can write up to do lists that are more ongoing and could span a week, month or the whole year.


Make long-term to do lists and prioritize which things need to be done first, second, and so on. For to do lists that you know will last a while, try to think about doing one or two of the tasks each day until they are all accomplished.

, Leaving things unfinished can begin to create a feeling of stress because you have things looming over you that are not done. Finishing one task at a time will help you see that you are accountable to the lists that you make for yourself.

, For every big life goal you set, there are 5, 10 or 20 small steps that have to be taken to achieve that goal. Therefore, micro-goals are the individual steps that are necessary. They are not only goals that will happen a little while down the road, they are goals that you will diligently begin to achieve ASAP.For example, if you want to lose 50 pounds in one year’s time, the steps will include exercising more, eating less, and establishing an overall routine. A micro-goal could be, “Today I will not eat junk food and I will walk one mile.” Micro-goals are baby steps that become the foundation for larger, ultimate goals.

Prepare yourself for some fear.,
Explore new hobbies.,
Get creative.,
Disconnect from technology.,
Think back to childhood.,
Spend time outdoors.",How to Be a Recluse1," Spending time alone is scary for many people. In our modern era, we're more interconnected than ever. If you want to take some time to be reclusive, there will be an adjustment period. You may feel scared or confused when you first begin spending time alone.


Try to push past any negative thoughts as you begin transitioning into spending more time alone. Remind yourself that you may feel some discomfort at first. However, also remember the benefits of alone time. You may be able to effectively work through certain problems or focus on certain creative pursuits if you give yourself time alone. These benefits are probably worth the initial adjustment period.If you feel very afraid at the notion of spending time alone, consider the root of this fear. Are you afraid of loneliness or is there something deeper at play. Bad past experiences can sometimes make a person hesitant to spend time alone. You may not want to let your thoughts wander to negative aspects of your past.;
, Use your alone time wisely. It's easy to fall into a rut if you're choosing to keep your free time all to yourself. Instead of binge watching TV shows or sleeping all day, try to take up some new hobbies. Choose hobbies you can do by yourself.A lot of your initial aversion to alone time may stem from boredom. If you don't have a lot to fill your time, you may feel very bored or frustrated when you're alone. Taking up a hobby can help combat boredom. You'll have something to do with your newfound free time.Remember, a hobby does not necessarily have to constitute a passion. Many people are wary to try solitary hobbies like drawing, painting, music, or writing. However, you're not trying to be a concert pianist. You're just trying to play the piano in your free time for your own amusement., Many people choose the life of a recluse to fuel their own creativity. Without the distractions of socialization, you can focus more on your own creative work. If you're a writer, painter, sculptor, or any other creative type, use your reclusive nature to better your work.


Alone time forces you to think deeply. The most interesting art, writing, and music asks difficult questions about the nature of human existence. If you're constantly filling your time with distractions, this can inhibit your creativity as it stops you from considering deeper aspects of existence. If you're alone, you'll have more time to ponder.You can also take your alone time as an opportunity to learn things that will enhance your work. If you're writing a memoir, for example, learning from other authors is important. If you've never had time to read all of Proust's work, your newfound life as a recluse can allow you to do so.

, If you want to be reclusive, you need to disconnect significantly. This means avoiding your phone and computer, as these devices allow you to connect with others. It's a bad idea to completely cut yourself off. If there's an emergency, for example, it's important to be able to get help. However, try to consciously disconnect from technology for a bit each day. Set aside a few hours each day to turn off your smart phone and power down your laptop. Take this time to simply be alone with your thoughts., Part of what makes being alone hard is that troublesome, unwanted thoughts can creep in if we're alone for too long. You need to have some ability to self-soothe. Thinking back to your childhood can help. As children are frequently navigating new and difficult thoughts for the first time, they often have better self-soothing rituals than adults.Try to remember how you relaxed as a child. Even silly rituals, like daydreaming, can be helpful to relax if you spend a lot of time alone.
If you had a happy childhood, you're more likely to be good at self-soothing. If your basic needs were met as a child, you viewed the world as a mostly safe, trustworthy place. However, if your needs were not met as a child, you feel insecure in the world. You may have a need to bring others into your space in order to soothe yourself.If your childhood was unstable, consider seeing a psychiatrist to talk through these rituals. It may be harder to be reclusive if you lack the ability to soothe yourself.

, Many reclusive people have a fondness for nature. The free space of nature enhances your ability to be alone with your thoughts. It can remove certain temptations, like modern technology, that prohibit your ability to embrace solitude.Many people enjoy activities like hiking and camping alone. As long as you're experienced enough to understand safety precautions, look into taking an occasional weekend hiking or camping trip by yourself.
However, if you're not an experienced outdoors type, camping alone may be dangerous. Instead, try going for long walks in the woods by yourself. If you live in a rural area, just sitting in your backyard can help you feel alone in nature.

Have confidence in yourself that you are just as deserving as the next person. Avoid dwelling in the past or comparing yourself to others. Consider these ways to remember your value and worth:


Look at yourself in the mirror. Instead of focusing on the negatives about yourself, name three things that make you feel good about you.
Complete a brief self-affirmation exercise. Write down in a paragraph about the positives you see in yourself and your abilities to achieve a target goal. If you are seeking acceptance from others and yourself, you can focus on this. Use an active voice. Keep it in the present tense, and be positive.Incorporate self-gratitude sessions each morning. The moment you wake up, think about all of the things you are grateful for about yourself or your life. If you have time, spend a few minutes to list and write about one or two things that you are grateful for. Review this list daily, and do your best to add to it frequently.
If you don't have enough time to journal, get some sticky notes and jot down one or two words that represent something you are grateful for. Place these sticky notes around your home as reminders of the good things in your life.

, We seem to live in a society where the norm is to compare ourselves to other people, whether that means sizing them up based on what they look like, what they do for work, or their possessions. We then tend to rate ourselves as being good or not good enough, as compared to others. Self-rating and comparing yourself to another person does not lead to a healthy, happy lifestyle.

Put more focus on your own life, and what your own needs are. Learn to live your own life and accept yourself for who you are as an individual, not for how well you fit other's expectations. Accept who you are by living an authentic life, and you’ll notice how much happier you’ll become.

, While you may want to feel like you belong, it’s also important to be honest about what feels right to you. Being a people-pleaser can be exhausting. Find out what matters to you. Define yourself based on that.Don’t feel like you have to change who you are if it feels untrue to yourself.
For example, if your friends want to go shopping and you'd rather be doing an art project, think about what matters to you at that time. Maybe you want to be able to spend time with your friends, but you also want some alone time to do creative projects. Be clear with your friends about the value of both time with friends and time to do your art. Good friends will understand that not everything revolves around them.

, Model the behaviors that you wish to see in other people. Give yourself to others and they will likely give back in return. If others do not reciprocate, avoid feeling upset and sad. Remember those people in your life who do give back and show kindness. We all wish to be treated with respect and honesty. Actively listen when others are talking.
Put away the devices and focus on the present when you're with other people.
Be courteous and say, ""thank you.""
Say good morning and good afternoon to people. Greet others with kindness.
Be empathetic when others are having a difficult time. Give them support through words or hugs.

, To be accepted by others, first you need to accept yourself. Learn to recognize your good qualities. Praise yourself for a job well done. Validate yourself. But also allow yourself to hear the good things that other people say about you. Use words of self-affirmation. Consider saying to yourself, “I accept and love myself” or “I am secure and confident in who I am.”When you’re feeling like you don’t belong, redirect your negative thoughts to positive thoughts about yourself and your life. Think of three things that you like about yourself and your life.

Find people that make you feel accepted.,
Find ways to relax and let go.,
Be healthy in mind and body.",How to Be Accepted for Who You Are3," Avoid the people that make you feel worthless. Spend more time with the ones who give you love, kindness, and support. While it takes time to make friends and find genuine people, there are many out there.Talk with a trusted friend or relative about feeling unaccepted. Sometimes being open about what’s bothering you will help you feel less alone.
Consider joining a group with like-minded people. It could be a social group at school, or an interest group in the community. Talk with others about what you’re going through.
Tell those people who accept you that you appreciate them. Show them that their love has meaning and value.

, Instead of desperately seeking validation from others, find ways to cope with your stress and anxiety about the situation. Focus on what you can control—you. Learn to take a difficult situation in stride. Here are some ways to relax:


Listen to music.
Find a creative outlet. Write. Draw. Paint. Build. Sculpt.
Step away from the situation. Take five deep breaths. Inhale slowly and hold your breath. Exhale slowly.
Take a walk. Go for a hike. Ride your bike. Swim. Go for a run. Get active.

, Being happy and confident is also about taking care of your mind and body. If you don’t treat them right, no one else will. Exercising your brain and eating healthy can help you feel more confident about who you are and how you’re viewed by others.


Eat healthy foods that help your mood. Eat more fish. Get your daily greens. Reduce the caffeine and fatty foods.Consider meditation or yoga. Find ways to clear your mind of negativity.
Get good rest. Sometimes being sleep-deprived can affect how you see the world around you. You may feel more judged or stressed."
"
Keep promises you make.,
Negotiate towards an agreement.,
Get it in writing.",How to Be Accountable4," Everyone has experienced a broken promise, at some point in their life, and knows how serious the repercussions can be. Seeing promises as a sacred responsibility can add the weight to them that’s necessary to help you keep them. If you see a promise as something truly important, then you will do whatever is in your power to keep it.It can also be really important to give proper time to considering whether or not you should make a promise in the first place. Think about what it will take to fulfill a promise and honestly assess whether or not you can keep it. It is way easier to refrain from making a promise to someone than it is to explain why you didn’t keep it.
When you do break a promise, being accountable means confessing to your lapse and sincerely saying you are sorry. In many cases, this will not take away the consequences of the broken promise, but accepting those consequences is better than avoiding them.

, If someone asks something of you that you are doubtful that you can deliver on, you can either say yes and hope you make it work, or you can say no. Saying no can be a good option if you couple it with a counter-offer. Rather than accepting terms that you may end up failing to meet, find a way to compromise that gives you a better chance of success.Sometimes you may disappoint people by not being able to agree to exactly what they ask of you, but the small disappointment will most likely be outweighed by you fulfilling the agreement. If you agree to something and then fail to deliver, more than disappointment, the other person will probably experience anger at you.
If you try to negotiate something that you feel confident you can achieve, and the person is unwilling to compromise on their original preference, you should say no if this is at all an option. Tell the person you do not feel you can deliver what they are asking and that you would rather say no than agree to it and end up failing.

, A great way to practice being accountable is making up a detailed written agreement when you are making commitments to someone. This may be excessive in some cases, but if you do it even when it’s unnecessary it will help create the habit of following through. Writing out what you are committing to helps promote accountability because it makes it so you can remember the specifics of what you agree to. It’s hard to honor a commitment if you forget that you made it.The specific situation you are in will dictate how detailed of a written agreement you should make. Jotting a brief note to yourself may be enough, but the situation may also warrant a thoroughly detailed contract between you and someone else. You may both want to sign and date it for any potential legal consequences of the agreement.
At the very least, writing down your commitments will help you remember, and at the most it could serve as evidence for the future.

Find work you can do at home.,
Find creative ways to shop.,
Stay connected to some people.,
Manage stress.",How to Be a Recluse2," If you want to be a recluse, you may be hesitant about working outside of your home. With modern technology, there are many jobs can you can easily do from home if you have a laptop and an internet connection.


Freelance writing jobs are often done at home. There are also many jobs, like transcription work, that can be done from home. Many companies hire web designers to work from their own house. Also, a lot of call center type jobs are handled at home. You can be a customer service representative at your own house, taking calls on behalf of a business as they come in.If you have a specialized skill set, consider working for yourself. This does not necessarily mean starting your own business. You could do freelance work from home for clients. If you have a writing degree, for example, you could look into freelance editing.

, If you want to become particularly reclusive, you may be hesitant to leave your home even for things like grocery and clothes shopping. If this is the case, find creative ways to stay at home.


In the modern world, almost everything you need can be ordered online. Clothing, books, food, and other items can be ordered from websites like Amazon. You may cringe at the delivery fees, but remember you're staying home most of the time. While you may spend $10 for shipping and handling, you're not spending money on gas or public transportation.
If you don't want to order everything online, consider avoiding people in other ways. You could shop during hours of the day where stores are unlikely to be crowded. For example, try going clothes shopping at 1 o'clock in the afternoon on a weekday. As most people are working, you may be less likely to run into other people.

, If you want to be a recluse, you may feel you have to cut people out of your life entirely. However, this is not the case. In fact, a reclusive lifestyle may not be sustainable if you cut out all your friends and social contacts.


Strong relationships can help you feel more secure about spending time alone. Even if you enjoy spending time alone, it's important to be able to have someone to call if you need it. Everyone needs support on occasion. In the event of a major emergency or setback, you should be able to have at least one person to rely on for support.Try to deepen existing relationships before committing to a reclusive life. Spend more time talking to friends and family members. Be willing to share intimate secrets to your social contacts. If you have a few very close friends, you'll feel more secure in the fact your solitude is a choice rather than a necessity., If you're going to be spending a lot of time alone, stress management is important. Troubling thoughts may be harder to avoid if you have a lot of time to yourself.


As stated, have someone you can call in the event you are feeling very stressed or down. You do not have to socialize frequently if you don't want to, but having at least a few contacts for social support is important.
Practice stress-reducing activities, like meditation, deep breathing, and yoga.
Exercise regularly. Having a regular exercise regimen can help you manage negative emotions. Strive for 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity a week or 75 minutes of intense aerobic activity."
"
Consider your mental health.,
Stay away from mindless consumption.,
Ask for help if you need it.",How to Be a Recluse3," Being reclusive has many benefits. However, a tendency to avoid social situations can be a symptom of an underlying mental health disorder. Cutting yourself off from others can increase feelings of depression, anxiety, and isolation. If you feel sad, anxious, or otherwise unhappy most of the time, make an appointment with a mental health professional for assessment.


You can find a therapist by asking your regular doctor for a referral. You can also find a list of providers in your network through your insurance.
If you're a college student, you may be entitled to free counseling through your university.

, Mindless consumption is common if you're spending a lot of time alone. Without social events as a distraction, you may overeat, binge watch television, or play video games for hours. This can stave off some of the positive benefits of solitude. You won't consider the deeper questions if you're constantly immersed in a video game world, for example. Try to engage in entertainment and food in moderation.It can help to make a schedule for yourself. You can try to get up and go to bed at the same time each day. You can also strive to limit your video game time to, say, an hour a day.
If mindless eating is a problem for you, try to keep track of the calories you're consuming. Log what you're eating and when. If you find yourself gaining weight, try reducing your caloric consumption.

, When spending time alone, you may confront unpleasant realities. You may be forced to think about aspects of your life that are frightening to face. Ask for help when you need it. If the loneliness is becoming overwhelming, call a trusted friend or family member. There are many benefits to solitude. However, everyone needs help now and then. Do not hesitate to reach out to others when you are in need."
"
Offer help when needed.,
Look out for everyone, not just those closest to you.,
Practice your empathy, or ability to put yourself in others' shoes.,
Get things done without being asked.,
Make yourself available to people going through tough times.,
Offer your forgiveness freely.",How to Be a Nice Person1," Offering your assistance to someone who is in need can make someone's day, and it is mandatory if you are wishing to be a nice person. If a friend of yours is in a spot of trouble, it is polite to offer them a helping hand. A positive attitude does point only towards your friends and family. Instead, offer help to all who may need it.


When you see someone at work or struggling, simply ask, ""mind if I lend a hand?"" Even if they say no, this gesture alone is a wonderful display of kindness.;
, Holding the door for a friend is kind, but being a nice person is about being helpful and kind towards everyone. So give a little to a struggling person on the sidewalk, and offer to help out a classmate or coworker when they spill their papers in the hall. You can be the person who helps organize someone's birthday, or brings donuts in on Friday just because. Be nice just to be nice.

, Empathy is not something you're born with, it is something you need to work on. Simply put, try and leave your own head and ask, ""how does this make them feel?"" The goal here isn't to find a ""right answer."" Rather, the act of putting others before yourself will help you become a more thoughtful, caring, and kind person.

, If you see someone's dirty dishes in the sink, and you're cleaning yours, lend a hand and wipe them up. Help an elderly person put their bags in the overhead compartments on your plane. When you go grab an extra water, or napkins, or ketchup, grab a couple extra for your buddies.


This piggy-backs off of empathy -- if you're thinking of other people, it is easier to anticipate their needs and be helpful and kind., In a crisis or emotional period, your grieving friend wants to do anything but cook and eat alone -- bring them a casserole and some cookies and spend the evening with them. If a bestie just got through a tough breakup, offer to help them clean out their significant other's stuff so they don't have to go through it alone. The best friends, and the nicest people, are those who don't shy away when the going gets tough -- they stand tall.

, Don't hold grudges, and don't continue punishing or getting angry at people after they've asked for forgiveness. Remember, forgiveness is about letting the moment go instead of letting anger or jealousy continue to dominate your thoughts. It doesn't mean you have to suddenly trust them with your secrets again -- it just means you stop harboring ill will if they've asked for honest forgiveness.


Even if they don't ask for forgiveness, try and move on. Someone who hurts you and won't apologize is generally not worth a lot of your worry and anger."
"
Challenge negative thinking.,
Focus on things you can control.,
Set goals.,
Deal with setbacks.",How to Be a Hard Man1," Everyone has negative thoughts from time to time, but having too many negative thoughts can begin to affect your behavior and how you see yourself. If you do not challenge these negative thoughts, you may not live up to your potential and be the person that you would like to be. To challenge these thoughts, write them down, evaluate them, and then respond with a more positive thought.For example, if your initial thought is “I am weak”, you would start by writing down that thought on a piece of paper. You would then ask yourself, “Is there evidence that I am not weak?” Lastly, you would replace your initial thought with a more positive one like, “I am a strong person. There are areas that need improvement, but I am working to be better.”You have to practice positive thinking until it becomes natural.;
, You will not always be able to control your circumstances, but you can control how you respond to them. Time spent worrying about a problem is a waste of your mental energy. If you find yourself worrying about something, identify exactly what you are worried about and then develop a plan to solve the problem.For example, if you are worrying about a big presentation coming up, you would start by writing down the reasons you are worried about the presentation. You would then come up with a plan to prepare for the presentation and address any of your specific concerns. Putting your energy into developing a great presentation is a much better use of your time than sitting and thinking about all the ways your presentation could go wrong.

Developing good habits and increasing your willpower are also ways to help you manage any stress and focus on your behavior instead of the problem., Set short-term, specific goals for yourself. This will help you focus your mind on one task at a time and instead of thinking about what you have to do next. You will also become more confident every time you achieve a goal.If you were setting a goal around working out, your goal would be to ""finish the next 60 minutes of your workout"" instead of ""working out for 60 minutes, 5 times a week.""

, There will be bumps in the road. How you handle them will determine if you are a hard man. Accept that setbacks are part of the growing process and stay focused on your goal. Take time to write and/or think about your experience and what you learned. You may ask yourself:What did I do?
What could I have done better?
What would I do if I could go through this situation again?
What did I do well?
What did I learn that I could apply to my future goals?

Think about why you enjoy being alone.,

Accept yourself for who you are.,
Learn what you can from critics, and ignore the rest.,
Nurture the relationships that are valuable to you.,
Disconnect from social media.,
Make a space that is just for you.,
Get up early or go to bed later.,
Go do something you enjoy.,

Try to chat with someone you don’t know every once in awhile.",How to Be a Loner and Be Happy About It," If you start feeling as though maybe you should just try harder to be more social or worried that maybe there is something wrong with you, just remind yourself of the reasons that you enjoy being alone. If you need to you can make a list of the reasons that spending time alone makes you happy. You can refer back to this list whenever you start feeling insecure.For example, for many “loners,” spending time alone allows them to “recharge their batteries” by engaging in some creative activity or simply relaxing with a good book.;
, Some people may see extroversion as the ideal personality. However, more and more research is pointing out the value of introversion. For example, some research is finding that introverts can be great leaders because they tend to be better at letting those below them have a bit more room to try out new ideas, and are better at listening to others.An extrovert is a person who relies on social interaction and novel experience for their energy, while an introvert is someone who is more inward focused. An introvert needs time alone and often feels drained by intense social interaction.There is also a strong link between being introverted and being creative. Remember that many famous artists, writers, and scientists are believed to be loners, such as J.K. Rowling, Emily Dickinson, and Isaac Newton.

, One key thing you must do in order to become happy about being a loner is accept yourself as you are. You can certainly do things to become more social if you want to. However, if you are truly happiest when you are alone, why try to do something different?


When you find yourself being self-critical, try to change your way of thinking from negative to positive. For example, if you find yourself thinking, “people think I’m such a loser because I don’t like to go to parties” remind yourself of why going to parties is difficult for you. For example, “I know people don’t understand how exhausting a big party is for me, but staying at home makes me feel happy so I shouldn’t worry about what they think.”

, Dealing with people who criticize you can be tough. Especially if the person criticizing your habits is someone you really care about. At some point, someone may give you a hard time about preferring to spend time alone. Take time to determine whether or not there is something you can learn from them, or whether they simply can’t understand why you enjoy being alone because they are not like you.


They may tell you that you’re not trying hard enough to be social or that there is something wrong with you. If you think the person criticizing you is really trying to help then hear them out.
If the person criticizing you is someone you care about, then you might want to try and explain that this is who you are and that you need time by yourself to recharge. For example, you might say something like, ""Going to parties and having a lot of friends is your thing. I'm happy the way I am and I enjoy my life.""
If someone you don’t know well or someone who’s opinion you don’t value, then just brush off the criticism. Remember that what they say is a reflection of their own thoughts and beliefs, not an indication of what is right and what is wrong.

, Although you may be a loner, you may also have one or two good friends or family members that you rely on for social support. Spend time nurturing these relationships so that you will have the social support you need when things get tough.


If you don’t have any friends and don’t feel that you need any, then don’t worry about it. However, try to have at least one person (such as a family member) that you feel like you can rely on when/if a tough time arises., If you spend lots of time looking at various social media outlets then try to limit yourself. There is plenty of evidence that social media causes us to compare our lives to those we see on social media, which often leaves us feeling somehow inadequate.When you do look at social media, remember that people are only posting the best moments from their day, and they may even be exaggerating in their posts.

, If you live with other people you probably have a bedroom that is just for you. You can make this your own space and fill it with things that make you feel safe and happy. If you have to share your room with siblings or roommates, then finding a solitary place can be a bit tricky. In this case, maybe there is a closet or a small space where nobody goes that you can use to get some time alone.


You can also find a place outside the home that will provide you with solitude. There is no guarantee that you won’t encounter another person, but a park often offers a good place to go where no one will bother you.
If you have your own room where you can be alone, close your door when you need alone time. If that doesn’t deter people then place a sign on your door that says you are not to be disturbed.

, If you can’t seem to find some quiet alone time in your home and you can’t find a nearby place outside the home, try getting up an hour or two earlier than everyone else. If that isn’t an option, try going to bed a bit later. Hopefully this will give you at least a few minutes to enjoy being alone without being bothered by parents, siblings, and/or roommates.Be careful with this step though. Getting up earlier or going to bed later may mean getting fewer hours of sleep. Sleep is important for staying physically and emotionally healthy so don’t give up too many hours in the name of solitude.
Use this time to do whatever makes you happy. For example, do something creative, meditate, or get some work done that you aren’t able to do when everyone is up and about.

, As a loner, it can sometimes be hard to get out of the house as you may wonder what you can do by yourself without feeling weird. However, if you think about it you will find that there are lots of things you can go do alone to have some fun.


Going to the movies is a great thing to do alone. Find a movie you’ve been wanting to see, pick up some popcorn, and enjoy the film. Going to the movies with people is all well and good, but when you think about it, it seems a bit silly since you don’t talk to each other the whole time the movie is showing anyways.
Try out different coffee shops. Coffee shops have become very popular in the past few years, so there are more and more popping up every day. Take a book or, if you like drawing, a sketchpad. Order a nice coffee or tea, and just enjoy a few hours out of the house.
Try out a restaurant you’ve been interested in. If there is a restaurant you’re interested in, there is no reason you should feel embarrassed to go alone. If you’re worried that people will stare at you, try to go during an off-peak time.
Go for a walk or a run. Another great thing to do alone is just to go out and enjoy nature. Go for a walk or jog in a nearby park and you’ll be doing something good for you and your health.

, One part of going out in public that can make a loner feel nervous is the possibility that someone will try to chat casually with you. If you want to avoid this, put on a pair of headphones or have a book to read while you are waiting around or riding public transport. This will discourage people from engaging in idle chat.


This doesn’t guarantee that no one will talk to you. Some especially outgoing people are hard to deter. If someone talks to you and you aren’t interested in the conversation, keep your answers short and don’t ask questions that will encourage the conversation.

, If you are not used to going out by yourself to do things, you might feel as though everyone is staring at you, which will distract you from enjoying what you are doing. Try to remember that it is unlikely that anyone is truly interested in what you are doing or why you are doing it. As you spend more and more time outside the house by yourself, you’ll come to realize that most people are just trying to get on with their day. Although it will take some practice, when you go out to do something, focus on how you’re feeling about what you’re doing instead of on what you think everyone around you is feeling.


If you aren’t able to focus on yourself you may find the experience of going out alone just as draining as going with other people.

, Depending on your work or school setting it may be very easy for you to go days or weeks without talking to anyone. For example, if you work from home you may not have to talk to anyone at all. While this may be comfortable for you, there is evidence that socializing is good for everyone (even loners) from time to time.It doesn’t have to be a huge conversation. You can simply chat with someone in your class or at a coffee shop for a few minutes. For example, you can bring up how tough that last test was with a classmate, or you can ask the barista about her favorite beverage to make.

Once every month, go through your room and look through the things that you don't need and throw them out. If you have a hard time with this, then every day before you go to school, make sure your floor is cleared and no clothes or anything is on there. Step by step you will get to a clean, organized room of sitting up, stretching, and getting out of bed as soon as the alarm goes off. If you can't get out of bed on time, you may be going to bed too late. Try sleeping earlier to allow yourself at least 8 hours sleep. By getting up late you are setting a pattern of lateness for the rest of the day.

, Always arrive at your destination at least 15 minutes before you are supposed to be there. Wake up extra early. People will not take you seriously if you are late to things. You are letting people and their expectations down.


Don't rush. Leave your house early so you don't even risk getting a detention for being late to class, or so that you will not be late for work. When you plan out your day, plan it so that you don't have to rush. It is as simple as that.
Keep your watch accurate. For some people, moving up the time on their watch will help them be earlier. For others, they will subconsciously know that the time is wrong and so they just disregard it altogether. It may be helpful to set your watch just two minutes ahead instead of five or ten. This will make you less likely to ""factor in"" those extra few minutes.

, Get a calendar/planner, and write all of the things that you have to do on that day, not just the important things; to a perfectionist, everything is important.


Make a to do list for your day. Your daily or immediate list should never be more than 5 items long, or else you're taking on too much and setting yourself up for failure. Mark one or two of those items as things you absolutely must get done that day, and pursue those tasks relentlessly until you get them done.
Make a to do list for the week. Appropriate items here would be: Grocery shopping, fix air conditioner, etc. Draw from this list to make your daily to-do list. A white board or board with erasable markers can help to remember all one has to do every day, or long term goals.
Make a to do list for the month. This list would have more general tasks like: Birthday gift to Jill, get car serviced, dentist appointment. Draw from this list to make your daily and weekly to-do list.
Make a to do list for your life. Drastic, yes, but why not use this time to rethink your life and where it's going? Being a perfectionist is all about priorities, and it never hurts to get your ducks in a row.
Follow through. There's no point in making a to-do list if you don't discipline yourself to complete the tasks you've assigned yourself. There are many ways to stick to your to-do list. Stop procrastinating, remove or ignore distractions, and hop to it.
If something keeps slipping to the bottom of your to-do list, take a good look at it. Is it really important? If so, get it over with, or at least get it started. If not, put it back in the long-term list for ""someday"" or get it off the list altogether. Don't let yourself get hung up on something for too long.

,


Have excellent grammar.
Be very polite. Hold a door for someone. Say please, thank you and I'm sorry whenever necessary, even if it is to a person you may not like very much.
Speak calmly. This shows politeness. If you talk very loudly, it will seem that you're desperate for attention. Being loud in public isn't just obnoxious, but also inconsiderate to the people around you. Listen to what people have to say and always make eye contact.
Act As If You're Constantly Watched. Anywhere you are, imagine your boyfriend, your boss, your mother watching you. If you are a perfectionist you are doing just as you should, but if you talk to yourself, smoke, slouch, eat like a pig, speed, swear, or lie would these people think of you differently? They would!; And you should feel you need to change as well.

, If you want to act the part, you should look the part as well. Be sure to iron your clothes. Dress for success, not like a slob. You will find that people will take you more seriously.



Take care of your skin. Skin should be well cared for and clear of imperfections. Wash your face everyday and remember to wear sunscreen or shade hats. Try to give yourself a mask facial once a week.

Maintain your nails. Clear coat on your fingernails; color or french pedicure on your toes. Don't let the skin around them get dry to the point that they crack, and stop biting your nails. If you polish them, go for a natural French manicure, clear polish, or even neutral, solid-colored polish (not bold, like red or blue or black). Don't let the polish chip off, and don't let your nails get too long. Nails should be in neutral colors and medium short in length on girls and trimmed short on boys.

, Carry extra money with you. If you have a cell phone, always make sure that it's fully charged. You never know when you will be stuck in a situation where you are stuck on your own. You will be very thankful that you brought your cell phone with you. A perfectionist cannot be perfect if they are unprepared!

, Perfectionists are known to set impossibly high standards for themselves. You want to set high standards, but not impossibly high if you would actually like to achieve them. Find out what works for you.

, Pay attention to every little detail. It will make you happy.

At school try to get a seat where you can clearly hear and see the teacher and chalkboard and pay attention.
A good goal to set for yourself is to try to get mostly A's in everything you do at school including homework.
Take notes, study for that test, focus, but most of all come to school ready to learn and try not to worry about the social scene too much, after all, that's not what school is for.
try to join extra curricular activities but only if you know it will not bring your grades down.
Follow school rules. There's a reason why they've been set in place. By following rules, not only do you avoid getting in trouble, but troublemakers are often though less of, so you'll look like a better person. To be a perfectionist, you have to be a perfect student!;
, i.e. Go to bed on time, offer to wash the dishes, bring in the groceries, teach your little brother how to tie his shoes, etc. No matter how tempting it is, if you know there's something you should be doing (no matter how badly you don't want to do it), do it!


Create a chore chart for yourself. Once you have organized your space, make a list of a few small chores to do each day to help you keep up with your organization.

,


Girls should dress neatly and appropriately. Any style can work for a perfectionist, just remember to pay attention to detail. Wearing quality, classic clothes is your best bet. Follow your school's dress code!
For boys try to wear things such as t-shirts with checks, and fabric pants, and, just like the girls, wear items that look crisp and fresh and are well coordinated. And, no matter your gender, always follow your school's dress code.

,


Remember to always be clean: run a comb through your hair, keep your nails dirt-free and neat, brush your teeth and bathe/shower.
When spraying perfume, be sure to use just enough, but not too much. Excessive use of perfume isn't attractive and does not improve your hygiene, despite popular belief.
Never have greasy hair. Use dry shampoo, if you do not have time to wash it.

Maintain your nails. Clear coat on your fingernails; color or french pedicure on your toes. Don't let the skin around them get dry to the point that they crack, and stop biting your nails. If you polish them, go for a natural French manicure, clear polish, or even neutral, solid-colored polish (not bold, like red or blue or black). Don't let the polish chip off, and don't let your nails get too long. Nails should be in neutral colors and medium short in length on girls and trimmed short on boys.

Maintain your hair.,
Have a daily regime in mind.,
Moisturize your lips.,
Shave Your Body Hair.,
Consider waxing.,
Shape your body to be more feminine.,
Dress femininely.Shirts that fit nicely, even snugly, are always more acceptable.,
Wear softer scents.,
Be kind, gentle, and caring.",How to Be a Feminine Guy," Long, feminine hair is one of the single most important things in the feminine beauty. Done correctly, it can be amazingly beautiful, and simple at the same time. The key to having luscious hair is to moisturize and wash daily. Use moisturizing shampoos and conditions every day when you shower. When drying, use soft, gentle motions to prevent pulling.;
, Femininity is often described as soft, graceful, elegant, and clean. The key to all this is obviously cleanliness. Shower at least once a day, preferably twice. Buy an oil-free moisturizer, and use it daily! Smooth skin is the essence of beauty. Wash your face multiple times a day using a cleanser like Cetaphil to prevent drying. Lastly, exfoliate your skin as much as possible. By removing dead skin cells from the top layer of your skin, your skin will take on a beautiful, radiant shine and color.

, Chapped lips not only look disgusting, they can actually be harmful to your health. Chapping and tearing of the lips can create blood blisters or canker sores, which can become infected. Using lip balm will not only improve your image, but also present smooth, healthy lips.

, Body hair is the bane of feminine society. To be feminine is to let go of the ugly body hair that inhabits much of your body. Removing body hair is a simple process, however, and can be done daily. Before shaving any part of your body, always either take a warm shower or wash the part of your body to remove trapped dirt, dust and grime, soften hair follicles, and open pores. For the best image, shave the number of times listed in parenthesis.


For your armpits (Daily):

Put a generous amount of shaving cream (unscented is best) into the hand opposite of the armpit you are currently shaving.
Place your arm up over your head so that the armpit to be shaved is taut. Starting from the top of your armpit, take gentle, smooth strokes downward, picking up the razor every so often to wash off hair and start afresh.
Go up now, taking gentle, smooth strokes and making sure to stop every so often to wash off hair and restart.
Now go side to side, left to right and right to left, so that the awkward hairs are shaved clean.
Wash off any remaining shaving cream and run your hand over your armpit to feel for any stray hairs.
Repeat this process with the opposite armpit.


For your chest (Every other day):

Lather a generous amount of shaving cream onto your chest, starting at your neck and moving down to the underwear line, right below your belly button.
Starting from the left, take slow, smooth strokes upward, stopping to clean out hair every so often.
Continue this process across your entire chest, avoiding your nipples and belly button, which we will come back to.
Once shaved all the way to the left, lather around your nipples and carefully shave around, avoiding the nipple itself at all costs. Cutting your nipple is extremely painful, so avoid getting the razor too close.
Wash the remaining shaving cream off and check for any straggling hairs.


For your legs (Every 2 days):

Apply a generous amount of shaving cream to one leg, starting at the hip and moving down to the knee.
Take careful, smooth strokes from the knee up, being careful not to go too fast as to cut yourself. Stop often and wash away straggling hairs in the razor.
Having reached the hip area, stop and go the opposite direction, cleaning the razor as needed.
Once finished, apply shaving cream to the knee area down to the ankle, and begin shaving, starting from the ankle up.
When you reach the ankle, go the opposite direction to ensure all hairs are shaved. Stop to clean the razor as necessary.


For your arms (Every other day):

Apply a generous amount of shaving cream to the top of your arm, starting from the shoulder and moving down to the hand.
Shave with light, gentle, starting at the shoulder and moving down to your the top of your hand.
Once finished, reverse direction and shave from the bottom up.
Next, apply a generous amount of shaving cream to the bottom of your arm, starting at the armpit (if you are shaving your armpits as well).
Shave very gently starting from the armpit, and working your way down, gently shave your wrist for only a few strokes (little hair grows on the wrist).
Once finished, reverse direction back up to the armpit.
Wash off any remaining shaving cream and check for stray hairs. Then, switch to the opposite arm and repeat these steps.


For your feet (Daily):

Apply a generous amount of shaving cream to the top and side of your foot, and your toes.
Slowly and gently shave your foot and toes, starting from the end farthest from you, and work your up to your ankle.
Reverse direction and shave towards your toes.
Wash off any remaining shaving cream and check for any stray hairs.
Repeat these steps for the opposite foot.


Once you have finished shaving the areas of your body you desire, wait for approximately 30 minutes, and then apply an oil-free moisturizer generously to the area to avoid redness and ingrown hairs.

, Waxing has become a sort of dreaded personal care technique. Horror stories are limitless, and often waxing is not even considered for hair removal. However, horror stories aside, waxing is one of the best and most feminine ways to remove body hair for a much longer time. Consult with friends to find where the best waxing salons are, or do an internet search. Always check to make sure that the license of the store is up to date, that the salon waxier seems to know what she is doing, and that all sanitary codes are followed, including making sure the wax is hot, which is the single greatest deterrent of infection. Waxing is a much more permanent way of removing unwanted bodily hair.

, The most feminine figure one can obtain is that so-often desired hourglass figure, but in reality, starving oneself to get a perfect body is far from necessary. Remember that the feminine physique includes small shoulders and broad hips. Exercises that tone the lower body muscle, not the upper body, are key here.

, Wearing tight jeans also helps. Remember to wear softer colors, including purple and pink, and try to consult with female friends on what clothing would fit your desires best.

, Feminine colognes, perfumes, and sprays do not overpower your look, they add to it. Strong smells will detract from your appearance, not add to it.

, The feminine side is caring, loving, and nurturing, not destructive and hateful. Always smile, carry a bright outlook, and live today as if it's your last.

Talk less and listen more.,
Consider the context before saying potentially inflammatory or difficult statements.,
Ask for help and things, never just take them and assume it is okay.,
Never speak ill of others when they aren't around.,
Slow down before speaking.,
Mind your manners.",How to Be a Nice Person2," Yes, good conversation skills can go a long way. Be polite when you are talking to others and try to always listen intently. By listening to those you talk to, it shows that you care about what they are saying. Try to speak about yourself less and focus on creating a great conversation.


If you find yourself thinking constantly about what you need to say next, you're not listening well enough., Politics and religion tend to bring out the most argumentative of people, and can be conversational landmines. The issue isn't the argument -- even kind people can have good, productive arguments over tough issues -- rather, it is being sensitive about when you bring these things up. A good rule of thumb is to always try to recognize the good in someone elses' viewpoint. If you can't do that, don't bring it up.


This goes for off-color or risque jokes too. No matter how funny it is, pay attention to your audience before telling it.

, Never bully someone into giving you what you want. This will give the impression that you believe you are 'superior' above others. You do not want to set this impression, so be sure to be gracious when asking things from others.


""Hey-- would you mind if I borrowed this?""
""Could you offer me a hand? I'd really appreciate it.""
""I wanted to let you know I need the car next weekend. Will that be okay?""

, Of course, you shouldn't generally criticize people at all, but there are times when telling someone they did someone wrong is perfectly fine. However, that time is never when the person isn't around. Talking badly about people when they aren't around tells everyone else that you don't respect them, and treat people differently when they are around. Nice people know that talking behind someone's back is never appreciated.


If you have a problem or question about someone, just ask. Bring these conflicts out into the open to make them much more manageable in a kind, easy way., Don't just blurt the first thing in your mind. Wait a bit and process. Slower, more thoughtful speakers don't cut others off, and they don't put their foot in their mouths during delicate conversations. Remember that your opinion is important, and so are your thoughts, but you can make them all more meaningful if you take a few seconds to compose yourself first., Opening doors for people, saying please and thank you, and helping with the chores or dishes after staying with friends is a simple, everyday way to be a nice person. These little interactions may not feel like much, but they ultimately show that you respect the other person enough to take your time and be considerate.


Don't feel like you need to be a manner's expert, taking courses or reading books. Just remember to be considerate -- think of your host or other people, and act accordingly."
"
Be nice for the sake of being nice, not to gain personal advantage.,
Remember to always treat people the way you would like to be treated.,
Be trustworthy.,
Take a deep breath and slow down when you feel anger or meanness coming.,
Focus on one area of your life where you need to improve at a time.,
Find the silver linings and positives in any situation.",How to Be a Nice Person3," The nicest people you know do kind things when absolutely no one is watching. This is because being nice is about caring about more than yourself. Having a positive spirit, kind heart, and willingness to help out those in need isn't about impressing people or getting a reward. Being kind is about creating openness and trust with everyone you meet, showing the world that being nice is its own reward., When you fully respect others' dignity, then automatically more people see you as a nice, caring, trustful, and considerate friend. At the end of the day, you want to be respected for your views, ideas, and passions, even if the other person doesn't share them. You should offer the same courtesy to others as well.

, It is very important to be trustworthy if you are wishing to be a nice person. You must show people that they can trust you no matter what. People will begin to come to you for advice and sometimes just to vent. You can not tell lies and spread rumors, ever. A nice person would never betray a friend or spread rumors, so be cautious of what you say. Habits of trustworthy people include:


Being on time for people, and respecting their time and deadlines.
Following through on promises promptly.
Avoiding double-talk and dealing with issues or problems head on.

, When the burst of anger hits your brain, try not to react immediately. Instead, try to remove yourself from the situation mentally. Look back on the situation and ask yourself if getting angry or upset really solves anything. Before placing blame on others, ask yourself if the situation is really one person's fault. Give yourself 30 seconds to relax -- you'll be surprised how much easier it is to be nice when you're done., Becoming a nicer person can be difficult if you have a hectic, jam-packed life, but it isn't impossible. Start small, focusing on one aspect of life or one relationship where you aren't being kind enough, and start to make the change. As you do, you'll find it easier to settle down and be nicer no matter where you are.

, Keeping cool, level, and positive will always make it easier to be a nice person. If you keep your thoughts generally happy and optimistic, that spirit will come through in your words and actions. The more you can share a positive spirit with others, the nicer you will be perceived to be.Take a deep breath during stressful moments instead of rushing in. Give yourself 30 seconds to get calm and everything will be much less negative.
Look for solutions, not complaints or excuses. Once something bad happens, harping on how it happened helps no one -- move on to possible solutions.

"
"
Exercise regularly.,
Train outdoors.,
Push your limits.,
Deal with pain.",How to Be a Hard Man2," Have a regular fitness program that you follow. Try to train as hard as you possibly can. Decrease the amount of rest between workouts and exercise. For example, instead of running every other day, you may run 5 or 6 days a week and have one rest day. If you are lifting weights, you may rest 30 seconds in between exercises instead of resting for 1 or 2 minutes.


Because you are pushing your body hard, it is important to eat a healthy diet and get plenty of sleep.
If you have not been exercising, speak to your doctor before you get started.

, If you only train indoors, you are limiting yourself to a controlled environment. When you go outside, you are challenging your body more. Train in cold and hot environments. Walk and run up hills and trails instead of being on paved, flat surfaces all of the time.You can also adjust your clothing to make the environment more challenging. If it is hot outside, wear long pants and long sleeves instead of shorts and a tank top. If it is cold outside, wear the least amount of clothes you can stand when you train.
Slowly increase the intensity. You do not want to hurt yourself. For example, you may train in hot weather with shorts and a long sleeve shirt. Once your body gets used to the long sleeve shirt, you can add the long paints.

, Your body will adapt to your training conditions. You must mix it up and do a variety of activities. Constantly push yourself to get to the next level. If running in cold weather is easy, try running when it is cold and raining outside. If you did 20 repetitions last time, try to get 25 this time.Do anything that gets you muddy and dirty.
Spartan races, obstacle courses, and adventure races are good options.
If you train with other people, always strive to be the best and outwork the other person.

, Pain is inevitable when you are pushing your body. Try to manage your pain yourself. Do not complain to other people about how you feel. Positive thinking will also help you deal with pain. Your pain is bringing you one step closer to being the man you want to be.


Tell yourself, ""I can deal with the pain. This is helping me get stronger.""
If the pain becomes so severe that you cannot do your daily activities, visit a health care professional to make sure that you do not have a serious injury.

"
"
Do something uncomfortable daily.,
Choose your battles.,
Do not complain.,
Stand by your beliefs.,
Speak with confidence.,
Know when to be soft.",How to Be a Hard Man3," As a hard man, you cannot be controlled by your emotions or circumstances. It takes time to reach this stage and you must train yourself by dealing with small discomforts every day. The more you practice, the better you will become.Small discomforts such as taking cold showers, fasting one day a week, or eating a strict diet are a good place to start.
If you are having trouble finding a small discomfort, make a list of the things that irritate you or you don’t like doing. Then choose one of those things work on. For example, if you hate waking up early, start waking up 15 minutes earlier in the morning.

, Just because you can fight, does not mean you should. You do not need to prove anything to anyone. Only fight when it is necessary and for a good cause. You should never start a fight, but you can definitely finish one.Defend the victims of bullying and scapegoating. Sympathize with the victim and tell the bullies to leave the victim alone.
Someone bumping into you or saying something rude is not worth a fight. However, bumping into or disrespecting your girlfriend, partner, sister, or mother would be worth the fight.

, No matter how you are feeling or what you are going through, do not complain about it to other people. If you complain about things, other people will think that you are weak. Instead of complaining, face your problems head on and be brave.


This is especially important when you are in front of other people. For example, if you worked out really hard one day and you are very sore, there is no need to tell other people how hard you worked out and how sore you are. You do not want sympathy; you want to be respected.
If you were up all night working or studying, don’t go and tell people how tired you are the next day. Instead put extra effort into how you look the next day. People will see that you worked very hard, but it did not affect you.

, Do not be influenced by what other people do or say. Have your own mind and stick to your beliefs. Always act based on those beliefs, and take action if those beliefs are violated. Your reputation is very important. Be a leader, not a follower.For example, if you have strong beliefs about being friendly to animals and children, you may correct someone that hit their dog for being disobedient.
If you believe in being loyal and honest with your friends, do not tolerate friends who lie and are shady.

, Look people in the eye and speak with conviction. You do not need to raise your voice or curse, but speak as if you truly believe what you are saying. If you do not believe your words, other people will not believe you.For example, instead of saying, “I think that was a really good movie,” you would say, “That was a great movie. You need to go see it.”

, Even hard men have limits. There are times that your toughness may not be helpful to you or other people around you. You should never be a danger to yourself or other people. Ask for help if you need it. Remember that you do not have to prove anything to other people. You are a hard man because you have spent time working on yourself.


You may need to soften up a bit to comfort a friend, help someone in need, or show humility.
You can be a hard man and still have emotions.

Treat small promises with the same level of importance as big ones.,
Write your commitments down.,
Bridge the gap between abstract long term commitments and short term experiences.,
View your commitments as a privilege.,
Don’t agree to do things you don’t want to do.,
Don’t use excuses.,
Don’t be vague about what you are committing to do.,
Do what you said you’d do, even if you don’t want to do it.,
Get a commitment partner.,
Schedule reminders for yourself on your phone or in your calendar.,
Keep commitments you make to yourself.,
Make a habit of keeping your promises.",How to Be a Man of Your Word," Being a man of your word means more than simply following through with the commitments you think people will remember; it means following through no matter what.Place the same value on keeping small promises as you do on keeping the big ones.
Remember that being a man of your word is about integrity, and integrity matters even when no one is watching.;
, Writing your commitments down can help you change how you think about them, as well as being a great tool to help you remember them. Use index cards to write important commitments or promises out and keep them someplace safe that is preferably visible to you on a daily basis.Writing your commitments down may make you feel more accountable for actions.
The act of writing your commitments down can help you to remember them., It can sometimes be easy to make commitments that would be unpleasant to keep because we tend not to think of things in the medium to distant future in a real way. If someone asks you to help them move next month, for instance, you are more likely to say yes than if they were to ask about this Sunday. That’s because discomfort in the distant future doesn’t seem real in the present.Viewing future events in an abstract sense is called the “planning fallacy” and it can lead you to make commitments for the future that you may not otherwise have made.
Try to think of the things you are agreeing to do as though you were about to go do them right now. Don’t agree to do things you wouldn’t normally accept doing.

, While it’s easy to see the commitments you have to others as burdens, try to reframe the way you see them to reflect the trust others must have in you. You have earned the respect of people in your life, and as a part of that respect, commitments have arisen.Following through on your word is a great way to show the people in your life that you care about them.
People rely on you based on trust and respect. Having commitments to others is borne out of the respect and trust people have for you.

, Sometimes it may be tempting to agree to do something in conversation that you don’t really want to do. Social or peer pressure can leave you agreeing to do something in the moment, despite not actually wanting to keep the commitment.Don’t succumb to peer pressure when asked to do something that you truly don’t want to do. This will make it easier not to go back on your word later.
Treat your commitments as a valuable asset that you don’t give away lightly.

, If you find that you will not be able to fulfil a commitment that you’ve made, take responsibility for it. Making excuses can seem disingenuous, and it removes your responsibility to follow through. Instead, be honest and apologetic when you need to cancel plans.If you are uncomfortable explaining why you can’t fulfil a promise, apologize sincerely and explain that you will try not to let it happen again.
Disallowing yourself from using excuses will help motivate you to keep your promises and fulfill commitments.

, Do not say that you may be able to do something if you don’t believe that you will for the sake of casual conversation. Instead, make solid commitments to do things when you intend to, and clearly explain that you cannot when you don’t.Don’t use vague wording like, “I’m not sure but I’ll try,” when you don’t want to do something.
Be honest and clear about what you can and can’t do. It’s better to say you won’t be able to do something now then to make excuses later.

, Force yourself to keep your word, even if you don’t want to at times. Sometimes you may commit yourself to something at a moment when it seems like something you wouldn’t mind doing, only to find yourself lacking the motivation or energy when the time comes to fulfill your commitment. Don’t allow yourself to fall through because of a change of heart.Always keep your promises and fulfil your commitments to the utmost of your ability.
Keeping your word even when you don’t want to will help to teach you not to commit to things you will not want to do.

, Find someone that you trust and ask them to be your commitment partner. A commitment partner is someone you share your personal, professional or social commitments with so they can hold you accountable for your actions. If you struggle to keep your commitments, a commitment partner could be a great tool for you.Use your best friend or significant other as your commitment partner so they can ask you if you fulfilled the commitments you discuss with them.
Having someone to answer to can help motivate you to keep your commitments.

, If you find yourself unable to follow through with commitments because you forget about them, try scheduling reminders for yourself on your phone or e-mail calendar.


Most iPhones and Androids have applications that allow you to set reminders to go off at specific times and dates.
E-mail applications like Outlook can also provide you with reminders of things you have committed to do.

, Following through is a habit, and as such you need to treat all commitments with equal importance. That means you must keep the promises you make to yourself as well as those you make to others.When you decide to do something, do it, regardless of who you committed to.
Following through on your word no matter what will help make it second nature and eventually will require less and less mental effort.

, When you make keeping your word a habit, it will become second nature to you. Instead of using tools to help you keep your word, you can train yourself to do so without having to convince yourself.


Make keeping your promises a habit so it requires less and less self-convincing to follow through.
Maintaining such a habit will lead others to see you as a man that keeps his word.

Know your strength and exercise caution.,
Do not touch people who don't want to be touched.,
Do not confuse gentleness with weakness.,
Be patient.,
Don't lash out.,
Take deep breaths.,
Walk away.,
Practice ""constructive confrontation"".",How to Be a Gentle Person1," If you aren't careful, you may unwittingly hurt another person without intending to do so. Be especially cautious when interacting with fragile individuals--such as children, sick people, or very old people.


Always err on the side of caution. Treat fragile people as though they might actually break. You do not need to be overprotective--just thoughtful.
If you are picking up a small child, don't throw her in the air or swing her around. Hold her gently, with both of your arms, and be careful not to drop her. Be playful, but not careless.
If you are trying to a get a child or other dependent to come with you, don't pull their arm or push them. Pulling a child's arm can bruise skin, dislocate a shoulder, and earn the mistrust of the child. Sternly but gently tell him or her to come.;
, Physical intimacy is an important part of being human, but you should not violate anyone's personal space. Be respectful.


This can include playful touching. Acts like tickling, poking, or holding can seriously bother a person if they aren't in the mood.
Respect consent. If someone asks you to stop: stop. If you don't respect peoples' space, then they will distrust you.
If you absolutely must touch someone who doesn't want to be touched (say, your child is throwing a tantrum, but you need to change his diaper): be as soothing and careful as possible. Do what you need to do, and then give the person their space.

, The strongest people are those who can interact with others--touch others, speak with others, love others--in a patient and caring way. Being gentle is being able to hold someone without crushing them.


Think of a hug. Try to hug someone close enough that they feel your warmth, but not so close that they cannot breathe. Always be aware of how tightly you are squeezing.
Walk softly, but with power behind every step. You do not need to use all of your strength all of the time in order to prove that you possess it. There is strength in self-control.

, If you get into a disagreement with someone--or if you want someone to do something, but they aren't cooperating--be patient. Explain your reasoning and try to work out a compromise.


Fighting--verbally or physically--will only inflame the situation. If you want to build a lasting peace, you must work to understand both sides of the argument. Do not be the first to react.
Do not try to force anyone to do something against their will. Respect their position. Practice the art of compromise.

, When you get angry, count to ten. If you are still angry, keep counting. You may act rashly and violently when you let yourself become swept up in the flood of anger--but you can learn to control these impulses.Give yourself time to cool down. You may find that are overreacting to a situation. There is almost always a solution that does not involve verbal or physical violence.

, If you become angry, try to center yourself and calm yourself down before you do something rash. Breathe in through your nose, deeply, for as long as you can. Breathe out, slowly.Close your eyes and focus on your breaths. Take the time to slow down your heart rate and balance yourself. Let the initial burst of anger fade into the background. Clear your mind.
Consider counting your breaths--like meditation. As you inhale, count slowly: 1... 2... 3... 4. As you exhale, count out the same increment of time. This will keep you focused upon the act of breathing.
Consider taking up meditation. This is a great way to center your thoughts, practice mindfulness, and control your emotions.Search for tutorials online, and consider attending a guided meditation session.

, If you can't calm yourself down and focus your energy, then you may need to walk away from the situation. Take a few moments alone to reflect upon why you are so upset.


Excuse yourself simply and gracefully. Ask whoever is making you angry, ""Can we discuss this later?"" or ""I need to think about this. Can I get back to you on that?""
Consider going somewhere that you can be alone. If you have a favorite spot--a shady tree, a beautiful vista, a dark and quiet room--go there. Surround yourself with calm.
Consider finding a wise, balanced person to whom you can vent. Find a friend, or call someone, and tell them what's making you so upset. Your friend may be able to calm you down and give you perspective on the situation.

, Therapist Mark Gorkin, LICSW, author of Practice Safe Stress: Healing and Laughing in the Face of Stress, Burnout & Depression, offers a five-step method for ""constructive confrontation"":


1) Use an ""I"" statement, question, or observation: ""I'm concerned,"" ""I'm confused,"" or ""I'm frustrated"" are good ways to begin your exchange.
2) Describe the problem specifically. Avoid judgmental accusations such as ""You never get your work in on time."" Instead, be specific: ""I've asked you three times this week for the status of the systems report and I haven't received the report or any response. What's going on here?""
3) Explain why you're upset. Talk about effects and expectations. For example: ""Because I didn't receive the report on time, I wasn't able to present it at the meeting and we had to postpone making a decision."" That's the effect. The expectation: ""We really need the data. I want to meet tomorrow morning at 9 to discuss where you are with the project.""
4) Acknowledge the other person and ask for input. Let the other person know you have some understanding of what he's going through. For example: ""I know you're working on several important projects. Tell me what's on your plate. Then we'll need to set priorities and upgrade the importance of this project.""
Listen and let go. Once you've engaged in the first four steps, you can be more objective and can let go of any existing anger, hurt feelings, or questionable assumptions.

Think before you act.,
Make a conscious effort not to hurt anyone.,
Empathize.,
Accept the things that you cannot change.,
Take time to de-stress.",How to Be a Gentle Person2," If you are quick to anger, you may do something in the heat of the moment that you'll regret later on. Consider the consequences of what you are about to do. Don't react; respond.


Try to grab hold of your anger and examine it. Ask yourself what exactly is making you so angry. Ask yourself if you are overreacting.
Think through the consequences of your actions. If you react violently in this situation, will you burn any bridges? Will it negatively impact your relationships? Will you run the risk of being arrested, suspended, or otherwise punished for your actions.

, It's easy to be rough with other people if you don't consider how your actions might make them feel. Be careful.


If you find yourself hurting people without intending to do so, try to understand what it was that hurt them so. Is this person sensitive to a particular word or label? Did I grab their arm too hard without thinking?
Consider treating others as if they are especially fragile, at least at first. Be as considerate as you can be without walking on eggshells.

, Try to understand why someone is acting the way they're acting: try to figure out how they feel and what they are thinking. You may find it much harder to be angry once you understand where someone's coming from.If you can't understand why someone is acting a certain way, just ask them. Tell them what you don't understand, and listen carefully to their response. They may be just as confused about what you are thinking.
Empathy is a two-way street. Try to be open about what you are thinking. Work to build a mutual understanding.

, Practice letting go. You may find that many of the things that stress you out are things over which you have absolutely no control.Consider each source of stress. Can you fix it with force? Can you change it with kindness? Do you understand why it bothers you?
Let go of the things that make you angry--whether this is a toxic relationship, an awful job, or a grudge from the past. Commit to yourself that you will focus on the present and not on the past.
Practice letting go, for example, when you are interrupted in the middle of speaking. Take a deep breath. Do not let yourself lose your head over something that you will forget about in a week., It's easy to become swept up in the day-to-day demands of work, school, relationships and family. Give yourself time to simply be yourself.


Get outside. Find a quiet space. Go for a walk or take a swim. Go to the movies. Get a massage or get your nails done. Do anything that allows you to forget your troubles for a while.
Consider leaving your phone behind. You may find it easier to leave the troubles of day-to-day life behind if you are not being constantly bombarded with texts, calls, and emails. Be present.
Reducing stress is fantastic for your health. If you're always stressed and often angry, you may be at risk for high blood pressure. Practice de-stressing, and you may live a longer, healthier life."

Try hard to be more gentle.,
Tell your loved ones.,
Consider hiring an anger management coach.,
Embrace your emotions.,
Stick to it.",How to Be a Gentle Person3," Actions speak louder than words. If you want to show the people in your life that you've turned over a new leaf, you will need to prove it by being especially careful.


Be patient. It takes time to build trust. Practice being as gentle as you want to be, and continually evaluate your actions. Am I being gentle? Am I being kind?

Do not expect anyone to forgive you. If people do forgive you for past violence, do not expect them to forget. You cannot change the past, but you can shape the future.

, If you are trying to overcome your violent impulses and become a more gentle person, consider sharing this with the people in your life that have been hurt by your anger. Ask them to tell you when you step out of line.


In order to do this, you must be prepared to take constructive criticism. It may be a challenge to stay calm when someone asks you to curb your anger--few things are more infuriating than the phrase, ""Calm down!"" Bear in mind that your loved ones are only trying to help you help yourself.

, Search for therapists and psychologists in your area that specialize in helping people deal with their anger. It can't hurt to try just one session.


Run a web search for ""anger management coach"" or ""anger management classes"". You can take these courses over the Internet. If you want to meet with someone face-to-face, search for ""anger management coach"" along with your city (e.g. ""anger management coach san -francisco"").
Enter with an open mind. No one can help you change unless you are prepared to help yourself. Work with the people in your life, not against them.
Research your anger management coach before you make a final decision. If you can find reviews online, read them. Try to get in touch with someone who has been to see this particular coach.

, If you are acting in a rash, violent way, you are letting your negative emotions overwhelm you. Embrace your positive emotions and let them guide you through trying times.


It's okay to be vulnerable, and it's okay to cry. You can be strong and also keep in touch with your feelings.
Don't be afraid to vent. Find someone to talk to about your problems. You may find that an outlet of support makes it much easier to cope with your stress.

, Be gentle and be self-aware. If you get angry and do something rash, you may undo all of the work that you've done.


Continually evaluate whether your actions are gentle or violent. Do not let yourself forget the person that you used to be.
Eventually, with time and care, you can change your image: you can become a genuinely gentle person in the eyes of yourself and others. Practice leads to habit. Start today.

Give everything you do 100% of your effort.,
Practice basics at home.,
Avoid chatting during class, drills, between turns or at the water fountain.

,
Be willing to try even if you are a little afraid.,
Always think about pointing toes, stretching knee's and nice presentation.,
Bring a positive attitude to training with you everyday.",How to Win over a Gymnastics Coach," Commit fully to your training schedule and make sure you are there no matter what. Don't use silly excuses like being tired or having too much homework to skip training but always be there ready to work and ready to learn.;
, Gymnastics is a very dynamic sport even with injuries its important to still come to training. If you have a broken arm you can still work on your leg strength and flexibility for example. Your coaches will be impressed if you continue to train your other body parts when you are injured and you will find it easier to get back into full training when you recover. However make sure you understand that you won't be allowed to do somethings because of your injury.

, Nothing infuriates a coach more than being late for practice. Being late disrupts the class, means you might miss important warm up and is quite rude. Aim to be at the gym 10-15 minutes before your classes start in order to be ready to go at start time.

, Make sure your hair is neat and tidy and pulled back of your face. Wear a leotard and look ready to compete when you train.

, Your coach won't ask you to be able to do everything right the first time but he/she will expect you to try.

, Most of your gymnastics is unsafe to practice at home but it's a great place to work on your stretching and flexibility, basic conditioning and handstands. A little time each day will make a big difference.

,, Remember that your coach would never ask you to do something that you are not ready to do. If you are too afraid to do a skill be honest and say ""I'm feeling scared of this"" rather than trying to avoid your turn or just refusing to do your skill.

, Do every skill like you are competing it.

, Smile and be ready to enjoy yourself. Don't whine about being sore or tired.

As with most gymnastics skills, the most important thing for learning a new motion is practice.,
You may find it helpful to have a friend act as a spotter, or someone who will help you walk across the beam.,
Start by practicing on a line on the ground or a low beam (one that is only a few inches off the ground).,
Place one foot in front of the other.,
Extend your arms straight out to the side, like the wings on an airplane.,
Stay ""tight."",
As you become more comfortable with the beam and your muscles learn the movements, practice on higher beams.",How to Walk on a Gymnastics Balance Beam," It may take many tries before you can consistently walk across the balance beam without falling. That's okay; gymnastics is a difficult sport.;
, He or she should stand on the ground while you are on the beam. They should place their hands on your waist or lower rib cage - not on your arms or legs - to help you keep your balance. Note: you should always have some sort of supervision (see Warnings).

, A good rule of thumb is to start at a height where you feel comfortable, and work your way up.

, People with small feet may be able to walk with their feet completely or partially next to each other, but it is better to practice putting one foot in front of the other. In addition to being good practice for more complicated moves, this reduces the likelihood that your feet will get tangled up or that you will trip.

, You might feel a little silly, but you will be able to balance much more easily.

, This means that you should be squeezing your muscles, but not so much that you cannot move. If nothing else, you should make an effort to keep your core (abdominal muscles) tight. If you are ""loose,"" or your muscles are not tight, you will find you lose your balance much more often.

, Before you know it, you'll be able to walk across a beam like an Olympian!

Seek out qualified advice.",How to Teach Yourself Gymnastics," Before you start flipping, pirouetting and standing on your head, you should work to reach a base level of physical conditioning. Build your muscular strength by performing calisthenics exercises such as push ups, pull ups, air squats and crunches. Go for a jog or swim laps a couple times a week to get in better cardiovascular shape. Begin stretching thoroughly every day—flexibility plays a critical role in gymnastics.As you progress, keep up with your strength and conditioning exercises and increase their intensity.
If you have history of serious injury, or a condition that makes strenuous exercise difficult or risky, gymnastics may not be for you.;
, Start learning all the most basic skills from the ground up. You may have performed some gymnastics moves as a kid or think you have a pretty good idea of how it’s supposed to be done, but if you want to learn the right way you need to put pride aside and start from square one. Looking at each skill like it’s your first time will help do away with any misconceptions you may have and orient you with the correct technique.Any expert will tell you that the most important aspect of getting good at anything is mastering the basics. Spending more time becoming confident with fundamental skills will benefit you in the long run.
Some good techniques to add to your repertoire when you’re first starting out are back bends, bridges, headstands, handstands, forward and backward somersaults, cartwheels and splits., Do every skill the right away or don’t do it at all. Proper form and precision are the two most important components of the sport. If you learn something the wrong way, not only do you run the risk of injury but you might also establish bad habits that affect every skill that builds off that movement.Film yourself and compare it to the photo and video tutorials you’re using to review your technique.

, Whenever you get a chance, set aside time to drill the techniques you’ve learned. Only work on skills that it's safe for you to do by yourself or under the supervision of an adult or someone else who can spot you. This will mostly include simple floor movements—flips and other complex skills will be too dangerous to learn on your own. Formal instruction can provide you with useful cues for learning more quickly, but the progress you’re able to make depends almost entirely on how hard you’re willing to study and work.Try to set aside at least three hours a week to train.
Remember, practice doesn’t make perfect: perfect practice makes perfect. You should always put special emphasis on correct form when training and give it your all.

, One of the simplest skills to learn as a beginner is the somersault. To perform a front somersault, crouch down and place both hands on the ground directly under your shoulders. Tuck your chin and lean forward until your head clears the floor. Then, roll carefully down the length of your spine. Finish by bringing your feet back beneath you and returning to a standing position.You'll need to push lightly with your legs to create enough momentum for the roll to propel you all the way over to your feet.Curl up as tightly as possible to make the roll one fluid motion.

, Squat down with your weight over your heels. Lower your weight until your butt touches the ground, using your hands to guide you if you need to. Rock backwards, tucking your knees up toward your head. Tilt your neck to one side and roll over your shoulder, pushing through with your hands to assist you. Come to a stop by touching down with one knee at a time, then rise to your feet.Because of the amount of control you have over the early stages of the movement, the backward roll can be learned at a more gradual pace than the front somersault, making it easier to master.

, Lie flat on your back with your knees bent, feet on the ground. Bring your arms up and back until your palms are resting on the floor beside your head. Use a coordinated push to hoist your body up into an arched position, bending backwards as the name suggests. Make sure you're in a stable stance by keeping your hands and feet planted firmly. Reverse the motion in a slow, controlled manner to return to your back.The bridge requires a moderate amount of upper body strength for stabilization, so you may have to work up to it over time.Lower yourself slowly to keep from bumping your head.

, From a normal stance, stagger one foot in front of the other. Lean forward at the waist, keeping your torso rigid and straight with your arms extended over your head. Place both hands down on the floor; at the same time, kick up with your back leg to elevate yourself into an inversion. Push through your shoulders, keeping your arms locked. Use small adjustments of your fingers and palms to maintain your balance. When you're ready to come down, lower one leg back to the floor at a time.Practice handstands against a wall until you get the hang of kicking up and balancing.You'll need to know how to recover safely if you should happen to lose your balance while in an inverted position. Simply bring one or both feet to the floor underneath you if you're falling backwards, and turn slightly to one side and step out if you're falling forwards., Stand at the ready with your hands by your sides. Take one long step with your dominant leg, raising your arms up over your head as you do. Shift your weight forward and teeter your upper body down towards the ground as you shoot your back leg up forcefully behind you. This action is similar to kicking up into a handstand, only this time you'll set one hand down after the other (starting with the same side as your lead leg) while following through with your kicking leg. Let the kick carry you up and over the top, landing on the same leg, then following with the other.This skill takes its name from the movement of the spokes on a wheel. Imagining yourself turning over in the same fashion can help you learn the correct hand and foot positioning needed for the technique.
Cartwheels are tricky because to pull them off successfully, all four limbs must coordinate independently of one another. Start by practicing them at a low angle until you get the timing right, then gradually kick up harder until you're more inverted.
The cartwheel is an important prerequisite for the one-handed cartwheel, round off and aerial skills., Pick out clothes that allow you to move freely. Competitive athletes work out in team uniforms, usually leotards or tights, but at home you can wear shorts or sweatpants with a tank top or anything else that feels good to bend, twist and leap in. You also have the option of wearing shoes, which will protect your feet, though they might feel clunky when you're performing skills that require a high level of coordination. Above all, you should be comfortable and uninhibited.If you have long hair, pull it back in a tight ponytail or bun to keep it from falling in your face.
It might be a good idea to bring along a pair of shoes when you're practicing outside, or any place with rough, uneven surfaces.

, Since you won’t have access to an actual gym, you’ll have to exhibit a little creativity in coming up with places to work on your skills. For floor techniques such as cartwheels, back bends, handstands and basic tumbling, a simple grass field might do the trick. In addition, some public playgrounds have equipment that you could use to practice bar skills like swinging, casts and landings. Always have someone around to help you when you're playing around with difficult or risky maneuvers.A low wall could be used as a vault. A tree stump could serve as a pommel horse. Rings can be bought and hung for cheap. The only thing limiting you is your imagination.
Trampolines and swimming pools can help you get over your fear of new skills that involve unfamiliar movements like flipping and twisting. Just use them sparingly, as they can encourage bad habits if you rely on them too much.

, Be smart about the way you train to avoid getting hurt. Always warm up and stretch thoroughly before pushing your body with high-impact movements. When training outside, scan the ground for rocks, sharp sticks and other dangerous, unseen obstacles. If you can, put down mats to cushion impact when attempting new skills for the first time.Have a friend spot you if you’re scared to try out a technique on your own.

, Be patient and drill the basic techniques repeatedly until you’re competent enough to move on to more difficult skills. Your progress will be very slow and gradual, and that’s okay. Don’t get in too big of a hurry to improve; you’re more likely to make mistakes and hurt yourself if you force yourself to try techniques you’re not yet ready for.Once you’re ready for intermediate-level skills, add front and back walkovers, handsprings, aerials and standing flips to your practice sessions.
When you feel yourself getting impatient, remember that a cartwheel leads to a round off, a round off leads to a back handspring, a back handspring leads to a back tuck, a back tuck leads to a back full, etc. One things builds off another.

, When you’re teaching yourself and practicing alone, a lot can go wrong. In all likelihood, there will come a time when you suffer a sprained ankle, a pulled muscle or even a broken bone, just like any other gymnast. Invite a friend along when you practice to be there in case you slip up. Keep a phone on you and have an emergency contact in mind that you can call if something bad were to happen.Hospital bills can get very costly. If you don’t have a solid insurance plan, you may want to consider picking up another hobby.
One of the most unfortunate injuries you can incur is a bruised ego. Setbacks will happen, and they can often be painful and embarrassing, but don’t let them discourage you from reaching your goals.

, Pull up instructional videos on YouTube and similar websites. By running a simple search, you can often find helpful content that breaks down technique, offers detailed explanations of unusual movements and features slow-motion demonstrations. Look to make sure that a given video was produced by an official gymnastics school or coach—otherwise, the information it outlines might not be trustworthy.Examine videos of skills you’re in the process of learning to familiarize yourself with the way they’re supposed to look.
Take notes from the videos you watch so you’ll have them to refer to while you practice.

, Pick up whatever books, magazines and other published works related to gymnastics you can get your hands on. The articles and photos they contain will prove very illustrative and can give you technique tips and ideas for new training exercises. A good place to start would be an instructional guide that provides a comprehensive overview of the sport, such as Gymnastics for Dummies.Go over written guides extensively to gain an understanding of how certain techniques work. You’ll have to be willing to do a little more homework since you won’t have the benefit of a coach.
If you’re lucky, you might even be able to track down copies of old gymnastics training manuals used to teach competitive athletes in past decades., In some cases, you may be able to register for gymnastics instruction over the internet for a small fee. Online education might take the form of e-books, video seminars and/or virtual classrooms led by experienced coaches. These web seminars are typically designed to provide new instructors with practical lessons, but you probably stand to learn a lot yourself if this option is available to you.Verify that an online course is being presented by a reputable coach or athlete before signing up.

, Ask for pointers from those who are involved in the sport. If you know someone that does gymnastics, see if they’ll pass on a portion of what they’ve learned to you. Sit in on a gymnastics class if there’s a school nearby and absorb as much of the coaches’ instruction as you can. You might even be able to find a friend or acquaintance willing to work with you one-on-one in their spare time.Look into whether your area university, YMCA or rec center has an existing gymnastics program or club. Clubs like these are often free or inexpensive and open to people in the surrounding community.Try asking questions online on gymnastics message boards. These can be an excellent resource for getting info from many different knowledgeable parties. If you’re under 18, ask a parent if it’s okay for you to post on internet forums before turning to them for help."

If you are good enough, you will eventually improve to the top. Your coach will be proud of you no matter what level, because they will know you try hard to be the best.;
, As they say, practice makes perfect! Stretch at home, using the apparatus from class, but practice over-splits on stacks of books or benches. Practice the moves your learning on a trampoline, but be careful! Try nothing any harder then a double back. Try dance moves from your floor routine at home. Everything counts.

, Balance your diet and watch portions. You don't want to be the most unhealthiest gymnast, now do you?

, Ask questions, because questions will let them know you understand, and that you want to know more. However, there is a fine line between curiosity and not paying attention. Try to be alert and attentive, and raise your voice at the end of your question to sound curious and knowledgeable. Avoid words like ""um"" ""uh"" and ""yeah"".

, Waiting in a gym can be hard, especially if a friend or somebody you know is there. Avoid talking while the coach is speaking, do not look bored, and pay attention! The person your talking to may tell on you by the classic, ""Excuse me, I didn't hear because 'so and so' was talking"".

, If you ever feel something is wrong with your body, tell a coach or parent. Injuries must be reported to your coach and parents. Work hard, stay determined, and never give up, even if you are not the best.

, You need to work on certain skills, but do not push yourself too hard! You do not want to hurt yourself, because if you hurt yourself too badly, you might end up never doing gymnastics again.

If applying lotion, use a fragrance-free, neutral lotion to stop the fresh skin underneath from cracking. By choosing a lotion without added ingredients, you have less likelihood of aggravating the skin and letting it heal faster.
When getting a rip, one very easy thing to do is to rub some black classic chap-stick on the rip. This will keep the rip from going dry and cracking.

, Finish by applying a Band-Aid or other adhesive plaster.

, If the rip feels as if it is producing a lot of heat and is throbbing or causing pain, try cooling it down by placing the rip into cool water. Or, wrap ice cubes in a face washer and hold this against the rip.


Only do this if you're resting. Having cold hands or wrists before returning to a workout or competition can cause more harm.

, A common solution to prevent or protect a wrist area rip is to use gym tape or pre-wrap wrapped around your wrists, finished off with tennis sweatbands; first aid pads can be stuck directly on a rip before adding the tape and sweatbands, then place any grips on top., Avoid using the bars and don't put strain on the rip!

, Dry off.

,, This is done as follows:


Get an old, clean sock that you don't care about anymore or a plastic bag with loose rubber bands.
Apply lotion or petroleum jelly on your hands. Alternatively, it might be preferable to rub an antibiotic ointment on the rip, to prevent infection.Put the sock or bag over your hand and leave it on overnight. In the morning, the rip usually has a thin layer of skin over it and is ready to be taped.

,, Do not wait for it to take a long time to heal; continued lack of healing is a sign that it needs medical intervention.

Bend your knees.,
Stay ""tight"" and keep your body upright.,
Keep your hips square.,
Bring your arms down to your thighs and bend your knees when landing jumps.,
Pinch the quarter in your shoulders.,
Find a spot to focus on.,
Stick your dismount.,
Chalk up your feet and hands properly.,
Practice the routine over and over.",How to Stick a Balance Beam Routine," Bending your knees slightly gives you a lower center of gravity. A lower center of gravity gives you a sturdier foundation and a better sense of balance.;
, Squeeze your muscles, but not so much that you cannot move. Make an effort to keep your (abdominal muscles) tight. If you are ""loose,"" you will lose your balance much more often.


Avoid doing the ""booty-tooch"". This is when you arch your back with bent knees. This posture sets you off-balance, as well as giving you, perhaps, a deduction.
Stay hollow. Being hollow in gymnastics means maintaining a completely straight back. Many gymnasts naturally arch, but you want to avoid this. To have good form, build your abdominal muscles. Assume a ""dish shape"" on the ground (also known as hollow holds).

, Avoid twisting your hips to the sides. Keep your hips perpendicular to the beam (when standing facing along the beam). Make sure you line up your hips with your shoulders.]

, Place them about halfway between your hips and your knees. Your hands should be on your legs just as you come down, with your arms straight, but not locked.

, Holding your arms back can help you stay balanced. Press them back as far as they will go and make sure you hold them up and back; not back and down. Hold this position when standing upright (for instance after you have landed a skill solidly) or in relevé (keep your arms above your head).

, When you look at something, it is easier for you to balance. Pick two spots (one at each end of the beam) and focus on those two spots throughout the entire routine. Some good spots to focus on are:


The end of the beam
The dismount mat
Any apparatus that is directly in front of the beam
Posters (encouragement!)
Avoid looking at people, as they can move.

, If you do a salto dismount, fully rotate before landing. Bend your legs to absorb the impact and avoid bouncing. Pause a moment to make sure you are completely balanced, then salute the judges.

, When you do beam, your feet and hands get sweaty. Chalk absorbs sweat, reducing the amount of sweat that can cause you to slip. If possible, step into a chalk bucket. If not, simply rub it on the balls and heels of your feet. There is no need to rub it on the arch, as your arch rarely touches the beam. Avoid too much, as it can make the beam more slippery.

, The easiest way to stick a routine is to a good base of have muscle memory.


Make sure to concentrate on completing each and every move to perfection, though, because if you ingrain a poor technique, it can be very hard for your muscles to 'forget' the bad habits. Ask a coach or spotter for feedback every now and then to help you stay on track.

Choose your lemon: A lemon for bathing should be light in color.,
Peel your lemon: It is best to have the largest pieces of peel possible.,
Wash your hair: Hold the lemon half with the peel side out.,
Condition your hair: Hold a large piece of peel in both hands.,
Wash your face and body: Using the same technique you used to wash your hair, wash your face with the peel-side of the lemon half.,
Rinse thoroughly: Make sure any lemon bits are removed.",How to Shower With a Lemon," Green spots are acceptable. Darker lemons tend to be mealy inside. Mealy is not good.;
, It is acceptable, if not preferable, to leave some of the white layer on the lemon Split the peeled lemon into two halves. Begin showering.

, Squeeze gently over your head to release some juice and begin rubbing the peel side of the lemon onto your hair. If you use the other side of the lemon you will get lemon bits in your hair. Make sure to cover the entire length of your hair.

, Rub the inside (white) of the peel onto your hair. Use both hands to treat long hair. Rinse after you have thoroughly applied the peel to your hair.

, After you wash your face use the remainder of both lemon halves to wash your body.

, Enjoy smooth feeling skin.

Rinse the bathtub if it hasn't been cleaned recently.,
Plug the drain and begin filling the tub with water.,
Adjust the temperature of the water so that it is no hotter than 100°F (38°C).,
Fill the tub until it is about 2/3 full, then turn off the water.,
Bring something cool to drink and a washcloth soaked in cold water if desired.,
Create a soothing environment.,
Add bubbles, salts, or essential oils.,
Use a facial mask or hair treatment.,
Give yourself a massage.,
Invest in a fluffy robe or towel, and have it ready post-bath.,
Keep your bath under 30 minutes.,
Skip the soap or save it for the end.,
Take a quick shower before or after your bath.,
Apply a moisturizer and pat your skin dry.,
Drain the tub and wipe it down with a clean rag.",How to Take a Bath," The ideal time to clean a tub is immediately following a bath, but if it's been a while, you want to make sure you won't be bathing with any dirt or mildew.Spray your tub with a mixture of 1/2 warm water and 1/2 white vinegar. Allow the solution to stand for 15 minutes, then wipe with a cloth or sponge. Rinse with clean water, then wipe again. Alternatively, you can use a purpose made bathroom cleaning product, wipes and sprays are available.;
, You may have to flip a lever near the faucet, or you may have a rubber stopper or bath plug that blocks the drain. If you're not sure if your plug is working, fill the bath with just a little water. The water level won't change if your plug is effective. If your plug is broken, missing, or ineffective, you can make a temporary stopper so you can still enjoy your bath:


Use a flat rubber jar gripper--the thing you use to help open stubborn lids--and lay it over the drain.
Wet a large hand towel and twist it, stuffing it into the drain. Just don't push it down too far.
Place an unused single-cup coffee pod in the open drain.
If it's a pop-up plug, get some plumber's putty and make a seal around the plug.

, While you may find a scalding bath relaxing, too-hot water actually agitates your nervous system and can cause a drop in your blood pressure. Your heart will start pumping harder, and you may feel dizzy or sick. On top of that, it can actually make it more difficult for you to relax and fall asleep after a hot bath.Use a thermometer if you want to ensure you don't run your bath too hot--this is especially important if you are pregnant.
Test the water with your wrist, not your hand. This will give you a more accurate sense of how the water will feel on the rest of your body., Remember that once you step into the tub, the water level will rise. If you fill it to the very top, water is going to spill over the sides and create a spillage and water could go everywhere.


Place a bath mat or towel on the floor to catch any water that might slosh out while you bathe or drip off your body when you get out. This will help prevent you from slipping and falling when you step out of the bath.

, As you soak in the warm water, your body will start to try cooling you down by sweating. You can quickly become dehydrated, so make sure you are replacing those fluids by drinking plenty of water. Applying a cold washcloth to your forehead can keep you from overheating.Drink lemon or cucumber water and skip the diuretics (like soda, coffee, alcohol, or caffeinated tea), as these will further dehydrate your body if liked. If you find you get a headache after a bath, drinking water and releasing heat by cooling your forehead, hands, or feet should help., If the purpose of your bath is to relax, then bright, overhead lights and the sounds of arguing neighbors shan't help you unwind. Dim the lights or light a few candles in the bathroom. Turn on calming music, like a classical station or some ambient noise, such as ocean waves or bird calls.If your bath has a curtain, draw it all the way or part-way to trap steam and heat. Just make sure the curtain is not in the bathtub with you.
If you have a heater in the bathroom, turn it on to make sure the temperature outside the bath water isn't jarringly cold. Running the bath with the bathroom door closed can also help create a warm environment. Ensure the heater doesn't get wet.
Don't use electronics in the tub. This can be dangerous (and potentially deadly). And while your phone or e-reader probably won't electrocute you if you drop it in the tub, it will be ruined.
Be careful if you use candles. They could fall over during your bath and burn something. Don't put unsecured candles near the tub.
Bring a magazine or book to read. Paperbacks are easier in the bath than heavy, hardback books.

, Personalize your bathing experience by adding fun bubbles or bath bombs; essential oils for aromatherapy and to keep skin moisturized; or things like Epsom salts, honey, or oatmeal to soothe or heal skin and muscles.


Add oils or other extras when the tub is halfway full to ensure they disperse evenly throughout the water.Use at least an entire cup of oil per bath to reap the moisturizing benefits., Now is a great time to really pamper yourself. Exfoliate your body with a sugar scrub. Apply a mud or face mask and lay slices of cucumber over your eyes to soothe and de-puff. Try an oil hair treatment and deep condition your hair.Try a hydrating mask if your skin is dry or you're worried about it drying out in the bath.
Use a clay mask for super smooth skin. These are great if you have large pores or oily skin
Tea tree oil can help treat dandruff and moisturize dry hair.
Try just a little Moroccan oil on your hair for silky, not oily, tresses.

, Bring a small ball into the bath and place it between your body and the tub. Move your body around on top of the ball to massage your back muscles. You can control the pressure by allowing your body to float up if it's too intense.Try a relaxing face massage, too.
Massage your temples with the tips of your fingers, using a circular motion. This can help relieve tension and reduce headaches.
If you have a cold, try massaging the bridge of your nose to open up your sinuses. Pinch the bridge of your nose and slide your fingers down toward your nostrils.

, You want your bliss to continue once you've stepped out of the bath, and nothing says luxury like a big, fluffy robe or a soft, plush towel.Keep your robe or towel in the bathroom with you so you can immediately swaddle yourself.

, There is some disagreement on the proper length of a bath, but it falls somewhere between 15-30 minutes. You run the risk of severely drying out your skin if you stay in too long. Wrinkled fingers is a good indication that you should start wrapping things up.If you do take an extra long bath, make sure you moisturize as soon as you step out of the bathtub.Bath salts can ease sore muscles, but quickly dry out skin. Keep your bath short if you're using salts., Hot water can dry your skin, but it's actually soapy water that can do the most damage. Soap can strip the natural oils from your skin, so you may want to use a body wash or gel instead. Otherwise, just wait until the end of your bath so you're not sitting in soapy water for at least another 15 minutes.Look for bubble bath that includes a hydrating oil, or add oil to your bubble bath to keep your skin from drying out.Use a superfatted soap, which contains a lot of oil and will moisturize your skin.,(optional) Again, there is a dispute over whether it's better to shower before or after bathing. Showering beforehand makes it easier to exfoliate and means you're already nice and clean when you soak.A post-bath shower will help you rinse off any oils, masks, and conditioner that may linger on your body., Wet skin acts like a sponge, so using moisturizer immediately after your bath means your skin will absorb as much as possible. Gently pat your skin with a towel and avoid harsh rubbing, which can irritate your skin and may wipe off your moisturizer.Try coconut oil, shea butter, or cocoa butter for ultra-moisturizing action. ""Butters"" and ""oils"" are far more intensive than ""lotions."", Taking a moment to wipe off oil and excess moisture will go a long way in preventing the build-up of soap scum, grime, and mildew.Give the tub a quick rinse with clean water, then use a clean, dry squeegee, microfiber cloth, or soft sponge to wipe it down."

Lie on your back.,
Lower your legs onto the bed.",How to Do a Log Roll1," Place yourself closer to the head of the bed than to the foot of the bed so that you'll be in the proper position when you lay down. Scoot back as far as you can so that you are not sitting on the edge of the bed.


To determine where you should sit, picture your bed divided into thirds. You should sit within the top 1/3 section of your bed.;
, Move very slowly and keep your body as steady as possible. It is important to keep your spine straight, so use your arms to help guide and control your body.


As you start to lean your body sideways, place your bottom elbow onto the bed underneath your shoulder. Then, place your top hand onto the bed in front of your chest.
As your body reaches the bed, lie on top of your bottom arm, and place your top arm at your side.

, As you're lowering your body onto the bed, bend your knees and pull your legs onto the bed. Keep your knees bent and your legs together as you pull them onto the bed.

, After you've pulled your legs onto the bed, you should end up lying on your side, facing the outside of the bed. Your knees should remain bent, one lying on top of the other.

, Keep you knees bent as you very slowly roll onto your back. Use your bottom arm to push your body onto your back. Be sure to keep your shoulders and hips together as a unit as you roll, so as not to twist your spine or torso. Picture your body as a rolling log.


Your shoulders, hips, and knees should stay aligned at all times. To be sure you're doing this, keep your knees and shoulders pointed in the same direction.

, At this point, you should be lying on your back with your knees bent and pointed toward the ceiling. Your shoulders and hips should be aligned., Slowly slide your legs down so that you are lying completely flat. Avoid any twisting or excessive movement one laying down.

Lie on your side.,
Lift your body to sitting position.,
Use your bottom arm for support.,
Lower your legs.,
Sit in place for a few minutes before standing up.",How to Do a Log Roll2," You should always lie flat on your back if you have an injury that requires stabilization, as keeping your back flat presents the smallest risk of re-injury. To get out of bed, you will start by bending your knees so that they are pointing toward the ceiling.


As you move, keep your knees and shoulders pointing in the same direction.

, Move slowly and be very careful as you do this to avoid further injury. Roll onto your side by turning toward the outside of your bed. Let your knees slowly fall to the side and use that momentum to turn your body. Be sure to keep your shoulders, hips, and knees facing the same direction. Keep your knees bent as you roll onto your side.


It is sometimes helpful to visualize your body as an actual log. This technique is called a log roll because your torso is supposed to move as one solid unit - just like a log would move.

, You should now be laying on your side, facing outward, with your knees bent. Your bottom arm should be underneath you, and your top arm should be at your side.

, Use your arms for support and move very slowly. Take your top hand and place it flatly on the bed in front of you at chest level. Begin to push your body up while keeping your back straight.

, As your body lifts from the bed, take your bottom hand and place it on the bed underneath your shoulder. You'll use this arm to push up for additional support.

, Keeping the spine stabilized and maintaining consistent motion is vital to a successful log roll, and a minimum of 4 people is needed to do that.

, The leader will be in charge of coordinating movement and maintaining the patient’s head and neck alignment.


The other helpers will take orders from the leader and perform tasks such as rolling the injured person onto their side, inserting a stretcher underneath them, or performing bandaging if necessary.

, The leader will be positioned at the head. The leader will place their hands on each side of the injured persons head, making sure their head is facing straight ahead. It is very important to keep their neck and head stable.


The other 3-4 helpers should be kneeling on one side of the injured person. Each helper will be in control of moving a different portion of the injured person's body, and the helpers should be spread out evenly.
One helper should be designated to slide a stretcher under the injured person as the rest of the helpers roll them on their side. This helper should be kneeling on the opposite side of the injured person's body.

, On the leaders command, the helpers will roll the injured person onto their side. Each helper must place one hand under the injured person's back, and reach their other arm across the top of the injured person's body to grab the side opposite side of them. The helpers will then roll the injured person toward them, so that the injured person ends up on their side.


As the helpers move the injured person, the leader must keep the head and neck aligned with the body. As the body turns, so should the head.

, Once the injured person has been rolled onto their side, the designated helper will slide the stretcher underneath them. The rest of the helpers will then roll the body back down onto the stretcher."

Replacement parts for your hot tub can be found at most pool and spa stores. In some cases, you may need to order parts from the tub manufacturer., When starting up your hot tub, use a clean filter. Open the tub’s filter access. Remove and dispose of the old filter. Replace this with the new filter. Verify the filter is securely installed, then close the filter access.Filter’s can be cleaned and reused. Soak dirty filters in a filter cleaner according to the cleaner’s directions, then replace the filter., Feed a garden hose into the filter well of your tub so air is pushed out of its pipes as it fills. Turn on the hose and wait until the tub fills to the appropriate level. Always fill your tub to the level indicated in its user manual and be sure to maintain this level. Low water levels can cause damage to your tub.


Take a moment at this point to look over your hot tub. If you see any leaks, turn off the water supply and tighten fixtures until the leaking stops or repair the leak., The amount of sanitizer you use will depend on the size of your tub. Check its user manual to find its volume in gallons or liters. Generally, most hot tubs use one of three kinds of sanitizing agent:


Powdered chlorine (dichlor). For every 500 gallons (1893 L) use 3 tsp (15 ml).
Powdered bromine. For every 500 gallons (1893 L) use 2½ oz (74 ml).
2-part Bromine, like Baqua Spa Sanitize #3. For every 500 gallons (1893 L) use 3 oz (89 ml)., Set the heater to “Off” or its lowest setting. Return power to your hot tub by switching its fuse to “On” in the fuse box or electrical panel. Turn on the hot tub at its control panel and then allow it to run for at least two hours.As the sanitizer flows through pipes and filters, it will neutralize bacteria in them and break up buildup.
When the jets of your tub discharge a steady, uninterrupted flow of water, the air from your lines has been purged., Turn off the tub and heater. Depending on your hot tub, the drainage process may vary slightly. Generally, you’ll need to remove a plug or open a drain valve. This will flush loosened buildup and sludge from your pipes and filter. Drain the water until little to none remains inside., Reinsert your hose into the filter well of your tub and turn on its water supply. Fill the tub to the proper level. Turn the tub on. When you are certain that water is flowing through your tub’s pipes, set the heater to at least 80°F (26.7°C).


It’s especially important that your tub reach at least 80°F when using granular chemicals. These may not dissolve properly in cooler temperature., When your tub is heated, use a hot tub testing kit to determine its pH and alkalinity. The pH should be between 7.6 and 8.2. Balance this with a pH adjusting agent, like pH Plus or Minus. Alkalinity should be between 100 and 120. Adjust this with a suitable agent, like Alkalinity Plus.Check and adjust the chemistry of your hot tub at least once or twice a week. Tubs that are used frequently should be checked more regularly.

, When the tub is filled and the chemicals balanced, turn on the tub at its control panel. Set the thermostat on the panel to your preferred temperature. Keep the tub covered while not in use to decrease its electrical cost.


Control panels are usually located near the tub, though some may be inside a protective housing, like a wooden box.
The control panel for most tubs includes a power switch, jet control, and a heater thermostat. Newer models may also have displays for error messages.
The heater should shut off when the water reaches the temperature on the thermostat. The time it takes for your tub to heat up will vary., Fill a bucket with a mixture made up of half white vinegar and half water. Stir the mixture to evenly distribute the vinegar and water. Dampen a clean cloth in the mixture and wipe water lines as they appear., Turn off your hot tub before doing filter maintenance. Open the filter access and remove the filter cartridge. Rinse it with fresh water every week to remove buildup. Filters should be soaked in a special filter cleaner at least once a month.


The more frequently you use your hot tub, the more frequently it’ll need its filter cleaned. Rinse high use tub filters twice a week; soak twice a month., If you use surface oil removers in your hot tub, like scum balls or scum bugs, these should be cleaned weekly. Remove the oil remover from the water and wring it out completely outside the tub. Rinse the oil remover with fresh water.Oil removers should be replaced regularly according to their usage instructions. Check the label or look up the product online to determine when you should replace your oil remover.

Reading about it is a good start, but at the end of the day, you need someone who knows what they're doing and can provide you a safe environment. Coaches don't just say, ""Okay, now do a backflip!"" You'll need to take classes to get started.


The most important thing to consider is the safety of your facility. Are there nice, padded walls? Are there wall spotters? What does the gym/school provide you with when it comes to gear?
In addition to those things, ask to talk to the coaches. Get a feel for their program. Ask whether they compete, the levels offered, how many hours per week are required, how much the class costs, whether it is a recreational class or a team (a team is much more intense), and what the teacher-to-student ratio is.;
, If you have a hard time physically getting up in the morning, that may be something your teacher should know before they enroll you in a specific program. On the opposite end, if you've been doing cartwheels and round-offs since you could crawl, that's something to take note of, too. Your program needs to be something you can handle but also challenges you — or you won't stick with it for very long!

, There are several different types of gymnasts, which focus on different equipment and different forms of fitness. You may want to try several before you choose one to specialize in:Artistic gymnastics is the most popular form. Women in this specialty train on the balance beam, vault, and uneven bars, and practice floor routines as well. Men train in floor routines, vault, parallel bars, high bar, still rings, and pommel horse.

Rhythmic gymnasts move and dance to music, using the ball, ribbon, rope, clubs, or hoop. Mostly women train in this form, but men compete in a few countries as well.
Aerobic gymnastics or sports aerobics focuses more on aerobic fitness than the other forms. Routines are performed on the floor without equipment, and do not involve balance skills or acrobatics.

, If there's one thing you can (and should!) do on your own time, it's work on your flexibility. You have no excuse! While you're sitting and watching TV, sit down on the floor, and start touching your toes in just about every position you can. Whatever you're doing, you can fit in a stretch.


It's not just your legs, it's your whole body. Even super fit people who start gymnastics often get caught off guard when it comes to this. What's the one area everyone forgets about? The back. Turns out your back and shoulders (and the flexibility of your back) is super important when it comes to gymnastics!
If the stretch causes pain, you've gone too far. Stretch gradually and only to the point of mild discomfort to avoid injury.

, Gymnasts may not have the biggest muscles, but they're extremely strong. Most amateur gymnasts train strength using their own body weight, for instance with pull ups and push ups. Weight training is best left for the college level or above, since it takes specific routines to avoid slowing yourself down with unnecessary muscle bulk.If you do begin weight training, your muscles will start enduring rips and tears and will need time to heal themselves. So be sure to take days off! You've deserved it. You can still do cardio and exercise, but lay off on the weights to give your muscles a breather.

, Gymnasts need to be fluid and graceful. Those floor routines are a combination of impressive tricks and dance. If you're choppy and can barely manage to do the macarena, a beautiful floor routine will be quite the challenge. Ask your coach if he knows of a good studio that works with gymnasts.

, As you progress, there's going to be things your coach wants you to do. The beauty of it is if you're not ready or if you'd like to take your skills in a different direction, say so. If you want to nail that backbend before you move onto the next move, say so. If you think you want to get into tumbling instead, say so. That's what they're there for!


It's important to be very open with your coaches. This sport challenges you to your physical limits, then throws you in front of a crowd to perform. If you don't feel ready physically or mentally, seek advice from your coaches.

, Bends are among the first moves learned by many gymnasts (in addition to the standard cartwheel and handstand). Bends are the core part of many of the more complicated, impressive tricks. Without a bend, you definitely won't be doing flips. If you're not there yet, wikiHow has some articles to whet your appetite:


How to Do a Bridge
How to Come up from a Back Bend
How to Do a Back Limber
How to Do a Back Walkover

, As you get better, you'll progress to jumps. When you combine jumps and bends, you get flips, so this is also moving you on up the skill ladder. Here are a few examples:


How to Do Gymnastics Jumps
How to Do a Chinese Split

, A beginning gymnast's dream: doing flips. This is where you'll really start to feel like you're making progress. Start doing them with a spotter and in your gym, and once you get comfortable you can start busting them out at parties and on the stage. All that hard work is paying off! Take a look at the following articles:


How to Do an Aerial Cartwheel
How to Do a Roundoff Back Handspring
How to Do a Backflip

, Once you learn the basic bends, jumps, and flips, you'll be able to combine them into sweet floor routines. You'll work on the speed of your transitions and, most importantly, your confidence. If you've gotten this far, you've more than earned it. Pat yourself on the back!

, You've got the skills, now what do you want your specialty to be? Do you want to try the uneven bars? Maybe the balance beam? How about the rings? Or even rhythmic gymnastics! There's going to be one that you enjoy more than the others — so get to finding it!


Maybe your niche is competing! Ask your coach if you can take this to the next level. She should be able to direct you to organizations and competition that will help you earn more recognition — not to mention trophies.

, Gymnasts are typically rated by skill level once they start competing. Find out how to qualify for higher level competitions from your national organization, such as Canada's CanGym or USA Gymnastics.


For example, the USAG Junior Olympics system sets competition standards for ten levels. Here's an example of what it takes to reach level six. If you would like to compete in college and beyond, aim for level nine or higher by the end of high school., Discipline is key in this sport. It takes time and repetition for your body to learn and remember the moves, so keep working until you get it right. If you get frustrated, sit down for a minute, get a drink, then go back and try again. It may not be easy, but once you get it, you'll know how worth it it really is.


Be sure to work on building your strength, including arm, shoulder, and back strength, your core muscles, and your leg muscles. Include pull-ups, push-ups, v-ups, crunches, handstands against a wall in your strength conditioning routine. It's not all flips and fun! And, as always, make sure to stretch first.

, Once you hit the appropriate level (your coach will know when this happens), you can enter the competing world. It may be harsh, it may be time consuming, but it also can be a lot of fun. However, don't feel obligated to compete -- gymnastics can be for leisure, too!


You can compete in your school, then in your area, then regionally, and then throughout the country if you so choose. Competitions can get pretty intense! There's always a panel of judges eyeing your every move and it can be quite stressful. If it's something you want to endure and excel at, go for it! But if it's not, feel free to keep getting better on your own time.

, There's not much evidence for the ""common knowledge"" that stretching prevents injury, and overdoing it could even lead to problems.That said, most gymnasts and sports doctors would likely agree that some stretching is beneficial for increasing your range of motion. Target the muscle groups most at risk for injury in the activity you'll be performing.Warming up and stretching are not the same thing. A warm up is any light exercise that gets your heart rate up and your muscles loose. Stretching increases flexibility. Consider a short warm up, four or five 60-second stretches, then a brief warm up again.

, When your coach says, ""Alright, who wants to demonstrate a backflip for me?"" and you raise your hand when you just mastered the somersault yesterday, that's not a good idea. You need to know your own skill level so you know what you're capable of and what to expect from yourself. If you bite off more than you can chew, you'll wind up in a cast watching yearningly from the sidelines.


On the opposite side of the coin, know what you are capable of! If you've been practicing for months and you're improving, you'll need to take a risk once in a while. Realize all the work you've done and what you can do. It's the only way you'll get better!

, Just like how they tell powerlifters to only lift 10% more weight than the session before (even if they feel like lifting more), you need to work up in small increments, too. You can't go from a cartwheel to a front handspring in a day. Rome wasn't built in one, and your skills won't magically develop in one, either. So take baby steps and, above all, be patient.


You will fail. Straight up. You will fall on your butt and you will bruise yourself. You will be, at one point or another, laying face down on the floor, willing the gods to make everyone disappear by the time you open your eyes. This happens. This happens to everyone. If you never fell, you'd never know what not to do!

, An aspect of gymnastics we haven't really gotten much at yet is how incredibly intense it is. Seriously. People who run marathons walk into a gymnastics class and they are quite literally (and figuratively) floored. What does this mean? It means, if you're to do this, you gotta be healthy. 24/7. Your body is what you're working with. If you don't treat it right, it sure won't be doing you any favors.


Always get a good night's rest. If you're tired, you will not perform at 100% of what you're capable of. Simply put. It'd be silly to expect otherwise of your body!
It's of utmost importance that you eat healthily. That means lean meats (you need your protein!), lean dairy, whole grains, and definitely loads of fruits and veggies. Little to no processed junk should be in your cupboards!

That being said, eating disorders are a huge problem in the gymnastics world. Yes, you need to be lean. Yes, it's easier to flip a smaller body. However, when you don't intake food, you lose your muscle. You become weak. It is impossible to support your own weight when your muscles are literally being eaten away. If or when this issue arises, know that you're not alone and that seeking professional help is a top priority. Remember that your mentors may have been there, too.



, This is especially important if you're working with the rings or the bars — your hands need protecting! And if you're experiencing any pain whatsoever, you'll need to wrap your joints. Always take precautions to prevent injury.

Once you have a good front limber, do a front walkover.",How to Do Forward Tumbling for Beginner Gymnastics," The first forward tumbling skill that a gymnast learns is a forward roll. To do a forward roll, you need to put your hands on the floor right in front of your toes, and tuck your head in keeping your chin on your chest and roll forward. You should put your hands down at the start and not to stand up and try to keep your knee's and feet together.;
,, The most common mistakes are putting your hands too far away from your feet to start, not tucking your head to keep your back round, using your hands to stand up and crossing feet or opening knee's to stand up.

, Also, try under your chin to keep it on your chest.

, For example, try a continuous forward roll, forward rolls that start and finish in different positions and so on.

, To do this, kick up to a handstand, then tip over further putting your chin on your chest and rounding your back so you roll out.


When you first learn this skill, you should get a coach to help you or do it down an incline or onto a soft mat.

,, This is when you kick up to a handstand, land in a bridge and then stand up.

, Do lots of bridges every day to increase your shoulder flexibility.

, First try this going up and down a wall with your hands, over a cylinder, with your coach spotting or up onto a raised surface

, Arch your back and let you feet fall into a bridge relatively close to your hands. Then rock your hips forward over your feet to stand up. Roll up from your hips, your head and arms should come up last.

, This is like a front limber but you go over one foot at a time. Make sure you land on a straight leg as you do this skill.

You should at least stretch your ankles, hamstrings, neck, and wrists.To stretch your ankles, sit down on the floor. Prop one ankle up on the other knee, and rotate it in a circle a few times. Do the same with the other ankle.Stretch your hamstrings by pulling one leg up behind you while standing. Try to tighten your butt muscles while doing it. Switch to the other leg.Rotate your wrists and neck to get them stretched out.;
, Run a couple of steps forward. On the last step, bring both feet together, and punch into the ground, pushing yourself into the air.You should land on the balls of your feet.As you push yourself into the air, lift your hands to your ears, so that you are keeping your core tight.You're not trying to flip right now. You're just practicing the jump.When you land, bend your knees slightly., Once you get the punch down, add in a knee lift. As you jump up, pull your knees up into the air.As you come back down, straighten back out.Bend your knees as you land., One safe way to practice these steps is on your trampoline in the back yard. You can go through each of the steps in this section on your backyard trampoline to get the feeling of the moves.When you start out on the trampoline, make sure you are tight. That is, keep your head steady and your body straight. You don't want your head and body flopping around, as that can lead to injuries.Start by getting a bounce going by jumping a little forward into a punch. Once you've got the punch down, try adding in the knee lift.

, Before doing a front flip, you want to make sure you're getting as much height as possible. Really punch off the ground when you're jumping. In addition, it's really best to work with someone if you've never done it before. Try a gymnastics or parkour gym to get some tips. In addition, you'll have access to things like spring floors at these gyms, making it a whole lot easier.


Realize that if you're trying to do gymnastics as an adult, the consequences can be more severe than when you're learning as a kid. That is, as a kid, you only weigh 40 or 50 pounds when starting out in gymnastics, plus you're a lot more flexible. As an adult, you weigh a lot more, and you don't bend as easily. Therefore, it's easier for you to get injured.You probably shouldn't try a front flip if you have back or knee issues, at least not without consulting a doctor first.

, You only need to run a few steps to get your momentum going. Four or five steps should do it, though you can do more to gain more height and power once you learn the basics.It's best to work in a gym that has a spring floor and spotters if you can.

, On the last step, leap forward, bringing your feet together so you land on both of them in a jump. In addition, you need to lean your torso slightly backwards, so that your momentum goes up rather than straight forward.As you're leaping into the jump, lift your arms. Your arms should end up by your ears as you're jumping, as that keeps your core muscles tight.Pushing your momentum upward gives your more height. In turn, that gives you longer to complete the flip.In addition, push your butt out as you lift off from the ground. This move can help you get your spin started., Until you tuck your head in, your head should be facing forward. The easiest way to maintain this position is to find a spot on the wall to stare at as you go into your front flip. Keep your eyes there until you begin your tuck., Your arms can help you get started on your rotation. As you punch into the air, your arms should go slightly back. When you move to start your tuck, throw your arms forward. That will help start your rotation., To push yourself into rotation, tuck your body in. Grab your shins just below your knees, tucking yourself into a ball, which continues your rotation.Make sure to grab your legs just below your knees in the little hollow there. That way, you pull your legs in without pushing your knee forward.You are also going to be throwing your upper body down towards the ground.Also, push your head down. Your chin should be at your chest so that you tuck tightly., When you tuck, it's tempting to hold on to your shins for an extended period. However, if you hold on for too long, you'll end up rotating too much. You might get lucky and do a double front flip, but you also might come crashing down without landing on your feet., To finish the front flip, you straighten out your body as you come around. Basically, you are un-tucking yourself from your flipping position.Try to shove your leg down towards the ground as you come around, rather than kicking outward, so you don't land on your butt.As you land, bend your knees so that they take some of the shock.In gymnastics, you generally finish with your arms up.

, You can stick the landing, meaning you don't move.You can also run a few steps forward after you flip, as a way to deal with the momentum.Finally, you can use the momentum to move into another tumble skill.To move into another skill, lunge forward on one leg as you come out of the flip.Basically, it's like continuing to run, but instead of taking steps, you use the momentum to go into your next move.Make sure your arms are up by your ears so you're ready for the next move., One way you can practice the running front flip is on a running trampoline. Most gymnastics gyms have these trampolines.To use a running trampoline, you simply run down the trampoline. Do a punch at the end, and then flip into the mats.If you don't have access to a running trampoline, you can still practice your front flip on your trampoline. Simply get started jumping, then treat a jump as a punch, meaning you rotate into your front flip. Extend as you come out the other side and keep jumping."

Sit with your back against the wall and legs straight in front of you.,
Get on all fours.,
Push your bottom in the air.,
Walk your feet a few feet up the wall.,
Continue walking up the wall until you're doing a handstand.",How to Do a Handstand on the Wall1," To start, you should get in the right position. Make sure you have a yoga mat or gym mat to work on in case you slip or fall. Place the mat before a wall and sit down.


Sit with your back pressed against the wall. Stretch your legs straight out in front of you and raise your arms above your head.You should form the shape of an ""L."" There should be a roughly 90 degree angle forming at your waist.;
, Once you've gotten into the above 90 degree angle, you'll need to get on all fours. You want to place your hands on the ground roughly where you heels were in the first position. This will allow you to guide yourself up the wall safely when performing a handstand.The soles of your feet should be pressed against the wall.Keep your arms straight and spread your fingers out.Pull your shoulders back, drawing them out as to broaden your collarbone., To shift into the headstand position, pull your bottom into the air while straightening your legs and arms. As you do so, tuck your toes onto the floor so your feet spread against the wall. This will look something like the downward dog position, if you're familiar with yoga., Now, you can begin shifting into the headstand position. Place one foot up the wall, curling your toes as you go. Lift your foot until it's about the height of your hips. When you feel balanced and secure, lift your other foot up until it's about hip height as well.Straighten your legs. This will push your bottom away from the wall, which may feel frightening. Try to stay calm as you go, remembering to breathe on occasion.Try to form a roughly 90 degree angle. It's similar to the position you started in, only reversed. Hold this until you feel comfortable and balanced enough to continue., Keep moving your feet up the wall. As you go, you'll have to move your hands closer to the wall for safety and balance. Keep going until your body forms a straight line parallel to the wall, with the tips of your toes touching the wall.You may have to stick to a 90 degree angle for your first few attempts.

Prep your shoulders.,
Practice with a headstand.",How to Do a Handstand on the Wall2," Before attempting to do a handstand, you should stretch your wrists. Your wrist undergo a lot of pressure during a handstand. If you do not warm up first, you could end up feeling sore afterwards.


Stand on your hands and knees, placing most of your weight on your knees. Hold your hands forward with your fingers touching the ground. Gently rock back and forth on your knees, alternating the weight you're placing on your fingers.Then, put your hands flat on the ground. Shift your body weight on your hands. Then, lift your palms up and down, raising your body with the motion. Do this about 10 times.After this, repeat the same basic motion but roll your palms back and forth as you lift. You want to shift weight between the different joints of your fingers. Do this 10 times, while rolling your palms., Your shoulders also carry a lot of weight during a handstand. You want to make sure you warm them up properly before attempting a handstand. Once again, get on all fours with your fingers spread slightly apart.


Going slowly, rotate both your elbows. Try to move your elbow as much as possible, moving it from the back of your body to the front. Keep your arms straight as you go.Move your hands so your fingers are pointing out to the side of your body. Push your body back and forth, shifting your weight from one hand to the other. Keep the heel of your hand on the ground. Make sure the heel holds most of your weight.Shift your fingers so they're facing your knees. Keep the heel of your hand on the ground. Shift your weight up and down, keeping your arms straight. Repeat about 15 times., Handstands can be intimidating because being upside down is uncomfortable. Before doing a handstand, try practicing with a headstand.


Sit in front of a sturdy wall. Place your hands on the ground, about shoulder width apart. Place your head on the ground in front of your hands, forming a triangle.Kick one leg forward and then the other, transferring your weight onto your hands, head, and shoulders.

Move up slowly.,
Use a mat.,
Have a friend spot you.",How to Do a Handstand on the Wall3," If you've never done a handstand before, you need to work your way up to the routine. Do not attempt a full handstand right away. Spend a few weeks practicing headstands and forming 90 degree angles against the wall. This will get you used to the feeling of being upside down. It will also help you build the muscles necessary to do a full handstand.


You might also want to strengthen your arms. Try lifting weights or doing push ups a couple of times a week to build up your muscles.

, You should not be practicing handstands without a mat underneath you. In the event you do lose your balance and fall, a mat can help prevent injury. It may be a good idea to practice in a gym at first. There should be mats in place.

, You should not start off doing handstands completely alone. A friend can help hold your legs to help you find your balance. He or she can also help catch you in the event you lose your balance. When you first start doing handstands, do so with the assistance of a friend.

Come out of your back handstand.",How to Do a Back Handstand," Flexibility in these joints is crucial for your back handstand. You can do these stretches every day, and always do them before practicing your handstand.


To stretch your wrists, sit on the floor and place your palm flat on the ground at a 90-degree angle to your arms. Gently bend your elbows and feel the stretch through your inner wrist. Then cross your arms in front of you, putting your hands on the ground with your fingertips pointing towards each other.
To stretch your ankles, make several circles with your foot (moving from the ankle joint) clockwise and counterclockwise. If you like, you can sit on the ground and do this – extend one leg in front of you, cross the other over it and hold your foot in your hand to gently increase the intensity of the stretch.;
, The bridge is a fundamental pose for practicing handstands. Not only does it help stretch out your shoulders, it is also your beginning pose for the back handstand.Lay down on your back with your feet flat on the floor, knees bent. Your feet should be touching your bottom.

Push your weight onto your hands so that your shoulders are over your hands in a vertical line.
Walk your feet out in front of you so your legs are straight, keeping them parallel.
Rock the bridge back and forth. Bend your knees, shifting the weight onto your feet, then back onto your hands by straightening your legs. This helps to stretch out your shoulders.
Come out of the bridge by bending your elbows and knees, gentling lowering your back to the floor. , To execute a perfect back handstand, you need strong central muscles. These include your abdomen, pelvis, lower back and hips. The bridge is an excellent exercise for this, so practice every day.In addition, many basic exercises involve core strength, such as weight-lifting, sit-ups and push-ups. Systems like Pilates or yoga also have many exercises to help develop strong core muscles.

, Headstands are basic, stable inversions that allow you to work on things like strength, balance and form.


Start on a yoga mat on your hands and knees.
Lower your elbows to the floor.
Make a semicircle with your hands by interlacing your fingers and tucking your lower pinky under the other so the outsides of your hands rest flat on the floor.
Lower the crown of your head to the floor so the back of your head is cradled against your palms.
Straighten both legs and walk your feet towards your face as much as possible.
As you do that, shift your hips so they are vertically aligned over your shoulders.
Lift your right leg up into the air, and then the left leg.You can practice this against a wall to begin with, and then gradually move away from it as you feel more secure.

, Before you can do a back handstand, you need to be able to do a handstand. Starting against a wall helps you perfect your form as you gradually get comfortable with the pose.


Place your hands on the floor just in front of the wall. They should be about shoulder-width apart, with fingers spread out.
Kick your legs up to the wall.
Move the top of your head to touch the wall so it's pressing against it and your face is parallel to the ground.
Move your legs away from the wall.
Make sure your shoulders and hips are vertically stacked. This is the proper alignment.
Hold the position as long as you can to help build muscle strength., Now you're ready to do a freestanding handstand. If this is scary, ask a friend to spot you as you get the hang of how far to kick. Visualize making a vertical line with your toes, hips and shoulders.


Place hands on the ground in front of you, shoulder-width apart.

Start arching backwards at the waist, pushing your hips forward and keeping your arms extended beside your ears.Land into the bridge, palms flat on the ground with fingers pointing towards your toes.As you get more advanced, you can bring your feet together.
Have a spotter hold their arm behind your lower back if you need a little more security.
Come out of the bridge position by lowering your back slowly onto the ground.

, This helps you get ready for your back handstand. Follow the steps described above. When you're warmed up and ready, follow the next steps for your handstand.

, The back handstand essentially starts with a bridge from standing position, but with the difference that here you kick your legs up into the air for a handstand.

Finished.

",How to Do a Handstand and Stay Up," If you bend your elbows, you will collapse onto the floor - but if you lock your elbows, you will hold your weight on your hands almost effortlessly.;
, Before you try a handstand, try high kicks. Place your hands about shoulder length apart on the floor in front of you. Lean upon your hands so that a majority of your weight is positioned onto the floor through your hands. Practice kicking one leg at a time up into the air, just to get the feeling of lifting onto your hands. You do not want to go vertical - just kick your legs off the ground one at a time and return to your original position.

, Getting everything right is important, you will fall right back down if your form is not perfect.

, A good way to figure this out is to do a cartwheel and see which foot you put in front.

,, You should be able to draw a straight line from your hands to your non-dominant foot. Once your hands hit the ground, push off your dominant foot and bring it up to your non-dominant foot which should be straight in the air at this point.

,, If you are trying to look forward, you will lose your balance, it is best to look at your hand to create a center of balance.

,,, When falling backwards, arch your back and try to land in a bridge position. When falling forward, try to land on your feet.

, If you have a short shirt be sure to tuck it into your pants. You don't want your stomach to show.

, It may take you a few minutes or a few hours. But if you keep practicing you'll get it. Remember that you have to do it slowly or else you will collapse.

If you prefer, you can start in a standing position with your feet hip-width apart and hands placed slightly in front of you and shoulder-width apart. This sets up your body to move into the press., Shift your weight into your hands by pressing down on them. Begin to lean forward, with your hands facing forward and palms down. Hold your arms straight as your feet begin to lift off of the floor. Keep your core engaged to maintain stability.Spread your hands as far as possible. This creates a wider base and can provide more stability to your handstand., Continue to lean forward and press through your hands until your feet are entirely off of the floor. Check your body position: your hips should be directly above your shoulders, forming a straight line.Keep your shoulders from bunching up, which focuses the weight on your deltoid muscles. Instead, engage your abs and use your trapezius and scapular muscles in the middle of your back. This allows you to more easily stack your shoulders and hips.

, Lean forward on your hands so that your shoulders are slightly ahead of your hips. This allows you to better lift your legs.Engage your thigh muscles and core to lift your legs upward into a vertical position. Your legs, hips, and shoulders should now be in one line.As your legs rise, they will naturally move your shoulders back into alignment with your hips., Hold the handstand for as long as you can. Start slowly, such as with five seconds, and gradually build up the time you can keep your body in perfect handstand alignment., Keep your abs engaged as you pike and then lower your legs back towards the floor. Place your feet on the floor and stand up if you started in a standing position. If you pressed up from seated position, bend your arms to bring yourself back down to a seated straddle.

, A straddle press handstand requires strength, balance, flexibility and proper body positioning. Develop each movement until it becomes easy to perform before moving on to the next piece of your handstand. This can ensure that you maintain proper form while doing your handstand and may minimize your risk of injury., Sit on the floor with your sitting bones firmly grounded. Engage your thigh muscles and raise your legs up off the floor either straight or slightly bent in front of you. Stretch your arms out in front of you (and smile!) as you hold yourself in boat for at least five seconds. Navasana, or boat pose, can strengthen your core, inner thigh muscles, hamstrings, arms and shoulders.Avoid rounding your back, which prevents your core muscles from working.

, An exercise similar to navasana is V-Ups, which are slightly more difficult to perform. Lie with your back flat to the ground. Squeeze your thigh muscles and engage your abs. Using your strength and not momentum, lift your legs and torso off the ground into a V-position. Complete the repetition by lowering your torso and legs to the ground.Touch your hands to your feet for an extra challenge.

, Get into a straight body plank position, keeping your hands over your wrists. Engage your core and bum as you bend your arms and lower to just above the floor. Then, raise yourself back up into the plank position. This can build overall body strength that you need to do press handstands.Start with your knees down if you don’t have enough strength to do a push-up from the plank position. Build up your strength with half-plank pushups until you can properly perform full-plank pushups.

, Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart. Put a kettlebell between your legs and in line with your ankles. Keep your back straight and look forward as you bend from the hips and reach down to pick up the kettlebell. Press up through your legs so that the kettlebell is in front of you and then lower it back down. Keep your arms straight through the entire movement. This can build the hip strength necessary to pull yourself up into a handstand.Keep your back straight to minimize the risk of injury and focus the exercise on your hip muscles.

, Stand facing a wall and place your hands on the floor 4 to 12 inches from it. Lean your shoulders against the wall and straddle your legs up into a supported handstand. Then lower your legs back down to the floor. This can help you isolate your hip, stomach, and leg muscles, which will further develop your strength.Repeat this movement as quickly and as many times as you can. It also helps your body get used to the proper movements for a straddle handstand.

, Using a wall, spotter, or your strength, shift from a standing or seated straddle to a pike handstand. This means your legs are parallel to the floor and you’re making a rough “7” shape. This can strengthen your hips, core and back muscles as you work on pressing up your legs to a handstand.


It also shows you how to stack your hips and gently shift your shoulders forward so that you don’t fall out of your pike or handstand."

Build up your core strength.",How to Hold a Handstand," The first thing to do if you want to be able to hold your handstand is to use proper technique when you get into the handstand position. If you don’t start off with a strong foundation, it will be difficult to hold your handstand for very long. Here’s what you’ll have to do:


Stand up straight with your arms up over your head, as if they are glued to your ears.
Stand with your feet shoulder width apart.
Step forward with your dominant leg. Think of this as being halfway in the lunge position.
Tip your body forward while keeping your back straight. Your non-dominant leg should go up first.
Plant your hands down on the ground, shoulder width apart.
Lift your dominant leg all the way up to meet your non-dominant leg.
Straighten your legs and keep your back and body straight.;
, One way to hold your handstand longer is to make sure that you kick all the way up with your non-dominant foot when you begin the handstand. Most people think that they’re kicking up all the way when they go into the handstand, when in fact, they’re only going up about 80-85% percent of the way. This is because they get scared that they’re going to fall forward. However, if you aim to kick all the way up so that your body is straight, or even so that your feet are kicked up over your body a bit, it’ll be much easier to stay straight or to adjust your body a bit than if you did not kick up enough.


Have someone film you doing a handstand or just watch you do it to tell you if you’re really kicking up as much as you can.
You can also practice doing a handstand about a foot in front of a wall, so that the worst thing that will happen if you kick up too much is that you touch the wall with the tips of your feet. This will also give you a better sense of how far up you can really kick.

, You may think that all of the power lies in your wrists, when in fact, what’s most important is that you press into your palms and the pads of your fingers to gain your strength, almost as if you’re pushing the floor away while gripping it at the same time.


If you put all the pressure in your wrists, then you’re likely to injure yourself while also making it much more difficult for yourself to stay balanced. If you put too much pressure in your wrists, then you will lose your balance and fall back on your feet.

, The trick to holding a handstand isn’t staying perfectly still once you get your body up there, but in knowing how to use your body to adjust in small ways to keep your balance. One way you can hold your handstand is to counteract the way your body is moving with your hands. If your legs are falling forward, over your head, then you can press into your fingertips a bit more to help move your body back to center. If you feel yourself falling down to the standing position, then you can press a bit more into the bottom of your palms to adjust your body to be straight again.


You can also even walk on your hands slightly to counteract the direction your body is falling. If your legs are falling over your head, you can walk your hands forward slightly; if your body is falling backward, then you can move your hands back down a bit.
If you feel your body listing to the side, move your hands over to that side. Use your hands to balance the direction of your body, and you’ll be able to hold the handstand for longer.

, Another thing you want to avoid is arching your back. Not only can this cause injury, but it can lead you to fall forward, because arching your back will make your legs move over your head. Instead, focus on keeping the part of your body from your shoulders to your waist straight. You may not think you’re arching your back when you really are, so you can ask a friend or a spotter to check for you.

, Keeping your toes pointed will keep your body balanced and will keep your feet fully in line with your back and body. If your feet are flexed, it’ll be harder to control them, and they’ll be more likely to fall over your head a bit. Instead, focus on keeping nice, pointed toes from the moment you get up into the handstand until the second you come down.

, Another thing you can do to hold your handstand is to squeeze the muscles in your butt, so that your butt is flexed while you do the handstand. This will keep your strength centered and will make it easier for you to maintain control over your handstand. You can practice doing this when you’re standing up, first, to get the hang of it before you go into a full-on handstand.


If you’ve forgotten to squeeze your butt, you can do it once you’re in your handstand and feel yourself losing balance.

, Another thing you can do to hold your handstand is to make sure to squeeze your legs together. Ideally, there should be no or very little space between your legs, and they should be parallel to each other. Keeping your legs together can keep you from letting one leg fall over or fall down, leading you to lose your balance.


However, you can also keep your balance by putting your legs into the splits — but that should be purposeful.

, A lot of people freeze up when they go into the handstand position, because they get nervous or want to hold their concentration. When this happens, many people forget to breathe and just let out all of their oxygen. Well, if you don’t do this, you won’t stay up there for long, and you’ll be making it much more likely for yourself to get dizzy. Make sure to take nice deep breaths, in and out, using your diaphragm, and focusing on breathing just as much as as you focus on keeping your body straight.


If you breathe purposefully, you’ll feel in control of your body, and you’ll feel like holding a handstand is much more manageable. In yoga, for example, purposeful breathing is the key to any pose, especially the handstand.

, You should check to make sure that your arms are locked by your ears. If they’re too far apart, not parallel, or even too far above or below your ears, then it’ll be hard to hold your handstand for very long. The next time you do a handstand, check to make sure that your hands have the proper form. This can help you maintain your handstand for longer.

, Another thing you should do if you want to hold your handstand is to make sure that you’ve kept your shoulders over your hands. Having your shoulders over your hands can help you maintain your balance, and ensure that your body is pretty much in a straight line, from your arms all the way down to your legs. Most people tend to place their hands a little bit above their shoulders when they do a handstand, so you should be vigilant about keeping them in line.

, Some people think its harder to stay up if they keep their legs together and instead prefer to put their legs in the split position in order to maintain their balance. If you have one leg over your head and one leg behind it, it can be easier for you to shift your balance by moving one leg slightly down or the other leg slightly up to keep your body even. Sometimes holding a handstand with both feet together can be a bit of a challenge because both of your legs feel “stuck” together, and they tend to fall or stay up as a unit, which can make it harder to control your balance.

, Another thing you can do to practice holding your handstand is to do it against a wall. Leave about half a foot to a foot of space between you and the wall, and kick fully up into your handstand, so that you know you have some support if you fall over. If your legs fall forward too much and touch the wall, just gently push them away from it again.


This can help you gain confidence in holding your handstand and can show you that nothing bad will happen if you fall out of it.
Practicing against a wall can also be more efficient because you don’t have to start from scratch every time you fall over; if your feet touch the wall, you can just lightly kick them back up over your head instead of falling down.

, Crouch down next to a wall, facing away from the wall. Walk your hands forwards as far as you can reach. walk your feet up the wall as high as they can go. Walk your hands up closer to the wall. Walk your feet up again. Hold this for as long as you can. It will improve your arm strength and your abs.

, If you’re a gymnast, then you should already be familiar with the balance beam. You don’t have to practice a handstand on the balance beam to improve your balance. In fact, just walking on the balance beam, standing on one leg at a time, pivoting, or even doing a cartwheel on it, or a round-off off of it, can get you more in touch with your balance, and can help you see how to move your body to stabilize your position.


Just spending an hour a week on a balance beam can really work wonders on your balance, whether you’re a gymnast or not. If you’re not a gymnast, then you can practice balancing on a narrow surface, such as a concrete bench, as long as you have enough room to move safely.

, You may have a hard time holding a handstand simply because you lack arm strength. Your biceps, triceps, and forearms are crucial for holding up your body weight and helping you maintain a strong handstand. If you want to build up your arm strength, you can try a number of exercises in order to make them strong. Here are a few exercises you can try:


Holding a handstand against a wall for 10 seconds, for 5 repetitions at a time.
Holding a handstand against a wall and doing shoulder touches. Hold your handstand, and then lift up one arm quickly and touch the shoulder on the same side of your body with it. Then, repeat this with your other hand. Do this about 10 times on each side for 2 repetitions.
The plank position. The plank position is a yoga pose and is the starting position for the push-up. Get on the ground and push up through your palms, so that your back and legs remain straight, and hold the position for at least 10 seconds. Repeat this 3 times or transition into doing 2 sets of 5 push-ups.

, Your core, or your abs, is essential to holding a handstand, as well as maintaining any balancing pose. If you want to be able to hold a handstand, you can work on strengthening your core so you have a more solid foundation to work with. You can work on doing a daily arm and core workout to get stronger for your handstands. Here are some exercises you can try to build up your core:


The basic sit-up. Simply lie on your back, raise your knees, cross your arms over your chest, and reach up toward your knees, and then back down to your back. Do 2 sets of 20.
The banana. For this exercise, you can lie on your back, lifting your hands up over your head and raising them a few inches off the ground while doing the same with your feet, until your body is in a “banana” shape. Hold this position for 10 seconds and repeat this exercise once.
The bicycle. Get on the floor with your hands behind your head and neck, and “cycle” your legs up in the air. Raise your elbow to the opposite knee as it moves toward your head, and repeat with the other elbow. Do the bicycle for 30 seconds at a time.

Touch your toes, and hold the position for thirty seconds. Repeat three times.
Do three sets of ten jumping jacks.
Jog around the block (about half a mile).;
, You want the ground to be lightly padded, since you're sure to fall over a couple of times. Outdoors, look for a grassy flat spot, and be sure to check for rocks and sticks. Indoors, a padded gym floor or carpeted room both work well., When you're learning how to do a handstand and walk on your hands, it helps to have someone nearby who can hold your legs in position until you get a feel for how to balance on your hands. Ask a friend to stand next to you while you practice.They should gently hold your legs straight once they're above your head.
After practicing for awhile, you won't need as much help from your spotter. Ask them to stand back unless you're about to fall over.

, Stand up straight with your feet in a comfortable, balanced stance. Hold your arms by your ears, making sure to squeeze tight. Take a large enough step into a lunge.

, Do a handstand first going into it with your left leg, than your right leg. Whichever leg feels more comfortable for going into it, is your dominant leg. (At least for handstands.) Step straight forward, rather than off to the side, so you can maintain proper balance when you're upright.

, As you step, your body should tip over like a see-saw toward the ground in one fluid motion. Do not make the mistake of throwing your hands straight down and trying to throw your legs upward, which can cause you to fall forward.









Keep your arms straight. Bending your elbows can result in injury.
Keep your shoulders tucked in toward your neck, like you're shrugging.

, As part of the same fluid motion, use the momentum of your forward tilt to swing your legs up and straighten your body. Keep your back and legs straight, and don't throw your head back. This can cause you to arch your back and injure yourself.









Make sure your spotter is close by when you're swinging your legs toward the sky. This is the moment when you are most likely to fall.
Keep your legs straight and pressed together. This will help prevent you from falling to the side.
Your weight should balance toward your fingers, rather than your wrists.

, Before you start walking on your hands, you need to learn how to balance in place and gain control over your movements. Keep practicing your handstand until you're able to easily move into position and hold it for at least twenty seconds before rolling out.









If you're having trouble getting the hang of it, try walking yourself up a sturdy wall.Get into a plank position with your feet toward the wall. Walk your feet up the wall and move your hands toward the wall until you're upright on your hands, using the wall as a brace. Try gently pushing off the wall so that your body is hand-standing without the wall. Eventually you'll need to get to the point where you can move into a handstand without using the wall.
When you want to exit a handstand, roll out by bending your arms and tucking into a forward roll, or somersault. You can also simply drop your feet back and do a bridge, if you're flexible enough.

, A park, garden, or gym mat would work well for this exercise. Be sure to allow yourself enough space to perform the move; you need more room than you would for a simple handstand. It can help to have a sturdy wall nearby you can practice walking next to.

, This person’s job will be to stand a safe distance in front of you to catch and then hold your calves while you're in a handstand and learning to walk on your hands. They can also stand behind you, ready to catch your legs if you start to fall.

, As you practiced, take a step, tip over at the waist, plant your hands on the ground and move your legs toward the sky in one fluid motion. Point your legs and torso upward and balance on your hands for a few moments.








, Keep your legs straight up and balance yourself. Hold your legs together for balance and steadiness. Once you’re feeling comfortable, allow your spotter to let go. You may have to stumble around on your hands to keep balance, but that's the first step toward learning to walk.

, Move one hand forward, leaning slightly in the direction you want to go. You’ve now taken your first hand-step. Move the other hand forward, leaning slightly in the direction you want to go. Little steps are easiest if you are just learning.









Do not try to move too quickly, or take big steps. It will be very easy to lose your balance when you're first learning to walk on your hands.
Try to move in one single direction, rather than placing your hands wherever they land. Practice controlling where you go.

, As you start moving around, you'll need to constantly adjust your legs and torso to stay balanced. If you start to tip back in the direction of your stomach, move your legs more over your head. If you move them too far over your head and start tipping over, adjust them again.








Upper body strength also plays a role; it helps to quickly readjust your hands to help you regain your balance. If you feel your legs fall back down slightly, use the palm of your hands to move your weight onto your fingertips slightly. If you feel your legs start tipping past your head, use your fingertips to push against the ground as if you were trying to grab a large chunk of dirt.
The goal is to find your sweet spot, which means to center your body's weight as directly over your hands as possible. You'll get better at finding this spot with practice.

, Take small steps with your hands for about twenty seconds, then pause for twenty seconds before moving again. This will help you practice having greater control over your body's movements. Eventually, you will be able to take bigger steps with greater confidence.








If you start going too fast, take bigger steps to slow down and regain control.
Try the technique of taking steps in the direction that you are falling. Try to keep your hands directly under your feet at all times. When trying to walk forwards, tilt your body forwards slightly and then move your hands to be underneath your body, and repeat.
Make sure to tighten your abs and look at your hands; this will help you stay balanced.

, Bend your arms, tuck in your head and do a somersault. Alternatively, bend your legs back down from the waist and plant your feet on the ground. If you are falling as though you are going to land on your back, you can also bend over into a bridge and slowly let yourself down.

Show up to classes on time.",How to Be a Good Gymnast," If you are in high school, sign up for your school's gymnastics team. If you are younger you would have to join classes. If you are more advanced, you may be able to join a competitive gymnastics team.;
, Arrange a good schedule, and make sure you leave a good amount of time to get to your class.

, Not just vault, floor, beam, bars. Also, work hard in the conditioning and stretching. But don't go too far, especially with the stretching.

, If you are in a group like most gymnasts, asks for tips that are most important to you. But if you have a private instructor/coach, ask them help for all skills, learn to deal with criticism, because most coaches don't mean to insult you.


Use the tips. Unless your coach is just a friend's parent, or a P.E. teacher, you should trust their tips. Coaches at gymnastics gyms, are qualified, and most competitive ones, have been through the 10 levels of gymnastics some are even elite gymnasts.

, Think that you can do a skill, that you are afraid to. Try to be positive at every single practice!

, Maybe it's something like getting better at double backs, or something like getting your leg higher in a scorpion. What ever it is, if you have a goal in mind, it makes it easier to achieve it.

, Usually some people practice gymnastics for even four or five hours everyday, without their lessons. Typical gymnasts usually train for three to four hours, three times every week. If you wish to be a competitive gymnast the training hours will increase prior to an event. You must make sure that you are ready to commit to many training sessions that may affect your daily routine.

, If you don't have a lot of energy, exercise 2-3 days a week or on the days that you don't have gymnastics. If you feel stronger, do 6-7 days a week.


Give yourself time to rest and heal when you need it. Remember that if you are sick, skip this routine for about at least a week, unless it's just a cold.

, Warm up with exercises like running 1/2 a mile, or just a few laps, jumping jacks, high knees and butt kickers, or lunges. Practice stretching and warming up at home before you begin. Your coach will usually pick up on who is the best at stretching out beforehand, and gain their respect. Take part in all coach-led exercises to show that you are committed to gymnastics.

, Do different kinds of pushups like basic pushups, fist pushups, pushups with your elbows pointed inwards, knee pushups when you are tired, pushups with your legs higher, handstand pushups, and wall pushups if you are a beginner. You can even add 1-5 pound wrist weights to your pushups. Also try plank holds.

, Jumps, candlestick-jumps, lunges again, v-hold, arch-hold, tuck ups/v ups, and/or candlestick holds could help. There are many healthy variations.

, Try burpees, frog jumps, and basically all exercise where you go to the ground and get back up then jump.

, Do curl/sit ups, and wall sits.

, The only way to work towards mastering all your skills is to try, and practice, and try again. In every new skill you learn, you have to attempt it, so set goals to what skills you want to attempt at each practice.

, Check it off when you think you got the skill down. Example:


back handspring ()
front tuck ()
split jump ()

, If you try your best and practice this all the time, you'll be a dedicated gymnast in no time! If you want to be a good gymnast, you need to commit to the sport. Sometimes you have to realize that you can't always hang out with your friends.

, This is very important. Always have a healthy diet. This does not mean to stop eating, it means to eat less unhealthy junk food. Make sure that you eat a small energy snack before a long training session, otherwise you will find yourself running out of energy before the end of training.

, At your lessons, be kind to your fellow gymnasts. Being kind to others will also make you a better gymnast and person. Do not argue with your coaches. You should respect your coach's position.

, It's just something to improve on, a little tiny thing that you could work on to improve your gymnastics skills. Over-reacting will just make people think negatively of you. Take all points of criticism and use them to improve.

, Showing up on time will help your coach know that you're reliable and that in future tournaments you'll definitely be there to compete. Also, remember your leotard and other equipment. This will prove that you are a commited and serious student

, It is important that your muscles are warmed up, or injury becomes more likely. Jog for five minutes or do an active, or a fast walk for ten minutes will be adequate. Remember to keep yourself hydrated - bring a bottle of water with you.


Consider doing warming up exercises after taking a hot shower or bath because this makes your legs warmer.;
, The following non-stretch warm-up activities can really get you prepared for stretching:


20 jumping jacks.






20 cross jacks.






5 minutes jogging.






A light aerobic warm up.







, Reach over your legs towards your toes. Keep your back straight. Try to bring your chest closer to your legs. If this is difficult, try bending your right leg a little, and then switch. It may hurt, but try to touch your head to your knees for 15 seconds. The more you do this the better stretch you have. 

, One leg should be straight ahead and the other to the side. Stretch forward to your right leg with your back straight and hold the position for 30 seconds or more. Repeat to the opposite side, with your left leg straight.

, Keep your legs in the 90 degrees position, and lean and stretch your body forward between your legs with a straight back. Hold the pose for 30 seconds or more.

, Flex the feet and try to reach past your toes. Make sure the crown of the head is tucked in between your legs as far as you can, and this should benefit the back too, as well as all the way down the legs. Now, touch your toes and bend your elbows this will stretch you more.

, Reach towards the leg which is facing outwards. Then switch legs and do it again

, Reach towards each leg and towards the middle.

,, For a bigger stretch, keep your back straight.

, This time, pull your back leg towards your bottom, with your hand.

, This time, flex your front foot and hold for 30-60 seconds.

, Stand in a lunge position. Lift the back knee off the floor and let gravity pull your hips down. Do not bounce, as bouncing can cause tiny tears in the muscles.


Bending your back leg, straighten the front leg and lower your forehead towards your knee. This is a great stretch for the hamstring; be sure to repeat on the other leg.







, Your bottom should be fairly close to a wall and your legs up and against the wall.

, Gravity and the weight of your legs will help to push them down. Hold for 1 minute.

, Bend your front leg and have your back leg straight out the back. Repeat on the opposite leg. You will be getting closer and eventually you may be past that point.

, underneath your pelvis area whilst in a lunge. Slowly lower yourself into the front splits position, and keeping both legs straight if you can, sit yourself on the pile making sure that your hips are square to the front and your back knee is facing downwards towards the floor. Stay in this position with the stack underneath your legs and stay here for a minute or so.


Keep your hips square. Open splits are bad for the body in the long term.
Make sure your back knee is on the ground and your front knee is facing the ceiling. Also, try to get your pinkie toe to touch the ground on your back leg this will help keep your splits square

, Taking a cushion or pillow away at a time, lower yourself into the splits as far as you can go. Stay there for no longer than 30 seconds.

,, Learn to stretch past the split line where this is required for advanced dancers, gymnasts, and cheerleaders. It should only be worked on if you can already do the splits well and ideally should only be done under the supervision of a coach or experienced spotter.

, Gradually increase the height at which either leg--or both legs--are positioned on the pillow. This is called over-splitting and will stretch you past the splits. Never bounce to get there, as that can tear or strain your muscles.

, You want to perfect those splits, don't you? And once you're finally down, it's not over yet, you must perfect your splits kicks. Try going into over-splits by lifting one of your legs up and propping it on a high book or some piled books.

, Muscle for tumbling and bars doesn't build itself. To get stronger you should do push-ups, gymnastics crunches, lift weights, hold certain positions for longer. Do what they teach you at your classes.

, Once you get to competition, what good is it if you don't know what your scores mean? You should really read up on it and get to know your sport, the basics, tips, even observe how top elite gymnasts work. You don't need to work for as long as them, but certainly do some of the conditioning things they do.

Try focusing, primarily, on the muscles in your lower body.Improved flexibility in the hips, quads and hamstrings is the primary goal, as you prepare to do a split.
There are many different ways to improve flexibility including yoga and stretching.
Get into the habit of always stretching before you attempt to do a split. This will help to prevent injuries.;
, Leg stretches are important for improving flexibility in your legs. By doing so, you'll help to prevent leg injuries while doing splits. There are simple ways you can stretch your legs before you attempt a split.


You will need to lay down faceup on a yoga mat or another comfortable surface. Keep your legs straight. Now slowly lift your right leg into the air keeping it as straight as possible. Bring your fingers towards your toes and hold the position for at least 30 seconds. Slowly lower your leg back to the ground.Do this with your left leg as well. You should feel the stretch in your quads.
Stretch both legs simultaneously. You will need to use stairs or another slightly elevated surface. This stretch requires a slightly elevated, sturdy surface. The bottom step of your stairs could work well.
Start in a standing position facing the stairs. Place your right leg on the stair or other elevated surface. Make sure to keep your legs straight as you lean forward with both hands to place them on either side of your foot. Make sure your left foot is straight and firmly planted on the ground.Hold the stretch for 30 seconds and then repeat on the other side.

, To prevent injuries in your hamstrings, remember to include hamstring stretches in your pre-split workout.


An easy way to get blood flowing to your hamstrings, is to run in place for 10 minutes or so. You can also jump rope.A simple hamstring stretch is to begin with your feet shoulder width apart. Now bend to your left and try to bring your chest to your thigh. Make sure to keep both of your legs straight. Hold the stretch for 10 seconds and repeat on the other side by bending to the right and bringing your chest to meet your right thigh.

, Give yourself enough room to spread out and make sure you’re dressed comfortably. Don’t attempt to do a split if you’re wearing jeans or other restrictive clothing.


Using a yoga mat will help to keep you from sliding as you get into the split position.
Despite what you may think, attempting to do a split on a slippery surface such as a hardwood floor will do more harm than good as you could injure yourself by moving too quickly into position.

, To do a forward split, slide one of your legs forward. You can use either your right or left leg. Use the one that feels most comfortable to you. For a side split, both of your legs should slide out to your sides. Initially, they should be shoulder width apart, but then they need to slide further out as you begin to lower your body.


Slowly lower your body to the ground. Keep your hands out to your sides to both keep balance and to catch yourself if you start to fall.
Make sure to keep your hips squared for the forward split. This should force your body to stay straight and not sideways.For both types of splits, your chest should also stay nice and straight.

, Hold the pose for only a few seconds. Get your muscles used to being in this position. Don’t worry if you can’t go all the way to the ground. That will come with time.


If you start feeling pain in any part of your body, get out of the position immediately.

, Once you’ve held the position for a few seconds, stop for the day. You will want to work up to doing a full split.


Try doing this every day. However, if you feel pain in your muscles, always wait a few days before going back to it.

, To help your joints stay limber, try doing yoga on a regular basis. You don't need to join a class in order to do yoga. There are some simple positions you can try from home such as the warrior pose. Additionally, there are split poses in yoga, which can help with additional split practice.


To do the warrior pose stand on a yoga mat with your feet together. Keep your core tight as you extend your left foot behind you, towards the back of your mat. Once the leg is fully extended, plant your heel and turn your toe out to a 45 degree angle. Your hips should still be facing forward. Now raise your arms slowly and hold the pose for 45 seconds. You should feel the stretch in your legs.
Doing poses such as the warrior pose will help to improve flexibility in your leg muscles, which will help to prevent injuries when you're doing splits.
You can also do split poses in yoga, which will help to give you extra split practice. Try the monkey pose. You will need to kneel on your yoga mat. Now extend your right leg out in front of you, but keep your heel on the ground. Keeping your core tight, lean forward and press your fingertips to the floor. Your right leg should now be straight, but be careful not to hyperextend the knee. Slowly press your right heel forward and rotate your right thigh such that your kneecap is facing upward. While you're doing this, slide your left knee back behind you making sure that the top of your left foot is firmly planted on the ground. Your hips should still be squared as you gently flex your right foot. Hold this pose for 30 to 45 seconds.

, Watching your weight is important to your overall health and flexibility, particularly when it comes to avoiding injuries while exercising. Excess weight puts added pressure on your joints and doing splits will only further exacerbate problems.Exercise regularly and try to include healthy alternatives when cooking. For example, you can substitute olive oil for butter and vegetables for starches.
Cut back on the junk food and stock up on healthy snacks like apples and yogurt.

, An additional step you can take to help keep your joints healthy is to take a natural supplement.


Purchase fish oil. While there are many benefits to fish oil, an important aspect for your joints is that it helps to get your blood flowing.
Vitamin D is another helpful supplement, as it keeps your bones strong by absorbing calcium into your system. Vitamin D can also be found in some of the healthy foods you eat including milk and salmon.

Yoga pants, exercise shorts, or sweatpants are great options., Find a clear space on the floor to lay out your mat to begin. If you are on a carpeted floor, a mat may not be necessary.

, Staying hydrated is important for any type of physical activity. Dehydration can also cause muscle fatigue and reduce your ability to stretch your muscles to their full capacity., Spend about 5 to 10 minutes lightly jogging or doing jumping jacks to warm up your body and get your heart rate up. This will loosen your muscles preparing them for a deeper stretch.








, Performing different types of lunges and squats will stretch different muscles in your legs preparing them to do a split. The type of split you want to achieve will determine what type of leg exercises to do. 








For a middle split, do wide squats, side lunges, and deep plies.
For a front split, do scissor lunges, reverse lunges, and traditional squats.

, For a deeper stretch, bring your feet closer in towards your body as you do the butterfly stretch. Make sure to stretch slowly to avoid injuring yourself.








Sit with your knees bent and out to the side so they form a “v”.
Touch the soles of your feet together and place your hands on your feet or ankles.
Bend over to bring your head as close to your feet as you can and stay there while you take a few deep breaths.

Place your fingertips on the ground on either side of your front leg.
Gently bring both hands to the inner side of your front foot and rest your hands on the floor.
Take a few deep breaths and allow your muscles to relax with each exhalation.
If you’re able to, rest your forearms on the floor to get an even deeper stretch.

, Sit up tall with your legs open as wide as you can without bending your knees. Take a few deep breaths while you stretch and feel your muscles relax more every time you breath out.








Keep your legs out and your knees straight.
Bend your upper body towards the floor.
Breathe deeply and relax your muscles more with each breath.
Roll back up to sitting straight up and gently bounce in your legs to a butterfly position.
Repeat this stretch 3 to 5 times.

, Proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation is a contract-relax stretching method that suppresses the stretch reflex so your muscles don’t resist the stretch as much. During PNF, muscle stretches last for a few seconds up to a few minutes in cycles. After each stretch relax the muscle, and then immediately re-stretch the same muscle farther than you did before. Repeat this cycle until no more gains can be made.








Lay on your back and pull one leg up toward your head, as far as you can go.
Hold your leg with your hands for 20 seconds.
Release your leg and relax your muscle for 20 seconds.
Lift your leg back up pulling it a little further towards your head each time.

, Use the yoga blocks and bolsters for support as you ease into the splits position.


Kneel behind the bolster.
Place your hands on the yoga blocks for support.
Place one foot down in front of the bolster with your back knee on the ground.
Gently extend the front leg forward as you slide the back leg back curling your toes under.
Allow the bolster to support your legs to alleviate some of the tension
Take a 3 to 6 deep breaths and extend your legs farther with each breath.
Repeat this alternating which leg is in front 3 to 5 times.

, Once you stop feeling tension while using the bolster, it is time to try the split without it.








Position your body in a lunge with your hands on the floor on either side of your front leg.
Slowly slide your front leg out into the split position.
Lower your body down towards the ground.
If you are feeling tension, don’t overexert yourself or you may pull a muscle.
Hold this position for several seconds, and then relax down to your knees.
Repeat this 3 to 5 times, trying to go a little lower down each time.

, It is important to continue to practice these exercises and stretches every day to achieve a split. Some people can achieve it in a day, but most need the time to build up their flexibility before being able to do a full split. Taking 20 to 30 minutes every day to stretch and practice your split is what it’s going to take to master this skill.

Warm up.,
Set aside 15 minutes of your day.,
Know your limits.,
Do a v-stretch.,
Touch your toes while sitting down.,
Touch your toes while standing up.,
Do the butterfly stretch.,
Do kneeling stretches.,
Practice the splits.",How to Do the Splits Quickly," It is very important that you are warmed up before you attempt to do the splits. This will help you to avoid injury and allow you to stretch deeper. It will also help you to get your splits quicker. You can warm up by jogging on the spot for 5 minutes, by doing some star-jumps, push-ups, sit-ups or by dancing crazily to your favorite song - anything that gets your body moving!









As part of your warm up, you can then begin some gentle stretches such as touching your toes in straddle or pike, butterflies, lunges, or anything that will get you used to spreading out your legs.;
, You'll never accomplish the splits if you only stretch for two minutes at a time, once or twice a week. You need to commit to a routine that involves at least 15 minutes of stretching, every day.









Pencil these 15 minutes into your daily schedule and don't forget them, no matter what. If you're tight for time - multitask! Do your stretching exercises while watching TV, learning multiplication tables for school or waiting for the pizza delivery guy. It doesn't matter.
Remember that the more you stretch, the faster you will achieve the splits. If you're really serious about achieving your splits as quickly as possible - whether it's for gymnastics, dance class or karate - consider stretching for 15 minutes every morning and 15 minutes every night. This will really speed up the process!

, When practicing for the splits, you should feel a good, intense stretch in your leg muscles, but you should never feel any pain.









If you do feel any pain, you should stop what you're doing immediately, as pushing yourself too hard can cause serious muscle injuries.
If you pull or damage your muscles in any way, these injuries may prevent you from ever achieving the splits!

, Sit on the floor and spread your legs out in a big v-shape. If it helps, place your feet against a wall in order to get a deeper stretch.









Keeping your back straight, lean to the right and grab your right foot with both hands. Hold the stretch for 30 to 60 seconds, then repeat with the left leg.
Next, stretch your arms straight out in front of you, as far as you can. Try to get your chest to touch the floor. Hold this stretch for 30 to 60 seconds.

, Sit on your bum with your legs stretched out in front of you, feet together, and reach for your toes.









If you can't quite reach your toes, grab your ankles instead. If you can touch your toes easily, reach around the soles of your feet.
Remember to keep your back straight.
Hold this stretch for 30 to 60 seconds.

, Do the exact same as last time but standing up! Standing with your feet together and your legs straight, lean down and try to touch your toes.









Remember not to bend your knees, and try to keep most of your body weight on the balls of your feet, rather than the heels. Hold the stretch for 30 to 60 seconds.
If you're really flexible, try to put the palms of your hands flat on the floor.

, Sit on the floor and bend your knees until the soles of your feet are touching. Push your knees towards the floor, using your elbows if necessary. Hold for 30 to 60 seconds.









Keep your back straight as you stretch and try to pull your heels as close towards your body as possible.
For a more intense stretch, try leaning over and placing your hands on the ground, as far in front of your legs as you an manage.

, Kneel down onto your knees and extend one leg out in front of you, making sure that it's completely straight.









Place a hand on either side of your extended leg and lean down into the stretch. Hold for 30 to 60 seconds, then repeat on the other side.
For a more intense stretch, place your extended leg on a raised surface, such as a pillow or mat.

, One of the best ways to stretch for the splits is to actually practice the splits! Practice doing a right split, a left split and a center split, or just choose one.









Practice doing each type of splits slowly, gently easing your legs as far down as possible. When you've reached your limit, try to hold that position for 30 seconds. Then give yourself a break before trying again. Attempt to push yourself a little further down each time.
A couple of things you can do to get further down into your splits include asking a friend or family member to push down on your shoulders or legs while your stretch -- just make sure they will stop immediately when you ask!
You can also wear socks while you stretch (rather than stretching barefoot or in shoes), as this will help your feet to slide easier, especially on wooden or linoleum covered floors.

Stretch before you do the splits.,
Do a 10 to 20 minute warm-up, stretching each of your muscles.,
Organize the space you're going to use for doing the splits.,
Assess the area where you are going to do the splits.,
Add helper pillows.,
Decide which leg is naturally easier for you to use.,
Place your favored leg in front of you.,
From a standing straddle position, slowly make your way towards the floor.,
Find a position where you feel a little stretch, but the rest of your body weight is supported on the pillows (if using).,
Go further when ready.,
Relax and stretch out your muscles a bit.,
Allow plenty of time to learn this.,
Repeat the warm-up and splits practice every day.",How to Do The Box (Front) Splits," If you rush into the splits, you may hurt yourself. You must stretch before you do the splits even if you have done the splits a hundred times. Stretching your muscles will help you to ease into the splits more carefully.;
, Do each stretch a few times repeatedly, so to increase flexibility in those stretches.


If you want to follow a specific program, try physiotherapist Lisa Howell's flexibility program called The Front Splits Fast.

, Look for a good spot to do the splits. Doing the splits takes up a good deal of space. It would be bad if you tried to do that splits in your room and accidentally broke your favorite lamp. Instead, try doing the splits in a large room with nothing at a leg's distance that you can break.


You can also try doing the splits outside, on your front lawn. Make sure that the grass is dry––if it's wet, it could cause you to slip while going into the splits and thus maybe injuring yourself.

, Do a couple more stretches to make sure that there isn't anything nearby that you could land on if you accidentally fell while going into the splits.

, If wished, arrange some pillows to help you get into the right position.

, Many people favor one leg more than the other and it will be easier if you use the favored leg at first. To find out which leg you favor, place one foot in front of you and the other behind and stand for a few moments, then swap over and do the same. The leg you had in front when you felt the most comfortable is your favored leg.

, Place the other leg behind. Stand up with your hips square. If using pillows, place the pillows between your legs, where your hips will be.

, Slide down. Slide the front foot forwards and the back one backward. Aim to go as far as you can without forcing the movement, making sure that you have a support to hold onto so that you don't go too far.

, When you start to feel the pull of your muscles, hold it there for 10 to 15 seconds.


Hold your position by supporting yourself with your hands.






Focus on your breathing. Use your mind to relax your muscles instead of forcing them.






Don't force yourself into the splits flat on the ground because this could seriously injure your legs.







, Once you've held the position there a few times, it's time to go a little bit further. Ease yourself down by a centimeter (1/2 an inch) at the absolute maximum, if you feel ready. Pushing more than that at one time will hurt and could cause damage to your muscles, so once you're down another centimeter, hold your position, as long as it doesn't hurt too much. Hold that for about 5 seconds.

, Then repeat the process of slowly working your way down to the ground.

, Few people achieve this quickly, it takes practice, from days and weeks to even months and a year. Stop doing the splits if you feel a lot of pain. You know your own limits, so don't go over them.

, Soon enough, you'll be doing flat box splits at your own pace.

Warm up.,
Sit down on the floor.,
Now, spread out your legs as far as they can go comfortably in a straddle (middle split).,
Now, sit down where you are.,
We have done a lot of stretching.,
Stand up.,
Now, straighten your front foot, and flex it.,

These are all the stretches that will assist you in your task.",How to Improve Your Splits," Go for a short run, jog in place, or do fifty jumping-jacks.;
, Get into a pike, (both legs straight out in front of you,) and flex your feet. Lean over and pick a comfortable spot to sit at. Breathe in, and while you let your breath out, push yourself until you feel a little pain. Pain=good. Too much pain=injury. No pain=no stretching. Hold this for an 8 count, and then come up.

, Hold your hands above your head, ballerina style, and lean to the left. Count to ten, then come back up. Repeat this, but on your right side now. Once you are done, stretch your feet out as far as possible into the middle splits, (little pain,) and lean down into the middle. Aim for your elbows or chest to reach the floor; not your head. Hold this for as long as you want. The longer you hold it, the better and deeper you will get into your splits.

, Stretch one foot out in front of you, and fold the other one. Pull the other one up towards your chest. Hold for ten seconds, and then relax. Repeat on other foot. After you do this stretch, go back down in the pike. You will see that you have gone down a little more.

, Now, let's get into the splits!

, Step out with one foot as far as you can without pain. This doesn't have to be very far. Now, put the top of your back foot on the ground and get into a lunge. Stretch and feel it in your groin and back of the leg. Repeat on other foot.

, Now, try to touch your toes. Repeat on each leg.

, Put your hands down on the ground to support you. Now, lift your body off of the floor and lower yourself to the ground. Go into your splits. You don't need to go all the way down, but hold this for ten seconds, then relax. Now switch feet.

, Repeat each of these several times a week, and soon you will have your splits! Good luck, girls!

Stop if you feel pain.",How to Do Forward Splits," The hip flexors are important muscles that are in involved in doing a front split. These muscles will need to be gradually trained to become more flexible before you can do a full front split. Try this basic stretch to increase the flexibility of your hip flexors.Get down on both of your knees.
Put one leg out in front of you, placing your foot on the floor and your knee at a ninety degree angle.
Gently lean forward towards your outstretched leg. Keep your body and hips straight as you stretch forward.
You'll feel the stretch in your thigh of the leg you are kneeling on.
Hold this position for about 30 seconds.
Repeat the motion on the other leg.;
, Another set of muscles that are involved in front stretches are the quadriceps. Stretching your quadriceps will allow the leg that will be behind you to comfortably move into the front split position. Try this basic stretch to build up flexibility in your quadriceps and work towards the full front split:Stand upright and straight. You may want to stand next to a chair that you can grab onto for stability.
Bend one leg at the knee, grab the ankle and bring the foot up behind you.
Keep your torso straight as you pull the foot and leg upwards.
You'll feel this stretch in the thigh of the leg you are pulling up behind you.
Hold this position for around 30 seconds.
Repeat the same stretch on your other leg.

, Hamstrings are major muscles in your legs that will need to be quite flexible if you want to do a front split. These muscles run down the back length of your upper leg. The leg that goes out in front during a front split will need to have a very flexible hamstring to move into the full motion. Try using these steps to do a simple hamstring stretch: Find a door frame to use for the stretch.
Lay down on your back, parallel to the wall.
Your hips should be next to the edge of the door frame.
Raise the leg closest to the door frame straight up into the air.
Rest your heel on the inside of the door frame.
Gently straighten the leg against the door frame and hold it for about 30 seconds.
Lower your leg back down and repeat this stretch on the other leg.

, You'll need to start the front split by sitting down on your knees. From this position, you'll be able to easily transition into the next stages of the front split. For now, simply kneel down onto both your knees to start the front split.


Keep your knees about hip width apart.
Your feet and shins will be laying flat on the floor.
Do not try to turn you legs in by force in this position. This can lead to injured hips.
Keep the rest of your body upright and straight.

, You will begin the front split by extending one leg directly out in front of you. This leg will be kept straight, avoiding any bending at the knee that might occur. Place your foot and leg out as straight as you are able to. This position will allow you to gently slide downwards, easing into the full front split position.


At this point, your rear leg will still be in the kneeling position.
Your front leg will kept as straight as possible.

, Allow your body weight to slowly lower you to the ground, moving deeper into the front split. As you sink down, your legs will straighten out further and further. Go down as far as you comfortably can before pushing yourself back up to the starting position.


Try to get both of your legs flat against the ground. At this point, there should be no bending in either knee.
Never force the stretch beyond what you feel is comfortable.
If you can't do the full front stretch yet, go as far as you feel you can.
Try to hold the stretch for 30 seconds.

, To keep a balance in your levels of flexibility, you will want to do the same stretch on your other leg. Sit down on your knees again to start the movement. This time however, put the other leg out in front of you. Sit down into the full front stretch as you did last time to get the same practice and flexibility on this opposite leg.

, Taking time off from stretching can result in lost range of motion. Because you can lose range of motion from lack of practice, it's a good idea to regularly practice your front splits. By doing your front splits often, you can help keep the motion easy and comfortable, opening the way to more advanced splits.


Practicing front splits can help you move onto middle splits or over-splits.
Make sure to practice other types of leg stretches that focus on all the muscle groups.
Don't over train or hold splits for more than 30 seconds to help avoid injury., Before undertaking any new fitness regime or flexibility training program, it can be a good idea to speak with your doctor. Your doctor will be able to tell you if you are are healthy enough to work on your flexibility. Speaking with your doctor can help you stay safe, avoid injury and safely work towards your goal of doing a front split., Jumping into any exercises or flexibility routines without warming up can increase the chances of injuries occurring. Pushing your flexibility to new limits can be stressful on the body and muscles can be torn or injured. Always make sure you spend enough time warming up before getting into your main flexibility training routine.Spend at least 5 minutes warming up.
Doing gentle stretches can get your muscles ready for deeper movements.
Try something like jogging in place or jumping jacks to gently get your heart pumping.

, Whenever you are working on a new stretch or practicing your actual front split, you will want to move carefully. Moving quickly into a stretch or bouncing the motion can increase the likelihood of an injury occurring. Always keep your movements gentle whenever you are working towards your forward split.Never wiggle or bounce any stretch. You should only steadily hold a stretch to avoid injury.
Don't force any motion. If you don't feel that you can move further into a stretch, stop the motion where you do feel comfortable.

, Pain should never be ignored when you are practicing your forward splits. Any feeling of pain is an indication that your body is being pushed too far and may sustain an injury. If you feel pain, gently stop the movement that caused it and try again later.Never push through pain.
If notice any pain that persists for a long period of time, talk to your doctor as soon as you can.

, If you can, try to practice on a slippery floor which will allow you to slide.

, Even if you feel that you won't need to stretch, you will definitely want to, to avoid tearing your muscles.


There are a lot of stretches that could increase your flexibility, such as butterfly stretches, lunges, standing forward bend, sitting forward bend, touching toes, pyramid stretches, lizard poses, and pigeon stretches. Try to hold each of those stretches for 25 to 40 seconds each.

, By now you are feeling pain, but remember it will be worth it in the end!

Recognize your fear.,
Read about muscular anatomy.,
Watch videos of people doing the splits.,
Reassure yourself.",How to Get over Your Fear of Doing the Splits1," Acknowledging that you are intimidated or otherwise fearful of doing the splits is a great first step to getting over your fear. Write down what, specifically, you are afraid of. This might range from the risk of injuring yourself to fearing failure if you cannot accomplish this goal of yours. Visualizing your fear can make the mountain of concern seem small and capable of being overcome.Perhaps your fear is rooted in a specific incident. If so, reflect on this incident, considering whether it could have been avoided by, for example, stretching more or not going over your limit.;
, Understanding your body’s motions and knowing how muscles are moving with each stretch is a great way to learn how to do the splits safely. It is also reassuring, because you know what impact your motions are having on your body. You can find up-to-date information about muscle movements related to stretching by consulting online interactive resources such as InnerBody or Healthline.If your fear of doing the splits is due to the risk factor involved, it will be especially good to familiarize yourself with muscle movements so that you can understand how exactly your body is working and so you can set boundaries if a specific movement starts to hurt.

, This is a great way to become familiar with the motions of multiple types of splits. Watching a slow-motion video can also help you see how exactly somebody can drop to a split.


Watching videos is also a confidence booster! You’ll see people achieving their fitness goals, which will take your focus off of potential injuries.

, Know that you are going into this new experience of training to do the splits well-informed. Vow not to go past your comfort zone, so that if a specific stretch starts to hurt, you will stop before you injure yourself. Some reassuring statements you can think or say out loud to yourself include:


""I can try this without being afraid of injury because I trust my ability to decide when my body has had enough.""
""If things become too intense, I have the power to stop. I'm totally in control.""
""Not getting the splits this time is not failure; it's one step closer to my goal.""

Stretch towards a split.,
Listen to your body.,
Set a timeline.,
Be persistent.,
Accept your limits.",How to Get over Your Fear of Doing the Splits2," There are a number of different ways that you can lower yourself down into your chosen split position.


You can begin by practicing static stretching, which means getting into a position where you feel light tension and holding it for one to two minutes.
Try dynamic stretching, which involves a soft bounce the force of which is increased gradually.
Doing yoga may help you stretch toward a split. An instructor can help you by using straps, blocks, or the wall to increase flexibility and prepare you to do the splits.
If you want to be extra careful when training to do the splits, consider hiring a trainer to review and guide your movements. Trainers can personalize your routine and ensure your safety. Visit your local gym to inquire about personal training programs., If you don’t take your time and you rush to try to do the splits quickly, you could end up with strained muscles or otherwise injure yourself. Remember: your safety is of utmost importance.


Always warm up prior to stretching or attempting the splits.
When doing the splits, you should feel an intense stretch. You should not feel pain. If you do, stop immediately, as you are going beyond your limit., Doing the splits can take a week or it could take months, depending on how much you practice every day. It is certainly not something you can learn overnight, so you must be patient. Set a reasonable timeline based on your current ability for when you would like to be able to do the splits and practice accordingly.


If you are not at all flexible right now then you may need to practice more often or longer every day. For example, if you can't touch your toes bending down but you are determined to learn how to do the splits, then you could practice for half an hour daily. If, for example, you can already do side splits but want to learn how to do front splits, then you might only practice for 15 minutes every day.
The most important thing is to adapt the exercise routine to your needs and goals, being careful not to hurt yourself.

, Repeat your warm-ups and stretches at least once a day so that your body gets accustomed to this new range of motion.

, Theoretically, everyone should be able to do the splits with enough training; however, your body might not be able to reach the full range of motion required to do the splits without injury. If you are unsure of whether this is your case, it is best not to push yourself too quickly.


Understand that some people are born more flexible than others and acknowledge that splits are difficult. Keep doing your stretches, but only to the point where you feel comfortable.

Wear comfortable clothing.,
Warm up.,
Stretch in preparation for the splits.",How to Get over Your Fear of Doing the Splits3," Your clothing should be flexible enough that you can move freely and without worrying that your clothes might rip. Types of clothing that you might wear to do the splits include athletic shorts, tennis skirts, or loose tank tops. Materials such as spandex or lycra, frequently used in dancewear, are also good choices.

, Warming up will help you get in the right mindset for doing the splits and may reduce your risk of injury.Warming up involves joint rotations and raising your heart rate, which you can do with light aerobic exercise:First, make slow clockwise and counterclockwise movements with your joints: your toes, ankles, knees, legs, hips, waist, neck, shoulders, elbows, wrists, and fingers. You can start from your toes and work your way up or work your way down from your fingers. This will lubricate the entire joint and allow it to move more easily.
After joint rotations, get your blood flowing by jogging or jumping rope for five to 10 minutes.

, Stretching is a way to improve your flexibility. To do the splits, you must include a variety of stretches in your routine that will allow you to develop a full range of motion. These could range from doing lunges to reaching towards your toes.Hold each stretch for 10 – 30 seconds. This is enough time to allow your muscles to lengthen but not too long that it could result in injury if the stretch is done properly.Stop stretching if it hurts. Stretching should never hurt, so if it does, relax the stretch until you feel comfortable again.

, Spend 10 to 15 minutes doing light activity and get your blood going by doing jumping jacks, jogging, squats, and lunges. You want to get your blood flowing and loosen up your muscles.Combine both cardiovascular and dynamic exercises to warm up. Start with an exercise like jumping jacks, then follow with a lunge. Cardiovascular exercises also burn excess fat and calories.
Run on the spot or dance for at least 5 minutes to warm up.

, Do lower back and inner thigh stretches for 10 or so minutes.

Butterfly stretch. This stretch is mainly useful for box splits, although it increases all round leg flexibility. Sit on the floor and push your feet inwards, using your elbows to push your knees down.
Pike stretch. Do this standing up and sitting down. Stand straight and touch your toes for as long as you can, keeping your legs completely vertical.


Note that the older you are, the more difficult it is to stretch. This is because your body dehydrates as it gets older, causing the lubricants between your tissues to decrease. This means that it will take longer for you to do the splits. It doesn't mean that you can't do it though; take it slowly.

, Go into a kneeling position while keeping your back straight. Put the leg of your choice in front of you. Straighten the front leg as much as possible. Rest your back leg on its shin.

, Holding your breath as your stretch tightens your muscles, which makes it more difficult to perform the side splits. Breath deeply, but do not exaggerate your breathes. You want to make your breaths as natural as possible.


Inhale when you are holding the stretch. Exhale when you lean into the stretch.

, If you lower yourself into the split too fast, then you can seriously injure yourself. Find a speed that works for you.. Always ease yourself slowly into the splits.


By going slowly, you avoid injuries. Not only will injuries prevent you from doing the stretch immediately, it can potentially prevent you from practicing for a long time.
It’s more important to practice consistently than to attempt to do the splits fast

, Once you are warmed up and feel relaxed, start to lower yourself very carefully. Continue going down until you feel pain or discomfort. Once you feel any major discomfort, other than the minor pain that comes from stretching, stop.


As you lower yourself, keep your hands to your side so that you can support your body weight.
If you feel pain after you are done with the side splits, then you forced yourself too hard into the stretch. Wait until the pain is completely gone before attempting the stretch again.

, Once your pelvis is on the floor, and your legs are at a 180-degree angle, you have achieved a side split.


Do not bounce yourself into the side split as this could injure you.

, Once you have achieved the split, hold it for as long as you can. Start setting time limits. Try to hold it for 15 seconds, then 30 seconds. Try to work your way to a minute.


Remember to always do the splits comfortably. Do not hold the position if you feel any major discomfort.
Straddle stretch (if wished): get into a straddle and try to touch your nose to each knee and then to the floor. Sit with one leg behind you and one leg tucked underneath you. Sit like this for a while.

, Ease out of the stretch comfortably and gently. If you get up too quickly, you risk injuring yourself. Breath steadily as you come out and relax as much as possible.


Cool down. Cool down by walking for 5 minutes or doing a few gentle stretches. Don't forget to cool down, or you will regret it the next day when you ache.

, Practice every day unless you are sore. Try to do small sessions 2 to 3 times a day. Find the best routine for your body. If you find that you get sore consistently, try doing light practices one day and heavier practices the day after that.

, Hydrate your body as much as possible. Your joints and muscles need water to be flexible. If you are dehydrated, then that means your body will be much tighter and prone to cramps and spasms.

, Caffeine is a stimulant that prevents your body from relaxing. It tenses your muscles, which makes it more difficult to perform the side splits. Some studies also suggest caffeine causes muscle inflammation.


Cut down on food with high amounts of hydrogenated oil, sugar, and trans-fats can also help in reducing inflammation.

, Give yourself distractions to take your mind off the discomfort while your practice the splits. For instance, while watching television, practice stretching. Be careful not to let your mind get too distracted and overstretch.

, Make sure it lasts at least fifteen minutes. This will help loosen and relax your muscles. Additionally, a hot bath or shower will increase your heart rate and core temperature., Foam rollers help to relax and stretch muscles. The roller can be used to apply static pressure to sore or sensitive areas. For example, if your hamstring is sore, you roll back and forth on top of the roller for 10 to 15 seconds at a time.

Cautiously continue to the floor.,
Hold your position.,
Be patient.,
When you've mastered the splits, try the over split.",How to Do a Split1," When you do your first split, you're probably (understandably) focused on possible injury or discomfort you might experience, so it's easy to forget that you can shred certain types of clothing by doing a split. Don't put yourself at risk for an embarrassing rip! Wear loose or flexible clothing, such as the following suggestions:









Athletic shorts, leggings, track pants, skirt, or sweat pants.
Loose t-shirts or tank tops.
Skin-tight elastic material - spandex or lycra leotards, dance clothes, etc.
Martial arts clothing - karate gi, etc.
Socks or tights. You may also go barefoot.;
, Like with any athletic activity, warming up before doing splits can help you focus, decrease your discomfort, and prevent injury. To warm up, you'll want to raise your heart rate, then perform a few light stretches. To raise your heart rate, perform some light cardiovascular activity. 8-10 minutes of jogging, cycling, or jumping rope should suffice - whatever is enough to raise your temperature and heart rate.








, Next, do a few stretches - try to focus on the muscle groups that are most important for doing splits, like your hamstrings, hips, and, if you want to attempt a side-split, groin. You don't need to run through your entire stretching routine like you would if you were trying to build flexibility to be able to do the splits in the first place, as these stretches are intended solely as a warm up. In fact, once you can do it confidently, doing a split itself can become part of your stretching routine.








, When you've warmed up and stretched, get into a stance that allows you to transfer to a split with ease. This stance will differ based on whether you are attempting a front split or a side split. See below for the distinction:









For a front split, lower yourself into a kneeling position with your back straight. Stretch your preferred leg forward in front of you. Your front knee should be straight and your back knee bent so the shin on that leg is resting on the ground. Make sure your back knee and foot are facing the ground and NOT to the side. This is a common mistake and can result in severe injury.
For a side split, stand up straight, then take a wide straight-legged stance. Spread your legs slightly more than shoulder-width apart.
Relax. Take deep breaths. Think of peaceful, relaxing thoughts. Try not to hold any tension at all in any of your body's muscles. Believe it or not, there is evidence that relaxation techniques can make a measurable difference in a person's flexibility, especially if they become a habitual part of a stretching routine. Take a deep breath in and as you let it out go down a little bit farther., When you're warmed up, relaxed, and ready, slowly and gently lower yourself into either the front split or side split. Go down as far as you can without any major pain or discomfort - if you feel anything beyond mild ""flexing"" discomfort, stop your split attempt. Have your hands ready to brace yourself as you get close to the floor - it's very difficult to support your entire weight with your legs and keep them relaxed at this point.









If you're attempting a front split, place your hands on the floor and slowly slide your front leg forward until your reach the floor. Point your back toes, as keeping them flexed can prevent you from sliding down properly. You should never excessively twist your lower back.
If you're attempting a side split, allow your legs to spread out to the sides. You will probably need to lean forward and support your weight on your hands at some point.
Don't overdo it. Forcing yourself into a split can cause painful injury that will decrease your ability to flex. Be satisfied with gradual progress. If this means that, for instance, on a given day, you can only go down to a foot off the ground while feeling a decent stretch, don't go any further.

, Surprisingly, doing it on a mattress can help you get down further, and also help you get the feel of doing the splits. When your legs have reached a 180 degree angle and your pelvis is resting on the ground, congratulations - you've done the splits! On your first attempts, you probably won't be able to do this all the way. This is normal. Don't try to push yourself past your point of maximum flexibility or to ""bounce"" to get slightly better results. Instead, use the opportunity to stretch and try again later.








, When you've performed your splits or reached the limit of your flexibility, try to hold this position for about 30 seconds.Then, get up, stretch, and repeat as much as you wish (alternating legs if you do front splits). Only do splits as often as you're comfortable, never fighting against the pain to do ""just one more."" Or you can try doing some other skills that involve the splits.

, Never attempt to push yourself past your limit. Doing the splits requires lots of time and plenty of patient practice. Increasing your flexibility can take months. Since this is a process that happens gradually over time, you may not notice improvement every time you attempt the splits. Stick with it! You will get better as you practice every day. Keep in mind that the splits are not a comfortable position even for most people who have them.

, Believe it or not, getting your legs to 180 degrees is not the most you can do when it comes to splits. By continuing to stretch, you can increase your flexibility to a point that you're able to bend your legs to an angle greater than 180 degrees. However, because this feat of flexibility is fairly extreme, care must be taken to prevent injury. To build up your ability to do a so-called ""over split"", start by performing a splits with a pillow on the ground next to you. Go into your split and put your heel on the pillow. You will be stretching just slightly further than in a normal split. Hold this as position as you normally would.









As your flexibility gets better and better, you may gradually add pillows to increase the angle at which you flex. Be conservative - never add pillows until you're perfectly comfortable at your current level of flexibility.

The most important of these are the hamstrings and dorsal hip muscles (also called iliopsoas), however, stretching a wide range of lower-body muscles will ensure greater overall flexibility, lessening your risk of discomfort, pain, or injury. Additionally, this comprehensive stretching regimen prepares you to do both types of basic split - side splits and front splits. Besides the hamstrings and hip muscles, try to add stretches for as many of the following muscles as possible to your fitness routine:








Lower back (lumbar region)
Buttocks (glutes)
Groin (especially valuable for side splits)
Calves
Quadriceps
The stretching recommendations included the following steps in this section will target many of these secondary muscles. However, if desired, you may substitute your own preferred stretches.

, This stretch will help your hamstrings and lower back. Lie on the floor next to a straight wall. Position yourself so that your body is pointing perpendicular to the wall. Raise your legs and place them as high as you can on the wall while keeping your lower back on the floor. Reach towards your toes with your hands - go as far as you can without excessive strain or pain. Hold for 30 seconds. Repeat 2-3 times.








, This stretch targets your hip muscles. Begin as if you were doing an ordinary lunge exercise - plant one foot forward and lower yourself down to the ground by bending your front leg and sliding your back leg back until your shin lies on the ground. When you've reached the floor, put your hands on your hips and gradually shift your weight forward, keeping your back straight. Continue until you begin to feel the stretch in the top of the thigh where it meets the hip. Hold for 20-30 seconds, then return to your starting position and switch to your other leg. Repeat several times.








, This stretch hits your hamstrings, lower back, and, if you can reach your toes, your calf muscles. Sit on the floor and spread your legs in a wide ""V"". Raise your hands over your head. Gently and gradually bend your upper body as you reach towards one of your feet. Stop when you notice pain or discomfort or stretching becomes difficult. Hold for 20-30 seconds, then return to the starting position and stretch towards the other leg.









You may not initially be able to reach your toes. This is O.K. However, when you can reach your toes, you may grab your foot and gently pull it towards you to stretch your calf.

, This stretch mainly works your groin and inner thigh. Sit upright on the floor with your back straight. Don't slouch - if needed, you may sit against a wall. Bring your legs towards your body and press your feet together so that your legs make a diamond shape. Move your heels as close to your groin as you can without experiencing pain. You may also push your knees towards the ground with your hands for an added stretch, but use caution, as this can be somewhat hard on the knees. Hold this stretch for about 20 seconds, then rest and repeat.








, This aptly-named stretch mainly stretches your quadriceps - the large group of muscles on the front of your thigh. You'll need one or two pillows. Lower yourself into a kneeling position with your rear knee on the pillow(s). Raise your back foot, then, keeping your back straight reach back and grab it with your opposite hand. Gently pull your leg towards your bottom. You should feel a stretch in the front of your thigh. Hold for about 20 seconds, then switch legs.









Alternatively, if you're worried about putting stress on your knees, you may do a standing quad stretch. Stand up straight, lift one leg up towards your bottom, then reach back and pull it with the arm that's on the same side. You may want to brace yourself against a wall with your other hand for balance.

, Lay on your stomach on the floor. Raise yourself into a ""plank"" position - keep your back and legs aligned and support your upper body on your elbows and your lower body on your toes. Place one foot on top of the other so that you're balancing on one foot. Gently push back with your body weight until you feel a stretch in your foot and your calf. Hold for about 20 seconds, then switch feet and repeat.









In addition to stretching out your calf muscles, you'll also get a light ab workout from holding the plank pose.

Do a light cardio warm-up.,
Stretch out your hamstrings.,
Do a quick yoga sequence to prepare.",How to Do a Standing Split1," Standing splits are a difficult pose, so you need your body to be well-prepared for before attempting. It’s important to stretch out and engage your muscles, but you can start by doing a light cardio warm-up to get the blood flowing and your heart pumping.Do a quick dynamic warm-up for around five minutes. This could include the following exercises:


Light jogging on the spot.
Leg swings and arm swings.
Butt kickers.
High knees.
Jumping jacks.
Squats.;
, Standing splits work your hamstrings especially, so it’s a good idea to stretch out these muscles a little before you begin.A good stretch for the hamstring is the crossover stretch. To do this, stand up straight and then cross your right leg over your left, placing your right foot next to, but outside, your left foot.


Then gently and slowly roll your upper body down and reach towards the ground with your hands until you feel a stretch.
Hold for up to 30 seconds, and then release.
Now cross your left leg over your right, and repeat the stretch., Before you move onto the standing splits, you should do a short yoga sequence to ensure that your body is fully prepared. This will help you stretch out your muscles and relax your mind. Sun salutations A and B are both cited as excellent ways to prepare for standing splits.You could also move through the following poses:


Start in mountain pose. Stand up straight with your hands in prayer position in front of your chest.
Then move into Parsvottanasana (Intense Side Stretch Pose). From mountain pose step your left leg back and turn your left foot out around 30 degrees. Then carefully tilt forward at the hips and bring your hands forwards and down towards your right foot.
From this position you can move into High Lunge by bending your right knee and dropping your hips as you lean back and raise both your arms above your head.
You can then move into Warrior III. Stand and bring your feet back together and then raise your right leg behind you. Tilt your body forwards and ahead of your standing foot."

Do a butterfly stretch.,
Do a pancake stretch.,
Touch your toes.,
Do a bent knees stretch.,
Do half squats.,
Do standing leg stretches.,
Practice your full center split.",How to Do Center Splits1," The butterfly stretch is a great stretch for the center splits as it increases flexibility in the inner thighs, the groin and the hips. To perform:



Sit on the floor and bend your knees until the soles of your feet are touching. Pull your heels as close towards your body as possible and use your elbows to push your knees towards the floor.
Make sure to sit upright with your back straight. Hold the stretch for 30 to 60 seconds.
To deepen the stretch, lean forward as far as you can and place your hands on the floor in front of your feet. Keep your back straight and your knees pressed to the floor.;
, The pancake stretch is used by gymnasts to increase their flexibility and prepare for the center splits. To perform:











Sit on the floor and spread your legs as wide as possible into a straddle position. Make sure that your legs are completely straight and that your toes are pointed.
Keeping your back straight, lean forward as far as you can with your arms stretched out in front of you. Try to touch your chest to the floor, so your body is completely flat - just like a pancake!
To deepen the stretch, try to grab your feet with your hands, while keeping the rest of your body flat to the ground. Hold the stretch for 30 seconds., Touching your toes stretches your leg muscles and increases flexibility in the hamstrings, which is great for center splits. This stretch can be performed in a seated or standing position.











To perform the stretch while standing, stand with your feet together and your legs straight. Reach down and attempt to touch your toes with your fingertips. Don't bend your knees and try to place your weight on the balls of your feet, rather than your heels. Hold this stretch for 30 to 60 seconds.
To perform the stretch while seated, sit with your legs stretched out straight in front of you and lean forward (keeping your back straight) until your touch your toes with your fingers. As you grow more flexible, try to grab the soles of your feet with your hands, in order to increase the stretch., This stretch increases flexibility in the groin and hips. If you can perform it correctly, you are well on your way to achieving center splits.











Kneel on the floor and place your hands on the ground in front of you for balance. Move your knees outwards - as far from your body as possible - until they form 90 degree angles. There should be a straight line running from one knee to the other.
Move your weight from your hands to your elbows, to get deeper into the stretch. The goal is to get your hips flat on the ground, while maintaining the 90 degree angle with your knees. Once you have achieved the correct position, hold this stretch for 30 seconds., The half squat is a useful exercise for stretching the inner thighs. To perform:











Hunker down into a low squatting position. Shift your weight onto your right leg and stretch your left leg straight out to the side, as if you were doing the center splits with that leg. Make sure to point your toes.
Place your right hand on the floor (in front of your right leg) for balance and use your elbow to push the knees outwards until you feel a firm stretch in the inner thighs.
Hold for 60 seconds, then repeat with the other leg., These simple leg stretches are essential when training to do the splits, as they increase flexibility in all of the necessary muscles. They are commonly used in martial arts training as preparation for the center splits.











To begin, stand up straight and place your feet two shoulder widths apart. Bend forwards at the hips, keeping your legs completely straight. Let your body hang down and try to place your palms on the ground. As flexibility increases, try to get your elbows on the ground. Hold this stretch for 30 seconds.
Next your can try ankle grabs. Lean to the right and grab the right ankle with both hands, then lean to the left and repeat with the left ankle. When holding these stretches, make sure that your hips are level rather than tilted to the side, otherwise the stretch will not be as effective.
Next, try grabbing both ankles at the same time, bringing your chest as close to your knees as possible. Keep your back straight and relax your neck muscles so that your head is hanging straight down.

, Of course, one of the best ways to achieve center splits is to practice doing center splits. The safest, most effective way to do this is as follows:











Hunker down into a low squat and place both hands on the floor in front of you. Then, slowly begin to walk or slide both feet outwards, as far apart as you can manage.
Your legs should be completely straight and your feet should be parallel as you lower yourself down into the stretch. Many people make the mistake of lowering themselves down by rolling back on their heels, but this will not provide as effective of a stretch and could cause injury. Your toes should only point outwards when you have achieved the full splits.
Hold the stretch for as long as you can, then slowly come back into a squatting position to rest your muscles. When you feel ready, lower yourself back into the splits position again. Alternating between squatting and stretching will help you to get lower down each time you attempt the center splits.
As you stretch, remember to keep your back straight and your hips in line with your legs. If your hips are too far forward or too far back, you will not be able to perform a center split correctly.
The goal is to lower yourself down until your groin touches the floor. Once you have achieved this, you can try to roll your hips until you are sitting in an upright position, while maintaining a center splits.
Remember to move slowly and breathe evenly. Do not push yourself too hard. You should feel a tight stretch in your inner thigh and groin muscles, but it should not feel painful. If you feel any discomfort or tearing sensations, come out of the stretch immediately.

Cease jumping out with one foot in front of the other.,
Make sure you stretch before attempting to do a split.,
Choose what type of split you wish to do.,
Stretch again so that your muscles don't tighten up.

,
Practice!,
If you follow this you should be able to achieve the splits within three weeks!

",How to Do a Right Split," You cannot expect that you are going to make it to the floor without any pain at all. You will not make it to the floor, and if you try to do a split right away, it will hurt a lot!;
, Reach for your toes, sit down with your feet in front of you and put your head towards your knees and reach out.

, You have two choices to do a split if you're doing a left or right split. You can either slide down slowly to the ground with one foot in front of the other, or you can sit down with one foot extended out and then lift yourself up and extend the other leg. If you are doing a middle split, you also have two choices. You can either straddle your legs on the ground and then push them back until you feel a stretch, or you can start standing up with your feet together and gradually spread them apart and use your hands to support you.

,, This will take time, but if you work at it, you will eventually be able to do a split.

Start in Mountain Pose.,
Move into Standing Forward Fold.,
Raise one leg.,
Deepen the stretch.,
Try to square your hips.,
Hold and release.",How to Do a Standing Split2," Now you warmed up, you are ready to progress into Standing Splits. Start by getting back into Mountain Pose. Stand up straight and hold your hands in front of your chest in a prayer position. Then let your arms fall down to your sides and just concentrate on breathing with a steady rhythm.

, Inhale and raise both your arms up over your head. Pause and then exhale. As you breathe out, bend at your hips and reach your hands down towards the floor to bring you into Standing Forward Fold. Straighten your legs but do not lock your knees.


Bring your hands down so that they are flat on the ground.If you cannot place your hands comfortably on the floor, you can place a yoga block beneath each one.You should feel a stretch, but not be in pain.

, Once you are in the Standing Forward Fold you are almost ready to move into Standing Splits. Next, shift your weight onto you right foot and evenly across both of your hands. Once you feel secure and your weight is supported you can slowly raise your left leg up behind.


Life your leg up as high as you can behind you.
You should be aiming for a smooth controlled movement.
Remember to keep breathing with a calm, steady rhythm., You can deepen the stretch even further once you have elevated one leg up behind you. Carefully walk back your hands towards the heel of your right foot, and bring your torso in close to your standing leg. You can also tuck in your chin.


Breathe deeply as you do this, and try to relax your shoulders., As you raised your let leg up behind you, your left thigh will probably have externally rotated a little. Try to counter this by gently internally rotating it and squaring your hips. You will need to try to roll your left hip down and towards the floor to try and square it with the right hip.It is very difficult to fully square your hips in this position, so don’t push it. Only go as far as you are comfortable with.Lowering your left leg a little might help you to square your hips.
As you do this, be sure to keep your right foot and knee facing straight forwards., Once you have gone as deep into the stretch as you are comfortable with, hold it for five slow, controlled and rhythmic breaths. Then slowly and carefully lower your left leg to the floor and move back into Standing Forward Fold.


Repeat all these steps on the other side, raising your right leg behind you.
Hold the pose for the same amount of time, and try to be symmetrical in your movements."

Do Standing Splits against a wall.,
Bend your standing leg when in the pose.,
Grab the ankle of your standing leg.",How to Do a Standing Split3," A good variation of the Standing Splits involves resting your raised leg against a wall, or top on something such as a chair, table or a ballet barre. To perform this variation you can just move from a Standing Forward Fold into Standing Split a suitable distance in front of the object you will rest you raised foot on.Alternatively, you could start from a King Arthur Pose. This involves kneeling with your back to the wall and placing the shin of your left leg behind you and against the wall. Your toes should be touching the wall, and your knee a few inches in front of it.
Your right leg should be bent in a kneeling position with your knee in a line above your heel.
Bring your hands down to the ground in front of you, and place them shoulder-width apart.
Now slowly lift your left knee off the ground, and walk your left foot up the wall behind you.This variation allows you to support your elevated leg against a solid object, which is particularly helpful if you are still building up strength and flexibility.It's a good idea to practice the pose against a wall before you try it without any support.

, Bending and then straightening your standing leg when you are in a Standing Split is a minor but powerful variation that really deepens and the stretch and works the muscles.


Once you are in a Standing Split, carefully bend the knee of your standing leg and sink a little into the stretch.
Then straighten the knee and bring your raised leg up even higher., A final variation, that will deepen the stretch, just involves you reaching around and grabbing he ankle of your standing leg with the opposite hand when you are in a Standing Split. This variation requires a lot of balance and composure, so be sure you are breathing with a nice, steady rhythm and completely in control before you attempt it."

Always warm up before you stretch.,
Stretch every day.,
Enlist the help of a friend.,
Wear socks.,
Find a practice space that works for you.,
Know your limits.",How to Do Center Splits2," It is essential that you warm up before you stretch, in order to avoid injury and maximize your natural flexibility.











Try doing jumping jacks or running on the spot for a few minutes before you begin your stretching routine.
Alternatively, do your stretching at the end of a cardio workout . You will get the double benefit of increasing your flexibility while preventing muscle stiffness after your workout.

, Achieving the center splits requires a high level of flexibility, and flexibility is something that needs to be worked at consistently over time. In order to achieve the flexibility required for center splits, you need to be stretching every single day, or as close to it as possible.








Begin by stretching for 15 minutes a day, using a routine comprised of the stretching exercises outlined above. After a couple of weeks, increase the time spent stretching to 30 minutes a day, if possible. You can break this up into two 15 minute sessions a day.
Remember that the more stretching you do, the faster you will achieve center splits.

, When stretching for the center splits, it can be very useful to enlist the help of a friend.



Your friend can help by observing your posture, which can be difficult to correct by yourself. Ask them to make sure that your hips are in line and your shoulders are even. This is important as poor posture can affect the quality of your stretching and even cause injuries.
A friend can also help you to deepen your splits by pushing down lightly on your shoulders or legs as you stretch. This can help you to get a fraction or two deeper into your stretch than you could on your own. Just make sure that they will respond quickly if you ask them to stop.

, One simple tip that can help you to deepen your splits is to wear socks while you stretch, rather than stretching in your bare feet.



The socks will allow your feet to slide easily along the ground, helping you to get deeper into the stretch. This is more effective on wooden floors than on carpet.
However, make sure that you slide into the stretch in a careful and controlled fashion. Sliding too quickly may cause you to pull a muscle or tear ligaments.
For safety, most of your body weight should be supported by your arms as you slide into a center split.

, When working towards the center splits, it is important that you find a suitable environment for stretching and practice. The type of environment that works best for you will depend on personal preference.



Some people prefer to practice their center splits in a quiet, peaceful environment. They consider their stretching routine to be a type of meditation, where they can clear their mind and focus only on the sensations of their body.
Other people find stretching a chore and need something to entertain themselves as they go through their routine. For example, some people like to watch television to distract themselves as they stretch.

, The ability to perform the center splits is an impressive physical feat which requires discipline and perseverance to achieve. However, it is also important that you know your limits and refrain from pushing yourself past them in order to achieve your goal.











Pushing yourself too hard will only result in injury, which could potentially prevent you from ever being able to do the splits.
To safely yet effectively achieve the center splits, perform each stretch slowly and carefully, paying close attention to maintaining the correct posture. Listen to your body and you will soon achieve your goal!

Congratulations!",How to Do a Stride Circle in Gymnastics," Before you do anything in gymnastics (or otherwise, for that matter) you should fully stretch your body. Not stretching your body completely could result in injury.;
, Pullovers work best, but a kip can also suffice.

, Once you mount, take your dominant foot (right handed, right foot; left handed, left foot) and swing it over the bar. You now should look like you are doing the splits on the bar.

, You do not want your hands facing ""forward,"" (fingers pointing towards the mats, and you can see your knuckles) you want them ""backwards."" (Fingers pointing in the direction you're facing, and you can see your thumb.)

, If for some reason, you can't make it around the whole bar, you should hook your front leg (dominant leg) on the bar so that your shin and foot are on the other side of the bar, while your knee and thigh are on the suds closest to your body. This prevents you from the instinct to ""let go"" when you can't make it around the bar.

, Raising both of your legs up does two things: it propelled you to go faster (and further), while guarding your legs from friction with the bar, which makes very uncomfortable burn

, Don't push down just yet; this is the position you should assume before you officially start the stride circle.

, Remember, if you do not make it all the way around, hook your leg!

, Unless you have done this several times and know exactly how much to push down, you probably won't have enough momentum to travel the whole way. That is why it is exceptionally important to rely on your arm muscles the last quarter to get you up the bar.

Find a comfortable floor.,
Stretch well.,
Stand with a straight body.,
Crouch down.,
Push off through your legs.,
Continue to roll forward.,
Stand up.",How to Do a Somersault1," You should use a comfortable mat, a gym floor at your gymnastics school, or a floor with some cushion to do a somersault. If you use a hard surface, such as a wooden floor, then you're more likely to injure your head and neck.;
, You should stretch before you perform any gymnastics skill. For the somersault, there are a few key parts of your body that should be stretched well before you begin so you don't sprain a muscle or hurt yourself. Here's what you should do:









The pike stretch. Sit down with your legs straight out and reach forward toward your ankles with your arms to get a deep stretch in the back of your thighs and calves, as well as in your back.
The ankle roll. Sit down and hold on to the place just above your ankle and roll it a few times in one direction, then the other. Repeat with your other ankle.
The wrist stretch. Get on your hands and knees and put down your hands so that your fingers are facing your legs, not away from them. Move back and forth slightly with your palms down, and then flip your hands so that your palms are facing up while your fingers are still pointed toward your feet.
The neck stretch. Move your head from left to right and then up and down like you're nodding. Finish the neck stretch by rolling your head clockwise a few times, and then counter-clockwise.

, Stand straight up with your hands reaching up and your arms by your ears. Your palms should be facing out, slightly to each side. Your legs should be close together and there should be a slight arch in your back, with your head facing straight ahead of you. This is a classic beginning stance in gymnastics. If you feel more comfortable starting on the ground, however, you can skip this starting position and move straight to the floor.

, Tuck your legs and place your hands on either side of your feet, facing forward and several inches in front of each foot. Your chest should be resting on your thighs. Round your back and put your head down so that you're looking at your belly button. Remember that your head should never touch the ground in a somersault; holding this position will help keep your head above the ground. You'll actually be landing on your upper back, not on any part of your head.

, Lean forward as you push off through your feet and legs and make your hips come up over your head while your hands stay on the ground. Your arms and legs should straighten while still being a little bit bent as you roll forward and land on your back.








, Remember that your head and neck should never touch the ground; as you continue to roll, your upper back will touch the ground first as you roll onto the rest of your back before you come up. As you roll, keep your shoulders straight and even; if one shoulder moves before the other, you could hurt yourself and won't land the somersault in a straight position. No jumping is necessary to do a somersault -- in fact, this could cause injury -- all you need is to roll forward using the momentum generated by your legs.









Follow through. Your legs should be tucked as you finish the somersault, and you should land on your feet with your arms straight out in front of you.

, To finish the somersault, you should roll onto your feet and use your momentum to stand straight up, with your arms all the way up and your body straight once more.

Try a handstand somersault.,
Do a somersault kip-up.,
Do a dive somersault.",How to Do a Somersault2," This advanced move is a combination of a handstand and a somersault. Start with your legs spaced shoulder-width apart and your body straight. Do a handstand and pause for a moment while your legs are straight in the air. Keeping your legs together, bend your arms and lower your body toward the ground, then tuck in your chin and do a somersault. Finish in standing position with your hands over your head.


Since this move is rather difficult, you might want to try it with a spotter the first few times.
Be extra careful to tuck in your chin so that your head doesn't touch the ground at any time.

, This move is special because of the landing, which looks similar to a back handspring landing. Do a regular somersault, but instead of simply standing up, jump with both feet into a standing position. You'll need to do a fast somersault to get up enough momentum. Use your hands to help propel your body as you jump, then land on your feet and straighten your body with your arms above your head.

, If you really want to impress your friends, try this impressive variation on the basic somersault. Instead of starting in a fixed position, you run and then dive into the roll. Do a short headfirst dive, as though you were diving over a low log. Land on your hands, tuck in your head and immediately launch into a somersault. Move swiftly to your feet and finish with your body straight and your hands stretched over your head.


Don't attempt this move until you've completely mastered the somersault, handstand, front handspring and other advanced moves.
Once you get the hang of it, you can start making bigger dives.

Untuck and land firm.",How to Do a Standing Back Flip from the Ground," The safest way to learn how to back flip is under the tutelage of a qualified instructor.









An instructor can teach you the best technique, ensuring that you learn how to back flip safely, using the correct form.
You can find instructors with experience in back flips at gymnastics and cheerleading centers, or martial arts classes.;
, If you decide to go ahead with teaching yourself how to back flip at home, then please use a crash mat.


This will give you something soft to land on and potentially help you to avoid serious injury in case of a botched landing.
You should also practice your back flip on ground that has a bit of give (like grass) as this will absorb some of the shock when you land.

, It's also a good idea to have a friend or family member (who you trust) on hand to help you as you learn to back flip.









This person can spot you, by placing one hand on your back and one hand on the back of your thighs, helping you to feel more secure as you flip.
They can also be there just to watch you, encourage you and pick out any flaws in your form.

, The first exercise you should do in preparation for your back flip is to practice doing forward and backwards rolls. Make sure that you are rolling in a straight line, not tilting sideways.


If it helps, you can roll down an incline mat (or slightly downhill) at first.
This will help you to become comfortable with the rolling body movement and with being upside down.

, Possibly the most important part of performing a back flip is the ability to jump high off the ground.









Therefore, it's a good idea to practice your jumping technique and improve your jumping height as much as possible.
To begin with, just practice jumping straight off the ground. Bend your knees and swing your arms to build momentum and get as much lift as possible.
Then, you can practice jumping onto different surfaces, such as a bed, a box or a counter top - anything as long as it's above waist height. Jump onto the surface, landing in a sitting position, then (if you have space) tuck your knees and continue into a backward roll.

, A chin-up bar can be a really helpful tool in your back flip preparation, as it allows you to practice your tucking movement.









Use a chin-up bar with a height somewhere above your head, which you have to jump in order to reach.
Jump and grab the bar, then tuck your knees as tightly to your chest as possible. Though it's tempting, do not throw your head back
If you want, continue all the way through your arms and land back on your feet. This is the movement you will be trying to replicate when you perform an actual back flip.

, If you find that confidence is an issue and that your fear is preventing you from going through with the back flip, flipping on a trampoline is a good place to start, as you are guaranteed a soft landing even if you fall!


Use the trampolines at a trampoline center, where you have much more space and there are qualified instructors to help you. Backyard trampolines are too small and can be dangerous.
First, practice flipping when you are at the height of a large bounce. The trampoline will propel you into the air, giving you more time to complete the back flip than you would when flipping from the ground.
Next, try to practice your flip from a standing position on the trampoline. Once you've got that down, you're ready to try a back flip from the ground., Back flipping is a fairly strenuous activity, and it's pretty easy to strain a muscle if you're not careful. Make sure your body is fully warmed up before you flip, and pay special attention to stretching out your core, legs, ankles, arms, wrists and neck.

, Stand with your feet approximately one shoulder width apart, then rise up onto your toes and stretch your arms straight into the air.


Remember to keep your back straight (so your body is perpendicular to the ground) and your eyes facing straight ahead.
Standing on your toes will allow you to get more power in your jump and will also help you to achieve good form.

, Bend your knees until they form a 90 degree angle - any more or less will cause you to lose power.









As you bend, swing your arms backwards as far as possible. Make sure they are straight.

, Here's the scary part - the jump! Jump straight into the air, as high as possible, swinging your arms to create momentum.









Don't throw your head and arms backwards - this is incorrect and could cause injury. Instead, point your hands straight up and focus your eyes straight ahead.
You should also avoid arching your back, which needs to be as straight as possible. Contracting your stomach muscles helps.

, Tucking your knees will create the backwards momentum necessary to complete the flip.









So, when you reach the peak of your jump, draw your knees as close to your chest as possible and wrap your arms around them. The harder you tuck, the faster you will spin.
At this point you need to really commit to the flip - you can't panic or lose concentration - otherwise you might land on your head, which could result in serious injury.
Note that your head should still be in a neutral position, in line with your spine. It should not be thrown back., About halfway through the flip, when you are completely upside down, you need to spot your landing. This will help you land safely and make a successful backflip. Spotting your landing should come natural.


You can do this by tilting your head back just far enough so you can see the ground.
Try to pick out the exact spot you'll land on, as this will help you to gauge when to come out of your tuck.

, Once you've spotted your landing, let go of your knees and prepare to land.









Be aware that landing from a back flip places the same amount of stress on your legs as jumping from a height of five feet.
Therefore, you will need to land firmly to ensure that your legs don't crumple beneath you. You can do this by tensing your muscles and squeezing your legs together.
The landing can be a little tricky - so don't worry if you land on your hands and knees the first couple of times. A good landing will come with practice.

If you can graduate to doing one-handed cartwheels, that’s even better., In a number of ways, side flips have the same form as front flips with the leading steps, launch off the ground, and tucked rotation.Though not a requisite, already being comfortable with front flips will make the entire process come more naturally and easily.

, Since part of the difficulty of this trick is the mental block associated with fear from landing incorrectly, you can help overcome it by practicing with plenty of mats. Since this trick does require launching off your feet and gaining quite a bit of height, flipping onto gymnastics blocks is also a great way to practice, and they offer even more cushioning than mats., Another great way to help you get the motion down is with the help of a spotter. In addition to possibly giving you tips on how to launch better or tuck more tightly, a spotter can help you practice by allowing you to roll over his or her back. The motion isn’t exactly the same, but by leading up in the same manner, tucking in a similar manner, and exiting the tuck with your feet pointing perpendicular to your movement, you’re still practicing key aspects of side flips., The run up to a side flip is important because you need to transfer that forward energy into height when you actually jump into the flip.While you need good speed, you don’t want to be at a full sprint because that makes it much more difficult to plant your feet and spring off.


You can think of the ideal speed as more of a jog at 30-40% speed., As you take your last two or three steps before launching, keep the steps smooth and your feet low to the ground.If the steps are too jarring or your knees are coming up too high, then you’re going to have a much more difficult time pivoting to the side and punching your feet off the ground to transfer your forward momentum into height for the flip.


By making the final steps too high, you also prematurely transfer some of your forward momentum into downward momentum at the ground.You want to maximize the forward movement in order to transfer the motion into your jump as efficiently as possible.

, The punch in this case literally refers to when you punch your feet off the ground to launch into the side flip. The punch is the final contact your feet make with the ground before flipping. After your final lead up step, you want to turn your body 90° so that your side is facing the direction of the flip. You will make this turn with both feet in the air, and you will bring your feet closer together, so they hit the ground more like a spring on the punch.It doesn’t matter one way or the other whether you turn 90° to the left or to the right. You’ll most likely find it most comfortable to turn toward the same side you would for a cartwheel, and you’ll probably choose that direction almost instinctively.You can find a visual tutorial on this exact moment at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFTKeJi6D7k#t=229


, Your arm movement as you punch and launch will help with your body’s rotation. You will bring your arms up concurrently as you take your last stride and turn leading into your punch.


Some people prefer to bring their leading arm (if you’re flipping right side first, then your right arm) all the way up so that their shoulder is nearly touching their head.Others prefer to have both arms out in front of them rather than one above in order to swing both arms to help with rotation.You may find one position works better for you than the other.
For a visual representation of the arm movement, you can check: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFTKeJi6D7k#t=286


, In order to get the most height off your punch, you actually want to make the contact with the ground with your legs angled slightly against the direction you’re moving and with your knees bent slightly.It can be tough to visualize, but if you’re moving left to right across this page, for instance, then your legs would land more like \\.
The reason for this is that as you land and punch, your body still carries forward momentum and your legs are closer to upright by the time you actually launch off the ground. If you land with your legs upright, then by the time you jump, your body is already leaning closer to //, which causes you to launch forward at a lower height, making it more difficult to tuck, rotate, and land before hitting the ground again.If you’re having trouble visualizing this positioning, try looking at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFTKeJi6D7k#t=382


, At this point, you’ve made your 90° turn, brought your feet closer together, have your arms up, and have landed with your legs angled and knees slightly bent. Now is the point where you transfer all of that forward energy into upward height by springing off the ground.You can easily practice your run up and punch without actually tucking and rotating when you leave the ground. Practice this maneuver until you feel as though you’re transferring most of the momentum into vertical height rather than continuing forward and out.

, Your rotation for the side flip will come from your arms, head/chest, and your hips. As soon as your toes leave the ground, throw your arms and head into the direction of the flip.Since your arms are already up or out and prepped, this movement should be almost instantaneous.


If upon practicing the side flip on mats, you determine that you have trouble with under-rotating, then you are likely throwing your arms and head/chest into the flip too late or with too little force. Try consciously starting your rotation the moment your toes leave the ground to get more rotation out of your time in the air.

, In order to help transfer the rotational movement down from your upper body through your lower body, you’ll additionally pull your hips into the flip as well, which will help begin the process of bringing your legs up and over.Your inclination may be to shove your hips back and your butt out, but you should keep your butt aligned and push your hips to the side rather than back.In order to properly visualize this movement, you can check: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpMrFzb5rLM#t=59


, The same way a figure skater tucks into a ball to increase the speed of rotation, you need to tuck into a ball in order to flip faster. As you throw your arms, head, and hips into the rotation, you also want to bring your knees up and to tuck yourself into a ball as your legs go up and over yourself.By throwing your arms into the rotation in step 1, they will have moved from above you or in front of you to down closer to your legs. This makes it quite easy to grab your knees as you tuck them, which allows you to pull them in more tightly.You want to grab just below the kneecaps because at the knee can force your leg out and lower on the shin will force your leg back in an awkward position that makes it harder to land.The second leading reason for under-rotation is from not pulling in tightly enough. If you find you have too little time to tuck your legs, then make the effort to pull your legs in earlier; try to combine the effort of pulling your hips and bringing your legs up.

, Roughly halfway through your rotation, you’ll easily be able to spot the ground. As soon as you see the ground, use it to orient yourself, so you can start preparing to land.Some people may find it hard to land because they get disoriented as they flip around and try to spot the ground in such a quick movement. You may find it easier to lock your eyes at one spot ahead of you rather than trying to look down toward the groundBy locking your eyes on one object as you go around, you don’t have to spot the ground, simply extend your legs as the object returns to right-side up as your vision comes around.

, Once your legs are past the vertical point and coming back around toward the ground (around the 3/4 mark in the rotation), break the tucked position and extend your legs in order to land.This allows you to slow your rotation, and it also cushions your impact. You want your knees slightly bent and ready to absorb impact rather than rigidly straight.


If you find yourself over-rotating and stumbling forward as you land, then try extending your legs slightly earlier in the flip to slow your rotation sooner.

, You’ll have the softest landing by most evenly distributing the force of the landing. In order to do this, land with your feet roughly shoulder-width apart and land on the balls of your feet rather than your heels or toes.By landing with your feet shoulder-width apart, you both distribute the force and give yourself a sturdier center of gravity, meaning you’re less likely to lose your balance and fall down.
You’ll likely find that you initially round off during the flip and land facing backward rather than sideways.This is mostly from swinging your arms at an angle rather than directly into the side flip. It simply takes practice to correct.

Work with your spotter.",How to Do a Standing Back Tuck," For many people learning a standing back tuck on a trampoline, and then transitioning to the floor is the best way to proceed. Since many people struggle with getting enough height to complete a standing back tuck, using a trampoline helps.You absolutely must have a spotter for any work you are doing on the trampoline.;
, Make sure you give yourself plenty of room -- it takes 6–8 feet (1.8–2.4 m) of space to complete the move. If you have not mastered this, go no further. You cannot learn how to do a standing back tuck until you have a good back handspring technique. This move has you essentially throwing yourself backward, catching yourself on your hands and then hurling yourself back onto your feet. It takes a lot of flexibility, strength, and timing to master., One way to help get you higher is to do a bounce or two before you launch into the handspring. This will give you more bounce and start to mimic the height you are going to need for a back tuck.

, This will mean both jumping high and pulling your legs close to, if not actually on your chest. Between the high tucks and the back handsprings, these two drills will give you the components you need to complete a successful back tuck on the trampoline.

, To help you on a back tuck, a spotter needs be standing one one side of you. Whichever side feels more natural to your spotter. He or she needs to stand with legs shoulder width apart, and bent knees. He or she needs to place one hand behind your thigh and the other in the middle of your back. They will help you throw your legs over and keep your back supported. They are there to help you not crash and get through the back tuck. Once you are more confident, he or she will take a less-active role and be there to help if something goes wrong., Make sure your spotter is close in case you need help. Keep your feet together. Bend your knees. Keep your chest up and don’t bend your back., You need to be mentally ready and all in to do the back tuck. Know that you can do it. Have your spotter there if something goes wrong, but fully commit to the move both mentally and physically.

, This is the way that you generate power in the back tuck, so the jump is the most important part. By pushing off your toes, you can extend the jump. The higher your set is the better. When you jump up for your set, never look at the ground!

, It helps your momentum on the jump and also helps to protect your neck. With your arms up and a straight body, you will start a slight rotation as your body flies upward., Don’t throw your head back. You might even want to try with something under you chin to keep it in place -- like a pair of rolled-up socks. Most of the time, you need to be looking at your feet as they are moving through the air. Throwing your head back can throw off the timing and physics of the move., Once you think that you've reached the highest point on your set, drive your knees up. Grab the bottom of your knees. Keep in mind that grabbing the knees is not the most important part of the jump -- you can even do a back tuck without getting your arms involved. Even when you are driving up your knees you should still be looking up so that you don't throw your head back., At first it might be hard to land your back tuck, but as you continue it will get easier to stick the landing. Some of the first times, you might land on your knees. But keep practicing. When you land try not to step out too early that may cause injury to your ankles.

, Have your coach watch your standing back tuck and offer suggestions. He or she will undoubtedly have some tips for you to incorporate. You need to have really good technique before you move to the floor., Think about putting a mat on the trampoline to make it somewhere between a trampoline and a floor. Put a tumbling mat on top of the trampoline and attempt a standing back tuck. Practice this way until you master it and are ready to move to the floor., Take time to adjust from the trampoline. Ask your coach or spotter to help you make sure your handsprings look good. As you practice, work on making some of them high so that you can begin moving toward the back tuck.

, Be aware of how different it feels compared to your work on the trampoline. Keep your jumps high and bring your knees up.

, Using the techniques you learned on the trampoline, set yourself, jump high, pull in those knees, and get both feet down. Have your coach offer suggestions. Doing a good standing back tuck can take hundreds of repetitions before you master it -- 400-500 times at a minimum., Keep him or her in place until you feel very confident. He or she is there to help keep you from getting hurt."

Run for a few steps and then hop with your right foot. Lift you arms up as you hop with your right foot.Make sure you are running on your toes and are not flat-footed.


Make a line that marks the distance where you will start your run. The distance from where you start your run to where you plant your hands for your round off should be the length of your body plus the length of your arm.You can practice your round off without running first if you would like. If you can do a standing round off, you will definitely be able to do a running round off.;
, Make a wide step with your left leg, reach your arms forward, and plant your left hand (your fingers should be pointing to the left) at a 90 degree angle in the direction that your round off is going. Plant your right hand right after you plant your left hand. The fingers of your right hand should be pointing back towards your body.Swing up your right leg as you plant your left hand and extend your knees and ankles. Your right leg should stay in line with your trunk.
Keep your stomach tight as you make this movement.
Your arms and legs should be fully extended.

, Once both of your hands are on the ground, you can push yourself off of the ground. Shrug your shoulders upwards and push down on the ground with your hands. Your elbows should be straight as you are pushing.Keep your stomach muscles tight as you are pushing.
Your knees should also be straight during this movement as well.
Have a slight bend in your back as you are pushing. Your body should look like a banana.

, As you plant your hands,bring your legs into the air. Bring your legs together as you hit the handstand position (i.e. the midpoint of the round off). Do not bring your legs together too early or you will not have enough momentum to do your back tuck.It will take practice to get the timing right.
Bring your legs around as quickly as you can. A hard push will help you bring your feet to the ground quickly.

, Once you have reached the halfway point of the round off, you must turn your body to the left. You will land with your body facing the direction that you started your round off. Your body should be completely turned by the time you take your hands off the floor.You are jumping from your hands to your feet as you turn your body.
Do not turn anymore once your hands have left the ground.

, Your hips should be in line with your feet when you land. Since you are planning to follow your round off with a back tuck, land on the balls of your feet. Finish your round off with a rebound jump to prepare you to do a back tuck.Jump straight up during your rebound jump.
Do not lock your knees as you land. You do not want to hurt yourself.
Keep your hands in line with your head and trunk during your landing.

, Start with your feet together and your arms extended above your head. Stretch your body as far as you can with your shoulders right next to your ears. Tighten your abdominal muscles and stand on the balls of your feet.Inhale before you jump.
Look straight ahead and choose a spot to focus on.

, Swing your arms down to prepare for your jump. If you are a beginner, you will probably be more comfortable swinging your arms behind your back. However, for the best back tuck, stop your swing when your arms become horizontal.


Bend your knees to a 45 degree angle as you swing your arms down.
If you are beginner, bend your knees to a 90 degree angle as you swing your arms.
Keep your upper body straight as you swing. You will want to lean forward, but do your best to stay upright.

, As you swing your arms, extend your legs and jump. Fully extend your body before you begin to tuck your legs. Look straight ahead as you are jumping and keep your eyes on the focal point that you have chosen.


Exhale as you jump
Keep your abdominal muscles tight as you jump.

, Once you have reached the highest point and fully extended your body, tuck your legs and grab your shins. Bring your legs to your chest. Do not try to reach down and grab your legs. Stop looking at your focus point once you are in the tuck position.Round your back as you bring your knees and hands together.
Keep your abdominal muscles tight during the tuck.
Having good form during your tuck will help you rotate your body.

, To stop the rotation, open up your body and extend your legs. Lift your hands over your head and look straight forward. Keep your eyes open so that you can see the ground as you are landing.Land on the balls of your feet with your knees slightly bent
Your start position and your end position should look exactly the same.
Do not relax your abdominal muscles until you have completed the back tuck.

, Your round off rebound sets you up for your back tuck. If you have a weak rebound, you will not have a smooth transition between the two movements. Jump as high as you can when you land your round off. Imagine that you are trying to touch the ceiling.If you are having problems transitioning, practice landing your round off with your hands up in the air.
Focus on keeping your back straight and landing with your knees bent.
Before your rebound is finished, your body should be completely straight.

, At the highest point of your rebound, go into the tuck position. Try to squeeze your body into a tight ball. Having a tight tuck will help you rotate more quickly and rotate a full 360 degrees before you land.You can grab your shins or wrap your arms around your knees as you turn.
Keep your head straight during the tuck.

, If you are trying a round off back tuck for the first time, have someone spot you. A spotter can help you through your back tuck motion, point out your errors, and suggest adjustments to improve your round off back tuck. As you get better, your spotter will make gradual changes until you can do the round off back tuck completely on your own.Work with an experienced spotter who has helped someone before.
A spotter can also give you confidence if you are scared about doing the back tuck portion.

, The more repetitions you do, the better you will get. Repetitions can also help build your confidence. Practice on a mat or springboard at first. You will definitely fall a few times before you get the hang of it.


If you are struggling with a certain aspect of the round off back tuck, focus your practice to that area.
For example, if you want to improve the speed at which you bring your legs down during your round off, do a handstand and practice snapping your legs down as fast as you can.

, Many people have a fear of going backwards. While you may actually be physically prepared and have the skills needed to perform a round off back tuck, you may be held back by your mental state. Positive affirmations can help you get over this fear.Write down statements such as ""I enjoy doing round off back tucks"" or ""I look forward to practicing my round off back tuck.""
Take your affirmations with you to practice or say them out loud before, during, and after practice.

"
Know that, at a minimum, you should be able to do perfect forward rolls and front handsprings before even attempting a double or triple flip.

,
Know that you will need to master a single front flip before adding additional rotations.

",How to Do a Triple Front Flip1,","
"
Have some basic moves down first.,
Find a safe space.,
Get a running start.,
Jump up at a slight forward angle.,
Position yourself in the air.,
Tuck your legs.,
Bring your legs out of the tuck.,
Land on your feet.,
Troubleshoot to get it just right.",How to Do a Front Tuck," The first would be a somersault; preferably, you’ll be able to do several in a row. Next, and probably the most useful to learn, would be a front handspring. Both the somersault and handspring get you used to being upside down in the air. Practice both until you’re totally comfortable before moving on to the front tuck.


You’ll also need to be relatively in shape to do a successful front tuck. Flexibility is also a great help. Try doing a handstand, either free or against a wall; if that is too much physical exertion for you, you might want to reconsider taking on the front tuck.
If you haven't mastered these other moves, do not attempt a front tuck. The front tuck is a serious move that requires advanced gymnastic skills. If you attempt it too soon, it may lead to injury.;
, Ideally, you’ll be performing your first front tuck in a proper gymnasium with padded mats on the floor and walls. If you can help it, do your best to seek out a gymnasium in which to train if only to be sure of your own safety. For those without access to a gymnasium, consider using a carpeted room (at the very least) or someplace outdoors with very full grass.


Be sure to find a spot well away from any walls. There’s a chance of you falling to the side, or falling forward or flat at the end. You’ll want to reduce any chance of colliding with a wall (especially if they are not padded) by keeping clear.
Have someone with you in case you hurt yourself. While it’s unlikely you’ll be seriously injured in the course of attempting a front tuck, it’s never a bad idea to have someone else monitoring, just in case.

, While you won’t need room to get full speed, step back four or so paces from the spot you hope to jump from to begin your flip. You’ll need to take a few quick steps forward to begin your flip. These steps will provide you with the forward momentum you’ll need to complete your front tuck.Facing the direction you’d like to perform your flip, take three or four quick steps forward. For these steps, stay bouncy by stepping with your toes, heels in the air.
On the last step (before you jump with both legs) jump lightly as best as you can with whatever foot you end with (try having it be your dominant one). Again, step using the front of your feet so that you have a spring to your steps. Raise your arms above your head as you bounce to begin to prepare for the flip
Lean slightly forward during these initial steps before the jump; the added weight forward will help with your flip.

, After your last bouncy step, land hard with both legs. Land with your toes as with the running steps just taken; you’ll need the bounce that it will provide. You’ll want to jump up as high as you can, but don’t bend your knees low to get power. Jump as high as you can using your toes with your knees only slightly bent.You’ll jump straight up, but you’ll keep your shoulders leaning forwards and your arms up above your head, tilted slightly forward. Your arms and shoulders will drive the flip motion of your front tuck.
This may very well be the step that needs the most repeating. The most common problem for those on their first attempts will be a lack of jump height. If you find yourself unable to complete the front tuck on your feet, keep working at your jump or try on a trampoline surface.

, Once in the air, begin swinging your upper body forward. Your arms should follow, beginning to move down (almost perpendicular to your chest) to tuck in your legs. Keep your back straight as you move; the temptation to curve it inwards may be strong.


Tilt your head so that it looks to the ground. This is useful both for orienting yourself during your flip, but it puts your head forward along with your shoulders to help drive the motion of the front tuck.

, To perform the signature motion of the front tuck, you’ll need to bring your knees to your chest in order to form a sort of ball. In terms of timing, you’ll want to begin the tuck just as your torso first becomes parallel with the ground after your jump (you’ll be facing the ground). Bring your arms down to your knees and tuck them in tightly. Your chest should make good contact with your thighs and knees.Using a loose hold for this could cut your jump short, and have you landing other than on your feet. Be sure to move your knees to your chest with some force, both to have them in place quickly and to add that much more momentum.
By the time your torso is perpendicular with the ground again (with your head closest to it), your knees should be tightly tucked into your chest by your arms.
Keep your head neutral and in line with the rest of your back, which should be straight.

, Once your torso has swung forward some more and is now parallel with the ground again, begin to move your legs away from your chest. For a good timing indicator, this is when your head will be facing the ceiling or the sky.


Your arms should come away from your legs, but don’t fling them backwards. You want to provide as little force possible in the direction opposite your front tuck. Instead, relax them at your sides.
Like your arms, don’t force your legs outwards; keep them relaxed at an almost right angle to your body. Imagine the seated position, but laying on your back. This will position your feet to catch your body after the last turn.
As in the previous step, keep your head relaxed and in line with the rest of your back. You may begin to tilt it forward as you finish your rotation in order to have a better look at where you’re landing.

, Though a front tuck requires a blind landing, you should have some sense of the ground if you’ve tilted your head forward into the final rotation. If everything in the front tuck has gone as it should, you should simply land on your feet without issue. Right as you land your knees should be bent into a right angle (formed by calf and thigh); pop up with your back straight and arms above your head for a showy finish.There’s a good chance in your first tries that you’ll under-rotate. Be sure not to try to put your arms out behind you to catch yourself; you’re likely to hurt them instead. It’s better to do your best and rotate to land flat on your back or side.
If you over-rotate, do your best to re-tuck your legs and roll out of it, either forward or to the side. Depending on where you come out, you may need to put your arms out to avoid landing on your head.

, If at all possible, try using a friend or coach as a spotter to help you learn the moves. Have the spotter rest both hands gently on either side of your abdomen. Then, they’ll move with you as you execute your front tuck. The spotter will have a much better perspective on what went wrong (if anything), so it's useful to have someone involved to help with troubleshooting.


Again, the most common problem will be to lack jump height. Fortunately, this will be fairly obvious when it’s the case; you’ll find yourself unable to complete the flip on your feet, landing instead on your side or bottom. Nothing more to do in this instance than practice and work on leg strength (your calves in particular).
Another common problem with those first trying the front tuck will be to untuck their legs either too early or too late. This is an issue that’s a little more simple to notice with a spotter or someone watching. Try practicing tucking/untucking on the ground (on your back) to get a sense of the speed at which to do it (it’ll be faster than you think).

Stretch your hamstrings. Stand up and fold one of your legs up until your ankle reaches your butt. Hold on to your ankle and pull your foot back until you feel the stretch.
Stretch your neck and shoulders. Roll your shoulders forward and back and roll your head clockwise and then counter-clockwise in a circular motion.;
, This move will help you gain vertical momentum. Focus on the force of your jump upward, not down to the ground. Practice taking a few running steps, then bending your knees slightly and jumping straight up with your hands high in the air, with your elbows by your ears.










Practice your landing too. You'll land with knees bent, at about a foot lower than your regular standing position, with your arms up straight in front of you.
After you land with your feet on the ground, you can straighten your body and lift your arms in the air for a graceful finish.
Once you've finished practicing the basic ""punch jump,"" you can repeat the ""punch jump"" while tucking your knees up toward your chest instead of keeping them straight as you jump.
Once you get the jump down, you can move on to practice the rotation.

, Start with the ""punch jump"" and then tuck your knees as you rotate forward, landing with your knees bent before you straighten up. Do this on a trampoline or into a pit until you feel comfortable enough to do it on the floor. You'll be adding a rotation to the ""punch jump"" to execute the flip on the trampoline.










Have a knowledgeable spotter stand by you as you practice the flip. The spotter should keep his hand on or near your stomach so he can help you rotate forward.

, Practice the same front flip skills while standing on a gymnastics block that faces a soft and durable mat. This will help get you even more comfortable than trying to do this on a trampoline. This will be harder because you won't have the extra upward bounce that the trampoline gave you, so you'll have to work on gathering your own momentum.










Work on going up more instead of leaning forward. Though you may think that leaning forward will help you land on your feet, you'll actually be making it harder for yourself to complete the rotation because you won't be gaining as much height.

, Once you've mastered the trampoline and gymnastics blocks and are comfortable doing a front flip without a spotter, it's time to find a sturdy and bouncy gymnastics mat that will help you do the flip. Though you'll be doing this on the floor, the gymnastics mat has more bounce that a regular floor, so it will help give you upward momentum. To do a front flip, just string together all of the steps that you've mastered while practicing while adding a rotation.










Start with the punch jump, tuck your knees, and rotate forward while keeping your hands around or near your shins.
Land with your knees bent and your arms in front of you, and then straighten your body and raise your arms straight up for your finish.

, A forward roll can be done indoors on a gym mat or outside in the grass. Look for a flat space where you'll have plenty of room. Alternatively, you can do a forward roll on a downward incline and use gravity to help you move into the roll.








, Squat with your feet together. Place your feet together and bend your knees so that you're squatting. Place your hands on the ground in front of you with your elbows bent. Your hands should be evenly spaced at shoulder width. This is the starting position for a beginner's forward roll.









Alternatively, you can start in an upright standing position with your hands stretched straight over your head. Pike your body forward and bend your knees to move into a squatting position to start the roll.

, Be sure to tuck in your chin. As you move into the roll, you don't want to place weight on your neck - it should move directly onto your upper back. Tucking in your chin will help ensure that you don't put pressure on your neck.








, Push over onto your upper back, so that your body rolls forward and your hips are pushed over your head. Follow the curve of your spine as you roll. Keep your back curved and keep your hands in position.








Do not roll from side to side - roll straight forward along your spine. Otherwise, you may fall to one side or the other.
Be sure to keep your chin tucked in and your back curved. If you straighten out, your roll won't have as much momentum.

, Throughout the roll, your legs should stay straight and your toes pointed. Bend your legs only at the end of the roll, when it's time to stand up. This is the standard positioning for a beginner's forward roll.









However, some gymnasts prefer to tuck in the legs during a forward roll. If it helps you gain momentum to keep your legs tucked, you can practice that way, too.

, At the end of the roll, place your feet flat on the floor and move into a standing position without putting your hands on the ground. Straighten your legs, then finish upright with your hands over your head.







, This advanced variation starts with a basic handstand. Start with your legs spaced apart and your body upright. Move into a handstand and pause for a moment. Instead of kicking out of the handstand, bend your arms and lower your body toward the ground, then tuck your head and move into a forward roll. Finish in a standing position with your hands stretched over your head. In a correct handstand foward roll your arms stay straight and you curve your back and roll. But doing one with bent arms is perfectly fine too.








Before you attempt a handstand forward roll, be sure you've mastered both the handstand and the forward roll separately.
You might want to work with a spotter to do the handstand forward roll, to ensure that you don't get injured when you drop into the roll.

, This move begins the same way as the standard forward roll. Instead of completing the roll and standing up, kick your legs outward and lunge your body out of the roll, so that you jump with both feet into a standing position. The ending of a forward roll kip-up looks similar to the a back handspring landing.









Use your hands to help propel your body off the ground to jump into your landing.
When both feet are firmly planted on the ground, raise your body upright and end with your arms extended over your head.

, This impressive advanced variation requires diving into the roll instead of starting in a fixed position. Begin by doing a short headfirst dive, as though you have a small log to dive over, and support your body with your hands as you move into a roll. As you get used to diving, you can make the dives bigger.

If you can do the skills listed above, you may be able to attempt a front hand spring on soft surfaces like mats, or a trampoline. While these are true, you should have some gymnastics or acrobatic experience, have developed upper-body strength, and should be comfortable doing a handstand.
You should also know how to do a front walkover. The front handspring is a faster, more advanced version of a front walkover.;
, You should always stretch before attempting a front handspring or any other gymnastics skill. Stretch your wrists by holding your hands in front of your body and pulling your fingers back, and stretch your ankles by sitting and rolling each ankle in a circular motion.









Stretch out your shoulders by rolling your shoulders back a few times and then rolling them forward.
Stretch your neck by rolling your head clockwise a few times and then rolling it counterclockwise.
Stretch out your back by standing and leaning down to touch your toes.

, The most ideal surface is a padded mat. If you don't have a padded mat and are comfortable with your skills, use a very soft grassy surface.

After you get used to this, try to do round off twos. These exercises will help stretch you out and prepare your muscles for the standing back tuck.;
, Research has proven that visualizing something helps in doing the same thing physically. So practicing a back flip in your mind would help you to do it physically., A spotter is someone, usually a trainer, coach, or experienced gymnast, who will help hold you and give you good posture while you try your first back tuck. Not only will they help you jump more into the air, but they'll also be able to give you great advice on anything you may be doing wrong, as well as safeguard against injury.

, Mats ensure that any accidental falls won't be devastating for you. They're also a great psychological motivator: If you're not worried about falling down (don't worry, you shouldn't fall!) you'll jump higher and have better posture.



For beginners: try folding a mat up and standing on top of that for your first couple back tucks. This will give you a little extra space (you'll be higher than the ground) to do the back tuck in the air.

For advanced gymnasts: try jumping back onto a folded-up mat. Instead of having more space in the air to tuck and land, you'll have less. This is a great technique if you're already pretty good at tucking and want to improve your technique!

, Pretend that there's a string tied to each of your hands that's being pulled upwards. This will help you extend your arms all the way up and straighten out your body.

, Before you do a back tuck, practice swinging your arms upward as you jump. This will give you the momentum you need to get high enough to actually do the back tuck.


Remember to jump up first and not backward. Many beginners believe that because the back tuck is a backward somersault in the air, they need to backward first. The proper technique for back tucks is jumping up first. This will give you the height needed to tuck your legs and then move backward.

, Bring your legs nearly up to your chest as you jump upward. The momentum of bringing your legs into your chest will help make the backward jump much easier.


Try practicing the leg to chest tuck on the ground first. Lie down with your back on a mat and your arms up above your head, as they are in the starting position. (Have a spotter hold your arms there, or pin them underneath something heavy but still comfortable.) Then practice, as quickly as you can, lifting your legs up to your chest, simulating the same motion of the back tuck. Bring them up quickly and then back down, repeating.

, You've bent your knees, jumped up, and then brought your knees into your chest while starting to lean back. If you can, try to make yourself small at the top of your jump.

, Never land with straight knees. This will seriously hurt, and could put you at risk for hyperextended knees. Try to land with your knees bent so that they can absorb some of the shock of the landing.

, Quickly get your balance by straightening your bent knees and thrusting your arms back up into the air. Your final stance should look almost identical to the way that you started.

, That's pretty much how you do a back tuck. Not too hard, is it? After practicing all the small fundamentals — jumping, tucking, landing, snapping up — you should begin to get the feel for what a back tuck feels like as one fluid motion. Don't be afraid to work with a trainer or spotter in the early going; never attempt these tumbles alone if it's your first time.

Stretch.,
Do a backbend kickover.,
Shift your weight into your hands.,
Start strong.,
Follow through.,
Land gracefully.",How to Do a Back Walkover," Before you attempt the back walkover, you should have some basic gymnastics skills, strength, and coordination. You'll know that you're ready if the following things are true:









If you can easily do a backbend. You have to be able to stick your backbend every time before you can move on to a tougher skill. You also have to make sure you are able to do a backbend kickover. If you can't do this you can't do a back walkover.
If you have the strength. Your arms and shoulders should be strong enough to support your body while you're in the backbend position. If you're not strong enough, then you'll feel unsteady and strained when you try to hold a backbend for any amount of time.;
, You should always stretch before you attempt to do a bridge, backbend, a back walkover, or any athletic feat at all. Before you attempt the back walkover, you should make sure to warm up by stretching your wrists, ankles, your back, your legs and neck. Here are some stretches to do:









Stretch your ankles. Sit down and hold your ankle with one hand, while rolling your ankle or even spelling out the alphabet with your foot. Stretch both ankles equally.
Stretch your wrists. Extend one hand with your palm away from you, and pull your fingers back with the other until you feel a nice stretch. Then do the same with the other hand. Next, hold your wrist with one hand while you roll the wrist of the hand you're holding, and repeat.
Stretch your back. This is the most important stretch of all. You should stretch your back with some simple yoga poses, such as the camel pose, bow pose, or cobra pose.

, Before you attempt a back walkover, you should be able to master the backbend kickover. This will help you get comfortable with kicking over with one leg, and will make it easier for you to transition into doing it in one fluid motion. Here's how to stick the backbend kickover:









First, do a backbend. Here's how you do it:

Stand tall with your legs apart at a distance wider than your shoulders.
Raise your arms above your head. Keep your arms near your ears with your palms facing the ceiling.
Slowly bend backwards until you plant your hands on the ground. You should be looking between your hands.



, This will make it easier to lift your leg and kick over.









If kicking over is hard then practice getting into a bridge and lifting the leg you kick over with up and down.
Push your shoulders over your hands in the bridge position. This will help get your weight over your hands and make it easier to kick over.
Lift one leg in the air. Pick your dominant leg. If you're a rightie, then your right leg is probably your dominant leg.
Then, push away from the floor with the foot that is planted off the ground. Make sure to keep your elbows locked as you kick over.
You will briefly be standing on your hands with your legs in a split position. Then you will move all the way over and will be standing upright to complete the backbend kickover.

, Always remember to keep your arms straight. Once you've mastered the backbend kickover, you will be ready to do a back walkover. You will just be taking the skills you developed during the back kickover and will move them into one fluid motion. First, you'll have to start with confidence and skill. Here's what to do:



Remember that you should always have a spotter when you try a new skill for the first time. The spotter should put one hand on your back, and one hand under the thigh of your kicking leg.
Stand tall, with your arms in the air. Pretend your arms are glued to your ears.
Point your lead leg about a foot in front of your other leg.

, Once you're positioned correctly, it's time to start bending backwards. Eventually the back walkover should be one synchronized fluid motion and should only take a few seconds, but you can take it a bit more slowly at first. Here's how to follow through:









Begin to bend backwards. Make sure to arch your back. Push your hips forward. Do not put any weight on your lead leg, it will slow you down and it won't be a fluid motion.
Kick your lead leg back. Move it as if you're doing a split in the air. By the time your hands hit the ground, your lead leg should be high in the air. Your fingers should be facing the same direction as your toes. Your base leg should stay on the floor until your hands are on the floor.
There will be a point when both legs are in the air and you're in the handstand position, so make sure to push down on your hands and keep your elbows locked, because your arms and shoulders will be your only support.

, Once you're close to planting your feet on the ground, you should make sure you are set up for a graceful landing. The landing will be the thing that ties all of your back walkover together, so it's important to finish strong. Here's what to do:









Land on your lead leg first.
Plant your base leg just a second later. This should look like one fluid motion.
Raise your arms in the air. Make sure your arms are straight. Point your lead leg to the floor, just as you did in the beginning.

Keep your feet apart as you land.",How to Backflip off a Wall," Running at a wall can make doing the backflip more daunting even if the wall does help boost you off the ground. You may be more comfortable backflipping off a wall if you already knows how to backflip elsewhere. You can try How to Backflip on a Trampoline and How to Do a Backflip first if you feel like you need to build up to backflipping off a wall.









Another plus of backflipping in place or on a trampoline is that it's easier to incorporate a safety mat, which reduces the risk of injury.;
, Fitness and gymnastics instructors alike are both used to helping people perfect their form and avoid injury. A coach of spotter can help you learn how to backflip in a variety of ways.









Initially, a coach may help you practice jumping with a slight backward rotation while standing behind you to stop you from actually turning over. This is also a great way to help you practice jumping while tucking your knees without actually flipping.As you advance in the process, a coach can help with your backflip form by placing one hand on your lower back and another on the back of your thigh. When you actually backflip, the back hand helps act as a fulcrum for you to rotate around and the thigh hand will push up and over to help give you momentum.The coach/spotter will gradually apply less force and let you do more of the work.

, One of the best ways to practice backflipping off a wall safely is to land on a few stacked landing mats. Instead of running straight at the wall, approach at a 45-degree angle. Place the landing mats immediately beside the point where you will launch off the wall. The angle and the launch will propel you over the landing mats to land. This allows you to practice getting the flip motion while being able to land on your knees or butt without the risk of injury.








Once you can land on your feet on the mats, which are stacked higher than the floor, you will have more confidence in your ability to make the full backflip when you try it without them.

, Make sure all surfaces are dry and that you can get traction on the wall. If possible, you should also consider placing down a gymnastics mat to help your landing while you practice.








, Your approach to the wall is very important since it fuels your momentum through the entire flip. Practice running up to the wall several times and get an idea of the best placement for your final step before you plant your foot on the wall based on your personal stride.









You don’t actually need to run full speed at the wall. Think of the wall as a launch ramp. Too much forward momentum toward the wall will make it difficult to transfer that motion upward and into the flip., Since your dominant leg will offer the most power to plant on the wall and push off it, you want the last step before reaching the wall to be on your non-dominant leg.








If during any of your practice rounds, you reach the wall on the wrong foot, stop and start over.

, Since you need to transfer your forward momentum toward the wall into upward momentum off the wall, don’t take a standard forward stride on the final step. Instead, give a small jump or hop that allows you to plant your dominant foot higher on the wall, which will give you more height and clearance for the flip.







, You want the toes of your dominant foot to contact the wall and create your source of traction to push off.







, When you push off the wall, you want to be able to push both up and out. To achieve this, you want to have the shin on your dominant leg as close to vertical as possible.








By pushing up and out, you give yourself more height off the wall and more distance away from it to complete your backflip.
If your shin is closer to horizontal, then your foot will be flat against the wall, which means you’ll only push yourself out and not up. This is dangerous and a good way to hit your head.If the top of your shin is angled too far toward the wall instead of up, your toes won’t get traction on the wall, which can easily cause your foot to slip off and result in your simply colliding with the wall., Giving yourself both upward and backward momentum off the wall is the key to starting the backflip successfully. You want to launch off the wall at close to an upward 45-degree angle rather than simply pushing yourself backward off it.







, Without actually rotating into a backflip, practice every other step so far. Run up to the wall with your feet planted properly, contact the wall with the toes on your dominant foot, and use the contact force to spring up and back at a 45-degree angle. Once you feel comfortable with this, you can try adding in the backflip.








, As you plant your foot on the wall, start to bring your arms up. You want them to be in full swing by the time you push off in order to provide more momentum into the backflip.








You want your elbows crooked at about a 90-degree angle rather than having your arms straight out. If your arms are straight, you can very easily slam your fists into the wall as you swing your arms up over your head., Just after you push off the wall, kick the other leg up and over to help give you full rotational momentum. Combined with your swinging arms, this will deliver enough force to bring you fully around.







, Much like a figure skater tucking her arms in to gain rotational speed in a spin, you want to tuck your body to help backflip with the least resistance. This means that as you follow through with the kick motion, you want to bring both legs up as though you were crouching in air during your backflip.







, You will be tempted to crane your head and neck back to follow the trajectory of your spin, but this will cause your upper body to stretch out rather than tuck into a ball. Instead, try to keep your eyes trained on the wall as your legs come around and tuck into the ball.By looking forward, you ensure that you end up with the most rotational speed possible.









Since your head is roughly at the center of the fulcrum, it will actually be the last thing to spin, and it will whip around the fastest after all the rest of the inertia is going.

, As your legs and hips come up and over, they will block your view of the wall, but as your body comes fully around and your keep your head vertically oriented, you will regain a visual with the wall. This is when it’s time to open your body and slow yourself to land.







, Once you have come fully around and can see the wall in front of you again, push your knees down toward the ground. This will decelerate you as well as getting your feet down to land.








Your knees will still be slightly bent when you put them back under you. If you just straighten your legs completely, they will end up too far ahead of you. This can result in you landing on your heels, which will make you stumble backward and potentially fall., If you land with your feet together, you are much more likely to land off-balance and stumble. Keep your feet apart to give yourself a larger center of gravity.

Straighten your arms.",How to Do a Backward Roll," Start in a squat position. Hold your hands close to the body with the palms flat towards the ceiling. They should be shoulder height. Drop your butt down like you are sitting. Roll back while lifting your legs straight. That should put the pressure on your hands and your shoulders. Roll forward again.As you get used to the exercise, start pushing with your hands to lift yourself off the floor a little bit. You are working yourself up to being able to push yourself over without hurting your neck.;
, This helps you to protect your neck and learn how to roll in a straight line.To do a backward roll, you need enough abdominal strength to lift your legs and hips over your head. You also need enough arm strength to push your body over and protect your neck.

, One way to learn the basic movement of a backward roll is to use a wedge. Sit on the higher end of a wedge. Hold your hands close to your body. Face the palms flat towards the ceiling. Tuck the chin. Roll backwards down the wedge. Reach for the mat while keeping your hands close to your shoulders. Kick your toes over your head to roll yourself. Land on your feet., If you are still unable to complete the roll, ask someone to spot you. The spotter stands to your side. As you roll back into your backward roll, the spotter will grab your hips. They lift your hips as they help guide your body over while keeping the pressure off your neck.Spotters help you learn correct hand placement. They also can help you build enough arm strength to push yourself off the ground.

, Start with your knees together and your back straight. Your thighs should be parallel to the floor.Hold your hands out in front of you if you need help balancing.
As you begin master the backward roll, start trying to begin in a standing position., Bend your arms close to your body. Place your palms facing towards the ceiling just above your shoulders. Tuck your chin to your chest like you are looking at your bellybutton.This is called having ""pizza hands."" Your hands are flat like you are carrying two pizzas in them.

, From the squat position, drop your butt down by bending your legs. Push back with your heels. You'll start to roll onto your back.


Another way to think about dropping down is to treat it like you are sitting down.Make sure that your back is rounded as you fall back onto it.
Keep your legs together. Don't let them separate.

, As you roll backwards, keep your knees tucked to your chest. Roll quickly enough so that you get some momentum. Your weight needs to shift from your lower back to your upper back then to your hands.As the knees and legs start to go over your head, push with your arms and shoulders.Drive the backward roll by moving your toes over your head, not by throwing your neck and head backwards. You should engage your hands and arms when your body rolls towards your neck. You always want to protect the neck and head.If you've kept your hands in the flat position, they should easily make contact with the floor so you can push yourself over. Your hands will be flat against the floor while your elbows will be pointing towards the ceiling.

, As you straighten your arms, your hips will start to lift up. This will roll your body over your head. Land on your feet.If you land on your knees, try tucking yourself into a tighter ball.

,


Jump straight up as high as you can. Bend your knees and powerfully push your body up towards the sky. Use your arms to help you reach higher, and land on the balls of your feet. Do this several times. The idea is to increase your vertical leap so that you get enough height when doing the flip.
Repeat with a running head start. Jog a few steps, hop, plant your feet and punch up with the balls of your feet as high as you can.
Practice forward rolls from a standing position. Stand, roll, and stand. This will allow you to get a feel for how you will tuck in the air.
Combine the above. Take a running start, jump high, and tuck in (but don't flip!). Bring your knees to your chest at the highest point. You don't need to hold your knees, but you can if you want.

Jump a bit up and forward on a dive and slightly tuck your head inward towards your chest. You should feel your body starting to rotate without much well...effort.


, Don't run so fast that you throw yourself off balance when you plant, and don't run so slow that you can't complete the flip. Many people have a tendency to run fast, thinking this will make for a powerful flip, but they often end up not jumping high enough, which results in landing on their back. A fast jog is sufficient.

, Your feet should be planted at about your shoulders' width but further forwards than your shoulders to help get you the explosive height that you need. Lift your arms while you jump, so that your arms are above your head as your feet hit the ground.Quick tip do not stomp on ground . It takes your height away from your jump push off with the balls of your feet not the whole foot. In the next step, your arms will be thrown up and forward to generate more spin for your flip.


Jump before you flip. Don't tuck your head until after your feet leave the ground, or you may not get the full rotation., It's quite possible to do a good front flip without your arms swinging, but it does make things a lot easier. Remember to ""punch"" off the ground with your feet to achieve maximum height. To help your body go up rather than forward, look up at the ceiling as you jump. You don't have to turn your face all the way up--just enough so you can see the ceiling above you.

, Try to spread your legs slightly when you tuck rather than having your knees touching each other. This gives you a smaller profile and therefore a faster rotation. It can also help to avoid injury to the face. A knee is much stronger than a nose and will break it.


Keep your tuck tight, not loose. If you don't tuck tightly enough with your shoulders, your landing will be unbalanced and sloppy.

, Some people suggest ""looking"" for your landing, but it's not as easy as it sounds to watch the ground while you're whirling in a circle. ""Feel"" your way through the flip.


Don't untuck too soon. You will land leaning backwards and fall on your rear. Hold the tuck a bit before opening.

, Bend your knees as you land to absorb some of the force, and use your arms to balance yourself so you don't fall forwards or backwards. Always land on the balls of your feet.

Take cold showers.,
Complete other tasks while the water heats up.,
Time yourself.,
Try the ""navy shower.",How to Shower Quickly1," If the water is cold, you may find that you're less inclined to wallow in the shower. Jump into the shower as soon as you turn it on, and try to keep the shower on for under two minutes. Beyond efficiency, cold showers can increase alertness, improve circulation, stimulate weight loss, ease stress, and speed muscle recovery., If you don't want to jump right into a cold shower, turn on the water and complete other tasks while the stream warms. Depending on the efficiency of your water heater and the number of other people taking showers, your system might heat up almost immediately, or it might take as long as a few minutes. Find a few quick tasks that you can complete while you're waiting.


Get undressed. Lay out your post-shower outfit. Quickly prepare anything else you might need for the day.
Take out your shower supplies. Prepare your shampoo, conditioner, soap, powder, deodorant, towel, and anything else that you'll need.
Brush your teeth while the water warms up. Once the water is warm, you can finish brushing your teeth in the shower. Spit out the toothpaste and wash your brush in the shower to save water and time.

, Consider setting an alarm for one, two, or three minutes, depending on how quick of a shower you want to take. Train yourself to race against the clock. When the alarm goes off, get out of the shower, even if you aren't completely done. With the pressure on, you may find new ways to optimize your routine. Challenge yourself to speed up your showers by at least a few seconds every week.,""Use the first thirty seconds to get yourself wet. Then, turn off the water during the middle portion of the shower while you lather up with soap. Finally, turn the water back on to rinse off in a minute or less. This is a great way to save water and energy, and it might well spur you to take shorter showers."

Clean your bathroom.,
Choose a good time.,
Set up a solid plan.,
Select a couple of items to add to your bath.,
Draw a bath.,
Pour bubble bath into the running water.,
Add bath salts.,
Add a few drops of essential oils.,
Put rose petals on top of the water.,
Set out a loofah or sponged.,
Light candles.,
Create a playlist.,
Prepare a tray with treats.,
Have towels ready.",How to Set up a Romantic Bath," It will be difficult to create a romantic atmosphere in a dirty bathroom. To set up the most romantic evening possible, you'll need to make sure nothing in the bathroom is dirty or grimy. This includes not only the bathtub, but the rest of your bathroom as well. Mop or sweep the floor, wash out the bathtub, and clean all surfaces, including the sink.It’s not necessary to spend hours cleaning, but making the bathroom look presentable is important.;
, The best time is when you know you will be uninterrupted. Unanticipated guests or interruptions can quickly ruin a romantic mood. Make sure roommates or children will be away so that you and your partner are able to relax without fear of being interrupted. If you live with other people, ask when they will be out to get a good idea for a date and time to plan the bath.You can bribe your roommates with a favor, like cleaning when it’s not your turn, in favor of some alone time with your partner at home.

, Make sure your partner will be available when you set up the bath. Nothing will dampen the mood like being informed that your partner is suddenly busy, or will be coming home much later than expected. Set up a time with your partner, and ask that they stick with it. You can secure up a time by sending out a cute, handwritten invitation that says something like: “You are invited to join me this evening for a romantic bubble bath.”If you want to keep it a surprise, you can tell your partner that you need them home to help you with something at a certain time.

, Too many additions might make the water overly fragrant or look too crowded. Limit the amount of things you put in your bath to three or four components. These items can be roses, essential oils, bath salts, and bubble bath. Make a list of what you want to put in the bath, and make sure you have everything before preparing the bath.You can buy all of the ingredients at most supermarkets. For nicer essential oils and bubble baths, look for a store like Bath and Body Works.

, Don’t run a bath too long before your partner gets home, or it will run cold. You should run the bath about ten minutes before you are expecting to get into the bath. It’s better to make the water a little hotter than comfortable because it will cool down before you step into it. Let the bathtub fill up to a comfortable level that will be full enough, but not overfilled.

, Adding bubble bath to the water while the tub is filling up adds a mood of both frivolity and romance. Look for more scents such as vanilla, rather than using the same fruity-scented bubbles you would put in a child's bath. Don’t overdo the bubbles to the point that they flow out of the bath, but add in enough that the bathtub is filled with them. The bubbles will fade quicker than expected., Bath salts help soften skin and usually add pleasant scents and colors to your bath. These are available at most bed and bath shops, as well as some specialty or beauty supply stores. Epsom salts and sea salts are examples of salts that you can add to your bath.Epsom and sea salt also help to detoxify skin.

, Adding a couple drops of essential oils, such as lavender, jasmine, or cedar wood, to the bathwater introduces aromatherapy into your romantic soak. The oils smell great, but they can also affect your mood. They can make you feel relaxed or invigorated. Make sure not to add in too many drops, especially if your bubble bath is scented.Lavender oil is great for relaxation.
Lemon oil is good for invigoration.

, Rose petals sprinkled on top of the water add a romantic and fragrant effect to your bath. You can also blend a few cups of rose petals with blender filled with warm water to make a puree. Swirl it into the hot bathwater, or massage it on each other during the bath.You can also spread some rose petals throughout your bathroom for an added romantic effect.

, Gather or purchase large sponges or loofahs to use while you are soaking in the tub. The more absorbent the sponges are, the better, because it allows you to squeeze the warm water over body parts that are not submerged. Use the loofah to rub on your partner during the bath.Make sure the loofah or sponge is clean before using.

, Set the scene by lighting candles around the bathroom. You can also set candles around the edge of the tub if the rim is wide enough that you won't knock them over. Tea light candles are great because they usually come with plenty in a package to set up. Any type of candle will work though.Turn off the lights so your bathroom is illuminated only by candlelight.

, Make a playlist beforehand to ensure you have a constant stream of your favorite romantic music playing during your bath. Try to find music choices that you both enjoy. Set up speakers or a music playing device ahead of time, and keep all electronic devices far away from the water to avoid electrocution. You can use an smartphone hooked up to a speaker, or a CD player., Prepare a tray with glasses of champagne or wine and strawberries or grapes to enjoy with your partner while soaking in the bath. Set the tray on a small table near the tub so it is easy for you both to access. There are also trays made to fit over each side of the bathtub, so that you can have the tray in the bathtub with you.If your partner does not drink, set out a glass with sparking juice or another one of their favorite drinks.

, Have fluffy towels or bathrobes ready for when you are ready to get out of the bath. As an extra loving touch, warm the towels or robes ahead of time in the dryer or using a towel warmer. If you don’t have a dryer or towel warmer, you can set your oven to 150 °F (65.6 °C), place the towels in a clean roasting pan, and cover the pan with foil. Keep the towels in the oven only long enough for them to get warm."

Be efficient with shampoo and conditioner.,
Wash your hair with a 2-in-1 shampoo conditioner.,
Use high water pressure to wet your hair quickly.,
Consider not washing your hair.",How to Shower Quickly2," Squeeze a dollop of shampoo onto your hand, then quickly and thoroughly mix it into your hair. Let it sit for thirty seconds while you wash your body or perform another shower task. Then, wash the shampoo out while you squeeze a bit of conditioner into your palm. Run the conditioner through your hair, then let it sit for up to a minute as you shave, exfoliate, or perform another shower task. Wash the conditioner of your hair and get out of the shower.

, Look for a cleansing conditioner product that contains a 1:3 ratio of shampoo to conditioner. This way, you can clean your hair while you condition it. It may be easier to shower quickly if you don't need to take the time to apply and rinse out two separate hair-care products., Long or thick hair may take more time to wash than shorter cuts. If your shower has a nozzle with adjustable water pressure, turn on a jet stream so the water sprays harder. The more quickly your hair gets wet, the more quickly you can wash it.

, If you're in a hurry, try foregoing the shampoo and conditioner for the day. Get your hair wet, but don't use any time-consuming hair products. You do not need to shampoo your hair every day.If you're feeling dirty, but you're in an extreme rush, consider leaving your hair dry altogether. Use a shower cap to keep the moisture out, or simply hold your hair out of the shower stream.

Lather soap efficiently.,
Exfoliate.,
Shave in the shower.",How to Shower Quickly3," Squeeze a dollop of soap onto your hand, and spread your palm and fingers as wide as possible. Use your outstretched hand to quickly and efficiently cover the maximum surface area of your body. You may be surprised how much area your hands can cover when they're fully spread out. For instance, you may be able to lather each leg in one pass if you can almost reach around them.


Try using a scrubber or loofah with body wash already applied. This can be a great way to cover surface area.
Work symmetrically with both hands, lathering each side of your body at the same time. Lather each side of your chest and torso, under both arms, up both legs – all in tandem, with your hands spread out. This technique also works with lathering your hair quickly, as well as for drying off quickly.

, If exfoliation is part of your daily routine, consider doing it in the shower so that it's easier to wash off the skin particles. This is not a way to shower more quickly, per se – but it may help you streamline your general morning routine., You might need to look in the mirror to shave your face, but you can shave other parts of your body while the water streams around you. Try shaving your chest, your legs, or any other area that needs a touch-up. Lather up with lotion or shaving cream. Shave gently and methodically, and let the water wash away the loose hairs.


This works best for just a touch-up shave. If your body is very hairy, then you run the risk of clogging the shower drain.

Ask your kids what they enjoy doing in the bath.,
Play races.,
Sit down next to your kids at the bathtub and talk to them about how animals take a bath or keep clean.,
Make a fun bath sponge.,
Make bath slime.,
Change the colour of the bath.,
Have fun with the bar of soap.",How to Make Bath Time Fun for Kids," Take their advice to heart and stock up on the things they love for bath time. Suitable fun items for bath time include:


Bath toys
Bath stickies and foam creatures or shapes
Bubble bath
Floating objects, such as a ball, toys, bottle, etc.
Soap crayons
Animal washcloths
Bubble blowing gear.;
, Have the children choose favorite toy boats or other floating objects. Place the boats at one end of the bath and count down: Ready, Set, Go! They're only allowed to make small waves to move the boats to the other end. The first one there is the winner.


Wind-up boats or toys suitable for bath use can make races a lot of fun too. Have each kid wind them up together and release them at the same time to save fights. If there's only one kid, have two wind-ups going against each other (one could be yours).

, Tell them that they have to be in the bath before you'll start talking. Then start talking about the different ways that animals keep clean. For example, rhinos need help from a special bird to pick the bugs off the rhino's hide, chimpanzees have other chimps pick dirt off their fur, zebras and horses roll around in the dirt, cats lick themselves clean, and elephants bathe in dust or water. Think of different ways to turn this into a game, such as:


Have the kids choose 5 new animals at the end of each bath for you to talk about at the next night's bath; you can quickly research the answers online.
Have the kids imitate the cleaning movements of the animals they're learning about.
Try to match the same animals with toy plastic animals for the kids to pretend to ""clean"".
Follow their cues for fun game ideas.

, This craft can be the prelude to the bath. Spend time making it together, then run the bath and have your kids try out their funky new toy. Here's how to make it:


Find a fairly wide plastic tube. One end is covered and the other is not. Use a small plastic hook with a small hole at the bottom of it big enough to fit some string.
Cut two slits in the tube, about a centimetre long, and do the same on the opposite side.
Grab a piece of paper or card and fold it up so that it's as wide as the tube and 1 centimeter (0.4 in) longer than the tube. Place it in firmly, into the box.
Make a hook. Cut out two identical circles, make sure they have holes in the centre.
Wrap some wool around it, (a bit like making a pom-pom – if you know how to make a pom-pom, make one.)
Keep on wrapping it until it becomes fatter than a doughnut. Wrap a 25 centimeter (9.8 in) length wool, through the hole in the pom-pom, and make sure these are equal length, at the top when you stretch it.
At the top, twist the lengths of wool and poke them through the hole in the hook, tie a knot, if there is some spare just cut it off. The bath sponge is done.
With the paper or card in the tube, fill each side with coloured liquid. Add some water to make it nice and bubbly. Now the fun starts!
With the sponge, dip it in the tube and then get going. Let your kids do whatever they want. If they draw on the tiles or wall next to the bath, simply wipe it off.

, Another fun craft to get the kids really excited about bath time! Put together 1 packet of unflavoured gelatin (about 1 tablespoon), 1/2 cup lemon juice, 4 drops of green food colouring, a microwave-proof container, and a small plastic container.


In a microwave-proof container, add the gelatin, lemon juice, and food colouring.
Put into the microwave. Heat on high for 45 seconds to 1 minute.
Remove it from the microwave once the gelatin has dissolved. Place the container in the refrigerator for half an hour. This will allow it to set.
Spoon the slime into a plastic container. A clean yogurt or margarine container are ideal. Take it to the bathroom.
Tell your kids they're allowed to be green slimy monsters. Have them smear it all over themselves while the bath is filling up. Suggest they scare the bath toys while they're being green monsters.
Once they've had enough fun being green monsters, it's into the bath with a washcloth and soap. The green slime will rinse off.

, Kids love baths that are different colours. Use food colouring to make the bath blue, orange, green, pink, etc. Commercial coloured fizzy bath tablets made just for kids' baths are also fun if you can locate some.

, For a kid, soap is more than just an item to get clean with!






Play ""Find the soap"". Drop the soap into a bath filled with bubbles. Now have your kid try to find it – without using his or her hands!
Rub the soap into a huge lather and let your kid make a beard or moustache from it.
Let your kid carve his or her initials into the soap. This can be their soap for the week.
Suggest that your kid try to hold the soap in any number of ways apart from in their hands. Between their feet, under the arm, in the crook of their elbow, etc. This one's a lot of fun!
Use the soap for skimming across the bath, in the same manner as skimming stones on ponds.

Find something to do the backflip off of.,
Get on top of the platform you have decided on.,
Determine whether or not your platform is stable, and then take your stance.,

,
Finished.

",How to Backflip off a Raised Platform," Your platform should not be too high off the ground, but it should also not be too low to the ground. Something about waist height is preferable, although something higher can be used, if you're feeling courageous.


Do NOT use anything lower than waist height if you cannot perform a backflip prior to attempting this stunt. To do so could cause you to under-spin, and result in landing on your neck, and serious injury
;
,


Move around, shift your weight, and make sure that your platform does not move. If it shifts under your weight, or wiggles when you lean, you should not perform a flip off of this surface. It could fall over, and end up in a severe injury on your part.

,


The best stance is to have your heels slightly over the edge of the platform, so that you are leaping from the balls of your feet.

,, That is, bend your knees and balance on the balls of your feet while leaning your upper body forward. Jumping while standing with your foot flat on the ground is not recommended, as you will gain maximum height and spin by jumping from the balls of your feet. Also, raise your arms behind you, keeping your forearms at a ninety-degree angle with your upper arms.


To give an idea, your forearms should be perpendicular to your upper legs. Just make sure that your arms are pulled back, so that you can fling them forward and up to add to your spin.

, While your knees are unbending for the jump, you should also be throwing your arms, to begin the spin. Straighten your back, and then arch it as you make it into the air.


The arch of your back and the location of your arms should be similar. -- I.e., if your arms are pulled all the way back, your back should be completely arched.

,


Pulling yourself into a tight ball will increase your rotation speed, and can help when you're jumping off of a low platform. Don't try this when you're jumping off of something high, however, or you might over-spin.

Knowing when to slow your rotation by leaving this balled position is the key to landing correctly. Just before the rotation is completed, unfold your legs, and hold your arms out to your sides, to slow the spin.



, Keep your arms raised at your sides, to keep your balance, so you don't fall over when you land.


If your backflip is from a high object, such as a balcony, do not attempt to remain standing. Instead, as soon as you land, bend your knees, and perform a backward roll, to continue your momentum.

Attempting to land a 'high-risk' backflip without rolling is dangerous, and can result in a broken ankle(s) or leg(s).

Choose a natural cleanser.,
Bathe in warm water.,
Gently wash and dry your skin.,

Include more omega-3 fatty acids in your diet.",How to Prevent Dry Skin As You Age," Harsh soaps that contain alcohol, fragrances, deodorant and other chemical scan remove moisture from your skin so you should avoid them. Instead, choose a plant-oil based soap. Look for a soap that contains glycerin, jojoba oil, coconut oil or almond oil. These will clean your skin while adding much-needed moisture.


You can also bathe without soap or choose a soap-free cleanser.;
, Since too much water on your body can actually dry your skin, take fewer baths or shower every other day. Always use warm water instead of steaming hot water since hot water can strip your skin of natural oils. Warm water is less drying than hot water. When you do bathe, keep the bath or shower around five to 10 minutes long.Avoid adding bath oils to your water. This can make your bathtub slippery and increase the risk of falling., You should use just your hands to wash your skin. But if you want to use washcloths, scrub brushes or poufs, be gentle since rough washing can damage delicate aging skin. When you're ready to dry off, consider air drying for a few minutes before applying a moisturizer.If you want to dry off with a towel, pat yourself dry instead of rubbing. This is gentler on your skin.

, Research natural products (like jojoba oil, olive oil, or shea butter) that don't contain fragrance since these can cause allergic reactions. Look up products on the Environmental Working Group's online database to determine if a moisturizer contains toxic ingredients or has been linked to allergic reactions or cancer. You should also look for products with ingredients that help your skin hold in water while smoothing out wrinkles. These ingredients include:Ceramides
Glycerin
Hyaluronic acid
Lanolin
Linoleic, linolenic, and lauric acids (these are emollients)

, Don't wait to apply a moisturizer. Since creams and ointments work by locking in moisture, your skin will stay better hydrated if you apply moisturizer while it's still damp from a shower or bath. Try to do this within three minutes of bathing.Remember to reapply moisturizer throughout the day as your skin begins to feel dry. Aim to moisturize your skin at least twice a day., Some sunscreens are marketed as being moisturizing which can prevent dry skin. Choose a sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30. The label should say that it's broad spectrum (meaning that it will block both UVA and UVB radiation). Use enough sunscreen to fill a shot glass to cover your body, and reapply sunscreen every two hours throughout the day.The sun's rays can cause premature aging, wrinkling, and drying of your skin. This is why it's important to use sunscreen every day.
If you have trouble applying a lotion sunscreen, consider using a spray-on sunscreen.

, If you know you'll be exposed to the sun, you should also wear physical protection like hats, sunglasses, long pants, and long sleeves. If the weather is warm, make sure your clothing is loose-fitting. You can wear natural fibers (like cotton, linen, and silk) to keep you cool and wick away moisture.You should also wear sunglasses that block UVA and UVB rays. While this won't keep your skin dry, it can protect your eyes from damaging rays.

, If you use tanning beds or lay out in the sun, you should think about stopping. The U.S. Department of Health and World Health Organization have both declared UV radiation from tanning and sunning to be a known carcinogen (meaning that it causes cancer). This UV radiation prematurely ages your skin, adding wrinkles and drying the skin.You should also limit the amount of time you spend outdoors in the full sun. Limit your exposure during the hours of 10am and 3pm. This includes cloudy days.

, Since the air is drier during winter months, most people experience some dry skin. It's especially important to protect your skin from the elements by wearing gloves, scarves, and hats. You should also avoid damaging your skin by sitting in front of the fire or other heat sources.


It may help to run a humidifier. A humidifier will introduce moisture into the air, which can prevent your skin from drying out., Dry skin is a normal part of aging, but if nothing give you improved skin within two to three weeks, call your physician or dermatologist for a consultation. You may have a medical condition that is associated with dry skin. Your doctor or dermatologist can diagnose or rule out one of these conditions:Eczema
Atopic dermatitis
Fungal infections (like athlete’s foot)
Seborrheic dermatitis
Thyroid diseases
Psoriasis
Sjogren’s Syndrome

, Studies have shown that people drink less water as they age. As you age, you may need to learn to drink more water, even if you're not thirsty. Try to drink water throughout the day, especially if you pinch your skin and it remains tented for several seconds (a sign that you're not well hydrated).Women should aim for nine 8-oz glasses (2.2 liters) daily and men should aim for 13 (3 liters). If you are in a hot environment, exercising, or sweating, you may need to drink more., Smoking can cause your skin to age faster than exposure to UV radiation from sunlight (or tanning beds). Research on smoking and premature aging of the skin shows that smoking reduces your skin's elasticity, increases the development of wrinkles, and can cause skin discoloration and loss of skin tone.Talk with your doctor about resources that will help you quit smoking. Cessation aids, support groups, and medications are all available to help you quit.

, Antioxidants may reduce the signs of aging in the skin. Some anti-aging creams contain these antioxidants, but research shows that the best form of antioxidants comes from your diet. You can also take them in supplement form (according to the manufacturer's instructions). Try to include vitamins A, C, D, E, beta carotenoids, and polyphenols.Some of the best food sources of these antioxidants include:Tomatoes
Strawberries
Citrus: oranges, grapefruit, lemons, limes
Cantaloupe
Apricots
Broccoli
Sweet potatoes
Spinach

, A diet high in omega-3 fatty acids can protect your skin as you age while keeping your skin hydrated. Omega-3 fatty acids do this by preserving the collagen in your skin. Fish (like salmon, mackerel, sardines, and albacore tuna) and shellfish are great sources of omega-3 fatty acids. For plant-based sources of omega-3s, try:Seeds: flaxseed, chia seeds, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, sesame seeds
Oils: hemp oil, soya oil, canola oil
Leafy green vegetables
Avocados
Walnuts

Possible properties include:






Moisturizing
Skin whitening
Blocking UV rays
Priming the skin
Tinting the skin
Refracting light to make skin look more radiant
Providing anti-aging components
Enriching the skin with vitamins


You should also research the manufacturer of the BB Cream. Only purchase a cream from a reputable company.;
, No matter how reputable the cosmetic company is or what the BB Cream claims to offer, each type will work differently for different people. Reading reviews will help you understand if the product is both high-quality and right for you.

Pay close attention to reviews that mention skin tone, skin type, and skin condition so that you can gauge how applicable the experience is to your set of circumstances.

, Different skin types have different needs as far as cosmetics go. For the most effective experience, choose a product that is geared toward oily skin, normal skin, or dry skin, depending on which skin type applies to you.


If you have oily skin, consider a BB Cream with a matte finish. Gravitate toward those containing natural plant extracts, as well. This skin type tends to be sensitive, and a BB Cream with natural extracts is less likely to cause a reaction.
If you have normal skin, consider a moisturizing BB Cream that can make your skin appear smoother. You could also look fr one with a skin whitener in it if you need help balancing your skin tone.
If you have dry skin, look for a BB Cream with a watery consistency instead of a thick cream, since thick creams can cause excess dryness. You should also look for moisturizing formulas.

, BB Creams tend not to have a wide variety of shades, but most will have some range of shades. The tone that comes closest to your natural skin tone will likely suit you best.


When comparing tones, compare the tone of the BB Cream to the skin of your face and neck. Do not compare it to your hands, since the skin on your hands can be a slightly different shade than the skin on your face.

, Get a sample and wear it around during the day. Check the way it looks in both natural and artificial light.Lighting can make a big difference in the way a cream looks. The lighting in a cosmetics store may not give you an accurate idea of how the cream looks on your skin once you walk outside. As a result, it is better to wear the cream in a variety of settings for a few hours before making a purchase.

, Most people prefer to use their fingers to apply BB Cream since it tends to be the easiest method.


Balmy BB Creams should be applied with the hands since the heat of your skin melts it, making it easier to apply.
Applying BB Cream with your fingers will produce a less smooth result than applying it with a sponge or brush, though.

, Squeeze a puddle of BB Cream roughly 3/4 inch (1.9 cm) in diameter, or the size of a dime, onto the back of your hand.


Strictly speaking, this is not essential. It will make it easier to dab the cream on in equal portions, however.

, Dab the cream on your fingertip onto your face. Only apply it in dots: one in the middle of the forehead, one on the tip of the nose, one on your left cheek, one on your right cheek, and one on your chin.


The dots of BB Cream should be about equal in amount.
Do not apply the cream in streaks or in large splotches. You should use the cream sparsely, apply a thin layer to avoid making your skin look too heavy or weighted down.

, Use your index and middle fingers to gently pat the cream in. Rub the BB Cream into your skin using a circular motion, but instead of keeping your fingers in contact with your skin for the entire motion, tap your fingers up and down as you rub.


This gentle, light pressure spreads the cream evenly without irritating your skin.
Start with the forehead and work your way down toward each cheek from the middle. Move onto your nose and chin after that, then finish off with your cheeks.

, If you are not fond of the patting technique, you can apply gently pressure with your index and middle fingertips. Blend each dab of cream using outward strokes.


As before, start with the forehead before working your way to the nose and chin. Finish with the cheeks.

, Use even gentler pressure when you reach the eye area, regardless of whether your are patting or blending the cream on in strokes.


By using a gentle patting pressure near your eyes, you prevent the fine lines that may show up when the dragging, stroke motion strains the skin around your eye, which is especially sensitive.

, Wait a few minutes for the BB Cream to dry. After it dries, if there are any particular areas in need of extra coverage, you can dab another thin layer of BB Cream over them.


Note that you may never achieve a purely flawless look with BB Cream, since it tends to even out the skin tone more than it covers imperfections.

, Sponge application is most suitable for people with oily skin.


When you have oily skin, applying BB Cream with your fingers can add further oil to the skin on your face.
A brush is less forceful, so when you have oily skin, you may have difficulty spreading the BB Cream evenly when you use a brush.

, Lightly spritz the makeup sponge with a moisturizing facial mist before using it to apply your BB Cream.


Using a sponge can throw the moisture levels of your skin off, so using a moisturizing facial mist can help prevent this.
Spraying the sponge with a mist beforehand will also allow you to spread the cream more smoothly while keeping as much of the cream on your face as possible instead of losing it all in your sponge.

, Squeeze a puddle of BB Cream roughly 3/4 inch (1.9 cm) in diameter, or the size of a dime, onto the back of your hand.


Strictly speaking, this is not essential. It will make it easier to dab the cream on in equal portions, however.

, Dip the tip of your middle finger into the puddle of BB Cream on the back of your hand. Dab the cream on your fingertip onto your face. Only apply it in dots: one in the middle of the forehead, one on the tip of the nose, one on your left cheek, one on your right cheek, and one on your chin.


Even though you will be blending the BB Cream in using a makeup sponge, you should still dab the initial amount onto your skin using your fingers in order to control the amount better.
The dots of BB Cream should be about equal in amount.
Do not apply the cream in streaks or in large splotches. You should use the cream sparsely, apply a thin layer to avoid making your skin look too heavy or weighted down.

, Rub the BB Cream into your skin using firm, even, outward strokes.


Apply enough pressure to make your skin “jiggle” or move slightly from the vibration.
Start from the forehead and work your way out toward the sides of your forehead from the center. Focus on your nose and chin next. Finish by firmly rubbing the BB Cream on your cheeks into your skin using outward strokes.

, The area around your eye is more sensitive, so hard pressure can cause damage to the skin. Blend the BB Cream on in this area using a patting motion.


You can either use your fingers or the sponge for this part. If you feel like you have less control over spread and pressure with the sponge, switch to your fingers.
By using a gentle patting pressure near your eyes, you prevent the fine lines that may show up when the dragging, stroke motion strains the skin around your eye, which is especially sensitive.

, This method is best if you have dry skin and works especially well with liquid BB creams.


Note that it is not generally recommended for thick, balmy creams.
If you have dry skin, using your fingers to apply the product can irritate your already irritated skin, causing it to become drier.
Additionally, using a sponge can be too forceful and may rob your skin of what little moisture it has.

, Squeeze a puddle of BB Cream roughly 3/4 inch (1.9 cm) in diameter, or the size of a dime, into the palm of your hand.


Strictly speaking, this is not essential. It will make it easier to dab the cream on in equal portions, however.
Use the palm of your hand with this method rather than the back of your hand. The palm of your hand has more heat, so it can warm up and liquify the BB Cream more effectively than the back of your hand. As such, it makes the cream easier to spread, especially if the cream is somewhat balmy in consistency.

, Dip the tip of your middle finger into the puddle of BB Cream in the palm of your hand. Dab the cream on your fingertip onto your face. Only apply it in dots: one in the middle of the forehead, one on the tip of the nose, one on your left cheek, one on your right cheek, and one on your chin.


Even though you will be blending the BB Cream in using a makeup brush, you should still dab the initial amount onto your skin using your fingers in order to control the amount better.
The dots of BB Cream should be about equal in amount.
Do not apply the cream in streaks or in large splotches. You should use the cream sparsely, apply a thin layer to avoid making your skin look too heavy or weighted down.

, Use even, firm, outward brush strokes to spread the cream over your face and into your skin.


A brushstroke will naturally be a little softer and a little gentler than a stroke with your fingers or a sponge. As such, you should not be afraid to use a little pressure.
Work from your forehead out. Start at the center of your forehead and brush the cream out toward the top and side. Brush the cream on your nose up and down and the cream on your chin side to side. Blend the cream on your cheeks in all directions until it meets with the ending point of each previous area.

, The area around your eye is more sensitive, so hard pressure can cause damage to the skin. Blend the BB Cream on in this area using a patting motion.


You can either use your fingers or the brush for this part. In general, it is harder to apply hard pressure with a brush, making it ideal for the eye area.
By using a gentle patting pressure near your eyes, you prevent the fine lines that may show up when the dragging, stroke motion strains the skin around your eye, which is especially sensitive.

Choose a concealer that is lighter than your natural skin tone and dab enough concealer onto the bruise to cover it entirely. Pat the concealer onto the bruise using a fingertip or makeup sponge. Then, blend it in well using your fingertips or the sponge.









You can also look for a concealer that has a yellow base to help offset the bluish color of the bruise.
If your bruise has other color tones, then a different type of concealer may work better. For example, you can use a green based concealer for red bruises, white based concealer for brown bruises, and lavender based for yellow bruises.;
, After you have covered the bruise with a layer of concealer, follow it up with a layer of foundation.This will help to even out the tone and provide more coverage. Use your fingertips or a makeup sponge to pat on the foundation and blend it in.









Apply the foundation over your whole face for best results. Do not just apply it to one cheek or one side of your face or there will be a noticeable difference in the color.

, This will also help to keep the makeup in place.









Apply the powder over your whole face as well. This will help to ensure that you have a uniform look.
You may need to reapply the powder throughout the day. Try taking the powder compact with you and check the makeup once every few hours.

Remove ALL of your makeup.",How to Apply Colorguard Makeup," Like with regular makeup, guard makeup will stick to your face better if you use a foundation first, but make sure it's light. If the foundation is too heavy, the colors and designs that you will be putting on your face later won't look as good, and will probably be more likely to smear. It is also a good idea to use an eye primer if at all possible, but it's alright to use regular facial foundation around your eyes. However, skip the powder, because more than likely, you will be using eyeliner on your face, and it will make a big mess. Apply a nude lipliner to your lips too, to help keep your lipstick from fading.;
, Again, you're not going to school, you're performing. Apply eyeliner in either black or a bright color to your top and bottom lids, and make sure it is heavy enough to be seen from a reasonable distance. Also, if you need to have designs on your face, use eyeliner to outline them at this point. Liquid, waterproof eyeliner is great because sweat won't run it off your face.

, Use an eyelash curler on your lashes for maximum effect. Then, apply at least two coats of your choice color of mascara. If using colors, your mascara should probably match your eyeliner color, unless you're going for a certain look, like the sun. If not using a color, use black. Brown or clear mascara will not make as big of an impact on the audience.

, This is probably the most important part of colorguard makeup, because eyeshadow is the most attention-grabbing and noticeable thing when you're performing. Make sure to get a vividly-colored eyeshadow and apply it very heavily so it can be seen. Make sure to blend the eyeshadow so there are no harsh lines, or spottiness in the color.

, This is pretty much self-explanatory. Use whatever lipstick matches your makeup. Make sure to exfoliate and moisturize your lips before putting it on; it will stay better. Apply multiple coats then use a tissue paper and bloat your lipstick apply another coat and hold a tissue paper over your lips then take a powder and go over the tissue paper. This helps your lipstick stay on longer and be more pigmented,

, Experiment with many looks. Work with your whole team to come up with the best look for your show. If you're the captain, accept ideas from everyone. Don't just stick to the conventional. Try glitter, swirls, stars, etc. on different parts of the face. Remember, eyeliner isn't just for eyes! Explore the possibilities of blue or gold face paint, don't be afraid of anything, always keep an open mind about your makeup.

,, Getting all of the makeup off is very important. If you don't, you could end up with skin or eye problems, plus it will look odd. Use baby oil to get eye makeup off, it's very effective, and regular facial wash is good for the rest of your face. Make sure you use moisturizer afterward, because excessive scrubbing will be needed, and this dries out your face like no other.

Go for a cool red (that has blueish tones), which will balance out the warm orange tones.Experiment with true tangerine shades, as well – these can also complement fair skin.;
, Peach, coral and persimmon shades tend to be muted, making them easier to wear than some of the brighter orange shades. They can warm up a light complexion without dominating or overpowering the overall look.The pink undertones of these shades help make them accessible.

, Olive skin has a naturally tanned appearance that combines really well with true orange, as well as bold shades like electric orange.Look for spicy shades like fiery tangerine and chili pepper for a vibrant pop of color that complements your skin tone perfectly., Bold pops of color look great when paired with dark skin tones. Try a bright, true orange in a matte formula for a punch of high-intensity color.If true orange feels too bright, opt for a shade that has deep reddish undertones, like blood orange. These shades are fiery and vibrant, while also being slightly easier to wear than true oranges., Glosses and shimmery lipsticks are great, but intense colors like orange work best in matte. The bright color will already catch eyes, so you don’t need to add any shine. Additionally, glossy products will not stay on or remain as opaque as a matte lipstick., Dark, matte orange lipstick can be a daunting look to pull off. If you like the orange hues, you don’t need to start with a matte lipstick right out of the gate. Instead, try using a less intense lip stain.


If you already have a great matte lipstick, try dabbing it on lightly with your fingertip.
Once you get used to the idea of orange lips, you can build up the color and apply it more daringly., Lipstick, especially matte formulas, look best on smooth, hydrated lips. Before applying yours, use an exfoliating scrub to remove any flaky, dead skin. Rub the lip scrub into your lips using your fingertips, a washcloth, or an old toothbrush. Wash the lip scrub off your lips with warm water.You can purchase a lip scrub at your local beauty supply store, or you can make one yourself.
After you’ve exfoliated your lips, apply a very light layer of lip balm to give them some moisture.

, It’s important to perfect the shape of your lips with lip liner before applying your orange lipstick. The lipstick is difficult to remove from skin, so you want to set yourself up for success by outlining first with liner. This will also help prevent the lipstick from smudging outside the border of your lips later on., Then carefully trace your top lip to the outer corners of your mouth. Trace the center of your bottom lip, so that you create a small line. Once you’ve lined the center, bring your liner to the outer corners again.If you want, you can fill your entire lips in with liner at this point. This will create a base for your lipstick and can help it last all day.

, Careful application is key when it comes to pulling off this bold look. The brightness will make mistakes very apparent. Slowly dab the lipstick on your upper and lower lips. Take care to stay within the borders you’ve created with liner., After you’ve applied your orange shade, blot your lips on a piece of paper. This helps remove any excess product that could eventually wind up on your teeth. Check your handiwork in a mirror under good lighting, and you’re all set!, The great thing about this striking lipstick color is that it adds a big pop of color to any outfit, particularly darker outfits. Wearing a black top with black jeans can look pretty plain, but add a pair of orange lips and you instantly make the look brighter and trendier. Whenever you feel like your outfit may be plain, orange lipstick can save the day., Wearing complementary colors together is a great way to catch eyes and make a statement. With orange lips, this means embracing blue outfits. Play around with the different shades of blue. Orange lips will look striking against everything from sky blue, cobalt blue, royal blue, to even navy blue., Orange lipsticks will warm up your complexion, so embrace this warmth with fun florals. Mix and match different floral patterns together for an ultra-trendy look, or pair an orange pout with your favorite spring sundress. Orange can certainly be worn year-round, but its warmth lends itself perfectly to vibrant spring patterns."

Skip the lotion.,
Apply a heavy foundation that matches your skin tone.,
Use concealer for darker bruises.,
Try a little red lipstick mixed with concealer.",How to Cover Up a Bruise2," When you apply lotion before applying foundation to your body, the foundation may not stay put as well. Therefore, it is best to skip the lotion or to at least avoid applying lotion to the area that is bruised.If your skin is very dry, then apply a light layer of a lightweight lotion before using the foundation.

, You can purchase a foundation that is meant to be applied on your body, or just buy a full coverage foundation.Apply about a dime sized amount on the bruised area and blend it well with your fingertips.









Theater makeup also works well for covering body bruises.

, If you have an extra dark bruise that still peaks through the foundation, then you may need to spot treat it with some concealer. Gently dab the concealer onto the bruised area with your fingertips or using a makeup sponge.








Opt for a skin tone colored concealer in a shade that is slightly lighter than your natural skin tone.

, Mixing your concealer with a bit of orangish red lipstick may also help to hide the bruise. Mix a small amount of orangish red lipstick in with your concealer to create a peachy or pink tone. Then, apply the makeup mixture to your bruise.








After you apply the pink makeup mixture to your bruise, blend it well and then cover it with a layer or two of skin toned concealer.

Use clothing and accessories to cover up the bruise.,
Wear a strong eye or lip look.Creating a strong eye look or wearing some bold lipstick may help to distract people’s attention away from the bruised area.,
Put on an interesting accessory.",How to Cover Up a Bruise3," Physically covering the bruise with clothing may also help. Consider the location of the bruise and check your wardrobe to see what clothing and accessories you have that might help you to cover it up.


If the bruise is on your arm or leg, then wearing a long sleeved shirt or pants is an easy way to cover it up. However, this is not always possible, especially in hot weather.
If the bruise is near your hairline or on your forehead, then wearing a scarf, headband, or hat may provide coverage.
If the bruise is on your eye or near the bridge of your nose, then wearing a pair of sunglasses or your prescription glasses may help., Keep in mind that this will not cover the bruise, but it may help to draw people’s attention away from it.


For example, you could apply some black eye liner with a couple of layers of mascara to create a dramatic eye look, or opt for a bright red lipstick to draw attention to your lips instead.

, If you have some really long dangly earrings or a statement necklace, then this might be the day to wear them. Putting on some interesting accessories will not cover the bruise, but it can help to pull the focus away from it.


For example, if you have some large hoop earrings or a necklace with a large pendant, then these might help to distract away from the bruise.

Refresh your makeup throughout the day.",How to Apply Makeup to Dry Skin," No matter what kind of skin you have, always wash your face before putting on makeup. This will give you the ideal canvas for your makeup by leaving skin fresh and ready for anything you put on it. It also will wash away any leftover makeup or products that you may have used. This will prevent breakouts and clogged pores.Use a gentle face wash formulated for dry skin to wash your face. Face washes meant for normal or oily skin will be too aggressive, and could cause dryness to get worse.;
, After washing your face, apply moisturizer to your skin, focusing it on the driest areas. For many, the area around the nose and the space between the eyebrows tend to be the driest areas.Use an extra-hydrating moisturizer formulated for dry skin.
Apply enough moisturizer so that it gets absorbed by the skin, but not so much that the skin feels greasy with moisturizer.

, Primer is a sheer, gel-like base that goes on skin before applying makeup. For dry skin, primer is especially useful because it gives your skin a smoother base, so that makeup can be applied without getting stuck to dry patches of skin. To apply primer, take a dot of it on your finger and pat it into sections of the face.Do not apply too much primer. In general, use one dot for small areas like your chin and nose, and two dots for larger areas like your cheeks or forehead.

, Eye primer helps eyeshadow and eyeliner glide on smoother, and makes eye makeup more blendable. It also is often tinted to give your eyelid a more uniform color. If your eyelids are dry, they may appear red or irritated. Eye primer will moisturize without making your lids too oily, and will help combat discoloration.Apply one dot of eye primer to each lid and pat it on with your fingertip.

, If you suffer from dry skin, your lips may also be chapped. Chapped lips make it almost impossible to apply lipstick or other lip products smoothly. Patchy lipstick is one of the most obvious makeup faux pas, so make sure to use a layer of chapstick before you apply your makeup., Make sure you are using foundation and concealer meant for dry skin. Foundation meant for dry skin is packed with more moisture than foundation meant for oily or normal skin, meaning that it will glide on easier and keep your skin feeling enriched and fresh, as opposed to making it feel depleted.Don’t overlook the importance of the right foundation. Applying foundation smoothly is often the biggest struggle for those with dry skin, so if you think your foundation may not be working for you, it may be best to invest in a new one.
If you feel like drugstore-quality foundation isn't working for you, visit a high-end makeup store like Sephora or Mac. Tell a sales associate that you are looking for a foundation for dry skin. Sample several foundations and apply them until you find one that works for your skin.

, If you are using powder foundation, this may be the cause of some of your makeup woes. Powder foundation is great for people with oily skin, because it helps to absorb excess oil and moisture on the skin. However, it you have dry skin as it is, using powder foundation will only leave your skin more dried out than before. The powder will cling to the dry areas of your face, making foundation look patchy, especially from up close.Buy a liquid foundation at the drugstore or at makeup stores like Ulta or Sephora.
Also make sure to use a cream concealer as opposed to a stick concealer.

, Pick an area of your face to start applying foundation. Dab a small amount of liquid foundation onto your finger, then tap the foundation onto your face. Use a foundation brush to blend the foundation into your skin. Repeat as desired for your whole face, except for your under eye area and your eyelids.If you have dry skin, you may notice that your skin is often flaky. Using a brush as opposed to your fingers to blend foundation minimizes flaking since brushes are gentler.
Do not press too hard with the brush. Instead, use a soft series of repetitive taps that blends in and spreads the foundation to the area you are working on.

, Use a liquid or cream concealer on your undereye area, and any other area that you feel needs more coverage. Apply concealer like you applied the liquid foundation, using a series of small pats.Use a small brush that can reach all the areas of the under eye., Use setting spray, as opposed to powder, to set your makeup. Hold the spray about a foot from your face and give your face a gentle mist. Setting spray has a moisturizing effect, as opposed to setting powder which will absorb precious moisture., With your eyes already primed, apply your eye makeup as you usually do. You should notice that with the primer in place, it is easier to blend your eyeshadow, and your liner pencil should glide on more smoothly.


If you notice that your eyelids are still dry, apply liquid liner as opposed to pencil liner.
You also can use cream-based eyeshadows, though they are less easy to blend than powders., If your cheeks and cheekbone areas are prone to dryness, making your blush go on patchily, try a liquid blush. Liquid blush not only goes on smoother, but it lasts longer and is more heat resistant during hot days. To use liquid blush, dab a dot of it on your cheekbones and spread with a blush brush in small pats., By the time you have put on your foundation, blush and eye makeup, your lips may be starting to feel dry again. Apply a thin coat of chapstick. Wait for a moment for it to sink in, and then apply your lipstick. Try to avoid matte lipsticks, or long-lasting lipsticks, as these have a drying effect.If do decide to use a matte lipstick that leaves your lips feeling dry, dab a bit of Vaseline or chapstick onto your finger, then pat this onto your lips. This will leave your lips feeling moisturized, and will counteract the drying effect of the lip product you are using.

, If you are self-conscious about your skin appearing dry, use a liquid highlighter to give your skin a fresh, dewy look. Use a liquid highlighter, and dab a drop on the top of each cheekbone. Pat it in using your finger in a diagonal along the ridge of your cheekbone.Applying highlighter won’t actually make your skin less dry, but it will give you a fresh and healthy look.

, Check up on your makeup every couple of hours. If you notice that your skin is flaking or dry patches have appeared, revitalize your skin. First take a pair of tweezers and tweeze off any flakes of dry skin. Then use a patting motion to apply a dot of moisturizer to each dry patch. Moisturizer will give your skin the moisture and nourishment that it needs, and it will make your makeup look less dry and cakey.Make sure to not to use too much moisturizer, and to pat as opposed to rub the moisturizer in. Rubbing can remove your foundation and concealer.

Be very cautious.",How to Use Nose Hair Removal Cream," When you shop for nose hair removal cream, you must be very careful about what you purchase for this purpose. Most hair removal creams are not intended to be used in the nose because their odors can cause dizziness and nausea. Read labels carefully to be certain that the cream you get does not specifically say to avoid using it in the nose.The truth is that no hair removal cream is designed for the nose, so you should be very careful if you find a cream that does say it is safe for the nose.These creams also place you at risk of ingesting them through the mouth if they drip down from your nose, so be sure a cream is safe if accidentally swallowed.;
, A nose hair removal cream made with 100% natural ingredients may be safe for the nose, since it is not composed of chemicals and would not pose a toxic fume threat. Instead, this natural type of hair removal cream may contain ingredients like lemon juice and aloe vera.You may be able to find natural nose hair removal creams at herbal or vitamin stores.

, Use removal cream combined with other techniques. You may find that because you have to use natural ingredients, your nose hair removal cream may work more to soften the hairs rather than to completely dissolve them. You need to have a backup plan. Alternatives to nose hair removal cream include clippers, trimmers, and tweezers.
Consider nose hair wax, such as the one Nad’s, a popular hair remover brand, has developed. The waxing system promises to be safe and effective.The Nad’s nose hair waxing system uses wax containing chamomile and aloe vera, and includes a uniquely designed ergonomic hair removal stick., Once you have found a nose hair cream that is safe for the nose, you should apply it carefully by wrapping your finger or a q-tip in a warm, wet washcloth. Coat only the hairs that are visible to avoid getting the cream inside the nose.


Only use enough cream to coat the hairs, a pea sized amount at most.

, Since you are using a natural cream rather than one made with powerful chemicals, the cream may only end up softening the hair rather than dissolving it. In order to maximize the results of the cream and soften them as much as possible, try to leave it on the hair for three or four minutes.

, After allowing the cream to do its work, you may wipe it away with a dry washcloth. Be careful not to spread the cream around on the skin near the nose.


Some brands of natural hair removal cream warn against getting it on skin that has been irritated by chapping or sunburn., Since your nose hairs might only be softened rather than dissolved, you may need to follow up with an alternative nose hair removal procedure. The softened hair will most likely remove much easier now.


If you use clippers, be careful to only use clippers designed for nose hair so that you don’t risk clipping the skin near the hair.Electric trimmers are available on the market and are specially designed for nose hairs. They involve rotating blades that cut the hair without getting skin involved. Be careful not to stick this deeply into your nose.
If you use tweezers, be sure to find a pair that is high quality and where both points meet.
Wax works by coating the offending nose hairs. Allow the wax to harden for just a minute, then use an ergonomic applicator (or a q-tip) to pull the hairs out. Be careful to only coat the nose hairs at the front., Although waxing usually lasts longer than any other method of nose hair removal, avoid using regular body wax in the nostrils. The nose is a sensitive area and precautions should be taken to make sure all substances that come in contact with it have soothing elements, such as aloe vera and chamomile.Don’t forget that waxing can be painful, bringing involuntary tears to the eyes.
Be very careful not to get the wax on any skin because waxing off skin can cause infection and sores in the nose, which is uncomfortable and embarrassing., If you reach for hairs that are beyond the visible, you risk interrupting the important biological role that nose hairs play.Instead of trying to rid your nose of all its hairs, focus only on the hairs that cause you embarrassment: the ones that stick out at the end of your nose.


Nose hairs function to strain out particles in the air so that you don’t inhale them into your lungs, including bacteria and viruses., No matter how you remove nose hairs, you need to be cautious. Every method has its risks. Make sure you only go after hairs that are in the front of your nose and visible to others. If you choose to pluck or wax, try not to snag skin as well. If you use trimmers or clippers, avoid catching skin.


Other methods should also be avoided when dealing with nose hairs, like shaving, electrolysis, and laser treatment. All of these methods can cause harm to the nose."

If you suffer from a skin-related disorder or take medication that can affect your skin, consult a doctor before using this cream.
If your skin shows no irritation, continue using the cream.

Do not use the cream if the cream itself is not all the same color, or if the tube it comes in is damaged.
Avoid letting the cream make contact with metal or cloth, which can damage or discolor the material. In case of accidental contact, clean the surface immediately with water.
Keep Veet hair removal cream out of reach of children. In case of accidental ingestion, consult a doctor immediately and show the outer pack of the product.;
, Only produce enough cream to cover the intended area.









Avoid making contact with eyes. If you get any cream in your eyes, rinse with plenty of water and seek medical attention immediately.

, Use the spatula tool that is included to evenly apply the cream and fully cover hair.









Apply the cream to the surface of the skin rather than rubbing it into the pores.
The removal cream is designed for legs, arms, underarms and bikini lines. Do not use the cream on the face, head, breast, perianal or genital areas as severe irritation and burning can occur. If you apply the cream to these areas and experience irritation, wash the cream off gently and consult a doctor.
Don't apply the cream to moles, scars, spotty, irritated or sun burnt skin. Avoid contact with skin that has been shaved in the last 72 hours.
Avoid contact with broken or inflamed skin. If cream gets into broken skin, wash it with lukewarm water and 3% of boric acid solution. Talk to a doctor if the pain is not alleviated after rinsing.
Don't use this cream immediately after a hot bath/shower. The cream contains alkali and thioglycolate, which can more easily irritate tender skin.

, Be sure you carefully time this period as leaving the cream on longer can seriously irritate skin.


If you experience any smarting or tingling during use, remove the cream immediately and rinse thoroughly with water. If this sensation persists, seek medical advice.

, First, use the head of the spatula to test a small area. If the hair comes away easily, remove the rest of the cream with the spatula.









Use a soft sponge or washcloth to remove the cream if the spatula is too abrasive.
If needed, you can leave the cream on longer before fully removing. Do not exceed 6 minutes, as your skin will likely become irritated and produce a painful burning sensation.

, Wash away the residual cream and any stray hairs.









The best way to do this is to take a shower and use a Loofah or sponge to softly scrub the area.

, Do this gently as the area may still be tender after using the removal cream.










Always wait 72 hours between cream applications. This will reduce the amount of irritation and inflammation sustained to the skin.
Do not apply antiperspirant or perfume to the treated area, or sunbathe before 24 hours has passed. Skin may be tender and will be especially sensitive to the sun or to the chemicals in said products.

Find the right cream for your skin.,
Talk to your doctor if you have very sensitive skin, a skin condition, or take any medications that may affect your skin.Because the cream is applied directly to the skin, the chemicals that break down the proteins in your hair will also interact with the proteins in your skin and could cause a reaction.,
Do an allergy test 24 hours before using the cream, even if you've used it before.,
Examine the area for any cuts, scrapes, moles, scars, cold sores, irritated or sunburnt skin.You want to minimize your chances of having a bad reaction to the cream and potentially developing a rash or chemical burn.,
Take a shower or bath, drying your skin thoroughly afterwards.",How to Use Hair Removal Creams1," There are lots of different brands of hair removal cream, and lots of choices within those brands. When choosing a cream, think about your skin's sensitivity and where you plan on using the product.Some companies even make a waterproof depilatory that can be applied in the shower.


If you are using the cream on your face or bikini area, make sure you choose formula specifically for those areas, as the skin is more sensitive.If you have sensitive skin, look for creams with ingredients like aloe and green tea. You may also want to speak with a doctor or dermatologist before use.Depilatory creams can come in different forms, from aerosols (or sprays), gels, and roll-ons.A roll-on won't be as messy as a cream or gel, but the creams and gels let you control how thick you apply them (and usually the thicker the better).If you are sensitive to smells, try a cream that has added a scent to cover the eggy smell of the cream reacting to your hair. Just remember that additional ingredients can increase the chances of irritation.;
, Consult your doctor before using depilatory creams if:


You have developed rashes, hives, or allergic reactions to skin products in the past.You take a retinol, acne medication, or other medication that increases your skin's sensitivity.You have a skin condition such as eczema, psoriasis, or rosacea., Your hormone levels are always changing, and they cause your skin to change, too. Even if you've never had a reaction to the hair removal cream before, your skin's chemistry may have changed slightly and could cause you to react.Apply a small amount of cream to the area where you plan to remove the hair. Follow the directions, leaving the cream on for the advised amount of time and removing properly.If the tested area does not react in the next 24 hours, it is safe to use the depilatory cream., Don't apply the cream directly to any scars or moles, and if you have a sunburn, rash or cut, wait until you are completely healed before going ahead with the application.There may be tiny cuts on your skin if you have shaved recently--wait a day or two before applying the cream., This will ensure you don't have any lotions or anything on your skin that might interfere with the hair removal cream. Make sure your skin is dry afterwards, as most depilatory creams need to be applied to dry skin.Don't use hot water, as this can dry out your skin and may increase chances of irritation.Soaking in warm water can soften your hair, which may make it easier to break down. This is especially helpful for very coarse hair, like pubic hair."

1 cup Olive oil or other natural oil (grocery store)
1 oz (28 g) Pure beeswax (health food store or online)
1 to 2 tbsp USP grade zinc oxide or titanium dioxide powder (health food store, pharmacy or online)
Essential oil (optional);
, In addition to your ingredients, you’ll need the following tools for making the sunscreen. These tools should only be used for making sunscreen, as residual oxide powder could leech into your food and make you ill.


Saucepan
Heat-resistant glass jar (optional, if using double-boiler method)
Spoon for stirring
Gloves and face mask
Stove
Storage container with lid (glass jar, ceramic pot, or plastic bottle will do)

, If you’re using a gas stove, use a low flame. If you’re using an electric stove, set your element to a medium heat.









To ensure the integrity of the ingredients, you might try using a double-boiler method to melt them instead of placing them directly in the saucepan. This will also save you from having to only use your saucepan for making sunscreen.
To use the double-boiler method, heat an inch or two of water in a saucepan until it’s simmering, then mix the ingredients (NOT including the oxide powder) in a heat-resistant glass jar and place the jar upright into the water, allowing it to sit there until all of the ingredients are melted together.

, If it’s not already in pearls or broken into pieces, you’ll need to grate or chop the beeswax into small pieces before adding it to the oil. This will help it melt faster.









The beeswax makes the resulting product viscous, like a skin cream. It’s what holds the oxide in suspension so that it doesn’t all sink down to the bottom of the container.
For a thicker, heavier sunscreen, add more beeswax. For one that is lighter and smooths on more easily, add a little less beeswax., You want the ingredients to be completely melted together before you add the oxide powder.








, If you want to add a fragrance to your sunscreen via an essential oil, now is the time to do it. Lavender oil is a popular choice, and has a natural SPF of up to 6.








Just use a couple of drops to ensure that it’s not an overly strong or irritating smell, especially if you intend to use it on your face.

, Wear gloves and a face mask to protect you from coming in direct contact with the oxide powder. In particular, you want to protect yourself from inhaling it, which can be dangerous to your health.As an extra precaution you can also wear safety goggles, which will protect your eyes in case anything splashes up when you add the powder to the hot oil solution.
As you’ll be dealing with hot oil, make sure that the gloves you wear are heat-resistant and won’t melt if any oil splashes up on to them. Heat-resistant rubber gloves will work well. Just make sure they fit you well so that you can still use your hands without feeling clumsy.

, Add just a little bit at a time while constantly stirring to ensure that the mixture is well blended. The oxide powder must be evenly distributed throughout the mixture to make an effective sunscreen.









You can use either zinc oxide or titanium dioxide, although zinc oxide seems to be more common amongst DIY sunscreen makers.
Make sure the powder is USP grade, which means that it is suitable for food, drug, or medicinal use.

, Once everything is mixed together, remove the mixture from the stove and pour it into its storage container. Small mason jars with lids are highly recommended.









Depending on the thickness of your mixture, you might be able to get away with a squeeze bottle. A wide-mouthed jar will make it easier for you to stir the solution while it cools though, and less of the solution will be likely to go to waste.
If you’re pouring the mixture into a container with a narrow neck, use a pastry bag to squeeze the sunscreen through. It will likely be too thick for a funnel. Just make sure that the sunscreen isn’t still very hot while you do this lest you burn yourself.

, As the mixture cools, stir it every 5 to 10 minutes to ensure that the oxide powder remains evenly distributed throughout the mixture., Once the sunscreen is room temperature, you can put it on your skin. Note that the sunscreen should be opaque. If it looks translucent, the oxide has likely sunk to the bottom of the container.









The oxide can settle when the sunscreen is cooling. It can also sink to the bottom of the container if it is out in the heat for too long. It’s important to stir it or shake it up before use in these situations, so that you get the full protective benefits of the oxide.

, It’s best if you can use this, or any other homemade sunscreens, within six months of making it.Make sure you keep it in a cool, dry place.


If the sunscreen gets too hot or too cold, the ingredients might shift. If the oxide powder isn’t evenly distributed throughout the sunscreen, it will not be effective.
If the sunscreen melts or hardens, you will need to stir the sunscreen to evenly distribute the oxide powder once it’s back at room temperature and a regular thickness.

, Explore what recipes other DIY sunscreen makers are using. This will give you a sense of what ingredients are popular, and what ingredients you may want to use.

, One DIY sunscreen maker suggests the following recipe, which combines several different oils. Simply melt all of the ingredients EXCEPT the zinc oxide together, then add the zinc oxide, cool, and you’re done.1/2 cup Almond or olive oil
1/4 cup Coconut oil
1 tsp Red raspberry oil (optional)
1 tsp Carrot seed oil (optional)
1 tsp Vitamin E oil (optional)
A few drops of essential oils of your choosing (optional)
2 tbsp Shea butter
1/4 cup Beeswax
2 tbsp zinc oxide

, Once you’ve read or even tried other DIY sunscreen recipes, such as the ones in this article, you can add your own ingredients to the sunscreen to tailor it to your tastes.


As an example, you might add lavender oil and cut the beeswax content of the DIY recipes in this article for a lighter, lavender-scented sunscreen that easily smooths over your skin.

, The base oil is the oil that you will use the most of in your homemade sunscreen recipe. Popular base oils include olive oil (SPF 7-8), coconut oil (SPF 7), castor oil (SPF 6), and almond oil (SPF 5)., Popular essential oils to use in sunscreen include peppermint (SPF 7), tulsi (SPF 7), and lavender (SPF 6).Avoid citrus oils (e.g. Bergamot or Citron) as they will boost your chances of burning., Red raspberry seed oil is a popular choice amongst DIY sunscreen makers, who claim that it has an SPF of 25 to 50.You can add a small amount of it to your sunscreen to boost its SPF level.

, With an SPF of 35 to 40, carrot seed oil is a DIYer favorite.Try adding a small amount of carrot seed oil to your homemade sunscreen to enhance its SPF level.

, Shea butter is believed to have a natural SPF of 4 to 6. Adding it to your sunscreen will help thicken it. Shea butter is also a great moisturizer, and will leave your skin feeling soft and smooth.

, The most important ingredient in homemade sunscreen is oxide, which comes in the form of either zinc oxide or titanium dioxide. Both of these offer protection against UVA and UVB rays, and are an absolute must.


The more oxide you use in your sunscreen mixture, the more protection you’ll get. Sunscreens commonly come in concentrations of between 5% and 25% oxide.Both types of oxide are effective, but zinc oxide is believed to offer broader, more effective sun protection., The efficacy of your homemade sunscreen is not only based on your ingredients, but on the way in which you’ve made the sunscreen. This is the primary concern expressed by doctors when discussing DIY sunscreen.


Doctors worry that even if the ingredients are effective, the way in which they are mixed might undermine them. For instance, if your oxide powder isn’t properly blended with the rest of the ingredients, it might only protect your skin in patches, or worse, not at all.Doctors also warn that since DIY sunscreen makers don’t usually have labs or testing environments for their sunscreen, there is no scientific way to properly measure the level of UV protection their mixtures provide., SPF only measures the ability to block UVB rays, which are the rays that burn you. It does not protect against UVA rays, which are what age you. Both types of rays can cause skin cancer.To be properly protected, you must have a sunscreen that protects against booth UVA and UVB rays.
This is why it’s so important to have a good amount of oxide powder in your sunscreen. Zinc oxide in particular is good at blocking UVA and UVB rays., If you’re interested in boosting your skin’s natural protective barrier against the sun, there are foods that you can eat to help. Note that consuming these things is not enough to protect you from the sun. You must wear sunscreen.Cocoa, green and black tea, micro-algae (chlorella and spirulina), and carotenoids and antioxidants found in fruits and veggies are all great for boosting your skin’s natural ability to fight the sun’s harmful rays.

, As reports of dangerous chemicals in store-bought sunscreens have scared people off buying them, natural options have become more popular and affordable.


It’s now relatively easy to find sunscreen options that are organic, chemical free, and just as safe as your homemade concoction, with the added benefit of being lab-tested for UV protection.

If your skin doesn't become irritated, it is likely safe to use the waxing strips.
For first-time waxers, start by removing hair from the legs. This is one of the less sensitive parts of the body. Once you have some experience, move on to more sensitive areas like the underarm and bikini line.
It is not recommended to use the strips to wax areas of skin that have already been waxed.
If you take medication that affects your skin, get approval from a doctor first before using Veet wax strips.

Do not use Veet ready-to-use wax strips if you are elderly or diabetic. There could be serious health risks involved.
Waxing is fine if pregnant; however, know that your skin may be more likely to bruise.

, Either shower or use a washcloth to scrub away any dirt or residue that may be on your skin.









Dry your skin very well after cleaning. Moisture will prevent proper adhesion of the wax to the skin.

, This is done to warm the wax and prepare it to be bonded with hair.










Traditional hair waxing techniques usually involve heating a thick wax solution in the microwave or in warm water. Though not as complicated a process, Veet strips still require some heat before waxing can occur.

, You can reuse each strip until it loses its grip.








, Rub the strip in the direction that your hair grows.









For waxing legs, rub the strip from knee to ankle.
Exercise the same caution as if using the removal cream. Do not apply it to the head, face, genitals, or other sensitive private areas. Don't apply the wax strips to varicose veins, moles, scars, or irritated skin.
If you experience irritation, remove the wax by using a Perfect Finish wipe from the box. Alternatively, you can use cotton balls soaked in baby oil or body oil. Since the wax is resin based, it will not rinse off with just water.
Be sure that the hair you are waxing is at least between 2-5 mm long. Hair that is shorter than 2 mm may not adhere well to the wax and therefore will not be pulled during removal.

, The quicker you pull the strip off, the higher your chances are of removing most of the hair.









Remove the strip in the opposite direction of hair growth. This will increase the likelihood of hair being pulled.
Hold the skin taut with one hand and make sure you keep the strip parallel to the skin. This will maximize effectiveness and minimize discomfort.
Avoid pulling the strips outward as this will only break the hairs.

, You can also shower to better remove waxy residue from your skin.









Wait 24 hours before applying antiperspirant and perfume products, or before sunbathing. Since waxed skin may still be tender, doing these things may cause irritation or discomfort.

One type of hair removal might take only three minutes, while another might take ten. Following the directions will give you the best results and help protect your skin.If you lost the directions that came with your cream, you can find them on the bottle or tube. Otherwise, check the company's website. They should have instructions for each kind of cream.
Check the ""use by"" date to make sure your cream is not expired. An expired depilatory cream will not work very well and give you poor results.

, Use your fingers or a spatula, if provided. Do not rub the cream into your skin, just spread it.Wash your hands immediately if you apply with your fingers.


Uneven application means your hair could come off in patches, leaving you with spots of hair, which is probably not the look you're going for.Never apply a hair removal cream to your nostrils, ears, the skin around your eyes (including your eyebrows), genitals, anus, or nipples., This can be anywhere between three to ten minutes, though the time rarely exceeds ten minutes. Most directions recommend checking a small area about halfway through the process to see if hair comes off.The shorter the amount of time the depilatory cream is in contact with your skin, the less likely you are to develop redness or irritation.


Because you can really harm your skin if you leave the cream on too long, set an egg timer or use the timer on your phone to make sure you don't exceed the limit.
Some tingling is normal, but if you start to feel burning, see redness or irritation, remove the cream immediately. Depending on your reaction, you may want to call your doctor for advice on how to treat your skin.
You may notice a bad smell while you are using the cream. That's a normal side effect of the chemical reaction that is breaking down your hair., Wipe gently--don't rub the cream.

Pat, don't rub, your skin dry.Apply a moisturizer to the area to keep it smooth and hydrated., Wear loose clothing right after using the cream and don't scratch the area. If the redness and discomfort continues after a few hours or gets worse, call your doctor., You should also wait 24 hours to use anti-perspirant or products with fragrances.


You should not shave or use a hair removal cream in the same area for 72 hours after use."

Wear sunscreen everyday.",How to Establish an Effective Skincare Routine1," If you wear makeup, you should remove it before you go to bed. Some cleansers claim to remove makeup for you, but these may not get rid of all makeup. You may want to have an extra makeup remover on hand. Use it before you cleanse your face.Makeup wipes or removers are easy and convenient. Simply wipe off the makeup with a soaked pad until it is gone.
Since eye and lip makeup can be harder to remove, you may want to use a special makeup remover designed for these parts.;
, You should wash your face twice a day, once in the morning before you put on makeup, and once at night before you go to bed. You should also cleanse after sweating heavily.Wet your skin with warm water but not hot water. Warm water helps remove dirt, but hot water will dry out your skin.
Apply the cleanser and massage it into your skin in upwards, circular motions. Remove completely, either by using a sponge or by splashing with warm water. Dab your face dry with a clean towel.

, Toner should be applied once you have dried your face after cleansing. Pump a small amount of toner onto a cotton pad, and simply wipe over your face. Avoid the eye area. Let the toner dry on your skin. You do not need to rinse off.

, Your moisturizer goes on after your toner absorbs. You can massage your moisturizer into your skin using upward circular motions to your face and neck. Alternatively, you can apply it to your clean palms and gently pat it in.If you have dark or puffy eyes or if you are concerned about wrinkles around your eyes, you can use a separate eye cream. Gently pat the cream around your eye with your ring finger.

, You should only exfoliate once or twice a week, or else you may cause damage to your skin. Be gentle as you exfoliate. Soft movements are all that are needed. Vigorously rubbing or scrubbing can be harmful.There are many different types of exfoliation. You can use a wash-off scrub, a special mitt or sponge, or even a chemical exfoliant such as AHA or BHA.
You may want to avoid exfoliating if you have active acne breakouts or hyperpigmentation., Daily sun exposure can cause premature aging, hyperpigmentation, and other problems. Even if you don’t plan on going outside for long, put on sunscreen before you leave home. Apply it fifteen minutes before going outside. Sunscreen should be applied as the last step of your routine after you have put on moisturizer but before you have put on any makeup.

If your pores routinely look large, this could be part of the problem. Get into the habit of cleansing your face each and every night so your pores will be less likely to get clogged.









Use warm water, rather than hot or cold, so your skin will be less likely to get irritated.
Pat your face dry with a soft towel.;
, Many cleansers contain harsh ingredients that cause dry, irritated skin. When your pores are irritated, they look wider and more ""open."" In order to keep them closed, it's best to use a gentle cleanser that washes away dirt without causing your skin to dry out.









Choose a cleanser that's sulfate free. Sulfates are harsh cleansers that can strip the skin of its natural oils and leave it dry and itchy.
Avoid using a cleanser with scrubbing beads on a daily basis. The beads could be irritating to your skin, and should only be used sparingly.

, It's becoming increasingly popular to replace soap with oil as a facial cleanser. It might sound counterintuitive to use oil to wash your face, but it's actually quite effective. The oil binds with your skin's natural oils and gently washes away dirt, sweat, and makeup without the need for harsh chemicals. Just smooth it over your skin and use a wet washcloth to wipe it off using a circular motion. Here are a few oil combinations to try out:








For oily skin: Mix 1 teaspoon castor oil and 2 teaspoons jojoba oil.
For combination skin: Mix 1/2 teaspoon castor oil and 2 teaspoons olive oil.
For dry skin: Mix 1/4 teaspoon castor oil and 2 teaspoons coconut or olive oil.

, After getting a good night's sleep, it feels refreshing to splash your face with water. Since you don't wake up wearing makeup, there's no need to wash your face using a cleanser; in fact, it's better for your skin to give it a break and just use water. Pat your face dry with a soft towel.








, Dead skin builds up on the surface of your skin, mixes with sweat and dirt, and ends up clogging pores. Exfoliating your skin regularly will prevent your pores from getting clogged so quickly. The result will be closed, small-looking pores as opposed to clogged pores that look big and open.









One of the best ways to exfoliate is by simply using a washcloth. Wet your face and scrub it gently using circular motions.
You could also use a facial loofah pad, which digs slightly deeper to remove dead skin.
Facial scrubs are also good. Try a mixture of ground almonds and honey.

, This is a great way to open your pores so you can get rid of the small plugs of dead skin and dirt that are making them appear large and open. Heat a small pot of water until it begins to steam, then hold your face over it and drape a towel over your head. Let the steam bathe your face for three to five minutes, then rinse your face with cool water.









Steaming your face opens up your pores, allowing them to become unclogged.
Rinsing afterward gets rid of the debris, leaving your pores fresh and clean. Use cool water to close your pores.

, Clay is a natural element that draws impurities out of the skin as it dries. When you do a clay mask, dry clay is mixed with water to form a paste, which you smooth over your face. Let it dry completely, then rinse it away with cool water.









Storebought clay masks are available in most beauty supply stores. Look for a mask designed to unclog pores.
You can make your own clay mask by mixing a tablespoon of clay cosmetic powder (white or green), a teaspoon of honey and a teaspoon of water.

, A seaweed mask, like a clay mask, will draw impurities from your pores as well as helping them close back up. Buy a seaweed mask from the beauty supply store, or have one done next time you go to the spa.








, Whether you steam or use a mask, always remember to rinse away the dirt when you're finished. Follow up by using a toner on your face. Toner helps restore your skin's pH balance after cleansing, giving it a youthful, glowing appearance and helping to close pores.








, Beauty supply stores carry many different toners. Look for one that works with your skin type, but avoid toners with excess chemicals, perfumes, and dyes that could irritate or dry out your skin. These toners will do more harm than good, and your pores will end up looking larger instead of smaller.Avoid toners that contain alcohol, which can dry out the skin.
Avoid toners that contain glycerin and fragrances, since these can cause allergic reactions.

, Apple cider vinegar is made from fermented apples, and is a gentle, natural toner for any type of skin. Mix 1 tablespoon of apple cider vinegar and 1 tablespoon of water, then use a cotton ball to apply it to your skin after rinsing. Let your skin dry, then moisturize it., Plain, raw honey is an excellent toner for skin. Simply spread some on your face and let it sit for about ten minutes, then rinse it away with warm water. Your pores will tighten up and your face will feel fresh and youthful.

, Using a good face moisturizer is key to keeping your pores closed, since dry skin can become irritated and lead to large-looking pores. Chose an alcohol-free moisturizer that doesn't contain perfumes and excess chemicals so you make sure you don't irritate your skin.

Choose a foaming cleanser.,
Look for ingredients that will fight acne.,
Apply a water-based moisturizer.,
Relax with a clay mask to reduce oil.,
Avoid touching your face.",How to Establish an Effective Skincare Routine2," Foaming cleansers work the best for oily skin as they remove oil gently. You only need a small amount for your whole face. Foaming cleansers come in gel, pump, and cream form.Be careful only to wash your face twice a day. Washing too often can actually cause your skin to produce more oil and pimples.

, If you have acne-prone skin, then you should be using tougher ingredients that will reduce oil, shine, and pimples. Some common and effective ingredients include:Benzoyl peroxide
Salicylic acid
Sulfur
Alpha hydroxy acids such as glycolic acid or lactic acid
Retinoid
Witch hazel

, Using a heavy moisturizer might make your skin even oiler. To combat this, use a water or gel-based moisturizer instead. These are moisturizers where water is listed as the first or second ingredient., Clay masks are great for people with oily skin. Smear them on your face after cleansing, and leave them on for fifteen to twenty minutes before rinsing off. Apply moisturizer afterwards., Touching your face can transfer bacteria and dirt from your hands to your face. These can cause pimples. If you must touch your face, wash your hands thoroughly with soap and warm first.Never pick, squeeze or pop your pimples. It hurts more, looks worse, and eventually may leave behind an ugly scar.

Instead, rinse your face with warm water and pat dry. Wash your face with cleanser at night., Makeup removers often contain alcohol and other harsh ingredients that can dry out and irritate your skin. Oil cleansers are gentler than makeup removing wipes. Simply apply the oil to your dry skin, and wash off with warm water., A serum is a watery moisturizer that gives your skin an extra boost of hydration. Gently dab the serum onto your face with a cotton ball or clean hands. Let it absorb into your skin before you apply moisturizer.

, If you have dry or mature skin, oil-based products will not only add hydration but seal moisture into your skin. Check the label to see if oil is one of the first listed ingredients.Mineral oil or petrolatum may be helpful if you have cracked skin or flaky patches.
Rosehip oil and jojoba oil can help prevent moisture from leaving your skin.

, Irritation and flaky skin can be common for both dry and sensitive skin types. To soothe your skin, pick products that contain moisturizing ingredients, such as aloe, chamomile, green tea extract, or Vitamin C., Alcohol can dry out skin and irritate sensitive skin.

Peppermint
Eucalyptus oil

, If you want to reduce hyperpigmentation or dark spots on your face, choose ingredients that will lighten these areas. Some effective products include:Kojic acid
Vitamin C
Vitamin E
Arbutin
Niacinamide
Licorice Root Extract

, Dull skin is a common side effect of dry or mature skin. If you are looking for more of a glow, try to find products that contain Vitamin C, arbutin, niacinamide, and mulberry extract. These products are more effective when used together, so feel free to mix and match., To avoid flares, choose a mild cleanser and moisturizer.You should avoid products that contain alcohol, menthol, peppermint, eucalyptus oil, or witch hazel.For the best treatment, talk to a doctor about getting a prescription to treat your condition.

, If you are struggling to find products that work for your skin, visit a dermatologist. They can help you identify your skin type while pinpointing the underlying issues that may be causing your concerns. They may even give you prescriptions that can help.

Wash your hands.,
Slice off an outer leaf of an aloe plant.,
Drain the resin for 10 minutes.,
Peel the leaves.,
Scoop the gel out with a spoon or knife.,
Consider mixing the gel with a natural preservative.,
Place the gel in a sterilized, clean glass jar.,
Use the gel.",How to Make Aloe Vera Gel," It's important to start with clean hands and use clean tools to make sure the gel doesn't get contaminated.;
, The outer leaves are more likely to be mature. They'll contain plenty of fresh, healthy gel. Look for leaves around the outside of the plant, with bases growing close to the ground. Use a sharp knife to make a clean cut near the base.


Since aloe vera gel is perishable, it's best not to make a huge batch at once, unless you plan to give some away. Cutting off just a leaf or two, especially if they're large, should be sufficient to make 1/2 to 1 cup of gel.
If your plant is young, be especially careful not to cut off too much at once. Cutting off all of the outer leaves could damage the plant.

, Place the leaves upright in a cup to let the dark yellow resin drain out. The resin contains latex, which can be slightly irritating to skin. It's best to drain it out so it won't get into your gel.








, Use a vegetable peeler to carefully peel away the green portion of the leaves.Be sure to cut through the inner white layer to the gel underneath. Peel off all of the skin on once side of the each leaf, leaving a canoe-shaped half filled with gel.









If you have large leaves, it may be helpful to cut them into smaller pieces before peeling.
Discard the skin as you go so it won't get mixed in with your gel.

, The clear, soft gel is easily scoopable. Scoop it all out into a clean bowl until there's nothing left in the leaf half.








, If you have a lot of gel and you want it to keep for a month or two, mix in 500mg powdered Vitamin C or 400 IU vitamin E for every 1/4 cup of gel you have. Place the ingredients together in a blender and blend well. The gel will look foamy at first., If you used the preservative, the gel will keep for several months in the refrigerator. Without it, it will keep for a week or two.

, Apply it to sunburns or other minor, surface burns. Aloe can also be used as a skin moisturizer or an ingredient in homemade body products.


Never use aloe vera gel on deep cuts or blistered skin. It should only be used on surface skin irritation, since it can prevent deep cuts from healing properly.
Try blending 1/2 cup aloe with 1/4 cup melted coconut oil to make a healing, moisturizing massage lotion.Learn how to grow an aloe plant so you'll be able to make a batch of gel whenever you want.

As with most things when it comes to taking care of your body, it’s more important that you’re doing anything at all. That means that if you’re going to be better about doing a shorter, simpler routine every day rather than sporadically doing something more complex once every two weeks, just do the simpler routine.


A routine which you can really be regular about is more likely to be something that you keep up over time. Since long-term care is really what’s needed for nice skin, that is why it’s important to choose something that you can make a habit out of.
This is going to be the most important thing if your major skin problem is acne. Acne is a difficult skin problem to defeat and regular cleaning is the most important thing you can do to treat it.;
, Washing your skin is one of the most important things you can do to get nice skin. As you go through your day, you build up all sorts of dirt and bacteria on your skin that can clog your pores, cause redness, make you itch, and other problems. When you wash your skin, you remove these materials before they have the chance to really cause problems.


Start by rinsing your skin with clean, warm water. Next, lather up with a soap that is geared toward the type of skin you have. You'll want to use oil-free soaps on your face, unless you have dry skin. Your body will usually do best with a moisturizing soap. Gently rub the skin using a washcloth, in circular motions. When you're done, rinse with clean, cool water.

, Exfoliating your skin will leave you feeling more comfortable but it will also help your skin in many different ways. Exfoliating uses textured materials to remove dead skin and dirt from your healthy skin underneath. Most people associate it with the skin of the face, but you'll want to exfoliate all over your body if possible.


One of the major benefits of exfoliating comes with exfoliating in areas where you shave (legs, face, whatever). When you shave, the root can become misaligned with the skin opening and cause ingrown hairs. By exfoliating, you can realign the hair and prevent those annoying red bumps. Try exfoliating after you shave every time and occasionally before you shave as well.
You can buy many exfoliating products wherever other skin products are found (including creams and scrubbing tools) or you can make some basic products at home. One easy option is to make a baking soda paste. Mix baking soda with just a few drops of water until a paste is formed. This can be used like a ""soap"" in order to exfoliate the skin. This works best on the face. A homemade sugar scrub may work better for the rest of your body.

, When you dry your face, don't use a regular towel and don't just rub your face with it. This spreads bacteria, which can lead to unhealthy skin to begin with. Instead, pat it gently with a clean towel that's used for your face and only your face.


Patting dry and using a clean towel is especially important if you're combatting acne.

, There are all sorts of problems that you might have with your skin, but regardless of what they are: don't ignore them! The sooner you take a serious approach to fixing the problem, the easier it will be to solve. If you don't have luck on your own, talk to a dermatologist. You may have a condition which requires stronger medication than what is available at your local Walgreens.



Deal with acne and blemishes. There are lots of different ways to get rid of acne and which one works for you will depend on the type of acne you have, as well as your skin type. Experiment to find something that works for you.

Treat dry skin You'll want to take dry skin just as seriously as oily skin, even if the appearance isn't quite as bad or it's in an area you don't normally see. Dry skin can crack, opening you up to infection and acne, so it's important to deal with. Moisturizers and increased water consumption are a good place to start, as well as regularly exfoliating.

, You'll want to take extra steps to protect your skin in the winter, if you want to ensure that you develop nice skin. The cold temperatures are harsh on your skin, drying it out and causing damage. Cover as much of your skin as you can with clothing. For the skin that must stay exposed, use a moisture cream or lanolin product to protect your skin. Be extra careful and hydrate more than you normally would to help your body naturally compensate as well.


Cold air is low in moisture because the water precipitates out in the form of mist or snow. Because it is low in moisture, it sucks the water out of your own skin, drying it out., This is one of the most important things you can do for your skin, not just on your face but over your whole body. The sun's UVA and UVB rays create the most wear-and-tear on your skin, but that same wear and tear can come just as easily in a tanning bed. Use sunscreen whenever you go out on a sunny day on avoid using tanning beds.


You'll need a sunscreen with an SPF of at least 15 if you want to be protected. Put it on 30 minutes before sun exposure so that your body can absorb it, then reapply 20 minutes after going out. If you use this early reapplication, you'll only need to reapply if you get wet or sweat a lot (or stay at the beach all day).
You're also probably not putting on enough. Use roughly two finger-lengths for each of the 11 areas of the body (head, left/right shoulder, left/right arm, left/right chest, left/right thigh, and left/right calf).Ignore the higher SPF sunscreens. SPF 15 will work just fine and higher formulations don't carry that much more benefit. Higher numbers also don't mean that you can use less. You still have to use just as much.

, Vitamin A is a crucial compound for healing and maintaining your skin. These days, you can buy special creams which infuse your skin with retinoids, which are chemically very similar to vitamin A. These are one of the few products on the market that you can buy that have been proven to improve your skin, repairing damage from acne and smoothing up wrinkles.Prescription retinoids will get the best results, but you can also use over-the-counter retinol, which will also provide some benefits.

, Lanolin is a substance that animals (most commonly sheep) produce naturally which protects their skin and hair. While you may not baa and eat grass, lanolin still is great for you skin. Most people will be familiar with it through the product Carmex, which is used to smooth chapped lips. However, you can also get it in greater quantities for use on hands, legs, face, and anywhere your skin gets dry or hard. Bag Balm is the most common brand.


When you first start using lanolin, you'll want to cover the area in the cream once a day or a few times a day, depending on the placement and severity. After that, you should only have to reapply every four or five days to keep your skin just as soft.

, Ever see people in movies or on TV with cucumbers on their eyes and weird, paint-looking stuff on their face? That's a facial mask. Masks are a sort of creamy substance that can be made out of all sorts of things.


Masks made with turmeric, activated charcoal, yogurt with active cultures , vitamin E, and retinol/retinoids should all have benefits. All of these substances have actual science behind how they help your skin.
Watch out for main ingredients like lemon juice, since all it really does is disinfect. Lemon juice can actually cause more skin problems for a lot of people, so it's best to play it safe and avoid this common mask type.
You'll want to pair the main ingredient in the mask with what your skin needs, however. Charcoal masks are good for oily skin but can make dry skin worse. Vitamin E masks are good for dry skin but can cause breakouts if your skin is naturally oily.

, It’s very important to drink water for your overall health, of course, but did you know that drinking water is also key in making your skin soft and smooth as well? When you don’t get enough water, one of the first places to suffer is your skin. Drying out your skin through dehydration lead to redness, itchiness, and tight-feeling skin. It’s uncomfortable. But this problem is easily solved by just drinking a few more glasses of water every day.


As a general rule, you can tell your body is getting the right amount of water when your urine comes out very pale or clear. The darker the color, the more likely that you are dehydrated.

, Your skin, just like other parts of your body, needs specific nutrients to thrive. You can create long term positive benefits for your skin by eating a diet rich in the nutrients that your skin needs. While the effects won’t be immediate, you should see positive and more serious changes over time. The most important nutrients for your skin are vitamins A, C, and E, as well as omega 3 fatty acids, zinc, and selenium.Salmon is a good source of several of these nutrients. Most fruits are a good source of vitamin C and carrots are a good source of vitamin A.

, You have probably never thought about it but your skin is just another one of the many areas that exercise can help. Studies have shown that exercise can actually do a lot to keep your skin looking healthy, by keeping it firm and reducing or even reversing other signs of aging.If you don’t exercise now, you should think about adding more activity to your life.


It’s important to understand that there’s no such thing as an exercise which targets a particular area of your body. There’s no magical exercise to improve your skin. You just have to be more active and exercise in general.
In order to get started on the path to a life which includes exercise, try walking briskly for half an hour a day in at least 15 minute segments.

, When you sleep, your body works on switching its energy over to cleaning and repair all sorts of things around your body. One of those things is your skin. When you miss out on sleep, your body releases too much cortisol (which breaks your skin down and makes it less smooth) and doesn’t release enough human growth hormone (which normally repairs your skin).Get enough sleep to give your skin its best chance.


Everyone needs a different amount of sleep. Every body is different. You might have to experiment to find what’s right for you, but you should be able to feel functional and alert through most of your day, without the aid of coffee.

, Remember that hormone levels can play a part in the appearance of your skin. We all know the cliché of the pimpled teenager, right? There’s actually a reason for that! Certain hormones can cause your skin to have problems like acne and any time that your hormones fluctuate, your skin might suffer. There are things that you can do to protect yourself from these hormone fluctuations but mainly you should just be aware of what the fluctuations can do. They’re a normal part of life and being patient is often the best thing that you can do.


Puberty, youth, pregnancy, and medications which affect your hormones can all create the imbalances which lead to splotchy skin.
If you really want to, consider taking medication which regulates your hormones. This is easiest for women and girls: birth control pills will tightly control your hormone levels and can often significantly improve your skin.

In many cases, triggers of rosacea increase blood flow to the surface of the skin.Avoid some of the following things that may exacerbate your rosacea:


Hot foods and drinks
Spicy foods
Alcoholic beverages
Sunlight
Stress, embarrassment, or anger
Vigorous exercise or activity
Hot baths, showers, and saunas
Drugs such as corticosteroids and blood pressure medicationWind
Cold weather
Humidity
Certain cosmetics and skin-care products;
, Exposing your skin to the elements can cause flare-ups or make ongoing rosacea worse. Protecting it against sun, wind, and the cold may minimize flare-ups and help you control your rosacea.Wear a sunscreen that protects against both UVA and UVB rays with a minimum SPF 30. Make sure to reapply often.Keep your skin cool by staying out of the direct sun, using fans, and being in air-conditioned rooms during the summer.
Put on a scarf or face mask in the winter to protect against the wind and cold.Sun protection that contains barrier protection silicones, like dimethicone and cyclomethicone, are preferred over alcohol-based formulations.

, Wash your face and any areas prone to rosacea with a gentle cleanser. This can not only prevent flare-ups but may also minimize the risk of breakouts or infection by clearing bacteria from your skin.Use with a gentle cleanser that has a neutral pH such as Dove or Cetaphil.Look for products that are fragrance-free and allergy tested. Note that “hypoallergenic” is not the same as “allergy tested,” which is what you should buy.Wash with your fingertips and avoid using a washcloth or sponge, which can irritate your skin.Rinse with lukewarm water to prevent flushing and stripping your skin of oils and irritating it.Blot your skin dry to avoid irritating it.Consider doing a skin patch test before using a product to make sure that you don’t have a reaction to it.Avoid harsh, mechanical scrubbing. Non-detergent cleaners, beauty bars, mild cleansing bars, and liquid facial cleansers are recommended. You should avoid topical products that may irritate the skin such as toners, astringents, and chemical exfoliating agents.

, Doctors believe that moisturizing your skin not only can help create a barrier to prevent flare-ups but also soothe rosacea. Apply a skin-specific moisturizer to your skin after washing it.Ask your dermatologist to prescribe or suggest a moisturizer for you. There are many products on the market now specifically formulated for people with rosacea.Wait up to 10 minutes after washing your skin or a medical treatment to apply your moisturizer. This may minimize burning or stinging.Apply frequently. Emollients help repair the barrier function of the skin and may be useful in rosacea. In one study, constant application of moisturizer with metronidazole helped ease the symptoms of skin sensitivity.
Consider using a moisturizer that has a broad-spectrum sunscreen in it. Products with multiple functions can minimize the risk of flare-ups., Some studies have shown that certain ingredients in products you use on your skin can trigger flare-ups or irritate your skin.Reading product labels for these ingredients can help you prevent flare-ups. Watch for:Alcohol
Witch hazel
Fragrance
Menthol
Peppermint
Eucalyptus oil
Exfoliating agents

, Touching or rubbing your skin can irritate it and cause flare-ups. Make a conscious effort to not touch your face or any other areas of skin that are prone to rosacea.Avoid picking or popping any rosacea lesions that resemble acne.
Be careful to not rest your hands on your face or chin.

, If you are having bad flare-ups, can’t control breakouts, or aren’t sure if you have rosacea, schedule an appointment with your doctor. They can suggest a treatment that works for the specific variant of the disease you have. The four types of rosacea are:


Erythematotelangiectatic, which presents as flushing and persistent facial redness or visible blood vessels.
Papulopustular, which presents as persistent facial redness and bumps and pimples resembling acne.
Phymatous rosacea, which presents as skin thickening and enlargement, often around the nose of men.
Ocular, which presents in the eyes as a watery or bloodshot appearance, sensations of foreign body, burning or stinging, dryness, itching, light sensitivity and blurred vision., There is some evidence that a prescription emollient cream can help repair skin that suffers from rosacea.Use one of these creams in addition to your moisturizer to help control and prevent flare-ups.


Read product labels for ingredients that include emollients.Examples of emollients are glycerol stearate, lanolin, soy sterol, and sunflower seed oil., Many people will need medication and to avoid triggers to control their rosacea. Taking or applying prescription medication can help control inflammation and any infection that may result from a flare-up of most types of rosacea.Your doctor may prescribe:


Antibiotics. These are often creams, lotions, or gels that control inflammation.Wait ½ hour after washing your face to minimize a burning sensation.Antibiotic pills may be slightly more effective, but also come with more side effects.Metronidazole is an antibiotic that has been helpful in treating rosacea, in particular any papules or pustules.
Acne drugs. Many doctors may prescribe isotretinoin, a drug usually for severe cystic acne, to help clear up acne-like flare-ups of rosacea.Avoid isotretinoin if you are pregnant because it can cause birth defects.Skin irritation is a possible side effect of using acne drugs like topical retinoids.

, In some cases, such as if you experience thickening of the skin or enlarged blood vessels, it may be necessary to control your rosacea with surgery. Consider this option if conventional treatments don't control your rosacea.Get dermabrasion to remove thickened skin.Reduce the visibility of blood vessels and thickened skin or tissue buildup with laser or electrosurgery.Discuss other surgical options with your doctor such as cryosurgery, radiofrequency ablation, and skin grafting if you are not comfortable with laser or electrosurgery., Early research has shown that use of probiotics can help clear your skin of rosacea. Try either a topical cream or an oral probiotic to help manage and prevent flare-ups.Apply a probiotic cream, cleanser or mask. Any of these products can shield, calm, and protect your skin from flare-ups.Take oral probiotics, which are sold as daily supplements containing Lactobacilli and/or Bifidobacterium.You can buy probiotic products at most pharmacies and health food stores.

, There is also some evidence that yogurt may help control your rosacea.Try eating yogurt with live bacteria cultures daily, or using Greek yogurt as a mask.Make sure your yogurt has live cultures by reading the label. Only these yogurt products may help your rosacea.Put a Greek yogurt mask on your skin. There is currently no formal research on the efficacy of Greek yogurt masks, but some doctors have reported their patients having success with this home remedy.Yogurt masks have the benefit of moisturizing your skin, which may also calm and soothe your rosacea.

, Many doctors believe that keeping your skin moisturized is a key component to dealing with rosacea. Make sure you moisturize your skin even during flare-ups to help them heal and minimize your risk for further breakouts.


Use an unscented and allergy-free moisturizer during flare-ups to avoid irritating your skin.Putting moisturizer on every day helps to build a moisture barrier that protects your skin from triggers and irritants., There is also no medical evidence that supplements can control rosacea, but you may want to try one in addition to another treatment. Consider taking:


A supplement with a gamma-linolenic acid, such as evening primrose oil or black currant oil. Take 500 mg twice a day and be aware that it can take at least six weeks to see results.
Herbal supplements containing ginger or turmeric. You can also add these in their natural form to food., There is some evidence that other alternative therapies may help control rosacea flare-ups and prevent breakouts.Consider these alternative options and discuss them with your doctor before using them. You might try:


Colloidal silver

;
, Let your flat iron cool on a heat-resistant mat or hand towel for about 5 minutes after you’ve turned it off and unplugged it from the outlet. Don’t set your flat iron directly on the counter or on the edge of the sink because it could burn these surfaces.







, While your flat iron is still cooling down, hold your hand about an inch above the flat iron to determine if it has cooled off enough to touch safely. Once it feels slightly warm to the touch, lightly dampen a washcloth or paper towel with warm water. Wipe all surfaces of the iron to complete a basic cleaning.







, Beauty supply stores carry many different professional cleaning products created specifically for hairstyling tools. If you’ve used your flat iron hundreds of times and this is your first time cleaning it, you may want to use a professional cleaning solution in order to complete a more general cleaning successfully., First, make sure that the flat iron is completely cooled off and soak a couple cotton balls in rubbing alcohol. Wipe the flat iron with your cotton balls and use a q-tip to clean nooks and crannies. After doing this, lightly moisten a clean cloth with water and wipe your flat iron again., Put about ¼ cup of baking soda in a bowl. Then, squirt in hydrogen peroxide and mix the two until the mixture resembles paste. Rub the paste onto the flat iron with your fingers to remove gunky buildup of hairspray and other hair products., Using a gentle abrasive, such as a toothbrush or magic eraser, gently scrub tough spots, including the lip between the plastic and the plate.Magic erasers contain a combination of melamine, formaldehyde, sodium bisulfite, and water, which make easy removal possible., Cream relaxers are typically used to chemically straighten curly hair, but they can be used to clean your flat iron as well. In order to clean your flat iron with a relaxer, do the following:

While the flat iron is unplugged, apply an even layer of the cream to the flat iron plates.
Plug the iron in and leave it on for about 10-15 minutes.
Turn the flat iron off, let it cool completely, and then remove the relaxer with a washcloth moistened by water."

Gather your supplies.,
Dilute the castor oil with another oil.,
Consider adding a few drops of essential oil to mask the smell.,
Pour all of the oils into a small jar and shake the jar to mix everything together.,
Fill a bowl with very hot water.,
Put the jar into the water, and leave it there for two to four minutes.,
Once the oil is warm, pour it into a small bowl.,
Start with damp, but not wet hair.,
Cover your shoulders with a towel.,
Dip your fingers into the oil, and massage your scalp for three to five minutes.Do not use too much oil; a little bit goes a long way.,
Apply the oil to the rest of your hair.,
Cover your hair with a shower cap.,
Wrap a hot towel around your head and the shower cap.,
Wait 30 minutes to 3 hours before washing the oil out.,
Use this treatment once to twice a week for best results.",How to Apply Castor Oil for Hair," Applying castor oil to hair seems like it might be simple, but there are a few things you could do to make it more effective and easier to apply. Here is a list of what you will need:Castor oil
Other oil (argan, avocado, coconut, jojoba, sweet almond, etc)
Hot water
Bowl
Jar
Shower cap
Towel
Old shirt (recommended);
, Castor oil is very thick, which can make it hard to apply. Try using one part castor oil, and one part of another oil, such as: argan, avocado, coconut, jojoba, or sweet almond.All of these oils are great for hair. You can also try the following combination:3 tablespoons castor oil
1 tablespoon jojoba oil
1 tablespoon coconut oil

, Castor oil can smell bad. If this bothers you, try adding in two to three drops of a fresh-smelling essential oil, such as: rosemary, peppermint, or tea tree., Close the lid tightly, and shake the jar for a few minutes. When you are done, take the lid off.

, Make sure that the bowl is large enough to fit the jar. You will be warming the oil. This will make it more effective and easier to work with. Do not attempt to warm the oil in the microwave.

, Make sure that the water level is at the same level as the oil. Also, make sure that the no water gets inside the jar, or the oil will get wet. If the water goes with the oil , it won't cause the same effect but if you want, heat the shower to the hottest amount possible - dont worry you won't go in it , then put conditioner in your hair and just sit in the bathroom. The warmth will moisturize your hair, help split ends, promote more growth to your roots and make you hair soft and shiny. make sure to have a glass of water in case you start to feel dizzy or too hot!!!

, This will make it easier for you to dip your fingers into when you go to apply it.


Consider pouring the oil into a small bottle with an eye dropper. This way, you can use the eye dropper to just drip the oil to your scalp.

, This will help the oil absorb better into your hair. A quick way to dampen your hair is to fill a spray bottle with water, and spraying just your scalp., This will protect your clothes from getting covered in oil. It may also be a good idea to wear something you do not care about anymore, in case the oil drips past the towel.

, Use your fingers to spread the oil between your hair roots and across your scalp. Massage your head with your fingertips using small, circular motions.


You can also use an eye dropper to drip the oil onto various points on your scalp. This may be easier for you, and less messy. Be sure to massage the oil into your scalp for about five minutes.

, Scoop a little bit more oil onto your fingers, and rub it between your palms. Then, run your hands across your hair. Use your fingers to comb your hair; this helps distribute the oil. Again, start with a small amount. You do not need a lot of oil.

, Loosely pile your hair on top of your head. If you need to, you can keep it in place with a claw clip. Slip a shower cap over your hair. The shower cap will trap the heat inside, and it will keep your hair from drying out.

, Warm up a towel by soaking it with very hot water. Twist the towel to get any excess water out, then wrap it around your head. You can tuck the end of the towel in under your ""turban,"" or you can secure it with a large hair clip. The heat from the towel will make the oil more effective.

, You can also leave it on overnight, although there is little evidence that shows this is more effective. When you go to wash your hair, know that it may take a while before you get all the oil out. Some people find that washing with just conditioner, and skipping the shampoo, is more effective than using shampoo.

, Keep in mind, however, that you may not see any results the next day. Try using the castor oil treatment for four weeks before moving onto something else."

Wear flared jeans and trousers.,
Avoid bottoms that highlight your calves.,
Balance your feet with a wide belt.,
Avoid clingy skirts.,
Draw attention to your top.",How to Make Your Feet Look Smaller1," You may worry that a flared leg at the bottom of your pants adds more weight and emphasis to the bottom of your leg, and in a sense, that assessment is accurate. By draping more material over that part of your leg, though, you can actually balance out the size of your foot with the size of your leg. The excess trouser material tricks the eye into expecting “more” at the bottom of your leg, so your larger foot ends up looking proportional.


Similarly, you should avoid jeans and trousers with tapered legs. Tapered legs cling to you and train the eye to look for less at the bottom of your leg instead of more. As a result, the size of each foot gets emphasized.;
, This means skipping the cropped pants, capris, and mini skirts. When the fabric of your pants or skirts stops just above the calf, the lower leg and foot get emphasized. This emphasis generally makes your calves and feet look stockier and bigger.


Try wearing shorts and skirts that rise just above the knee. This lengthens the overall appearance of your leg. You might be tempted to think that lengthening the look of your leg also lengthens the look of your foot, but by making the leg itself appear longer, you can actually make your foot look more proportional to the rest of the leg.
Alternatively, wear floor-length skirts to mask as much of your foot altogether. This is a valid option, especially if the skirt flares out and covers your ankles, since the excess material dwarfs the size of your foot by comparison. Avoid skirts that cling to your lower leg and those that stop just above the ankle, though, since these options will only emphasize your feet more.

, A large, chunky belt can compete with your feet in regards to size. A skinny belt will cause the eye to notice the mass at the bottom of your legs, but a wide belt will add a comparable amount of mass to the top of the leg. As a result, the eye sees the overall leg, from waist to foot, in a more balanced and proportional light.


In general, skinny belts make your legs look longer while wide belts make your legs look shorter by “cutting” your torso in half visually.While you do not necessarily want to make your legs look stubby, the extra foot length usually means that you can afford to remove some of the visual length of your leg without making them look too much shorter.

, Pencil skirts and other snug-fitting styles do nothing to help balance out your legs and feet. As a result, large feet are easier to spot, especially if accompanied by thick calves.


There's no need to skip the skirt altogether, though. Try on an A-line skirt or circle skirt. These styles flare out at the knee, and the resulting effect makes the overall appearance of your legs and feet look more balanced and proportional.

, A good way to keep the attention off your feet is to draw the attention as far away as possible. Wear shirts in lighter, brighter colors and patterns. Opt for eye-catching ""upper"" accessories, like scarves, necklaces, and earrings, to draw the eye toward the top of your body.


On the flip side, wear darker colors on the bottom and skip any prints or patterns there. Accessories that draw the eye downward, like anklets, bracelets, and rings, should be avoided.

Gather your ingredients.,
Mix the alcohol and aloe vera gel in the bowl.,
Add the essential oil.,
Funnel the mixture into the container.",How to Make Hand Sanitizer1," This sanitizer closely emulates the commercial kind, without all the chemicals and without the bad smell. Hand sanitizer should not replace hand washing; just use it when you really need it. Here's what you'll need:


2/3 cup 99% rubbing alcohol (isopropyl alcohol) or vodka
1/3 cup pure aloe vera gel (preferably without additives)
8 to 10 drops essential oil, such as lavender, clove, cinnamon, or peppermint
Mixing bowl
Spoon
Funnel
Plastic container;
, Pour the ingredients into the bowl and use the spoon to mix them together well. The mixture should be completely smooth.


If you want the solution to be thicker, add another spoonful of aloe vera.
Or thin it out by adding another spoonful of alcohol.

, Add it one drop at a time, stirring as you go. After about 8 drops, smell the mixture to see whether you like the scent. If it seems strong enough, stop there. If you like a stronger scent, add a few more drops.


Lavender, clove, cinnamon and peppermint essential oils have the added benefit of providing additional antiseptic properties to the mixture.
If you don't like these scents, it's fine to use whatever scent you enjoy. Lemon, grapefruit and passion fruit all work well.

, Place the funnel over the mouth of the container and pour the hand sanitizer in. Fill it up, then screw on the lid until you're ready to use it.


A small squirt bottle works well if you want to carry the sanitizer with you throughout the day.
If you make too much for the bottle, save the leftover sanitizer in a jar with a tightly-fitted lid.

Gravitate toward shoes with dark colors.,
Dress up your shoes.While you might think that accents and embellishments draw unwanted attention to a large foot, interesting details can actually provide a focal point for the eye to fixate on, thereby distracting it from the otherwise obvious length of the foot.",How to Make Your Feet Look Smaller2," Since feet are horizontal in their natural state, the mind automatically perceives foot length as a horizontal measurement. As such, when more of the actual length is drawn up toward your leg, the perceived length becomes shorter.


The type of heel you choose can also make a difference. Typically, chunky heels and wedges are better choices than stiletto heels. The idea is that a thicker heel balances your foot out better, while a thin heel can look overwhelmed on a large shoe and may accent the size of foot., Skimpy sandals that expose too much of your foot will make anyone's foot look bigger. You want to wear more stylish flats that expose less of your feet so they don't look so front and center.


Keep the ankle uncovered when you do wear flats. When you do look for flats, opt for low-rise options that do not extend up too close to the ankle. Wearing shoes with straps around the ankles actually makes your feet appear larger than they really are.
However, wearing flat sandals in addition to heels is important. If you care about the health of your feet, you will need to switch back and forth between heels and flats with adequate arch support.

, That extra space only adds more length to your foot, making your foot look larger as a result. Skip the pointed toes and go for a shoe with a more natural rounded toe to minimize excess length.


As a general rule, try to choose shoes that are cut close to your foot all the way around. This includes the toe area and the ankle area, as well as the sole. Avoid shoes that have a heavy, extended sole around the edges since this can make your feet look heavier and clunkier., If you have large feet, you may worry that heavy footwear like boots can add perceived weight to the foot. The right boot will actually mask some of your foot size by covering it in flattering ways and balancing the overall appearance of your leg.


Acquaint yourself with the ankle boot. More specifically, invest in a pair of heeled ankle boots. The heel elevates your foot and reduces its perceived horizontal length, while the boot covers up more of your foot, masking its size underneath the material.
Experiment with bulky boots. The usefulness of bulky boots is debatable among fashion experts. There are two opposing schools of thought: some believe that having a visibly large amount of excess material makes the foot look smaller by comparison, while others claim that any excess bulk around the foot will make that foot appear larger, even if that bulkiness looks notably loose. Try this style on and see the results for yourself.

, Peep toes and similar styles should be avoided. When the tips of your toes peek out of your shoes, it can give the visual impression that your foot is trying to squeeze out of shoes that are too small, thereby making your foot look larger. Avoid flats or boots with peep toes if you want your feet to look smaller.

, When you decide to wear sandals, look for options that have wider straps. Pass over shoes with thin straps and head for those that have a few notably thick ones. Exposing too much of your foot can highlight its large size, so hiding more of the foot under large straps can help minimize its appearance.


If you do prefer the look of thinner straps, choose styles that have many small straps over those that only have a couple. Multiple thin straps can still cover more of your bare foot and mask its size.
When wearing any sandals, make sure that your foot fits into the shoe comfortably and does not threaten to ""squeeze"" out through the straps. If skin pushes its way out of the straps, it can make your foot look as though it is bursting out of the shoe due to its size.

, Black, dark brown, and navy blue shoes are especially great options, but anything darker than your skin tone will work well enough. Dark colors look slimming on your body, and they have the same effect on your feet.


Nude shoes or shoes that are lighter than your skin tone can blend in to your leg. As a result, the shoe looks like an extension of the leg and an extension of the foot. This highlights the length of the foot and may even make it look longer than it already is.

,


Stick with single detail accents rather than all-over detail. For instance, a large bow or flower would work much better than a floral pattern.
Wearing boots with buckles on them can also make your feet look more petite.
You can test this look out by clipping a decorative shoe clip or hair clip onto the toe area of a plain pair of heels. If you decide that you don't like the way it looks on your foot, simply remove the clip and wear the shoes plain.

Gather your ingredients.,
Stir together the aloe vera gel, tea tree oil and witch hazel.,
Stir in the essential oil.,
Funnel the mixture into the container.",How to Make Hand Sanitizer2," Some people prefer not to use alcohol in their hand sanitizer, since alcohol has a strong smell and can have a severe drying effect on skin. Using a witch-hazel based sanitizer is a great alternative.Tea tree oil provides additional antiseptic benefits. Here's what you'll need:


1 cup pure aloe vera gel (preferably without additives)
1 1/2 teaspoons witch hazel
30 drops tea tree oil
5 drops essential oil, such as lavender or peppermint
Mixing bowl
Spoon
Funnel
Plastic container

, If the mixture seems too thin, add another spoonful of aloe vera to thicken it. If it's too thick, add another spoonful of witch hazel.

, Since the smell of the tea tree oil is already strong, go easy on the added essential oils. Five or so drops should be enough, but if you want to add more, stir it in one drop at a time.

, Place the funnel over the mouth of the container and pour the hand sanitizer in. Fill it up, then screw on the lid until you're ready to use it.A small squirt bottle works well if you want to carry the sanitizer with you throughout the day.
If you make too much for the bottle, save the leftover sanitizer in a jar with a tightly-fitted lid.

Assess your grip.,
Loosen your grip.,
Write lighter lines.,
Change your grip entirely.",How to Prevent a Writer's Bump Callus1," Grab the type of utensil that you normally use for writing, then get some paper. Write a few sentences, focusing on the way that the pen/pencil feels in your hand. Think about how much pressure that you’re putting on your finger and the callus itself. Then, look at the fingers that you use to hold and stabilize the pencil, noting where your callus and the pencil meet., If you feel that your grip is overly tight, or if pressure from the pencil causes pain in your fingers, loosen up your grasp on the pencil. Practice writing with a more relaxed grip, then observe over a week or so whether the callus gets any smaller. Loosening your grip will take active effort: make sure to keep your goal in mind when you write, or you may fall back into your old habits., Sometimes, calluses aren’t caused by a bad grip: they’re caused by a writer pushing the pencil too hard into the paper. If you find that you exert a lot of downward force when you write, try lightening up the pressure. Practice writing in a lighter, softer script.


One way to tell you're pressing too hard is to see if you make indentations on the paper. Flip the paper over and see if you can feel the marks you made on the other side.
Another way to tell is if you break your pencil lead fairly often. Everyone breaks a lead sometimes, but if you're doing it several times a day, you may be pressing too hard.
Also, just see what happens if you don't press as hard. If your writing is still dark, you were likely pressing too hard.

, There are many ways to hold a pencil. Most people who suffer from writer’s calluses find that they build up on their middle fingers at the knuckle right below the nail, because they hold their pencils in a “tripod pencil grasp” with the middle finger supporting the pencil. While this is the most common grip, you can try other grip styles: try resting your pencil on your ring finger, or hold the pencil between your thumb and first two fingertips."

Let them go barefoot.,
Choose the right socks.,
Find the right shoes.,
Make sure the shoe fits.,
Maintain good hygiene.,
Cut toe nails straight across, never rounded.,
Emphasize good walking habits.,
Keep your child's diet nutritious.",How to Look After Your Child's Feet1," Although there’s some debate, most doctors agree that being barefoot is great for foot development. Shoes can look great and provide warmth for a non-walking child. However, once your kid is mobile, ditching the shoes is best. This allows your kid’s foot to develop naturally and build strength in growing tendons without relying on the support of shoes. It’s great to let your kid run around barefoot, but make sure to keep an eye on the terrain. Walking on the grass may be fine, but be on the lookout for sharp objects that could hurt your unsuspecting explorer.;
, Your child’s feet may get cold so socks are important, whether they’re sleeping or on the move. With your kid’s feet constantly growing, you’ll want to choose a sock that fits properly without being constricting.


When fitting socks, it’s a good idea to always make sure they’re at least ¼ inch longer than the big toe.

, Although barefoot is best, your kid will need shoes eventually. Many doctors say shoes aren’t necessary until your kid is walking outside. There are so many stylish options for kid’s shoes but comfort and health should be your top priority.


Avoid overly stiff shoes. You may think they’re more protective, but developing muscles in your child's feet need to grow and develop on their own. An overly sturdy shoe may also do the work that your child’s developing muscles should be doing, hindering their development. Choose comfort over fashion. It may be tempting to choose a pair of stylish shoes for your new walker, but always choose proper support and fit over good looks. For an early walker, shoes with leather bottoms may be best for traction’s sake, whereas those entering into a walking/running phase may want something a little more athletic.

, Kids feet are always growing — sometimes as much as much as a half size every two months. You may want to buy big shoes to anticipate that next growth spurt, but shoes that are too big greatly increase the chance of stumbles and falls.


Stay proactive to prevent overly tight shoes. You may think your kid will tell you if their shoes are too tight, or feet hurt, but this often isn’t the case. Check the fit regularly so you're ready to get them in the next size up when the time comes.

, Although tasks like bath time can be difficult, it is important to maintain good hygiene.


Bathe your kid’s feet at least 2-3 times a week. This can help prevent common fungal infections like athlete’s foot and also teach your child good habits with which to grow. Dry them well to prevent any trapped moisture.

, This helps prevent in-grown toenails. , Once your kid is mobile, you can help reduce development problems by showing them to walk right. Teach them to walk with their feet and toes straight to help avoid issues. , Just like any other part of your kid’s body, proper foot development requires proper diet and nutrition. Calcium, Vitamin D, readily available in dairy foods, and good overall nutrition can go a long way to reducing the likelihood of development problems. A healthy diet, proper nutrition and exercise can help to ensure feet stay healthy.

Buy a waxing kit.,
Prep your skin.,
Reserve time to wax your legs.,
Prepare mentally.",How to Wax Your Legs1," You can find waxing kits on Amazon for anywhere between $10-$20. Compare kits and decide which one you want to buy. Generally they are all pretty similar but some offer more strips and some are advertised for men or women. Some beauty sites recommend using the Nair Moroccan Argan Oil Wax for Legs and Body.;
, It is important to exfoliate before you wax in order to achieve the best results. Also make sure your hair isn’t too long or too short. You want your hair to be at least a quarter of an inch long but no longer than half an inch. If your hair is longer than half an inch you should trim it with scissors first, then use the wax.









Consonant Skin Body Scrub is a great product that can help with exfoliation. Lather it on everywhere you plan to shave at least 24 hours before. Leave it on for a few minutes and then gently clean it off with soap and water.

, This will take about an hour, maybe two. Don’t try to wax your legs in the ten minutes before you head out the door for work or class.

, The waxing process might be a little painful, so try to recognize that as you make the decision to wax your legs. It's not excruciating but you you should prepare yourself to feel some mild discomfort. As long as you're okay with that you should be good to go.

Use a pencil grip.,
Try new pencils or pens.,
Use smoother paper.",How to Prevent a Writer's Bump Callus2," Pencil grips are often used to help young children develop good writing habits, but they can also cushion your grip. Look for soft, foam or rubber grips. Try shopping for grips at a school or office supply store, where you’ll be able to try them out. Also, if you use mechanical pencils or ballpoint pens, consider switching to a brand with a built-in soft grip., If you find that you press the pencil too hard into the paper, look for a writing utensil that creates smoother lines. With a smoother writing utensil, you won’t have to apply as much pressure to make dark, legible lines. Less friction may help reduce the size of your callus.


Try out different pencils. While most pencils come with standard #2 lead, some write smooth lines better than others. Shop around and try out different brands of wood-case pencils or mechanical pencils to see which leads you prefer. If none improve the pressure you need to apply, consider buying artist pencils with even softer lead than a #2: just remember you won’t be able to use them on standardized tests.Switch from pencils to pens. The choice between pencils and pens comes down to preference and the requirements of your school or office. However, pens often write with smoother, more legible lines, so you’ll be able to lighten up your grip.
Buy gel pens. While brightly colored gel pens may be frowned upon at school, black or navy blue gel pens may help heal your callus. Gel pens come in a variety of types, and many art stores will let you test out pens before you buy. Try some out and pick one that improves your grip the most., Different brands of notebooks use different kinds of paper, and they all have different textures. Some papers are soft and slick, while others are coarse and create a lot of friction. The more friction between your pen/pencil and the paper, the more pressure you use to hold your pencil, and the bigger your callus gets. Look at different types of notebooks at an office or hobby store, then choose one with slick, smooth paper."

Type instead of write.,
Write on a hard surface.,
Record lectures or classes.,
Write less, and remember more.",How to Prevent a Writer's Bump Callus3," If you’re able to, substitute a laptop for a pen and paper. Typing can be much faster and easier than writing, and you’ll be able to give your callus a break. If you’re in school and laptops aren’t allowed, try only to write in class when you really need you, then type all of your homework., Writing on a hard surface can make your marks darker with less effort. In turn, that means you can loosen your grip. You can also use a clipboard or other hard, flat surface to go under pages in a notebook., If endless note-taking is causing your writer’s callus, take less notes. Use a laptop, smart-phone or digital recorder to capture the audio from a lecture, then replay it later instead of having to reread notes. Calluses go away on their own after a few weeks of rest, so you should see a huge change after a semester of recording lectures.

, Just like typing and recording, developing your mental recall will prevent you from having to write as much. Improve your memory by playing brain-exercise games, creating mnemonic devices (where words stand for the first letters of information you want to remember), getting more sleep, or just practice paying more attention. With a little practice and effort, you’ll be able to save your fingers some stress."

Watch your child walk.,
Look for ingrown toenails.,
Check their feet for warts.,
Watch out for flat feet.,
Look for bowlegs.",How to Look After Your Child's Feet2," No two kid’s feet are the same and walking differently does not necessarily mean there’s a development problem. But keep your eyes open for any abnormal gaits or walking styles.Common problems include intoeing, outtoeing or clubfoot. These problems usually correct themselves but if you have a concern, make sure to consult your doctor during your next check-up.Common acute injuries in children and adolescents consist of friction blisters, wounds to the sole of the foot, and stubbed toes.

, Making sure you trim your child’s toenails properly can help their toenails stay healthy. Always be sure to cut the nail straight across and not rounded.


Cutting improperly can cause ingrown toenails. An ingrown toenail occurs when one or both sides of your child’s nail begins to break through and grow into the skin of the toe. If you notice an ingrown toenail, never try to fix it yourself. Call your doctor and make an appointment. Never cut into the toenail too far. This can lead to an ingrown toenail as well. Sometimes ingrown toenails are so painful/tender that they bleed and become infected. If this is the case, you need to take your child to see a Podiatrist. He/She will cut the nail out including part of the nail bed, this will allow for the nail to grow back in naturally and comfortably.

, Warts are viral, contagious callous looking bumps and can be painful. They can be relatively common in kids and most often appear on the bottom of their feet. There are many at-home treatments for warts, but if they’re on your kid’s feet, it would be best to let a doctor have a look to prevent their spread or pain.
Topical salicylic acid and cryotherapy with liquid nitrogen are the most common treatments for plantar warts. Cryotherapy involves the use of liquid nitrogen. The doctor will apply nitrogen to the wart to freeze if off. Sometimes the doctor has to cut wart first so that the nitrogen penetrates the root of the wart. Often if warts are involved you may need to get multiple applications of cryotherapy.

, If the arch of your child’s foot shrinks or disappears when they stand, they could suffer from “pediatric flatfoot.” Many children have flat feet and grow out of it. But if you child’s flat arch is accompanied by pain and tenderness it could be an issue worth visiting the doctor for. , This is an exaggerated outward bend of a kid’s legs when their feet are placed together. This can be caused by improper foot development and is worth nothing to your doctor if noticed. "
